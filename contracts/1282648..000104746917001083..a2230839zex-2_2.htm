 **ARTICLE 5**

 



 

 **5.** **SELLER S REPRESENTATIONS**

 



 

Seller represents to Buyer, as of the date hereof and as of the Closing Date,
as follows:

 



 

5.1 _Existence_ \- Seller is a limited liability company duly organized and
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Texas,
and is duly qualified to carry on its business as presently conducted and to
own and operate oil and gas properties in each jurisdiction in which the
Assets are located.

 



 

5.2 _Authority_ \- Seller has all requisite power and authority to carry on
its business as presently conducted, to enter into this Agreement and the
Conveyances and to perform its

 



      
 

 



 

obligations under this Agreement. This Agreement is, and the Conveyances and
other agreements, documents or instruments to be delivered at Closing, when
executed and delivered by Seller will be, the valid and binding obligation of
Seller, enforceable against Seller in accordance with their respective terms,
subject to the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium,
and similar laws, as well as to principles of equity (regardless of whether
such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law). There
are no bankruptcy, reorganization, or receivership proceedings pending, being
contemplated by or, to Sellers Knowledge, threatened in writing against
Seller.

 



 

5.3 _Violations_ \- To Sellers Knowledge, Seller has not materially violated
and none of the Assets are in material violation of any laws, statutes,
regulations or orders applicable to such Assets.

 



 

5.4 _Compliance_ \- Seller has materially complied (and all of the Assets, as
owned and operated, are in material compliance) with all applicable laws,
rules, regulations, ordinances and orders of all local, tribal, state and
federal governmental bodies, authorities and agencies having jurisdiction.

 



 

5.5 _Payment of Royalties_ \- To Sellers Knowledge, all royalties, in-lieu
royalties, production payments, net profits interests, and other burdens

attributable to the period prior to Closing, have been properly and fully
paid, escheated, or are included within the suspense amounts being conveyed to

agreement or provisions requiring a partnership income tax return to be filed
under Subchapter K of Chapter 1 of Subtitle A of the Code, or any similar
state statute and no transfer of any part of the Assets will be treated as a
transfer of an interest in a partnership for Tax purposes. All of the Assets
have been properly listed and described on the property Tax rolls for all
periods prior to and including the date of Closing and no portion of the
Assets constitute omitted property for property Tax purposes.

being contested in good faith and described in _Schedule 5.8_.

5.14_ , to Sellers Knowledge, there are no outstanding authorizations for
expenditures in excess of One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000), net to
Sellers interest, or other written commitments or proposals to conduct
operations on the Assets.

 



 

5.15 _Brokers_. Seller has incurred no liability, contingent or otherwise, for
brokers or finders fees in respect of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby for which Buyer shall have any responsibility whatsoever.

 



 

5.16 _Consents_. To Sellers Knowledge, all Leases, Easements, Surface
Agreements, and Material Contracts which contain a Consent provision are
listed on _Schedule 5.16_.

 



 

5.17 _Preferential Purchase Rights; AMIs; MFNs_. To Sellers Knowledge, all
(i) Leases, Easements, Surface Agreements, and Material Contracts which
contain Preferential Purchase Rights, (ii) Leases or Contracts which create
any area of mutual interest that any of the Interests are subject, and (iii)
Leases which contain any most favored nations provisions are, in each case,
listed on _Schedule 5.17_. There are no outstanding or deferred bonuses
remaining, or upon the satisfaction of a condition, could become outstanding,
or

 



      
 

 



 

other acquisition costs, relating to any of the Leases or other Assets
(excluding any extension payments).

 



 

5.18 _Surety Bonds_. All surety bonds held by Seller related to its ownership
or operation of the Assets are listed on _Schedule 5.18_.

 



 

5.19 _Current Plugging Obligations_. To Sellers Knowledge, as of the

or contract to be plugged and abandoned because such Well is not currently
capable of producing in commercial quantities.

 



 

5.20 _Payout_. _Exhibit "B"_ identifies the Wells subject to a reversion or
other adjustment at some level of cost recovery or payout (or passage of time
or other event other than a termination of a Lease by its terms).

 



 

5.21 _Suspended Amounts. Schedule 5.21_ lists all funds held in suspense
(including funds held in suspense for unleased interests) by Seller as of the
date of this Agreement that are attributable to the Interests.

Agreement is in full force and effect and, to the Knowledge of Seller, has not
been breached by any TRO-X Group members or Oxy, or previously by ExL,
including, without limitation, with regard to the Tag Along Rights and the
preferential right to purchase provisions under the Screaming Eagle Agreement.
Subject to additional revenues or expenses not yet received or booked, and to
adjustments made in the normal course of business, Seller believes that
_Schedule 5.22_ sets forth a true and accurate calculation of the Project
Payout balance as of the Effective Time.

 



 

5.23 _Leases and Interests; Pooling_. The terms of the Leases, Mineral Rights
or other Interests do NOT contain any remaining commitments or obligations of
Seller to drill any wells.

"AS IS AND WHERE IS." BUYER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT, EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE
SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT AND IN THE CONVEYANCES, SELLER HAS MADE NO
REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WRITTEN OR
ORAL, AS TO THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF THE BACKGROUND MATERIALS OR ANY
OTHER INFORMATION RELATING TO THE ASSETS FURNISHED BY OR ON BEHALF OF SELLER
OR TO BE FURNISHED TO BUYER OR ITS**

 



      
 

 



 

 **REPRESENTATIVES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY INTERNAL APPRAISALS
AND/OR INTERPRETIVE DATA OF SELLER.** Buyer acknowledges and affirms that it
has relied and will rely solely upon Sellers representations, warranties and
covenants in this Agreement and on its independent analysis, evaluation and
investigation of, and judgment with respect to, the business, economic, legal,
Tax or other consequences of this transaction, including its own estimate and
appraisal of the extent and value of the petroleum, natural gas and other
reserves associated with the Assets.

 



 

6.2 _Knowledge and Experience_ \- Buyer (i) is engaged in the business of
exploring for and/or producing oil and gas or other valuable minerals as an
ongoing business and (ii) is purchasing the Assets for its own account for
investment purposes and not with the intent to resell the Assets in violation
of any federal or state securities laws. Buyer is an experienced and
knowledgeable investor in oil and gas properties, has the financial and
business expertise to evaluate the merits and risks of the transactions
covered by this Agreement and has relied solely on the basis of its own
independent investigation of the Assets for all purposes. In acquiring the
Assets, Buyer is acting in the conduct of its own business and not under any
specific contractual commitment to any third party, or any specific nominee
agreement with any third party, to transfer to, or to hold title on behalf of,
such third party, with respect to all or any part of the Assets. Buyer
acknowledges that it has had the opportunity to seek the advice of persons it
deemed appropriate concerning the consequences of the provisions of this
Agreement and hereby waives any and all rights to claim that it is an
unsophisticated investor in oil and gas properties.

 



 

6.3 _No Warranty_ \- Buyer acknowledges that, except as otherwise set forth in
this Agreement and in the Conveyances, Seller has not made any representation,
covenant or warranty, express or implied, at common law, by statute or
otherwise, relating to the condition of the Assets, including, without
limitation, any implied or express warranty of merchantability, of fitness for
any particular purpose, or of conforming to models or samples of materials as
to any personal property, fixtures or structures conveyed pursuant to this
Agreement.

 



 

6.4 _Formation, Good Standing and Authority_ \- Buyer is a corporation duly
formed, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the state of
Delaware and is, or will be prior to Closing, duly qualified and in good
standing in the State of Texas. Buyer has all requisite power and authority to

under this Agreement. This Agreement is, and the Conveyances when executed and
delivered by Buyer will be, the valid and binding obligation of Buyer,
enforceable against Buyer in accordance with their respective terms, subject
to the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, and
similar laws, as well as to principles of equity (regardless of whether such
enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law). There are
no bankruptcy, reorganization, or receivership proceedings pending, being
contemplated by or, to Buyers Knowledge, threatened in writing against Buyer.

 



 

6.5 _Liability for Broker s Fees_ \- Buyer has not incurred any liability,
contingent or otherwise, for brokers or finders fees relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement for which Seller shall have any
responsibility whatsoever.

to pay the Base Purchase Price and any other amounts contemplated by this
Agreement. Buyers ability

ability to secure financing or to complete any public or private placement of
securities prior to or upon Closing.

 



 

6.7 _Qualification to Assume Operatorship_ \- Buyer is qualified to do
business in and to own and, assume operatorship of oil, gas and mineral
leases, including the Leases and Wells, in all jurisdictions where the Assets

operator. To the extent required by the applicable state and federal
governmental bodies or agencies, Buyer currently has, and will continue to
maintain, lease bonds, area wide bonds, or any other surety bonds as may be
required by, and in accordance with, such state or federal regulations
governing the post-Closing ownership and operation of such Leases.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 7**

 



 

 **7.** **TITLE**

 



 

7.1 _Title Defects_ \- Buyer shall notify Seller in writing of any Title
Defect in the Wells or Blocks after discovering the Title Defect but in any
event on or before seven (7) Business Days prior to Closing (the period
between the Execution Date and such notice date is the " _Due Diligence
Period_ "). For the purpose of this Agreement, a " _Title Defect_ " shall mean
a material deficiency which individually per property exceeds Thirty-Five
Thousand Dollars ($35,000) in one (or more) of the following respects (other
than Permitted Encumbrances), provided, however, that the above $35,000
threshold for individual Title Defects shall not be applicable with regard to
(i) matters or claims that Buyer may have the right to assert under the
special warranty of title in the Conveyances or (ii) a breach of any of
Sellers representations and warranties under this Agreement, and Buyers
right to indemnification therefor. For purposes of this Article 7, Sellers
title shall be deemed to include the title of the TAR Sellers:

 



 

7.1.1 _Adverse Claims_ \- Sellers title as to all or part of a Well or Block
or other Asset is subject to (i) an outstanding mortgage which is not released
on or before Closing; (ii) a deed of trust which is not released on or before
Closing; (iii) a lien or encumbrance which is not released on or before
Closing; or (iv) a pending claim or cause of action in which a competing
ownership interest in a Well or Block or other Asset is claimed or implied.

 



 

7.1.2 _Decreased Net Revenue Interest_ \- Seller owns less than the Net
Revenue Interest shown for Seller on _Exhibit "E_" for a particular Well for
the productive life of the Well as to all depths from the surface to the
lowest productive depth therein or for a particular Block as to all depths
from the surface to the base of the Wolfcamp Formation (except as provided
otherwise on _Exhibit "E"_).

 



 

7.1.3 _Increased Working Interest_ \- Seller owns more than the Working
Interest shown for Seller on _Exhibit "E_," without a proportionate increase
in the corresponding Net Revenue Interest shown for Seller on _Exhibit "E,_"
for a particular Well for the productive life of the Well as to all depths
from the surface to the lowest productive depth therein or for a particular
Block as to all depths from the surface to the base of the Wolfcamp Formation
(except as provided otherwise on _Exhibit "E"_).

 



      
 

 



 

7.1.4 _Reversions_  Sellers title to a Well or Block is subject to reduction
by the exercise by a third-party of a reversionary, back-in, or other similar
right except for any reversionary interest reflected in _Exhibit "E_" held by
the TAR Owners.

 



 

7.2 _Additional Interests_ \- During the Due Diligence Period, Buyer shall
notify Seller in writing if Buyer determines that Seller has a lesser Working
Interest (without a corresponding proportionate decrease in Net Revenue
Interest) or a greater Net Revenue Interest with respect to all or any part of
a Well or Block than that set forth for Seller on _Exhibit "E_." During the
Due Diligence Period and for two (2) Business Days thereafter, Seller may
notify Buyer in writing of any increase in Net Revenue Interest or decrease in
Working Interest of a Well or Block (without a corresponding proportionate
decrease in Net Revenue Interest) (" _Additional Interest_ "). If Buyer and
Seller agree upon the existence of any Additional Interest, such Additional
Interest shall only be permitted to offset and reduce the aggregate amount of
all Title Defects, if any.

 



 

7.3 _Notices_ \- Any Title Defect notice by Buyer pursuant to Section 7.1 or
Additional Interest notice by Seller pursuant to Section 7.2 shall include
appropriate documentation to substantiate the applicable position and the
estimated value of the Title Defect or Additional Interest. If any such notice
is not timely delivered, the claimant shall thereafter have no right to assert
such Title Defect or Additional Interest as the basis for an adjustment to the
Base Purchase Price; _provided_ , _however_ , that this waiver shall not apply
with regard to any matters or claims that Buyer may have the right to assert
under the special warranty of title in the Conveyances, nor shall this waiver
apply with regard to a breach of any of Sellers representations and
warranties under this Agreement, and Buyers right to indemnification
therefor.

 



 

7.4 _Adjustments to Base Purchase Price_ \- Upon timely delivery of a notice
under this ARTICLE 7 pursuant to Section 7.1 or 7.2, either by Buyer or by
Seller, Buyer and Seller shall meet and use their reasonable commercial
efforts to agree on the validity of any claims for Title Defects or Additional
Interests and the amount of any Base Purchase Price adjustment using the
following criteria:

 



 

(a) _Liquidated Charges_ \- If the adjustment is based upon a lien,
encumbrance, or other charge upon an Asset which is liquidated in amount or
which can be estimated with reasonable certainty, then the adjustment shall be
the sum necessary to be paid to the obligee to remove the encumbrance from the
affected Asset.

 



 

(b) _Ownership Variance_ \- If the adjustment is based upon Seller owning a
lesser or greater Net Revenue Interest and proportionate Working Interest than
that shown on _Exhibit "E_," then the adjustment shall be proportionate to
the amount allocated to the affected Asset on _Exhibit "E_."

 



 

(c) _Valuation of Title Defects_ \- If the adjustment is for an item other
than as set forth in (a) or (b) above, Buyer and Seller shall endeavor to
mutually agree on the amount of the Base Purchase Price adjustment. If the
parties cannot agree to the existence of a Title Defect or Additional
Interests or the applicable adjustment, the matter shall be resolved in
accordance with the dispute resolution provisions in Section 20.3. Any such
item shall be referred to as an " _Open Defect_." Notwithstanding any of the
preceding provisions of this ARTICLE 7, all adjustments applicable to Title
Defects or Additional Interests (other than with

 



      
 

 



 

regard to (i) matters or claims that Buyer may have the right to assert under
the special warranty of title in the Conveyances or (ii) a breach of any of
Sellers representations and warranties under this Agreement, and Buyers
right to indemnification therefor) shall be made prior to Closing which
Closing shall be extended until resolution of any disputes relating to the
Title Defects or Additional Interests (subject to Section 19.1(c)); _provided_
, _however_ , that if adjustments for alleged Title Defects, Environmental
Defects, Casualty Defects, Open Defects and contested Environmental Defects do
not, in the aggregate, exceed 10% of the Base Purchase Price, then Closing
shall occur as to the other Assets that are not subject to the dispute (with
the portion of the Assets subject to the dispute being excluded, and the Base
Purchase Price reduced for the entire Allocated Values thereof) and Closing
shall subsequently occur with respect to the Assets made the subject of the
dispute within thirty (30) days following the final resolution of the dispute,
and such Closing shall not waive or release any claims of Buyer that are the
subject of the dispute.

 



 

(d) If a Title Defect is not in effect, or does not adversely affect a Well or
Block, throughout the entire life of such Well or Interest in such Block, such
fact shall be taken into account in determining the value of the Title Defect.
The value of each Title Defect shall also be determined without duplication of
any costs or losses included in determining the value of such Title Defect or
the value of any other Title Defect. In no event shall the value of a Title
Defect exceed the Allocated Value of the applicable Well or Block affected
thereby. In addition to the criteria expressly described in this Section 7.4,
the parties shall consider any other factors as are reasonably necessary to
make a proper evaluation.

 



 

For all Title Defects, subject to the provisions of Section 7.5, Seller shall
elect to either (i) sell to Buyer the entire Asset(s) affected by the Title
Defect but reduce the Base Purchase Price by the portion of the Allocated
Value set forth for Seller on _Exhibit "E_" attributable to such affected
Assets or (ii) exclude from Closing the Assets affected by such Title Defect
and reduce the Base Purchase Price for the entire Allocated Value of those
Assets so excluded. If Seller cures any Title Defect within the 120 calendar
days following Closing then the Parties shall have a secondary Closing in
which (i) Buyer shall pay to Seller the Base Purchase Price reduction
associated with each such cured Title Defect and/or (ii) Buyer shall pay to
Seller the entire Allocated Value of the excluded Assets for which all Title
Defects have been cured (or a reduced portion thereof, as appropriate, due to
any remaining Title Defect(s) associated with the applicable Asset for which
other Title Defect(s) have been cured) and receive from Seller a Conveyance of
the applicable Assets for which Title Defect(s) have been cured; provided,
however, that the amount to be paid at such secondary Closing shall be subject
to adjustment in the manner described in Section 3.3, and any disputes
regarding the cure of a Title Defect or the applicable adjustment therefor
shall be resolved in accordance with the dispute resolution provisions in
Section 20.3. For purposes of clarity, any Additional Interests shall only be
permitted to offset and reduce the aggregate amount of all Title Defects and
Environmental Defects, if any.

 



 

7.5 _Deductible for Title and Environmental Defects_ \- Notwithstanding the
provisions set forth above, a Title Defect or Environmental Defect shall not
result in an adjustment to the Base Purchase Price unless the aggregate net
value of the sum of (a) all Title Defects with respect to the Assets and (b)
all Environmental Defects agreed to by the parties is greater than one and
one-half percent (1.5%) of the Base Purchase Price (the " _Deductible_

 



     

 



 

 _Amount_ "); provided, however, that this Deductible Amount shall NOT be
applicable with regard to (i) matters or claims that Buyer may have the right
to assert under the special warranty of title in the Conveyances or (ii) a
breach of any of Sellers representations and warranties under this Agreement,
and Buyers right to indemnification therefor. In such event, the Base
Purchase Price on the Closing shall be adjusted by the aggregate net value of
the sum of (a) all Title Defects and (b) all Environmental Defects which
collectively exceed the Deductible Amount.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 8**

 



 

 **8.** **ENVIRONMENTAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL INDEMNITY**

 



 

8.1 _Acceptance of Environmental Condition_ \- Buyer may give Seller notice
(an " _Environmental Notice_ ") of any fact or circumstance that indicates a
violation of a currently existing Environmental Law associated with an Asset
or existence of some issue which would otherwise require remedial or
corrective action under any Environmental Law (" _Environmental Defect_ ").
For the purpose of this Agreement, an Environmental Defect shall mean a
material deficiency which individually exceeds Thirty-Five Thousand Dollars
($35,000) and complies with all of the following conditions precedent but
shall exclude the mere fact that a well needs to be plugged or that a wellsite
or operating location needs to be reclaimed upon cessation of operations
thereon or expiration of the applicable leases, easements, or agreements
therefor:

 



 

(a) The Environmental Notice must be received by Seller as soon as reasonably
practical after discovery of the Environmental Defect by Buyer, but in any
event on or before seven (7) Business Days prior to the Closing Date;

 



 

(b) The Environmental Notice must be based on credible and probative evidence
substantiated in good faith by Buyers environmental experts (which may
include internal employees or personnel of Buyer, its affiliates or third
parties) that shows it is more likely than not that there exists an
Environmental Defect;

 



 

(c) The evidence referred to in Section 8.1(b) must be fully described,
substantiated in good faith by Buyers environmental experts, and in the case
of documentary evidence, enclosed;

 



 

(d) The Environmental Notice must reasonably describe the remediation and/or
restoration (" _Cleanup_ ") required to remedy the Environmental Defect, or
the potential damages claimed or likely to be claimed by a third party, each
as recommended or estimated in good faith by Buyers environmental experts;
and

 



 

(e) To the extent practicable, the Environmental Notice must state Buyers
good faith estimate of the amount of potential Loss to be incurred by Buyer as
a result of the Environmental Defect. For purposes of this Agreement, the term
" _Loss_ " shall include any estimated Cleanup, costs, losses, expenses,
liabilities (including civil and administrative fines and penalties), damages,
demands, suits, sanctions, reasonable fees and expenses of attorneys,
technical experts and expert witnesses.

 



 

If Buyer does not provide Seller with an Environmental Notice within the
period set forth above, then at Closing, Buyer shall be deemed to have
accepted such Asset and to have waived Buyers right to assert an
Environmental Defect with respect to the Assets, except with regard to a
breach

 



      
 

 



 

of any of Sellers representations and warranties under this Agreement, and
Buyers right to indemnification therefor.

 



 

8.2 _Remedy for Environmental Defects_ \- If Buyer gives a valid Environmental
Notice in accordance with Section 8.1, Seller may provide for one of the
remedies in Section 8.2(a) with respect to the Environmental Defect that is
subject to such Environmental Notice, but each such remedy, and the aggregate
of all remedies, shall be limited in accordance with Section 7.5.

 



 

(a) _Remedy_. If Buyer delivers a valid Environmental Notice to Seller,
Seller, at its election, shall have the option of (i) remediating the
Environmental Defect and resolving all Losses arising from such Environmental
Defect to the reasonable satisfaction of Buyer and, if applicable, the
appropriate state and federal agencies having jurisdiction, (ii) contesting
the existence of an Environmental Defect or Buyers estimate of the amount of
all Losses associated with the Environmental Defect pursuant to Section
8.2(c), (iii) paying Buyers good faith estimate of the amount of all Losses
associated with the Environmental Defect in the form of a reduction to the
Base Purchase Price (an " _Environmental Adjustment_ "), or (iv) excluding the
Asset pursuant to Section 8.2(b). If Seller elects to remediate the
Environmental Defect but fails to remediate the Environmental Defect and
resolve all Losses arising from such Environmental Defect to the reasonable
satisfaction of Buyer and, if applicable, the appropriate state and federal
agencies having jurisdiction within one hundred twenty (120) days following
Closing then Seller shall pay Buyers good faith estimate of the amount of all
Losses associated with said Environmental Defect. If there is disagreement as
to such amount, the dispute shall be resolved in accordance with the dispute
resolution provisions set forth in Section 20.3.

 



 

(b) _Exclusion of Affected Asset_. If an Environmental Defect exceeds the
Allocated Value of the Asset which is the subject of a valid Environmental
Notice, then at Sellers option, an exclusion adjustment may be made in an
amount equal to the Allocated Value of such Asset. In such event Seller shall
retain the Asset and the Base Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Allocated
Value of such Asset.

 



 

(c) _Contested Environmental Defects_. If Seller contests the existence of any
Environmental Defect or Buyers estimate of the Loss associated with such
Environmental Defect, Seller shall notify Buyer within five (5) Business Days
after Sellers receipt of the Environmental Notice. The notice shall state the
basis for Sellers contest of the Environmental Defect or the estimate of the
Cleanup cost. Within two (2) Business Days after Buyers receipt of the
notice, representatives of Seller and Buyer, knowledgeable in environmental
matters, shall meet, and, prior to Closing, either (i) agree to reject the
Environmental Defect, in which case Buyer shall waive the Environmental
Defect, or (ii) agree on the validity of the Environmental Defect and the
estimated Loss, in which case Seller shall have the options described in
Section 8.2(a) (except the right to contest) and Section 8.2(b) (Exclusion of
Affected Asset). If Seller and Buyer cannot agree on either option (i) or (ii)
in the preceding sentence, the Environmental Defect or the estimated Loss
subject to the Environmental Notice shall be resolved in accordance with the
dispute resolution provisions set forth in Section 20.3. Notwithstanding any
of the preceding provisions of this Section 8.2(c), all Environmental
Adjustments shall be made prior to Closing, which

 



      
 

 



 

Closing shall be extended until resolution of any disputes relating to the
Environmental Defects (subject to Section 19.1(c)); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that if adjustments for alleged Title Defects, Environmental Defects, Casualty
Defects, Open Defects and contested Environmental Defects do not, in the
aggregate, exceed 10% of the Base Purchase Price, then Closing shall occur as
to the other Assets that are not subject to the dispute (with the portion of
the Assets subject to the dispute being excluded, and the Base Purchase Price
reduced for the entire Allocated Values thereof) and Closing shall
subsequently occur with respect to the Assets made the subject of the dispute
within thirty (30) days following the final resolution of the dispute. IT IS
SPECIFICALLY UNDERSTOOD AND AGREED THAT ONCE AN ENVIRONMENTAL DEFECT HAS BEEN
REMEDIATED AND ALL LOSSES RELATED TO SUCH ENVIRONMENTAL DEFECT HAVE BEEN

 **ARTICLE 9**

 



 

 **9.** **THIRD-PARTY PREFERENTIAL RIGHTS TO PURCHASE, CONSENTS, AND TAG ALONG
RIGHTS**

 



 

9.1 _Third Party Notices_. In accordance with the documents creating such
rights and/or requirements, Seller shall, within five (5) Business Days of the
execution of this Agreement, (i) request any consent or approval of any third
party or Governmental Authority necessary for the conveyance of the applicable
Asset to Buyer (" _Consents_ ") and (ii) send out notices for all options,
rights of first refusal, or similar preferential purchase rights burdening any
of the Assets (each a " _Preferential Purchase Right_ "). Seller shall use all
commercially reasonable efforts, but without obligation to incur any cost or
expense, to obtain such Consents and waivers of, or to comply with, any such
Preferential Purchase Right prior to Closing.

 



 

9.2 _Third-Party Exercise_ \- If a third-party exercises a Preferential
Purchase Right of the Assets or if Seller fails to obtain a Required Consent
by Closing, the affected Asset shall be removed from this Agreement and the
Base Purchase Price shall be adjusted by the Allocated Value of the affected
Asset. If, as of Closing, the time for exercising a Preferential Purchase
Right has not expired and such Preferential Purchase Right has not been
exercised or waived, then the Assets subject to such Preferential Purchase
Right shall be included in the Assets to be assigned to Buyer at Closing, and
Buyer shall be entitled to the proceeds associated with the exercise of such
Preferential Purchase Right.

 



 

9.3 _Third-Party Failure to Purchase_ \- If (i) a third-party exercises a
Preferential Purchase Right for an Asset excluded at Closing, but fails to
close the purchase for any reason within sixty (60) days of Closing or (ii) a
Required Consent that was not obtained prior to Closing is obtained by Seller
within 120 days following the Closing Date, then (1) Buyer shall purchase from
Seller the Asset that was so excluded at Closing and pay to Seller the amount
by which the Purchase Price was reduced at Closing with respect to the Asset
so excluded and (2) Seller shall assign to Buyer the Asset so excluded at
Closing pursuant to an instrument in substantially the same form as the
Conveyance, with such assignment effective as of the Effective Time hereunder.

 



 

9.4 _Tag Along Rights_ \- That certain Participation Agreement: Screaming
Eagle Prospect  Pecos County, Texas dated effective January 1, 2012, between
ExL Energy II LP and TRO-X, L.P., et al., for the exploration and development
of lands located in the Screaming Eagle Prospect, as amended by the Waiver and
Disclaimer dated effective September 30, 2013 and by Agreements dated April 1,
2015, August 1, 2015, November 1, 2015, December 1, 2015, February 24, 2016,
and February 24, 2016 (collectively, the "Screaming Eagle Agreement"),
contains a provision giving certain parties thereto ("TAR Owners") the ability
to join in the sale reflected by this Agreement ("Tag Along Rights"). The Tag
Along Rights apply with respect to the reversionary working interests
("Reversionary Interests") owned by the TAR Owners on a reverted (after
Project

 



      
 

 



 

Payout) basis even though such interests have not yet reverted. Buyer agrees
to purchase the Reversionary Interests owned by the TAR Owners but only on a
fully reverted (after Project Payout) basis. Therefore, with respect to the
Tag Along Rights, the Parties agree that:

 



 

(a) Within three (3) Business Days after the Execution Date Seller shall
provide to the TAR Owners a notice and election in substantially in the form
attached hereto as _Exhibit "G"_ (including its enclosed Sales Terms and a
redacted copy of this Agreement) (an "Election Letter") for each TAR Owner to
sell to Seller on the same terms as contained in this Agreement including, in
particular, this Section 9.4.

 



 

(b) The Election Letter shall bind each owner of a Tag Along Right who elects
to sell by timely signing and delivering the Election Letter (" _TAR Seller_
") to sell all of its share of the Reversionary Interest (on a reverted, after
Project Payout basis) to Buyer (nominally, see (d) below) on the same terms as
this Agreement except that:

 



 

i. "Seller" will be deemed to be only the applicable TAR Seller for all
purposes except as set forth in this Section 9.4 (in which "Seller" refers to
only Samson Exploration, LLC and is distinguished from the applicable "TAR
Seller");

 



 

ii. "Assets" will be limited to the share of the Reversionary Interest owned
by the TAR Seller, including, but not limited to, all of the TAR Sellers
right, title and interest in and to the Screaming Eagle Agreement;

 



 

iii. "Base Purchase Price" will be the aggregated Allocated Values shown for
the TAR Owners on _Exhibit "E"_, proportionately reduced to the percentage of
the Reversionary Interest owned by the TAR Seller;

 



 

iv. Due to an assertion by Oxy USA, Inc. (" _Oxy_ ") that the Tag Along Rights
are subject to a preferential right to purchase in favor of Oxy (and
consequently Seller), the TAR Sellers transaction will be treated as being
subject to a preferential right to purchase consistent with Section 6 of the
Screaming Eagle Agreement (" _TAR Pref Right_ "). The Closing process shall be
altered as necessary as described below in order to effectuate TAR Pref Right
elections. No reference to the TAR Pref Right in this Agreement, any TAR Pref
Right notice or election, or any other document shall in any way serve as any
acknowledgement of the existence, validity, or applicability of any
preferential right to purchase under the Screaming Eagle Agreement;

 



 

v. The Deposit shall be entirely for the account of Seller, and not the TAR
Sellers. The TAR Sellers proportionate share of the outstanding Project
Payout balance under the Screaming Eagle Agreement, as of the Effective Date,
shall be paid to Seller rather than the applicable TAR Seller. Seller shall be
responsible for paying Oxy its portion of such amount;

 



 

vi. With respect to the Reversionary Interest, all of Sellers representations
in this Agreement shall be deemed to be made by the applicable TAR Seller
rather than by Seller, and all responsibility therefor under Article 16 shall
be borne solely by the applicable TAR Seller(s);

 



      
 

 



 

vii. Any Title Defect that doesnt affect the interest of Seller and all TAR
Sellers shall be solely for the account of the Seller and/or applicable TAR
Sellers whose interests in the Assets are affected thereby. In addition, all
dollar and percentage amounts set forth in Section 7.1, 7.5, 8.1, and 16.5
shall apply separately to (i) TAR Sellers as a group and (ii) Seller;

 



 

viii. The TAR Sellers entity type, state of formation, and notice address
shall be as set forth in the Election Letter, and persons with "Sellers
Knowledge" shall be the person signing the Election Letter, and any other
changes as are necessary shall be deemed to be made, _mutatis mutandis_ , to
reflect the different parties, interests, price, etc. subject to such
transaction.

 



 

ix. Notwithstanding anything stated in this Agreement to the contrary, Buyer
shall have no obligation to purchase any interests or Assets (as defined in
subpart (b)(ii) above) of the TAR Sellers if Buyer does not purchase the
Assets of Seller under this Agreement (and the occurrence of Closing between
Buyer and Seller (Samson Exploration, LLC) under this Agreement shall be a
condition precedent to any obligation of Buyer to purchase the interests of
TAR Sellers, whether directly as part of the TAG Along Rights, or indirectly
through Seller, as part of the interests Seller acquires in connection with
the TAR Pref Right.

 



 

(c) Due to the need to send TAR Pref Right notices and the 10 Business Day
election period applicable to the TAR Pref Right, Buyer agrees to include in
this Agreement only those TAR Owners who execute and deliver to Seller an
executed Election Letter on or before January 31, 2017 and thereby become a
TAR Seller.

 



 

(d) The Parties acknowledge that the TAR Pref Right is owned 75% by Seller and
25% by Oxy, and that the TAR Pref Right notice shall be issued by the TAR
Sellers accordingly within Three (3) Business Days after the earlier of (i)
the date set forth in paragraph (c) above or (ii) the date on which all TAR
Owners have become a TAR Seller. Seller shall timely exercise its TAR Pref
Right and thereby ensure its ability to deliver the before Project Payout
interests reflected for Seller on _Exhibit "E"_ with no after Project Payout
reduction in Sellers interest related to the Reversionary Interests owned by
the TAR Sellers. Upon Sellers timely execution of its TAR Pref Right all of
Buyers obligations with respect to the TAR Owners shall cease. Seller does
not know if Oxy will exercise its TAR Pref Right.

 



 

(e) If Oxy does exercise its TAR Pref Right, then:

 



 

i. TAR Sellers shall convey to Seller 75% of the Reversionary Interests owned
by the TAR Sellers on a reverted (after Project Payout) basis at least 3
Business Days prior to Closing;

 



 

ii. Oxy and the TAR Sellers will complete their TAR Pref Right transaction
(including conveyances, payment, and Project Payout payment) completely
separate from any involvement of Seller and Buyer;

 



      
 

 



 

iii. Seller will convey to Buyer at Closing all of Sellers interests
reflected for Seller on _Exhibit "E" plus_ Sellers 75% of the Reversionary
Interests of the TAR Sellers on a reverted (after Project Payout) basis (to
the extent received therefrom) and thereby ensure its ability to deliver
Sellers before Project Payout interests reflected for Seller on _Exhibit
"E"_ with no after Project Payout reduction in Sellers interest related to
the Reversionary Interests owned by the TAR Sellers; and

 



 

iv. Buyer will deliver to Seller at Closing, as adjusted pursuant to Article
3: (A) the entire Allocated Value attributed to Seller on Exhibit "E" plus (B)
the Allocated Value attributed to the portion of the TAR Owners interests
burdening Seller on _Exhibit "E"_ proportionately reduced to the percentage
of the Reversionary Interests owned by the TAR Sellers interests burdening
Seller (to the extent Seller has received conveyances therefrom). Buyer
acknowledges that all of the Project Payout balance to be paid by the TAR
Sellers is for the account of Seller.

 



 

(f) If Oxy does not exercise its TAR Pref Right, then:

 



 

i. TAR Sellers shall convey to Seller 100% of the Reversionary Interests owned
by the TAR Sellers on a reverted (after Project Payout) basis at least 3
Business Days prior to Closing;

 



 

ii. Seller shall endeavor to obtain, prior to Closing, from Oxy an assignment
from Oxy to Seller of the working interests owned by Oxy and burdened by the
Reversionary Interests owned by the TAR Sellers (in order to properly place
record title to such reverted working interests into Buyer due to the fact
that the Reversionary Interests of the TAR Sellers shall revert to a present
working interest as part of this transaction and payment of the TAR Sellers
portion of the Project Payout with a portion of the sales proceeds as
reflected below);

 



 

iii. Seller shall convey to Buyer at Closing all of Sellers interests
reflected for Seller on _Exhibit "E"_ plus Sellers 75% of the Reversionary
Interests of the TAR Sellers (to the extent Seller has received conveyances
therefrom) plus Oxys 25% of the Reversionary Interests of the TAR Sellers on
a reverted (after Project Payout) basis (to the extent Seller has received
conveyances therefrom) and thereby ensure its ability to deliver the before
Project Payout interests reflected for Seller on _Exhibit "E"_ with no after
Project Payout reduction in Sellers interest related to the Reversionary
Interests owned by the TAR Sellers plus the additional Oxy interest; and

 



 

iv. Buyer shall deliver to Seller at Closing, as adjusted pursuant to Article
3: (A) the entire Allocated Value attributed to Seller on Exhibit "E", plus
(B) the Allocated Value attributed to the portion of the TAR Owners interests
burdening Seller on _Exhibit "E"_ proportionately reduced to percentage of
the Reversionary Interests owned by the TAR Sellers interests burdening
Seller (to the extent Seller has received conveyances therefrom), plus (C) the
Allocated Value attributed to the portion of the TAR Owners interests
burdening Oxy on _Exhibit "E"_ proportionately reduced to percentage of the
Reversionary Interests owned by the TAR Sellers interests burdening Oxy

 



      
 

 



 

(to the extent Seller has received conveyances therefrom). Buyer acknowledges
that all of the Project Payout balance to be paid by the TAR Sellers is for
the account of Seller and Oxy, and that Seller will be responsible for paying
Oxy its portion of any such funds actually received by Seller.

 



 

(g) Buyer and Seller agree that Closing of this Agreement shall proceed
notwithstanding any delay caused by or dispute regarding the Tag Along Rights,
any TAR Owners execution, or non-execution, of an Election Letter, the TAR
Pref Right, or any matters related thereto, and that a Title Defect shall not
exist by virtue of any such delay, dispute, or decision to execute, or to not
execute, an Election Letter and/or to exercise (or not exercise) a TAR Pref
Right. In the event Seller has not received the conveyances of the
Reversionary Interests from the TAR Sellers and/or the working interests
burdened thereby from Oxy and/or any other Closing documents from the TAR
Sellers, then Closing shall proceed without those Reversionary Interests
and/or Oxys burdened working interests, and the payment to the TAR Seller
hereunder shall be reduced accordingly based on the procedures set forth in
Section 9.4(e) or (f) above, as applicable, with the Reversionary Interests
and/or Oxys burdened working interests not being conveyedto the extent not
being conveyedbeing treated at Closing as being owned by TAR Owners who are
not TAR Sellers and using the Allocated Value split among Seller and the TAR
Owners as set forth on _Exhibit "E"_. In the event any such delay or dispute
should be resolved, or conveyance should be received, within the 120 days
after Closing then the Parties agree to cooperate to conduct a subsequent
Closing for such Reversionary Interests and/or Oxys burdened working
interests as is just and equitable and with procedures, conditions, and price
adjustments as are reasonable considering the circumstances.

 



 

(h) Notwithstanding anything stated in this Agreement to the contrary, to the
extent there is any dispute or challenge made or asserted by any TAR Owners or
Oxy relative to their respective Tag Along Rights, preferential purchase
rights, or other rights or claims associated with the transactions
contemplated in this Section 9.4 or the notices, elections, or actions to be
taken or contemplated above, Seller shall INDEMNIFY, DEFEND AND HOLD HARMLESS
Buyer with regard to any Losses, claims or demands relating to any such
disputes or challenges, REGARDLESS OF THE NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR
OTHER LEGAL FAULT OR RESPONSIBILITY OF SELLER, BUYER OR ANY OTHER PERSON.

objects within this time period, the Parties shall meet within fifteen (15)
days following receipt of Buyers objections and attempt to resolve the
disputed items. If the Parties are unable to resolve the disputed items by the
end of such fifteen-day period, the dispute shall be resolved in accordance
with the dispute resolution provisions set forth in Section 20.3. After
approval by both Parties (or after final resolution of the same under Section
20.3), the net adjustment due pursuant to the Final Settlement Statement for
the Assets conveyed will be summarized and a net check or invoice will be sent
to the Buyer or Seller, as the case may be. Buyer or Seller, as the case may
be, agrees to promptly pay such invoice within ten (10) days after receipt by
Buyer. This process shall be repeated, if necessary, following any subsequent
Closing pursuant to Section 7.4. If an exact amount is not known within 120
days after Closing, Seller shall include a reasonable estimate of the
adjustment necessary for the Volume Commitment Shortfall Payment, if any. The
Party owing the difference between the estimated amount used for the Final
Settlement Statement and such final amount shall pay the other Party as
promptly as practicable.

 



 

11.4 _Suspense Accounts_ \- As set forth and itemized on _Schedule 5.21_
attached hereto, Seller currently maintains suspense accounts pertaining to
oil and gas heretofore produced comprising monies not yet escheated but
payable to royalty owners, mineral owners and other persons with an interest
in production that Seller has been unable to pay (the " _Suspense Accounts_
"). Seller will transfer to Buyer all funds in the Suspense Accounts related
to proceeds of production for the three-year period prior to the Effective
Time. Seller will be responsible for timely filing of escheat reports for
suspended funds aged beyond such three year abandonment period. A downward
adjustment to the Base Purchase Price will be made at Closing to reflect the
funds in the Suspense Accounts as of the date the Closing Settlement Statement
is prepared, and an additional adjustment will be made in the Final Settlement
Statement pursuant to Section 11.3 in order to reflect additional amounts
thereafter received by Seller and/or credited to the Suspense Accounts.
Subject to the other provisions hereof and only to the extent Buyer has
received a downward adjustment to the Base Purchase Price for the same, Buyer
shall assume full and complete responsibility and liability for proper payment
of the funds comprising the Suspense Accounts transferred to Buyer. Buyer
agrees to indemnify, defend and hold Seller, its parent, subsidiary and
affiliated entities, together with their respective officers, directors,
employees, agents and their respective successors and

 



      
 

 



 

assigns, harmless from and against any and all liabilities, claims, demands,
penalties and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) arising out of
or pertaining to the proper payment and administration of the funds in the
Suspense Accounts transferred to Buyer.

 



 

11.5 _Further Assurances_ \- After Closing, Buyer and Seller further agree
that each will, from time to time and upon reasonable request, execute,
acknowledge, and deliver in proper form, any instrument of conveyance,
assignment, transfer, or other instruments reasonably necessary for
transferring title in the Assets to Buyer or otherwise to implement the
transactions contemplated herein.

 



 

11.6 Volume Commitment - Buyer shall exercise its reasonable commercial
efforts to negotiate an extension of the deadline to fulfill Sellers volume
commitment under that certain Gas Gathering Agreement dated October 1, 2012
between Regency Field Services, LLC and EXL Petroleum, LP to December 31, 2017
or later (or to as late of a date as possible if Regency isnt willing to
extend the deadline to at least December 31, 2017) due to Regencys (i)
failure to maintain pressures equal to or less than the maximum pressure
requirements of such gas gathering agreement and (ii) inability to accept
Sellers gas, both of which required Seller to flare gas or make gas
deliveries to other pipelines instead of delivering said gas to Regency at its
designated receipt points.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 12**

 



 

 **12.** **TAXES**

 



 

12.1 _Property Taxes_ \- Seller shall be allocated and bear all ad valorem
Taxes, real property Taxes, and similar obligations (" _Real Property Taxes_
") attributable to (i) any Tax period ending prior to the Effective Time and
(ii) the portion of any Current Tax Period ending immediately prior to the
date on which the Effective Time occurs. Buyer shall be allocated and bear all
Real Property Taxes attributable to (i) any Tax period beginning on or after
the Effective Time and (ii) the portion of any Current Tax Period beginning on
the date on which the Effective Time occurs. Each Party shall be responsible
for its own Income Taxes. Real Property Taxes pertaining to a Current Tax
Period shall be allocated between the portion of such Current Tax Period
ending immediately prior to the date on which the Effective Time occurs and
the portion of such Current Tax Period beginning on the date on which the
Effective Time occurs by prorating each such Real Property Tax based on the
number of days in the applicable Current Tax Period that occur before the date
on which the Effective Time occurs, on the one hand, and the number of days in
such Current Tax Period that occur on or after the date on which the Effective
Time occurs, on the other hand. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the
period for such Real Property Taxes shall begin on the date on which ownership
of the applicable Asset gives rise to liability for the particular Real
Property Tax and shall end on the day before the next such date. All Real
Property Taxes applicable to the Assets with respect to the Current Tax Period
shall be apportioned between Seller and Buyer as of the Effective Time based
on the immediately preceding Tax periods assessment, unless the Current Tax
Periods assessment is known, in which case that assessment shall be used for
apportionment. Upon the later determination of the actual amount of Real
Property Taxes for the Current Tax Period, timely payments will be made from
one Party to the other to the extent necessary to cause each Party to bear the
amount of such Real Property Taxes that are allocable to such Party under this
Section 12.1.

 



      
 

 



 

12.2 _Production Taxes_ \- All Taxes (other than Real Property, income,
franchise, or similar Taxes) imposed on or with respect to the production of
oil, natural gas, or other hydrocarbons or minerals, or the receipt of
proceeds therefrom (including, but not limited to, severance, production and
excise Taxes) shall be apportioned between the parties based upon the
respective shares of production taken by the parties. Payment or withholding
of all such Taxes that have accrued prior to the Effective Time and filing of
all statements, returns and documents pertinent thereto shall be the
responsibility of Seller. Payment or withholding of all such Taxes that have
accrued from and after the Effective Time and the filing of all statements,
returns and documents incident thereto shall be the responsibility of Buyer.
In the event any such Taxes attributable to the Assets and to periods on or
after the Effective Time become due and payable prior to Closing, Seller shall
timely pay and satisfy the same, and appropriate adjustments therefor shall be
made to the Base Purchase Price under Section 3.3 above.

 



 

12.3 _Other Taxes_ \- Taxes that are based upon or related to income or
receipts or imposed on a transactional basis (other than production Taxes
described in Section 12.2), shall be allocated to the Tax period or portion
thereof in which the transaction giving rise to such Taxes occurred.

 



 

12.4 _Transfer Taxes_ \- As may be required by relevant Taxing agencies,
Seller shall collect and Buyer shall pay at Closing all applicable state and
local sales Tax, use Tax, gross receipts Tax, business license Tax, and other
Taxes attributable to the consummation of the transactions under this
Agreement except Taxes imposed by reason of income to (or capital of) Seller.
The Tax collected shall be based upon the Allocated Values as provided in
Section 3.4 and shall be added to the Base Purchase Price at Closing. Any
state or local Tax specified above, inclusive of any penalty and interest,
assessed at a future date against Seller with respect to the transaction
covered herein shall be paid by Buyer or, if paid by Seller, Buyer shall
promptly reimburse Seller therefor. Any documentary stamp Tax which may be due
shall be paid by Buyer. Seller shall make commercially reasonable efforts to
cooperate with Buyer to obtain the benefit of any applicable exemption related
to Taxes described in this Section 12.4.

 



 

12.5 _Tax Returns_ \- Buyer shall be responsible for the preparation and
timely filing of any Tax Returns and the payment to the applicable
Governmental Authority of all Taxes that become due and payable on or after
the date of Closing, and Buyer shall indemnify and hold Seller harmless for
any failure to file such Tax Returns and to make such payments. Buyer shall
prepare any Tax Returns for Taxes for Current Tax Periods ending on or after
the date of Closing on a basis consistent with past practice except to the
extent otherwise required by applicable Law. Buyer shall provide Seller with a
copy of any such Current Tax Period Tax Return for review at least ten days
prior to the due date for the filing of such Tax Return (or within a
commercially reasonable period after the end of the Current Tax Period, if
such Tax Return is required to be filed less than ten days after the close of
the Current Tax Period), and Buyer shall incorporate reasonable comments of
Seller provided to Buyer in advance of the due date for the filing of such Tax
Return.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 13**

 



 

 **13.** **OWNERSHIP OF ASSETS**

 



 

13.1 _Distribution of Production_ \- All oil in storage, including Sellers
tankage and pipeline volumes, or gas beyond the meters at the Effective Time
shall be credited to Seller, less

 



      
 

 



 

applicable royalties and severance Taxes. For Seller-operated Assets, Seller
has gauged the oil in storage and read all gas meter charts as of the
Effective Time. For Seller non-operated Assets, the quantity of such oil in
storage or gas beyond the meters shall be determined on the same basis as that
used for Seller-operated Assets based on operator reports or applicable state
regulatory agency production reports or records. As part of the Closing
Settlement Statement, the price for such oil in storage shall be at the price
that Seller has contracted to sell the oil on the Effective Time, taking into
account applicable royalties and severance Taxes. If there is no such price,
the price shall be the average of the two highest prices that are posted at
the Effective Time (plus any premium) by other purchasing companies, as
determined by Seller in the field or locality where the Interests are located
for oil of like grade and gravity. Title to the oil in storage for both
Seller-operated and Seller non-operated Assets shall pass to Buyer upon
Closing, effective as of the Effective Time, and an upward adjustment shall be
made to the Base Purchase Price due at Closing, less applicable royalties and
severance Taxes.

 



 

13.2 _Proration of Income and Expenses_ \- Except as otherwise provided in
this Agreement, all proceeds (including proceeds held in suspense or escrow),
receipts, credits, and income attributable to the Assets for all periods of
time prior to the Effective Time shall belong to Seller, and all proceeds,
receipts, credits, and income attributable to the Assets for all periods of
time from and after the Effective Time shall belong to Buyer. Except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement, all costs, expenses, disbursements, and
obligations attributable to the Assets for periods of time prior to the
Effective Time shall be the obligation of Seller, and Seller shall promptly
pay, or if paid by Buyer, promptly reimburse Buyer for and hold Buyer harmless
from and against same. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, all
costs, expenses, disbursements and obligations attributable to the Assets for
periods of time from and after the Effective Time shall be the obligation of
Buyer, and Buyer shall promptly pay, or if paid by Seller, promptly reimburse
Seller for and hold Seller harmless from and against same.

 



 

13.3 _Notice to Remitters of Proceeds_ \- Buyer shall be responsible for
informing all purchasers of production or other remitters to pay Buyer and
obtain from the remitter revenues accrued after the Effective Time. The
remitter shall be informed by Seller and Buyer via Letters-in-Lieu of Transfer
Order or such other reasonable documents which remitter may require.

 



 

13.4 _Production Imbalances_ - Set forth on _Schedule 13.4_ attached hereto
and made a part hereof for all purposes is a listing of all gas imbalance
volumes measured in Mcfs or MMBtus and the aggregate net volume of
overproduction or underproduction, as applicable, with respect to the Assets
as of the Effective Time (the " _Assumed Imbalance_ "). At Closing, the Base
Purchase Price shall be adjusted, upward or downward as appropriate, to
reflect the value of said aggregate net volume of overproduction or
underproduction with respect to the Assumed Imbalance as said volume may be
adjusted prior to Closing in accordance with each Partys due diligence
investigation. The value of said aggregate net volume (less royalties) of
overproduction or underproduction, as applicable, shall be the product
obtained by multiplying Two Dollars ($2.00) by the volume of such aggregate
net overproduction or underproduction measured in Mcfs or MMBtus as shown on
_Schedule 13.4_. Buyer shall be solely responsible for any liability and
solely entitled to any benefit from production imbalances, whether occurring
on, before or after the Effective Time. If the imbalance cannot be determined
by Closing or there are further imbalance adjustments attributable to Pre-
Effective Time periods subsequent to Closing but prior to the Final Settlement

 



      
 

 



 

Statement, then the value adjustment associated with any imbalance will be
made in connection with the Final Settlement Statement.

 



 

13.5 _Pipeline and Other Non Well-head Imbalances_ - To the extent there
exists any imbalances attributable to Hydrocarbons produced from the Assets as
of the Effective Time, with respect to any gas pipeline, storage or processing
facility, at Closing the Base Purchase Price shall be adjusted upward or
downward, as appropriate, to reflect the value of said imbalance. The value of
said imbalance shall be calculated by summing the product(s) obtained by
multiplying the volume of each net over-position or under-position, as the
case may be, measured in the same manner as it is measured by the pipeline,
storage or processing facility, as applicable, by the value at which the
imbalance was either cashed out, made up or sold, or if otherwise
undeterminable then using existing fair market value of, or price for, said
Hydrocarbons. Buyer shall be solely responsible for any liability and solely
entitled to any benefit from such pipeline imbalances relating to the Assets
from and after the Effective Time. If the imbalance cannot be determined by
Closing or if the pipeline storage or processing facility makes any
adjustments attributable to Pre-Effective Time periods subsequent to Closing
but prior to the Final Settlement Statement, then the value adjustment
associated with any imbalance will be made in connection with the Final
Settlement Statement.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 14**

 



 

 **14.** **INTERIM OPERATIONS**

 



 

14.1 _Standard of Care._

 



 

Subject to the additional restrictions set forth in this Section 14.1, Seller
shall operate the Seller-operated Assets in accordance with all applicable
laws, using the standard of care as a reasonable and prudent operator and
consistent with past practices until Closing, or such later time as any
applicable joint operating agreement may require, when such operation shall be
turned over to, and become the responsibility of, Buyer. During the period
from the Execution Date to Closing, Seller shall (i) permit Buyer to have
access for inspection only to those Assets operated by Seller; (ii) except for
emergency action taken in the face of risk to life, property or the
environment, shall not, without the prior written consent of Buyer (which
shall not be unreasonably withheld) approve or authorize any AFEs or capital
expenditures over One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000) net to the interest
of Seller which are received by Seller with respect to any Assets, settle any
gas imbalances and incur costs for discretionary expenditures for operations
in excess of One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000) net to the interest of
Seller for which AFEs are not prepared; (iii) operate, or if Seller is not
the operator, use reasonable efforts to ensure that the operator operates the
Assets in its ordinary course of business and in accordance with applicable
industry standards and the terms and conditions of all applicable Contracts,
laws and regulations; (iv) not transfer, sell, hypothecate, encumber, abandon
or otherwise dispose of any portion of the Assets (other than the sale of
Hydrocarbons in the ordinary course of business or as required in connection
with the exercise by third-parties of Preferential Purchase Rights) any of the
Assets or agree to undertake any of the foregoing; (v) assist the Buyer
(without incurring any third party expenses) in preserving the present
relationships related to the Assets with parties having significant business
relations therewith, such as suppliers, customers, brokers, agents or
otherwise; (vi) not amend, modify or terminate (or enter into any new)
Material Contracts; (vii) take any and all actions necessary to ensure that
the Assets are free and clear of all liens and

 



      
 

 



 

encumbrances as of Closing; (viii) not waive, compromise or settle any
material right or claim if such waiver, compromise or settlement would
adversely affect the use, ownership or operation of any of the Assets in any
material respect, and (ix) cause the Assets to be maintained in accordance
with the terms and conditions of the applicable Contracts and applicable laws
and regulations and consistent with past practices, and consult with Buyer
with respect to same. However, notwithstanding the above restrictions, insofar
as none of the same would reduce the interest in the Assets being delivered to
Buyer at Closing, increase any liability or obligation that Buyer would be
assuming as of the Closing, or materially and adversely affect Buyers ability
to own, operate and maintain the Assets in substantially the same manner that
Seller owned, operated and maintained the Assets, it is agreed that prior to
Closing, Seller shall be permitted to take those actions described on
_Schedule 14.1_ or execute any document intended to cure an actual or
potential Title Defect.

 



 

14.2 _Liability of Operator_ \- Notwithstanding Section 14.1, Seller shall not
be liable to Buyer for any claims, demands, causes of action, damages, or
liabilities arising out of Sellers operation of the Assets after the
Effective Time, insofar as Seller continues to operate and maintain the Assets
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement (including, without limitation,
Section 14.1 above) and as a reasonable and prudent operator, and insofar as
no such Claims, demands, causes of action, damages, or liabilities relating to
such interim operation are attributable to the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of, or any breach of this ARTICLE 14 by, Seller.

 



 

14.3 _Removal of Signs_ \- Seller shall have the option to remove Sellers
name and signs from the Seller-operated Assets or to require Buyer to do so
after Closing. Buyer hereby grants Seller a right of access after Closing,
upon reasonable prior written notice to Buyer, at Sellers sole cost, expense
and liability, to such Assets to remove Sellers signs and names from the
Assets, or to confirm that Buyer has done so after Closing. If Sellers signs
or name remain on the Assets after Closing, Buyer shall promptly, but no later
than required by applicable rules and regulations or thirty (30) days
thereafter, whichever is earlier, remove any remaining signs and references to
Seller and shall erect or install all signs complying with any applicable
governmental rules and regulations, including, but not limited to, those
showing the Buyer as operator of the Assets.

 



 

14.4 _Non-Operated Assets_ \- As to non-operated Assets, Seller shall exercise
the same standard of care as a reasonable and prudent working interest owner
under the same or similar circumstances until Closing, subject to the other
provisions of Section 14.1 above.

 



 

14.5 _Third-Party Notifications_ \- Buyer shall make all notifications to all
Regulatory Authorities, "one call services" and similar groups associated with
the operation of the Assets within fifteen (15) days of Closing. A copy of all
such notifications shall be provided to Seller pursuant to the notice
provisions contained in ARTICLE 18 hereof.

 



 

14.6 _Accounting Cooperation_ \- In accordance with the rules and regulations
of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and pursuant to other reporting
obligations of Buyer, including any rules of the New York Stock Exchange,
Buyer and its Affiliates may be obligated to provide certain audited financial
information related to the Assets. Accordingly, from and after the Execution
Date until Closing, and then, should it occur, the three year anniversary of
the Closing Date, Seller shall grant Buyer and its Affiliates, and its and
their independent accountants and other representatives, access, during normal
business hours, to the books and records in the possession or control of
Seller related to the Assets as may be reasonably requested by Buyer, and its
and their

 



      
 

 



 

independent accountants and other representatives, for the purpose of auditing
and otherwise verifying revenue and expense and other information related to
the Assets to be included in any required financial statements of Buyer and
its Affiliates; provided, however, that Seller shall have no liability or
obligation for the accuracy or completeness of such information or otherwise
with respect to the financial statements of Seller in which such information
is reflected.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 15**

 



 

 **15.** **EXCHANGE PROVISION**

 



 

Seller and Buyer, respectively, shall have the right, prior to Closing, to
elect to effect a Tax-deferred exchange under Code Section 1031 (a " _Tax
Deferred Exchange_ ") for the Assets at any time prior to Closing. If such
Party elects to effect a Tax-Deferred Exchange, the other Party agrees to
execute escrow instructions, documents, agreements or instruments to effect
the exchange; _provided_ , _however_ , that the other Party shall incur no
additional costs, expenses, fees or liabilities as a result of or connected
with the exchange. Seller and Buyer, as the case may be, may assign any of its
rights and delegate performance of any of its duties under this Agreement in
whole or in part to a third party in order to effect such an exchange;
_provided_ , _however_ , that each such Seller and/or Buyer shall remain
responsible to the other Party for the full and prompt performance of its
respective delegated duties. The electing Party shall indemnify and hold the
other Party and its affiliates harmless from and against all claims, expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees), loss and liability resulting from its
participation in any exchange undertaken pursuant to this ARTICLE 15 pursuant
to the request of the electing Party.

to the contrary contained herein, Sellers aggregate liability for the
indemnification under Section 16.4(i) above (except with respect to claims
relating to a breach of sellers representations set forth in Sections 5.1,
5.2, 5.3, and 5.6 **)** , shall not exceed fifty percent (50%) of the Base
Purchase Price.

 



 

16.6 _Further Limitation on Indemnification_ \- Neither Party shall have any
obligation under ARTICLE 16 with respect to any amount which has already been
taken into account and applied to or against the Base Purchase Price in the
Closing Settlement Statement or the Final Settlement Statement, _provided_
such Party has paid all amounts due pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

16.7 _Indemnification Procedures_

 



 

16.7.1 All claims for indemnification under this Agreement shall be asserted
and resolved pursuant to this Section 16.7. Any person claiming
indemnification hereunder is hereinafter referred to as the " _Indemnified
Party_ " and any person against whom such claims are asserted hereunder is
hereinafter referred to as the " _Indemnifying Party_."

 



 

16.7.2 In the event that a Party wishes to assert a claim for indemnity
hereunder, such Party shall with reasonable promptness provide to the
Indemnifying Party a written notice of the indemnity claim it wishes to assert
on behalf of itself or another Indemnified Party, including the specific
details of and specific basis under this Agreement for its indemnity claim (a
" _Claim Notice_ "). To the extent any Losses for which indemnification is
sought are asserted against or sought to be collected from an Indemnified
Party by a third party, such Claim Notice shall include a copy of all papers
served on the applicable Indemnified Party with

 



      
 

 



 

respect to such claim. The Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days from
the personal delivery or receipt of the Claim Notice (the " _Notice Period_ ")
to notify the Indemnified Party (i) whether or not it disputes its liability
hereunder with respect to such Losses and/or (ii) with respect to any Losses
arising out of, associated with, or relating to third party claims, whether or
not it desires, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, to
defend the Indemnified Party against any such Losses. In the event that the
Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party within the Notice Period
that it desires to defend the Indemnified Party against such Losses, the
Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend all appropriate proceedings
with counsel of its own choosing. If the Indemnified Party desires to
participate in, but not control, any such defense or settlement it may do so
at its sole cost and expense. If requested by the Indemnifying Party, the
Indemnified Party agrees to cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its
counsel in contesting any Losses that the Indemnifying Party elects to contest
or, if appropriate and related to the claim in question, in making any
counterclaims against the third party asserting such Losses, or any cross-
complaint against any third party (other than a Seller Indemnified Party, if
the Indemnified Party is a Seller Indemnified Party; and other than a Buyer
Indemnified Party, if the Indemnified Party is a Buyer Indemnified Party).
Such cooperation shall include the retention and provision to the Indemnifying
Party of all records and other information that are reasonably relevant to the
losses at issue. No third party claim that is the subject of indemnification
hereunder may be settled or otherwise compromised without the prior written
consent of the Indemnifying Party. No such claim may be settled or compromised
by the Indemnifying Party without the prior written consent of the Indemnified
Party unless such settlement or compromise (i) entails a full and
unconditional release of the Indemnified Party (and any other members of the
Indemnified Partys group, i.e., all Seller Indemnified Parties or all Buyer
Indemnified Parties) without any admission or finding of fault or liability
and (ii) does not impose on the Indemnified Party any material non-financial
obligation or any financial obligation that is not fully paid by the
Indemnifying Party.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 17**

 



 

 **17.** **CASUALTY LOSS**

 



 

If prior to Closing any of the Assets are substantially damaged or destroyed
by fire or other casualty (" _Casualty Defect_ "), Seller shall notify Buyer
promptly after Seller learns of such event. Seller shall have the right, but
not the obligation, to cure any such Casualty Defect by repairing such damage
or, in the case of Equipment, replacing the damaged Equipment with equivalent
items, no later than the Closing, insofar as the same are done to Buyers
reasonable satisfaction. If any Casualty Defect exists at Closing, at Sellers
option, Buyer shall proceed to purchase the damaged Assets, and the Base
Purchase Price shall be reduced by the aggregate reduction in value of all
affected Assets on account of such Casualty Defect. In the event the parties
cannot agree on the value, the dispute shall be resolved in accordance with
the dispute resolution provisions set forth in Section 20.3. Notwithstanding
any of the preceding provisions of this ARTICLE 17, all adjustments applicable
to Casualty Defects shall be made prior to Closing which Closing shall be
extended until resolution of any disputes relating to the Casualty Defects
(subject to Section 19.1(c)); _provided_ , _however_ , that if adjustments for
alleged Title Defects, Environmental Defects, Casualty Defects, Open Defects
and contested Environmental Defects do not, in the aggregate, exceed 10% of
the Base Purchase Price, then Closing shall occur as to the

 



      
 

 



 

other Assets that are not subject to the dispute (with the portion of the
Assets subject to the dispute being excluded, and the Base Purchase Price
reduced for the entire Allocated Values thereof) and Closing shall
subsequently close and consummate the transactions as to the Assets made the
subject of the dispute within thirty (30) days following the final resolution
of the dispute. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
ARTICLE 17, Seller shall be entitled to retain all insurance proceeds, if any,
and claims against other parties relating to any such Casualty Defect. For
purposes of this provision, normal wear and tear shall not be considered a
Casualty Defect.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 18**

 



 

 **18.** **NOTICES**

 



 

All communications between Buyer and Seller required or permitted under this
Agreement shall be in writing, and any communication or delivery hereunder

 **ARTICLE 19**

 



 

 **19.** **TERMINATION**

 



 

19.1 _Termination_ \- This Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing:

 



 

(a) by the mutual written agreement of Buyer and Seller;

 



 

(b) by written notice from either Buyer or Seller if Closing has not occurred
on or before June 1, 2017; _provided_ , _however_ , that no Party may
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 19.1(b) if such Partys
breach of its

 



      
 

 



 

representations and warranties or its failure to comply with its obligations
or covenants under this Agreement caused the Closing not to occur on or before
this date; or

 



 

(c) by written notice from either Buyer or Seller if ten percent (10%) of the
Base Purchase Price is less than the aggregate sum of (i) the Title Defect
amounts for all Title Defects timely and properly asserted pursuant to ARTICLE
7 (excluding all Title Defects related to any Reversionary Interests), (ii)
the Environmental Defect amounts for all Environmental Defects timely and
properly asserted pursuant to ARTICLE 8, and (iii) the Casualty Defect amounts
pursuant to ARTICLE 17; _provided, however_ , that Buyer shall have the right
to waive or reduce the amount of any previously asserted Title Defects and
Environmental Defects, by written notice to Seller within three (3) Business
Days after receipt of a termination notice, such that the aggregate sum of the
foregoing defects is less than 10%, thereby enabling the Parties to proceed to
Closing in lieu of termination.

 



 

19.2 _Liabilities Upon Termination; Deposit Amount_ \- If this Agreement
terminates, as described in Section 19.1 above, then the entire Deposit will
be returned and paid to Buyer and all obligations of the Parties under this
Agreement will thereafter terminate and be of no further force and effect,
except that the provisions of Section 20.4 and 20.5 will survive; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if this Agreement is terminated because of either (i) a
willful or intentional breach of this Agreement by Seller or because Sellers
conditions to Closing are not satisfied as a result of Sellers willful or
intentional failure to comply with its obligations under this Agreement, then
Buyers sole and exclusive remedy for any breach or failure to perform by
Seller under this Agreement shall be to terminate this Agreement, to receive
the Deposit from the Escrow Agent, and to pursue all remedies available at law
for damages or other relief, in equity or otherwise, including, without
limitation, specific performance; or (ii) a willful or intentional breach of
this Agreement by Buyer or because Buyers conditions to Closing are not
satisfied as a result of Buyers willful or intentional failure to comply with
its obligations under this Agreement, then Sellers sole and exclusive remedy
for any breach or failure to perform by Buyer under this Agreement shall be to
terminate this Agreement, to receive and retain the Deposit as liquidated
damages from the Escrow Agent (and the Parties hereby acknowledge that the
extent of damages to Seller occasioned by such breach or default or failure to
proceed by Buyer would be impossible or extremely impractical to ascertain and
that the Deposit is a fair and reasonable estimate of such damage).

 



 

 **ARTICLE 20**

 



 

 **20.** **MISCELLANEOUS**

 



 

20.1 _Entire Agreement_ \- This Agreement and all Exhibits and Schedules
hereto constitute the entire agreement between the Parties. Any previous
negotiations or communications between the Parties are merged herein.

 



 

20.2 _Survival_ \- This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the
benefit of the undersigned, their successors, heirs, assigns and corporate
successors and may be supplemented, altered, amended, modified, or revoked by
writing only, signed by both Parties. The representations made by Seller and
Buyer under ARTICLE 5 and ARTICLE 6 shall continue in full force and effect
for a period of twelve (12) months from and after

 



     

 



 

the Closing Date; provided, however, that the representations made by Seller
in Sections 5.1, 5.2, 5.3 and 5.6 and the representations made by Buyer in 6.4
shall further survive for the applicable statute of limitations. All other
representations, promises, agreements, releases, and indemnities made in this
Agreement or in the Conveyances shall survive Closing.

 



 

20.3 _Arbitration and Dispute Resolution Procedures_

 



 

(a) If a Party notifies the other Party of any disputed items regarding either
(i) the existence of any Title Defects asserted by Buyer, or the value of any
adjustments to the Base Purchase Price therefor, (ii) the existence of any
Environmental Defects asserted by Buyer, or the value of any adjustments to
the Base Purchase Price therefor, (iii) the existence of any Casualty Defects
asserted by Buyer, or the value of any adjustments to the Base Purchase Price
therefor, or (iv) any other proposed adjustments to the Base Purchase Price to
be made at Closing, or to be made after Closing in connection with the Final
Settlement Statement, then Seller and Buyer shall promptly meet and attempt to
resolve the dispute within fifteen (15) days following written notification of
the dispute in accordance with the applicable terms of this Agreement. In the
event the Parties fail to resolve their differences, then all such items
remaining in dispute after the later of Closing or the end of such 15-day
period shall be submitted by Seller and Buyer (i) in the case of Title Defects
or Casualty Defects (or adjustments relating thereto), a "Title/Casualty
Expert" mutually agreed to by the Parties, (ii) in the case of Environmental
Defects (or adjustments relating thereto), an "Environmental Expert" mutually
agreed to by the Parties, and (iii) in the case of any other proposed
adjustments to the Base Purchase Price to be made at Closing, or to be made
after Closing in connection with the Final Settlement Statement, then to one
of the nationally recognized independent auditors or accounting firms
("Accounting Experts") mutually agreed to by the Parties (in each case, the
Title/Casualty Expert, the Environmental Expert and the Accounting Expert, as
applicable, is herein referred to as the " _Neutral Auditor_ "). All fees and
expenses of the Neutral Auditor relating to the work, if any, to be performed
thereby pursuant to this Section 20.3(a) shall be borne 50% by Seller and 50%
by Buyer; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event that the Neutral Auditor
determines that the actual adjustment to the Base Purchase Price relative to a
disputed item varies less than 10% of the original adjustment proposed for the
applicable Title Defect, Casualty Defect, Environmental Defect or other
adjustment to the Base Purchase Price and made the subject of the dispute,
then the Party disputing the same shall be charged 100% of the costs of the
Neutral Auditor. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, all other costs
and expenses incurred by the Parties in connection with resolving any dispute
hereunder before the Neutral Auditor shall be borne by the Party incurring
such cost and expense. The Neutral Auditor shall act as an arbitrator to
determine only those items still in dispute at the end of the 15-day
resolution period. In no event shall the Neutral Auditors determination be
outside of the range of amounts claimed by the respective Parties with respect
to those items in dispute. The Parties shall instruct the Neutral Auditor to
render its reasoned written decision as soon as practicable but in no event
later than 30 days after his, her or its engagement (which engagement shall be
made no later than ten (10) Business Days after the end of the fifteen-day
period in which the Parties were to have attempted to reach mutual agreement
and resolution of the disputed item). Such

 



      
 

 



 

decision shall be set forth in a written statement delivered to Seller and
Buyer and shall be final, binding, conclusive and nonappealable for all
purposes hereunder. In all cases, the Neutral Auditor must be independent of
the Parties to the dispute, have the type of applicable experience described
in Section 20.3(c) below and render a decision on a neutral basis, in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Except for the type of dispute described and addressed in Section 20.3(a)
above, any other dispute arising under this Agreement (an " _Arbitrable
Dispute_ ") shall be referred to and resolved by binding arbitration in
Houston, Texas by three (3) arbitrators, using the Commercial Arbitration
Rules of the American Arbitration Association (" _AAA_ "), but not using the
offices or auspices of the AAA; and, to the maximum extent applicable, the
Federal Arbitration Act (Title 9 of the United States Code). If there is any
inconsistency between this Article and any statute or rules, this Article
shall control. Arbitration shall be initiated within the applicable limits set
forth in this Agreement and not thereafter or if no time limit is given,
within the time period allowed by the applicable statute of limitations, by
one Party (" _Claimant_ ") giving written notice to the other Party ("
_Respondent_ "), that the Claimant elects to refer the Arbitrable Dispute to
arbitration, and that the Claimant has appointed an arbitrator, who shall be
identified in such notice. The Respondent shall notify the Claimant within
thirty (30) days after receipt of Claimants notice, identifying the
arbitrator the Respondent has appointed. The two (2) arbitrators so chosen
shall select a third arbitrator within thirty (30) days after the second
arbitrator has been appointed (upon failure of a Party to act within the time
specified for naming an arbitrator, such arbitrator shall be appointed by the
presiding Federal District Judge for the Southern District of Texas (the "
_Designating Judge_ ")). Seller shall pay the compensation and expenses of the
arbitrator named by or for it, Buyer shall pay the compensation and expenses
of the arbitrator named by or for it, and Seller and Buyer shall each pay one-
half of the compensation and expenses of the third arbitrator.

 



 

(c) Each arbitrator must be a neutral party who has never been an officer,
director or employee of the Parties or any of their affiliates or any entity
in which a Party owns or controls, or owned or controlled, more than a ten
percent (10%) interest, has not provided professional or consulting services
for either Party within the five (5) years preceding the commencement of the
proceedings, has more than ten (10) years experience in the oil and gas
industry, and must have a formal financial/accounting, engineering or legal
education. The hearing for an Arbitral Dispute shall be commenced within sixty
(60) days after the selection of the third arbitrator. The parties and the
arbitrators shall proceed diligently in accordance with the procedures set
forth in Section 20.3 in order that the arbitral award shall be made as
promptly as possible. All statutes of limitation that would otherwise be
applicable shall apply to any arbitration proceeding. The tribunal shall not
have the authority to grant or award indirect or consequential damages,
punitive damages or exemplary damages.

 



 

(d) If the arbitration panel determines that an Arbitrable Dispute does not
present a valid Claim, the panel shall deny the Claim and no damages shall be
awarded.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) If, as a result of the initial decision making process, the arbitration
panel determines that a valid Claim was presented as an Arbitrable Dispute,
the arbitration hearing shall be scheduled and conducted as promptly as
possible in Houston, Texas. The amount of the award relating to the Claim
shall be determined by the majority vote of the three (3) arbitrators. Except
as provided in clause (b), all costs and expenses incurred by the Parties in
connection with resolving any dispute hereunder shall be borne by the Party
incurring such cost and expense; _provided_ , _however_ , that the arbitration
panel shall have the authority to award attorneys fees and costs of
arbitration to the prevailing Party if the panel determines that the non-
prevailing Partys position was not based on a commercially reasonable
interpretation of the applicable standards, law or facts.

 



 

20.4 _Confidentiality_ \- The parties understand and agree that the terms and
provisions of that certain Confidentiality Agreement dated November 23, 2016
by and between Seller and Halcon Resources Corporation (the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ ") shall remain in full force and effect until the Closing of this
transaction. In the event of termination of this Agreement pursuant to ARTICLE
19, the Buyer agrees to keep all of the terms of this transaction confidential
for a period equal to the later of the date of termination of the
Confidentiality Agreement or two (2) years following termination of this
Agreement. Furthermore, any additional information obtained as a result of
Buyers access to the Assets which does not specifically relate to the Assets
shall continue to be treated as confidential for a period of two (2) years
following the date of this Agreement and shall not be disclosed by the Buyer
without the prior written consent of the Seller. The above restrictions on
disclosure and use of information obtained pursuant to this Agreement shall
not apply to information to the extent it:

 



 

(a) is or becomes publicly available through no act or omission of the Buyer
or any of their consultants or advisors; or

 



 

(b) is subsequently obtained lawfully from a third party, where the Buyer has
made reasonable efforts to ensure that such third party is not a party to or
bound by any confidentiality agreement with the Seller; or

 



 

(c) is already in the Buyers possession at the time of disclosure, without
restriction on disclosure.

 



 

If the Buyer employs consultants, advisors or agents to assist in its review
of the Assets, Buyer shall be responsible to Seller for ensuring that such
consultants, advisors and agents comply with the restrictions on the use and
disclosure of information set forth in this Section 20.4.

 



 

20.5 _Choice of Law_ \- THIS AGREEMENT AND ITS PERFORMANCE SHALL BE CONSTRUED
IN ACCORDANCE WITH, AND GOVERNED BY, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF TEXAS.

 



 

20.6 _Assignment_ \- The rights and obligations under this Agreement may not
be assigned by any Party without the prior written consent of the other Party
and any nonpermitted assignment shall be void.

 



 

20.7 _No Admissions_ \- Neither this Agreement, nor any part hereof, nor any
performance under this Agreement shall constitute or be construed as a
finding, evidence of, or an admission

 



      
 

 



 

or acknowledgment of any liability, fault, or past or present wrongdoing, or
violation of any law, rule, regulation, or policy, by either Seller or Buyer
or by their respective officers, directors, employees, or agents.

 



 

20.8 _Amendments_ \- Except for waivers specifically provided for in this
Agreement, this Agreement may not be amended nor any rights hereunder waived
except by an instrument in writing signed by the Party to be charged with such
amendment or waiver and delivered by such Party to the other Party claiming
the benefit of such amendment or waiver.

 



 

20.9 _Counterparts_ \- This Agreement may be executed by Buyer and Seller in
any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original
instrument, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same
instrument. Execution can be evidenced by facsimile transmission of signatures
pages with original signature pages to promptly follow in due course.

 



 

20.10 _Third-Party Beneficiaries_ \- Except to the limited extent expressly
provided otherwise in Sections 8.5, 16.3, and 16.4, neither this Agreement nor
any performances hereunder by Seller or Buyer shall create any right, claim,
cause of action, or remedy on behalf of any person not a party hereto.

 



 

20.11 _Public Communications_ \- After Closing, either Party may make a press
release or public communication concerning this transaction; _provided_ ,
_however_ , any such press release or public communication is subject to the
other Partys prior review and written approval; _provided_ , _further_ ,
_however_ , that, if either Party is required by law or the rules of the New
York Stock Exchange to make such public announcement or statement, then the
same may be made without the approval of the other Party.

 



 

20.12 _Headings_ \- The headings of the Articles and Sections of this
Agreement are for guidance and convenience of reference only and shall not
limit or otherwise affect any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement.

 



 

20.13 _Expenses_ \- Each of the Parties hereto shall pay its own fees and
expenses incident to the negotiation and preparation of this Agreement and
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including brokers fees.
Buyer shall be responsible for the cost of all fees for the recording of the
Conveyances relating to the Assets. All other costs shall be borne by the
Party incurring them.

 



 

20.14 _Waiver of Consumer and Other Rights_ \- Seller and Buyer intend that
Buyers rights and remedies with respect to the transaction contemplated by
this Agreement and with respect to all acts or practices of Seller, past,
present or future, in connection with the transaction contemplated by this
Agreement shall be governed by legal principles other than the Texas Deceptive
Trade Practices Consumer Protection Act, Tex. Bus. and Com. Code Ann. §17.41, et
seq. (Vernon 1987) (the " _DTPA_ ") or similar laws in other states. BUYER
WAIVES IT RIGHTS UNDER THE DTPA SPECIFICALLY INCLUDING SECTION 17.41 ET. SEQ.,
VERNONS TEXAS CODE ANNOTATED, BUSINESS AND COMMERCE, A LAW THAT GIVES
CONSUMERS SPECIAL RIGHTS AND PROTECTIONS, OR ANY SIMILAR STATE OR FEDERAL LAW.
AFTER AN OPPORTUNITY TO CONSULT WITH AN ATTORNEY OF ITS OWN SELECTION, BUYER
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE DISCLAIMERS AND WAIVERS GIVEN IN AND UNDER THIS
AGREEMENT SHALL BE CONSIDERED MATERIAL AND

 



      
 

 



 

INTEGRAL PARTS OF THIS AGREEMENT, WITH CONSIDERATION GIVEN THEREFORE, AND
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT ALL DISCLAIMERS AND WAIVERS ARE "CONSPICUOUS" AND HAVE BEEN
BROUGHT TO THE ATTENTION OF BUYER, AND THAT BUYER HAS VOLUNTARILY AND
KNOWINGLY CONSENTED TO ALL DISCLAIMERS AND WAIVERS. Buyer hereby warrants and
represents to Seller, as of the date hereof and as of the Closing Date, that
(i) Buyer is not in a significantly disparate bargaining position, (ii) Buyer
has been represented by legal counsel in connection with the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement, which transaction does not involve the
purchase or lease of a family residence occupied or to be occupied as a
residence, and which transaction is for a consideration paid or to be paid
that exceeds $500,000.00 and (iii) Buyer is a business consumer with assets of
$5,000,000.00 or more according to Buyers most recent financial statement
prepared in accordance with GAAP and has knowledge and experience in financial
and business matters that enable Buyer to evaluate the merits and risks of the
transaction. Buyer acknowledges that the Base Purchase Price is predicated
upon this waiver of the DTPA and similar laws in other states and the
inapplicability of the DTPA and similar laws in other states and Buyers
representations and warranties contained in this Section 20.14, and the
Seller, in determining to proceed with entering into this Agreement, has
expressly relied upon this waiver and the inapplicability of the DTPA and
similar laws in other states and Buyers representations and warranties
contained in this Section 20.14.

 



 

20.15 _Non-Compensatory Damages_. - None of the Buyer Group or Seller Group
shall be entitled to recover from Seller or Buyer, as applicable, or their
respective affiliates, any indirect, consequential, punitive or exemplary
damages or damages for lost profits of any kind arising under or in connection
with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except
to the extent any such Party suffers such damages (including costs of defense
and reasonable attorneys fees incurred in connection with defending of such
damages) to a third party, which damages (including costs of defense and
reasonable attorneys fees incurred in connection with defending against such
damages) shall not be excluded by this provision as to recovery hereunder.
Subject to the preceding sentence, Buyer, on behalf of each of the Buyer
Group, and Seller, on behalf of the Seller Group, each waive any right to
recover punitive, special, exemplary and consequential damages, including
damages for lost profits of any kind, arising in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. This Section
20.15 shall not restrict any Partys right to obtain specific performance or
other equitable remedies (other than rescission) pursuant to this Agreement.
