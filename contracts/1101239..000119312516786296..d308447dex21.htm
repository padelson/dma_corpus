\- v - TRANSACTION AGREEMENT

 

This Transaction Agreement (this " _Agreement_ "), dated December 6, 2016, is
between Verizon Communications Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Seller_ "),
and Equinix, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Acquiror_ ").

RECITALS

 

WHEREAS, Seller has determined to divest its business of providing customers
with space, power and on-site telecommunications connectivity for information
technology equipment used in connection with customers business operations at
the Transferred Sites, and certain support services relating to the foregoing
(such business, as more specifically described on _Section 10.1_ of the
Seller Disclosure Letter, and excluding the Excluded Businesses, the "
_Business_ ");

WHEREAS, prior to the closing of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and subject to the terms and conditions contained in this
Agreement, Seller and its Subsidiaries will effect the pre-closing
restructuring described herein, pursuant to which (i) Seller will form
the Acquired Entities and (ii) Seller and the other members of the Seller
Group will Convey or cause to be Conveyed to the Acquired Entities the
Acquired Assets and will assign or cause to be assigned to the Acquired
Entities the Assumed Liabilities; and

WHEREAS, Acquiror and/or one or more of its Affiliates desire to purchase from
Seller and the other members of the Seller Group, and Seller and the other
members of the Seller Group desire to sell to Acquiror and/or one or more of
its Affiliates, the Acquired Entity Interests; in each case, on the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, the representations,
warranties and agreements set forth in this Agreement and other good and
valuable consideration, the adequacy and receipt of which are hereby
acknowledged, the Parties, intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as
follows:

 

I. THE TRANSACTION

 

1.01 __Pre-Closing Restructuring; Purchase and Sale of Acquired Entity
Interests__ _._

 

(a) Effective as of immediately prior to the Closing, Seller will, and will
cause Terremark do Brasil Ltda. (the " _Brazil Seller_ ") to, Convey all of
the Acquired Assets and Assumed Liabilities held by the Brazil Seller through
a drop down of such Acquired Assets and Assumed Liabilities to a newly formed
entity (" _Hickory Brazil_ ") in accordance with Schedule I to this Agreement
(the " _Brazil Drop Down_ "). (b) Effective as of immediately prior to the Closing, Seller will, and will
cause its Subsidiaries to, Convey all of the Acquired Assets and Assumed
Liabilities not Conveyed to Hickory Brazil pursuant to _Section_ _1.01(a)_ or
held by Hickory Colombia (including certain Transferred Contracts, but
excluding any Government Contracts, Excluded Assets and Excluded Liabilities)
to one or more newly formed Subsidiaries of Seller (the " _U.S. Acquired
Entities_ " and, together with Hickory Brazil and Hickory Colombia, the "
_Acquired Entities_ "). Each Acquired Entity (other than Hickory Colombia)
will be formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. None of the Acquired Entities (other than
Hickory Colombia) will, prior to the Closing, engage in any business
activities or conduct any operations or incur any Liabilities other than in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except that
in the event the Brazil Drop Down is completed prior to the Closing, Hickory
Brazil will conduct the Business and incur Liabilities in the ordinary course
of business prior to the Closing. Each Acquired Entity (other than Hickory
Colombia) will be an eligible entity as such term is defined under Treasury
Regulation Section 301.7701-3(a). Seller will cause each Acquired Entity
(other than Hickory Colombia), if such Acquired Entity is not already treated
as such, to make an election under Treasury Regulation Section 301.7701-3
to be treated as a partnership or an entity disregarded as separate from its
owner for U.S. federal income tax purposes, effective as of its formation
date.

 

(c) Prior to the Closing, and subject to _Section 4.01_ , Seller will, and
will cause its Subsidiaries to, take all actions reasonably necessary or
appropriate such that, to the extent reasonably practicable, none of the
Acquired Entities will own any Excluded Assets or be responsible for any
Excluded Liabilities.

 

(d) In furtherance of the restructuring transactions contemplated by _Section_
_1.01(a)_ and _Section_ _1.01(b)_ , on the Closing Date, (i) Seller will
execute and deliver, and will cause its Subsidiaries to execute and deliver,
such bills of sale, stock powers, certificates of title, special warranty
deeds or their equivalent, assignments of Contracts, powers of attorney,
assignments of Permits, assignment of warranties, affidavits and other
instruments of Conveyance (in each case to the extent applicable and in a form
that is consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and
otherwise customary or statutorily required in the jurisdiction in which the
relevant Assets are located) as reasonably necessary or reasonably requested
by Acquiror to evidence or otherwise effectuate the Conveyance of all of
Sellers and its Subsidiaries right, title and interest in and to the
Acquired Assets to the Acquired Entities, and (ii) the Acquired Entities will
execute and deliver such assumptions of Assumed Liabilities and other
instruments of assumption (in each case in a form that is consistent with the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, and otherwise customary or statutorily
required in the jurisdiction in which the relevant Liabilities are located) as
and to the extent reasonably necessary to evidence the valid and effective
assumption of the Assumed Liabilities by the Acquired Entities. All of the
foregoing documents contemplated by this _Section_ _1.01(_ _d)_ will be
referred to collectively herein as the " _Transfer Documents_." Seller will
make available to Acquiror the organizational documents of each Acquired
Entity and the form of Transfer Documents no later than ten Business Days
before the Closing and will consider in good faith any reasonable comments of
Acquiror thereon.

 



2 (e) Subject to _Section_ ___1.07_ , effective as of the Closing, Seller will
(or will cause any applicable member of the Seller Group to) sell, assign,
transfer, convey and deliver (" _Convey_ ") to Acquiror (or one or more
designated Affiliates of Acquiror), and Acquiror (or one or more Affiliates of
Acquiror) will purchase from Seller, or the applicable members of the Seller
Group, all of the capital stock or other equity interests of the Acquired
Entities (the " _Acquired Entity Interests_ "), in each case free and clear of
all Liens, other than Permitted Liens. The transfer of each of Hickory Brazil
and Hickory Colombia to Acquiror (or one or more designated Affiliates of
Acquiror) will, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, be effected
pursuant to separate acquisition agreements on a country-by-country basis in
substantially the form attached as _Exhibit H_ to this Agreement, with only
such modifications as required by applicable Law in the jurisdictions of
incorporation or organization of Hickory Brazil or Hickory Colombia, as
applicable (each a " _Non-U.S. Transfer Agreement_ "); _provided_ that, in
each case, the Non-U.S. Transfer Agreements will serve purely to effect the
legal transfer of Hickory Brazil or Hickory Colombia. For the avoidance of
doubt, (i) the Non-U.S. Transfer Agreements will not have any effect on the
value being given or received by Seller Group or Acquiror Group, including the
allocation of Assets and Liabilities and indemnities as between them, all
of which will be determined solely in accordance with this Agreement and (ii)
in the event of any conflicts between any Non-U.S. Transfer Agreement and this
Agreement, the terms of this Agreement will control in all respects. Seller
and Acquiror will not, and will cause their respective Affiliates not to,
bring any claim for any cause of action under any Non-U.S. Transfer Agreement.

1.07 __Certain Consents__. (a) If and to the extent that the Conveyance of
any Acquired Asset or Assumed Liability, to an Acquired Entity, the sale of
the Acquired Entity Interests to Acquiror or its designated Affiliate, or
both, or the retention by Seller Group of any Excluded Asset or Excluded
Liability, or any sublease transaction contemplated by the Post-Closing
Leases, would be a violation of applicable Laws or require any Permit or
Consent in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby that has not
been obtained as of the Closing, or would otherwise materially and adversely
affect the rights of Acquiror or its designated Affiliate thereunder, then,
notwithstanding 

 



10  any other provision hereof, such Conveyance, sale or sublease transaction
will automatically be deferred and will not occur until all legal impediments
are removed or such Permits and/or Consents have been obtained.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such Asset or Liability will still be
considered an Acquired Asset, Assumed Liability, Excluded Asset or Excluded
Liability, as applicable, and the Person retaining such Asset or
Liability will thereafter hold such Asset or Liability in trust for the
benefit, insofar as reasonably possible, of the Person entitled thereto (and
at such beneficiarys sole expense) until the consummation of the Conveyance,
sale, retention or sublease transaction thereof. The Parties will use, and
will cause their respective Subsidiaries to use, their respective Commercially
Reasonable Efforts to continue to seek to remove any legal impediments, obtain
any Permits or secure any contractual Consents required from third parties
necessary to Convey such Asset or Liability or to effect such sale, retention
or sublease transaction, including using Commercially Reasonable Efforts to
take the actions set forth on _Section 1.07(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure
Letter; _provided_ that Sellers and Acquirors obligations with respect to
the foregoing will terminate on the 12-month anniversary of the Closing Date.
Following the Closing, until the applicable legal or contractual impediments
are removed or the applicable Permits and/or Consents are obtained, the
Parties will develop and implement arrangements to place the Person entitled
to receive such Asset or Liability, insofar as reasonably possible and to the
extent not prohibited by applicable Law or the relevant Contract, in the same
position as if such Asset or Liability had been Conveyed or such sale,
retention or sublease transaction were effected as contemplated hereby such
that all the benefits and burdens relating to such Asset or Liability,
including possession, use, risk of loss, potential for gain, any Tax
Liabilities in respect thereof and dominion, control and command over such
Asset or Liability, are to inure from and after the Closing to such Person,
including, with respect to any Transferred Customer Contract or Transferred
Supplier Contract, to the extent not prohibited by applicable Law or the
relevant Contract, allowing Acquiror or a member of the Acquiror Group to
serve as a subcontractor, sub-licensor or sub-lessor (as applicable) of Seller
and the other members of the Seller Group under such Transferred Contract from
and after the Closing, under substantially the same terms as Seller or the
applicable member of the Seller Group enjoys under such Transferred Contract,
until, subject to _Section 1.07(b)_ , the earliest of (A) the assignment of
the Transferred Contract upon the receipt of the Consent or Permit required
for such assignment, (B) the execution of a new Contract between a member of
the Acquiror Group and the relevant customer in respect of the services
provided by the Business under such Transferred Contract, (C) the full
performance of the obligations of the Business under such Transferred
Contract, and (D) the termination of such Transferred Contract. In furtherance
of the foregoing, Seller shall, without further consideration therefor, pay
and remit to Acquiror or its designated Affiliate all monies, rights
and other consideration received in respect of such Asset or Liability as
promptly as reasonably practicable after receipt thereof, and Acquiror or its
designated Affiliate shall reimburse Seller or its designated Affiliate for
all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by
the Seller Group in connection with the performance of any Transferred
Contract prior to its assignment to the Acquiror Group (including Taxes
incurred as a result of the receipt of such consideration (net of any Tax
benefit realized as the result of the payment of such consideration), but
excluding any allocated overhead) and, insofar as reasonably possible

 



11  and to the extent not prohibited by applicable Law or the relevant Contract,
Acquiror or its designated Affiliate will pay, perform and discharge fully,
promptly when due, all of the obligations of Seller and its Affiliates in
respect of such performance as would have been assumed by Acquiror or its
designated Affiliate hereunder if such Assets and Liabilities had been
transferred at the Closing. In furtherance of the foregoing, (i) Seller shall
provide the services described in Section Seller B2C TSA for Project Hickory
(Billing ops) of Exhibit A to the Transition Services Agreement and (ii) with
respect to a Post-Closing Lease, at Sellers request, Acquiror and
Seller shall reasonably negotiate to allow Seller or the applicable member
group to license such space under the Colocation Agreement Amendment if a
Consent relating to a Post-Closing Lease is not obtained.

 

(b) Without limiting the obligations under _Section_ _1.07(a)_ above, to the
extent any Transferred Customer Contract has not been Conveyed to Acquiror or
another member of the Acquiror Group prior to the 18-month anniversary of the
Closing Date due to the existence of any legal or contractual impediments or
the pendency of any required Permits or Consents, upon the written request of
either Party, any such Contracts which have not been Conveyed will instead
become subject to the terms of the reseller arrangements provided for under
the Joint Marketing Agreement or an alternative reseller arrangement to which
Seller and Acquiror may otherwise reasonably agree.

(c) Neither Party will be required to make any non- _de minimis_ payments,
incur any non- _de minimis_ Liability (including any guarantee or other non-
monetary security) or offer or grant any non- _de minimis_ accommodation
(financial or otherwise) to any third party in connection with any action
contemplated by this  _Section_ ___1.07_ , nor will Seller commit to make any
payments (other than cash payments that are paid in full prior to the Closing)
or make any non-monetary concession that would purport to bind Acquiror, any
Affiliate of Acquiror, the Business or any Acquired Entity following the
Closing, in each case without Acquirors prior written consent (not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except as set forth on
_Section_ _1.07(c)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter. If and when the
applicable legal or contractual impediments are removed or the applicable
Permits and/or Consents are obtained, the Conveyance of the applicable Asset
or Liability will be effected in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

(d) In the event that despite the actions and/or the implementation of the
arrangements contemplated by _Sections _ _1.07(a)_ and _1.07(b)_ , the
Conveyance of any Transferred Real Property Lease or Owned Site (other than
any Owned Site listed on _Section_ _1.07(d)(i)_ of the Seller Disclosure
Letter, to which this _Section _ _1.07(d)_ will not apply) to an Acquired
Entity, the sale of the Acquired Entity Interests to Acquiror or its
designated Affiliate, or both, would require any Consent (including any
Consent or action listed on _Section _ _1.07(d)(ii)_ of the Seller Disclosure
Letter) in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby that has not
been obtained as of the Closing, and Seller is unable to otherwise transfer
the benefits and burdens of such Transferred Real Property Lease to Acquiror
such that Acquiror would be in a substantially similar position as if such
Consent or action had been obtained or taken, then, notwithstanding any other
provision hereof, (i) such Transferred Real Property Lease shall not be
Conveyed to such Acquired Entity, and any such Owned Site and any real
property to which such

 



12  Transferred Real Property Lease relates will be deemed removed from _Section
1.03(a)_ or _Section 1.03(b)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter, as applicable,
without any further action by Seller or Acquiror and will not be considered
an Owned Site, Leased Site or Transferred Site under this Agreement or any
Ancillary Agreement (including without limitation for the purposes of the
definition of Business and Acquired Assets), (ii) all Transferred Customer
Contracts, Shared Customer Contracts and Transferred Tenant Leases, to the
extent pertaining to such real property will be deemed Excluded Assets without
any further action by Seller or Acquiror, and (iii) the U.S. Purchase Price,
the Brazil Purchase Price or the Colombia Purchase Price (as applicable) will
be adjusted as set forth on _Section 1.07(d)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter.

 

(e) Nothing in this _Section_ ___1.07_ will be deemed to (i) constitute or
require a waiver by any of the Parties of any of the closing conditions set
forth in _Article_ _V_ , including the receipt of the Governmental Approvals,
or (ii) apply to any Shared Customer Contracts, which are governed by
_Section_ ___4.04,_ or Government Contracts, which are governed by _Section_
___4.18_.

1.08 __Waiver of Bulk-Sales Laws__. Each of Seller and Acquiror hereby waives
compliance by each member of their respective Group with the requirements and
provisions of the "bulk-sale" or "bulk-transfer" Laws of any jurisdiction that
may otherwise be applicable with respect to the Conveyance of any or all of
the Acquired Assets to any member of the Acquiror Group.

1.09  _ _Closing__. (a) On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement, the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
_Section_ _ _ _1.01_ (the " _Closing_ ") will take place at (i) Jones Day,

the later of April 1, 2017 and the first day of the calendar month immediately

immediately prior to the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or, where
permitted, the waiver of those conditions), unless such first day on which
such conditions are satisfied or waived is less than two Business Days before
the first day of such immediately following calendar month, in which case the
Closing will take place on the first day of the second calendar month
immediately following the first day on which the conditions set forth in

place as the Parties hereto may mutually agree; _provided_ that if the day on

For all purposes, the Closing will be deemed effective as of 12:00:01 a.m.,

this _Section 1.09(a)_. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to as
the " _Closing Date_."

 



13 (b) Notwithstanding _Section 1.09(a)_ , if the Closing does not occur on the
anticipated Closing Date as a result of the failure of the Billing Condition
to be satisfied, the Closing Date will be extended to (i) if Seller has met
its obligations with respect to the delivery of billing data set forth in
_Section 5.01(b)_ by at least 90 days prior to the anticipated Closing Date,
the first day of the calendar month immediately following the anticipated
Closing Date (but subject to the proviso set forth in _Section 1.09(a)_ ), or
(ii) if Seller has not met its obligations with respect to the delivery of
billing data set forth in _Section 5.01(b)_ by at least 90 days prior to the
original anticipated Closing Date, the first day of the month that is at least
90 days following the date on which Seller has delivered such billing data
set forth in _Section 5.01(b)_ (in either case, the " _Revised Closing Date_
"). Thereafter, if Acquiror has not satisfied the Billing Condition by 30 days
prior to the Revised Closing Date, then at Sellers option (i) the Closing
will occur on the Revised Closing Date, and Seller will continue to bill for
the Applicable Contracts in the same manner as it bills for Transferred
Customer Contracts and Shared Customer Contracts for which a Consent to
Convey is required and has not been obtained, or in such other manner as it
reasonably determines, in each case until such time as Acquiror notifies
Seller that it has satisfied the Billing Condition, or (ii) the Revised
Closing Date shall be extended until the first day of the month immediately
following the month in which Acquiror satisfies the Billing Condition (but
subject to the proviso set forth in _Section 1.09(a)_ ), and in the case of
each of clause _(i)_ and  _(ii)_ , Acquiror shall pay Seller a fee of
$250,000 per day beginning on the original Revised Closing Date (without
giving effect to any extension pursuant to this sentence) until the tenth day
thereafter, and a fee of $500,000 per day beginning on such tenth day
thereafter until the date on which Acquiror begins billing for the Transferred
Contracts.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that, prior to April 1, 2017,
a Government official with responsibility for review of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement expresses either in writing or orally to one or
more Representatives of Acquiror or Seller, at a meeting or telephone
conference at which one or more Representatives of each of Acquiror and Seller
shall have been present, that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
are under ongoing review by the reviewing Governmental Authority, and, as of
April 1, 2017 such Government official has not indicated that such
transactions are no longer under such ongoing review, Acquiror will not be
obligated to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement prior
to May 1, 2017, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set
forth in _Article V_ (other than those conditions that by their nature or
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement are to be satisfied at or immediately
prior to the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or, where permitted,
the waiver of those conditions).

1.10 __Purchase Price__. (a) Subject to the last sentence of this _Section_
_1.10(a)_ , at the Closing, and upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, (i) in consideration of the Conveyance of all
of the equity interests of the U.S. Acquired Entities, Acquiror or its
designated Affiliates will pay to Seller or its designated Affiliates the U.S.
Purchase Price, (ii) in consideration of the Conveyance of all the equity
interests of Hickory Brazil, Acquiror or its designated Affiliate will pay to
Seller or its designated Affiliates the Brazil Purchase Price, and (iii) in
consideration of the Conveyance of

 



14  Hickory Colombia, Acquiror or its designated Affiliate will pay to Seller or
its designated Affiliates the Colombia Purchase Price. If the day on which the
Closing is to occur is not a Business Day, then on the Business Day
immediately prior to the Closing, Acquiror or its respective Affiliates will
deposit the Global Purchase Price into an interest-bearing escrow account with
an escrow agent selected by Acquiror and reasonably acceptable to Seller and,
at the Closing, Acquiror and any applicable Affiliates will deliver to such
escrow agent irrevocable instructions to release the Global Purchase Price,
together with any interest thereon, to Seller or its designated Affiliates as
of the Closing; _provided_ , that Acquiror will be responsible for all fees
and expenses relating to such escrow account, including the fees and expenses
of the escrow agent.

 

(b) In the event that the Adjusted 2015 EBITDA is less than the Management
2015 EBITDA, the Base Price will be reduced by an amount equal to the product
of (x) the amount by which the Management 2015 EBITDA exceeds the Adjusted
2015 EBITDA and (y) 8.97. If the Adjusted 2015 EBITDA is equal to or greater
than the Management 2015 EBITDA, no adjustment to the Base Price will be
made pursuant to this _Section_ _1.10(_ _b)_. For purposes of this _Section_
_1.10(_ _b)_ :

(i) " _Adjusted 2015 EBITDA_ " means (A) net revenues, less (B) total
expenses (which is the sum of cost of service and selling, general and
administrative), calculated based on the Financial Statements for the calendar
year ended December 31, 2015 to be delivered by Seller pursuant to _Section_
_4.20(a)(i)_ , as adjusted pursuant to _Section_ ___1.10(b)(i)_ of the Seller
Disclosure Letter to give effect to the pro forma adjustments described in 
_Section_ _1.10(b)(i)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter on the page entitled
"2015 2065 Audit Reconciliation" under the heading "Adjustments to Audited
Financials."

 

(ii) " _Management 2015 EBITDA_ " means an amount equal to $377,000,000.00.

 

(iii) Seller will deliver to Acquiror by January 31, 2017 its calculation of
Adjusted 2015 EBITDA, together with the CIM Walk, categorized by the pro
forma adjustments referred to in _Section_ _1.10(b)(i)_ (together, the "
_Adjustment Documentation_ "). Following delivery of the Adjustment
Documentation, Seller will provide, within five Business Days of Acquirors
written request therefor, a written explanation of the methodology used to
calculate such pro forma adjustments for purposes of determining Adjusted 2015
EBITDA. Thereafter, Seller will, for a period of five consecutive Business
Days, provide access to a computer in a Seller facility during normal working
hours, and subject to compliance with Sellers building and IT security
policies, to permit Acquiror to review an electronic version of the CIM Walk
file and the related supporting documentation, consisting of the tabs
included in the CIM Walk file. Seller will make available one of its
accounting personnel to accompany Acquirors representative and respond to
questions relating to the CIM Walk file, but not to provide any additional
documentation or materials.

 



15 (c) Seller shall use reasonable best efforts to complete the condominium
conversion and the subdivision set forth in _Section 1.10(c)_ of the Seller
Disclosure Letter on substantially the terms set forth therein by the Closing
Date. In the event that the condominium conversion and/or subdivision set
forth in _Section 1.10(c)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter is not complete as
of the Closing in accordance with the terms described in the Seller Disclosure
Letter, (i) the Owned Site to which such condominium conversion or subdivision
relates shall not be Conveyed to the applicable Acquired Entity at the
Closing, (ii) Seller will continue to use its reasonable best efforts to
complete the condominium conversion and subdivision, and (iii) Seller or
another member of Seller Group shall lease each such real property to
Acquiror or its designated Affiliate pursuant to a long term lease, which
lease will (A) have the maximum term permissible under applicable Law, (B)
require the payment of a _de minimis_ amount of rent plus reimbursement
of reasonable and documented pass-through expenses incurred by Seller or its
Affiliate as the landlord, (C) include a purchase option, exercisable by
Acquiror within 90 days following the completion of the condominium conversion
or subdivision (as applicable), pursuant to which Acquiror (or its designated
Affiliate) may purchase fee interest in the underlying real property for
$1.00, and (D) insofar as reasonably possible and to the extent not prohibited
by applicable Law, put the Parties in the same position as if the fee
interest in such property were Conveyed to Acquiror or its designated
Affiliate at the Closing, such that the benefits and burdens relating to such
Owned Site, including possession, use, risk of loss, potential for gain, any
Tax Liabilities in respect thereof and dominion, control and command over such
Owned Site, inure to Acquiror (such leases, the " _Interim Leases_ ").

 

1.11 __Proration of Expenses__. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, the Seller Group will be obligated to make any payments in
respect of trade payables and expenses, and be entitled to receive and retain
any receivables and revenue (other than insurance proceeds to the extent
provided in _Section_ ___1.03(e)_ and  _Section_ ___4.12(b)_ ), in each case
in respect of events occurring, and for periods and portions thereof ending,
on or prior to the Closing as "Excluded Liabilities" and "Excluded Assets,"
respectively, and the Acquiror Group will be obligated to make any payments
in respect of trade payables and expenses (other than the Seller Transaction
Expenses, which shall be the sole liability of Seller), and be entitled to
receive and retain any receivables and revenue, in each case in respect of
events occurring, and for periods and portions thereof ending, after the
Closing, as "Assumed Liabilities" and "Acquired Assets," respectively. For
purposes of this  _Section_ ___1.11_ , prorations of receivables, payables,
expenses and revenue relating to the use and occupancy of the Acquired Assets
or the operation of the Business will be made on an accrual basis in
accordance with GAAP;  _provided_ that Taxes taken into account in
determining the prorations of payables or expenses pursuant to this _Section_
___1.11_ will be allocated to Seller or Acquiror in accordance with the
principles outlined in  _Section_ ___8.04(c)_. The Parties will work in good
faith to determine and finalize any amounts due under this _Section_ ___1.11_
prior to the Closing Date. Seller will provide Acquiror
supporting documentation and make its representatives reasonably available to
answer questions as to its determination of prorations of trade payables or
expenses pursuant to this _Section_ _1.11_. The net amount of the prorations
contemplated by this _Section_ ___1.11_ will be credited to (or debited from)
the

 



16  U.S. Base Price, the Brazil Base Price, or the Colombia Base Price, as
applicable, payable by Acquiror at the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that
to the extent any such prorations are not finalized by the Closing Date, the
Parties will cooperate with each other in good faith to finalize such amounts
as promptly as practicable, but in no event later than 60 days, after the
Closing Date.

 

1.12 __Closing Deliveries__. (a) _Deliveries by Seller Group_. Subject to

event no later than five Business Days prior to the date on which such payment
is made or, in the case of a change in applicable Law after the date of this
Agreement that would require withholding from such amounts, as soon
as practicable) notify the Seller of any intention to so deduct and withhold
and provide Seller the opportunity to provide any statement, form, or other
documentation that would reduce or eliminate any such requirement to deduct
and withhold; (ii) remit

 



18  and report any such amount required to be deducted and withheld to the
applicable Taxing Authority in accordance with applicable Law; (iii) promptly
provide to Seller a certificate, receipt or other documentation of proof of
such remittance reasonably acceptable to Seller so as to enable Seller to
claim any available foreign Tax credit; and (iv) cooperate with Seller as

of any claim relating to any available refund of such amount remitted. To the
extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld, such deducted and withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements as having been paid to the Person in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made.

1.14  _ _Post-Closing Leases__. (a) The Parties acknowledge and agree that
Seller has not been able to provide all information necessary to finalize the
forms of Post-Closing Leases as of the date hereof, and that Exhibit
B-1, Exhibit B-2, Exhibit B-3, Exhibit B-4, Exhibit D-1, and Schedule 1 to
each of the Post-Closing Leases (collectively, the " _Outstanding Exhibits_ ")
are not in a final form on the date hereof. Accordingly, Acquiror and Seller
agree to cooperate in good faith after the date hereof to finalize the
Outstanding Exhibits and the measurement and description of the space to be
licensed under the Colocation Agreement (such measurement and description,
collectively, " _Colo Space Descriptions_ ") as promptly as reasonably
practicable. Seller will provide Acquiror with copies of the Outstanding
Exhibits and Colo Space Descriptions for Acquirors review and approval, which
approval will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; _provided_ , _however_
, that it will be deemed to be reasonable for Acquiror to withhold its
approval if the plans, descriptions or requirements to be finalized (i)
include any common areas, telecommunication rooms, fire escapes, fiber vaults
or meet me rooms or (ii) would materially and adversely affect the operation
of the Business by Acquiror and its Affiliates at the applicable Transferred
Site.

 

(b) In the event any Transaction Revenue Sharing Payments are required to be
made under any Transferred Real Property Lease with respect to a Post-Closing
Lease (but in each case only to the extent that (i) such Post-Closing Lease
required the Consent of the applicable landlord, (ii) such Consent was not
received, and (iii) the applicable landlord makes a written claim that the
failure to obtain the required Consent in respect of such Post-Closing Lease
breached the applicable Transferred Real Property Lease), the Parties agree
that the applicable Post-Closing Lease will require Seller (or the applicable
subtenant under the Post-Closing Lease) to be responsible for 100% of all
such Transaction Revenue Sharing Payments such that Acquiror (or the
applicable sublandlord under the Post-Closing Lease) will be entitled to
retain the same amount of rent and other amounts payable under the Post-
Closing Lease (after deducting any amounts required to be paid to the landlord
under the Transferred Real Property Lease as a result of the Transaction
Revenue Sharing Payments) as if there were no such Transaction
Revenue Sharing Payments.

(c) On the Closing Date, each of Seller (or its designated Affiliates), as
lessee or sublessee, and Acquiror (or its designated Affiliates), as lessor
or sublessor, as applicable, will enter into the Post-Closing Leases, pursuant
to which Seller or its Subsidiaries, as lessee or sublessee, as applicable,
will lease or sublease an aggregate 

 



19  amount of space no less than the Minimum Space Commitment, subject to any
changes to the Minimum Space Commitment as may be agreed to by the Parties
prior to the Closing in the space to be leased under the Post-Closing Leases.
For purposes hereof, " _Minimum Space Commitment_ " means the aggregate square
footage set forth in _Section 1.14(c)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in the event that any Transferred Real Property
Lease is not Conveyed pursuant to _Section 1.07(d)_ or the amount of square
footage leased under any Post-Closing Lease is reduced in accordance with the
tenants contraction right thereunder as of the Closing Date, the Minimum
Space Commitment will be reduced by the amount of the square footage that
Seller would have leased in the property which was the subject of such
Transferred Real Property Lease had such Transferred Real Property Lease been
Conveyed. At Sellers option, Seller may cause its Subsidiaries, in their
respective capacities as sublandlord and subtenant, to enter into Post-Closing
Leases of the Leased Sites finalized in accordance with _Exhibit D-2_
but subject to property-specific changes mutually acceptable to Seller and
Acquiror, _provided_ that neither Party will unreasonably withhold its consent
thereto, and each such Post-Closing Lease will be in the name of or assigned
to the Acquired Entity at or before Closing and be an Acquired Asset
hereunder.

applicable Subsidiary in accordance with its terms, subject to the
Enforceability Exception.

 

3.03 __Governmental Approvals__. The execution, delivery and performance of

date hereof, there are no other agreements, side letters or arrangements
relating to the Commitment Letter other than the fee letter and the engagement
letter, none of which would reasonably be expected to affect the availability

the Seller Group to the Acquiror Group contemplated by this Agreement or as
set forth in _Section_ ___4.02(b)_ of the Acquiror Disclosure Letter, (ii)
agree to any restriction or limitation with respect to the Business, the
services or Assets of Acquiror or any of its Affiliates or any Acquired
Assets, or offer or commit to take any action that would reasonably be
expected to limit Acquirors freedom of action with respect to, or its
ability to retain, any of the Business, the services or Assets of Acquiror or
any of its Affiliates or any Acquired Assets, or (iii) subject to the third
sentence of _Section_ _4.02(a)_ , oppose, contest, appeal or litigate any
judicial or administrative action or proceeding, in each case relating to any
Antitrust Law or in connection with obtaining any Antitrust Approval.

 



44 4.03 __Public Announcements__. The press releases announcing the execution
and delivery of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby will
be in the forms attached as _Exhibit B_ (the " _Transaction Announcement_ ").
From the date hereof through the Closing, neither Seller nor Acquiror will
publish any press releases or make other public statements (including to
securities analysts) with respect to this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements
and the transactions contemplated hereby (or the portion thereof relating to
this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements and the transactions contemplated
hereby), except as such Party determines in good faith is reasonably required
by Law (including reasonable and customary disclosure in connection with any
financing transaction) or applicable securities listing standards after
consultation with counsel (in which case, such Party will consult with the
other Party to the extent reasonably practicable under the circumstances prior
to making such disclosure and will only disclose that information that is
reasonably required by Law or applicable securities listing standards based
upon advice of counsel), without the prior approval of the other Party, such
approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, or except
any such release or statement that only contains information previously
publicly disclosed in accordance with this _Section 4.03_ or is otherwise
consistent in all material respects with previous statements made jointly
by Seller and Acquiror or any mutually agreed upon communication plan.

4.04 __Shared Customer Contracts__. (a) During the period after the date
hereof until the 12-month anniversary of the Closing Date, Seller will use
Commercially Reasonable Efforts to (i) cause each Shared Customer Contract to
be assigned in relevant part to an Acquired Entity (in the case of a partial
assignment entered into before the Closing) or a member of the Acquiror Group
designated by Acquiror (in the case of a partial assignment entered into after
the Closing), in each case effective from and after the Closing, or (ii)
appropriately amend such Shared Customer Contract (as reasonably determined by
Seller in good faith) so that Acquiror or another member of the Acquiror Group
will, from and after the Closing, be entitled to the rights and benefits
enjoyed by the Business under such Shared Customer Contracts on substantially
the same terms as then in effect; _provided_ that Commercially Reasonable
Efforts shall include the actions set forth in _Section _ _4.04(a)_ of the
Seller Disclosure Letter. The Parties will reasonably cooperate to prioritize
the efforts with respect to the partial assignment or amendment of Shared
Customer Contracts that constitute Material Contracts. In addition, Seller
will provide Acquiror with contact information for such third parties and
introduce representatives of the Acquiror Group to Sellers contacts at such
third parties in respect of such Shared Customer Contracts. As soon
as practicable after the date of this Agreement (and in any event within 10
Business Days from the date hereof), each of Seller and Acquiror will notify
the other in writing of the contact person (or persons) responsible for
communications between the Seller Group and the Acquiror Group regarding
third-party consents, customer communications, responses to customer questions
and concerns and any negotiations on behalf of each party with respect to the
arrangements and obligations under this  _Section_ _4.04_. In furtherance of
the foregoing, in connection with the entry into or renewal of any Shared
Customer Contract after the date hereof, Seller will use Commercially
Reasonable Efforts to (i) enter into separate Contracts with such customer
with respect to the Business and the applicable Excluded Business(es) and (ii)
include provisions in such Transferred Customer Contract that would permit
such Transferred Customer Contract to be assigned, in whole or in part, to
Acquiror pursuant to this Agreement.

 



45 (b) With respect to any Shared Customer Contract, if partial assignment or
amendment cannot be obtained as of the Closing, or if an attempted partial
assignment or amendment thereof would adversely affect in any material respect
the rights of any member of the Seller Group or the Acquiror Group thereunder,
Seller and Acquiror will, and will cause the respective members of their
Group to, use their Commercially Reasonable Efforts to negotiate a mutually
acceptable arrangement under which Acquiror (or another member of the Acquiror
Group) or Seller (or another member of the Seller Group) will, from and after
the Closing, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and the relevant Shared
Customer Contract, obtain the benefits and assume the Liabilities and
obligations under such Shared Customer Contract to the extent related to
the Business (in the case of the Acquiror Group) or the Excluded Businesses
(in the case of the Seller Group) (the " _Sharing Arrangements_ "), including,
subject to _Section_ _4.04(d),_ by entering into sub-contracting, sub-
licensing or sub-leasing arrangements for the benefit of Acquiror or Seller,
as the case may be, under substantially the same terms as Seller or its
applicable Subsidiary enjoys under such Shared Customer Contract, from and
after the Closing until, subject to _Section_ _4.04(c)_ , the earliest of (A)
the partial assignment or amendment of such Shared Customer Contract as
contemplated by the first sentence of _Section_ _ _ _4.04(a)_ ), (B) the
execution of a new Contract between a member of the Acquiror Group and the
relevant customer in respect of the services provided by the Business under
such Shared Customer Contract, (C) the full performance of the obligations of
the Business under such Shared Customer Contract, and (D) the termination of
such Shared Customer Contract. In connection with such Sharing Arrangements,
Seller shall provide the services described in Section Seller B2C TSA for
Project Hickory (Billing ops) of Exhibit A to the Transition Services
Agreement. In furtherance of the foregoing, after the Closing, if Seller or
any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, or Acquiror or any of its Affiliates,
on the other hand, receives any benefit or payment under any Shared Customer
Contract that relates to the portion of the Shared Customer Contract that is
allocated to the other Party pursuant to this Agreement, Seller and Acquiror
will promptly deliver such benefit or payment to the other Party.

 

(c) Without limiting the obligations under _Section_ _4.04(a)_ and _Section_
_4.04(b)_ above, to the extent any Shared Customer Contract has not been
partially assigned to Acquiror or another member of the Acquiror Group or
appropriate amended pursuant to _Section_ _4.04(a)_ prior to the 18-month
anniversary of the Closing Date, upon the written request of either Party,
any such Contracts which have not been partially assigned or appropriately
amended will instead become subject to the terms of the reseller arrangements
provided for under the Joint Marketing Agreement or an alternative
reseller arrangement to which Seller and Acquiror may otherwise reasonably
agree.

 



46 (d) Neither Party will be required to make any non- _de minimis_ payments,
incur any non- _de minimis_ Liability (including any guarantees or other non-
monetary security) or offer or grant any non- _de minimis_ accommodation
(financial or otherwise) to any third party in connection with any action
contemplated by this  _Section_ ___4.04_ , nor will Seller commit to make any
non- _de minimis_ payments (other than cash payments that are paid in full
prior to the Closing) or make any non-monetary concession that would purport
to bind Acquiror, any Affiliate of Acquiror, the Business or any Acquired
Entity following the Closing, in each case without Acquirors prior written
consent.

 

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, following the expiration or other
termination of any Shared Customer Contract, neither Acquiror nor Seller will
be obligated to continue the Sharing Arrangements, as applicable; _provided_ ,
that following the Closing and prior to the expiration or other termination of
any Shared Customer Contract, neither Seller nor Acquiror may terminate or
amend any such Shared Customer Contract in a manner that adversely affects
the other Partys rights or obligations thereunder in any non- _de minimis_
respect without the prior written consent of the other Party (other than any
such actions taken by the counterparty to any Shared Customer Contract
pursuant to the terms thereof).

4.05 __Notification of Certain Matters__. Each of Seller and Acquiror will
give prompt written notice to the other of (a) any written notice received by
it from any Person alleging that the Consent of such Person is or may be
required in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and (b)
during the Pre-Closing Period, any Action commenced or threatened in writing
against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting it or any of its
Affiliates that relates to the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby for which it receives notice. During the Pre-Closing Period, Seller
will give prompt written notice to Acquiror of any material damage to all or
any portion of the Transferred Sites by fire or other casualty, or if any
portion of the Transferred Sites is permanently or temporarily taken by
eminent domain.

4.06 __Access and Contacts__. (a) During the Pre-Closing Period, to the
extent permitted by Law, Seller will allow designated Representatives of
Acquiror reasonable access during normal business hours and upon reasonable
advance notice to the books, records, files, properties and personnel to the
extent pertaining to the Business and the right to inspect the Transferred
Sites; _provided_ _,_ _however_ , that notwithstanding the provision of
information or investigation by Seller, Seller will not be deemed to make any
representation or warranty except as expressly set forth in this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) Seller will not be required to provide any
information which it determines in good faith it may not provide to Acquiror
by reason of applicable Law (including any information in confidential
personnel files) or non-disclosure obligations under any Contract with third
parties, or which Seller reasonably determines in good faith constitutes
information protected by attorney-client or other similar privilege, (ii)
Seller will not be required to provide access to any Transferred Site to the
extent such access is prohibited by applicable Law or to any Retained Site,
and (iii) Seller will not be required to provide access to any of the
Transferred Sites for the purpose of Acquiror or its Representatives
performing any onsite invasive investigation of any environmental media
(including any Phase II investigation or study) or for any other purpose in a
manner that would reasonably be expected to result in non- _de minimis_

 



47  damage to such property, without Sellers written consent, which Seller may
grant or deny in its reasonable discretion. Acquiror will, and will cause its
Representatives to, abide by all reasonable protocols established by Seller
regarding any site visit, including providing Seller a copy of a certificate
of insurance listing Seller and its Subsidiaries as additional insureds, and
requiring such inspection to be supervised at all times by a Representative
of Seller. Each of Seller and Acquiror agrees that it will not, and will cause
its respective Representatives not to, use any information obtained pursuant
to this _Section_ _ _ _4.06_ for any purpose unrelated to this Agreement and
the Ancillary Agreements. All information provided by a Party to the other
Party hereunder will be kept confidential in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement. Acquiror will be responsible for any damage caused
by Acquiror or its Representatives to any Transferred Site as a result of any
access pursuant to this _Section_ _ _ _4.06(a)_ , and for any Liens that arise
or are filed against any member of the Seller Group or any Transferred Sites
in connection with any inspection, testing, investigation or survey performed
on the Transferred Sites by Acquiror or its designated representatives
pursuant to this _Section_ ___4.06(a)_ except if caused by (A) the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of any member of the Seller Group or any of
its Representatives or (B) any physical condition existing on the applicable
Transferred Site prior to Acquiror or its Representatives entry thereon
(except for any incremental damage or exacerbation of any existing condition
caused by Acquiror or its Representatives with respect to such physical
condition).

 

(b) During the Pre-Closing Period, without the prior written consent of Seller
(which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
Acquiror will not, and will cause the other members of the Acquiror Group and
their respective officers, directors, employees and other Representatives not
to, contact any Business Associates having material business relationships
with the Business in connection with or pertaining to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreements. In the event
Seller provides such consent, a management employee of Seller will at all
times be permitted to accompany the Acquirors Representative(s) to any
meeting with such Business Associate and to participate with the Acquirors
Representative(s) in any such discussions.

 

(c) If a member of the Seller Group elects to perform work to a Transferred
Site (" _Building Separation Work_ ") before Closing to separate the leased
premises or any Telecommunications Equipment Area under a Post-Closing Lease
from any other part of the building in which the leased premises are located,
then the relevant member of the Seller Group will perform the
Building Separation Work in accordance with Sections 10.02(f) and 10.02(g) of
the form of Post-Closing Lease attached hereto as Exhibit D-1 as if the Post-
Closing Lease for the location where the Building Separation Work is to be
done were in effect at such time. The Seller Group will be responsible for
all costs and expenses associated with the Building Separation Work (including
the costs of any repairs to the building systems and portions of the building
outside of the leased premises and the Telecommunications Equipment Areas as
a result of such Building Separation Work) and the relevant member of the
Seller Group will provide notice to Acquiror in advance of commencing the
Building Separation Work, with copies of 

 



48  reasonably detailed plans and specifications therefor to the extent such
plans and specifications are in the Seller Groups possession, but no consent
of Acquiror will be required. If any portion of the Building Separation Work
or other alterations remain outstanding as of the Closing Date, such work will
be subject to the terms of the applicable Post-Closing Lease. If the Building
Separation Work constitutes a Material Alteration (as such term may be
defined in the Form of Post-Closing Lease) or the Building Separation Work or
any other alteration to a Transferred Site by a member of the Seller Group is
reasonably expected to be incomplete as of the Closing Date and the
alteration would otherwise be subject to the consent of the landlord under the
applicable Post-Closing Lease if the Post-Closing Lease were in effect at such
time, the relevant member of the Seller Group will consult with Acquiror prior
to performing such work, including by delivering plans and specifications
related thereto to Acquiror and addressing any reasonable comments of Acquiror
prior to commencing such work. Notwithstanding the foregoing, without
Acquirors consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld), in no event
shall any Building Separation Work adversely impact any building operations,
involve any change to building systems, make any space not leased by Seller
Group under a Post-Closing Lease unusable for its intended purpose ( _e.g._ ,
strand colocation space), limit access by Acquiror Group or its customers to
common space, fire exits, telecommunications rooms, meet-me-rooms, fiber
vaults or similar areas or in any way degrade the value or use of the
applicable Transferred Site.

4.07 __Exchange of Information__. (a) _Exchange of Information_. Except as
otherwise provided in any Ancillary Agreement or as prohibited by applicable
Law, at any time after the Closing Date and until the sixth anniversary of the
Closing Date or such longer time as may be required to comply with applicable
Law, each Party will provide or cause to be provided to the other Party or its
Group, as soon as reasonably practicable after written request therefor, any
Information in the possession or under the control of such Party or its
Group that relates to the operation of the Business prior to the Closing and
that the requesting Party reasonably needs (i) to prepare its financial
statements and Tax Returns, (ii) to comply with reporting, disclosure, filing
or other requirements imposed on the requesting Party (including under
applicable securities and Tax Laws) by a Governmental Authority, (iii) for use
in any Action or in connection with audit, investigation, inquiries,
accounting, claims (including insurance claims) or other similar matters, in
each case other than claims or disputes between the Parties and their
Affiliates hereunder, (iv) to comply with its obligations under this Agreement
or any Ancillary Agreement, in each case other than in connection with any
dispute arising out of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, or (v) for
any other reasonable purposes other than claims or disputes between the
Parties and their Affiliates hereunder. The Party requesting Information will
reimburse the other Party for the reasonable out-of-pocket costs, if any, of
creating, gathering and copying such Information, to the extent that such
costs are incurred for the benefit of the requesting Party.

 

(b) _Ownership of Information_. Any Information owned by a Party that is
provided to the other Party pursuant to this  _Section_ _ _ _4.07_ will
remain the property of the Party that owned and provided such Information.
Each Party will, and will cause members of their respective Groups to,
maintain the confidentiality of any Information provided pursuant to this
_Section_ _ _ _4.07_ in accordance with _Section_ _ _ _4.13_.

 



49 (c) _Closing Statement_. In furtherance of and without limiting this
_Section 4.07_ , within 45 days after the Closing, Seller will deliver to
Acquiror an unaudited and unreviewed statement of Acquired Assets and Assumed
Liabilities for the Business as of the Closing Date, which will include a
fixed asset rollforward ( _i.e._ , book cost and accumulated depreciation)
from the most recent fiscal quarter end prior to the Closing Date.

4.08  _ _Privileged Communications__. As to all communications among counsel
for Seller and/or its Affiliates (including Jones Day and in-house counsel of
Seller and/or its Affiliates), Seller and any Affiliate of Seller that
relate in any way to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or to any Excluded Assets, Excluded Liabilities or Excluded Business
(collectively, the " _Privileged Communications_ "), the attorney-client
privilege and the expectation of client confidence belongs to Seller and may
be controlled by Seller and will not pass to or be claimed by Acquiror, any
Acquired Entity or any of their respective Affiliates. The Privileged
Communications are the property of Seller, and from and after the Closing
none of Acquiror, any Acquired Entity, any other Affiliate of Acquiror or any
Person purporting to act on behalf of or through Acquiror (including any
Continuing Employee), any Acquired Entity or any other Affiliate of Acquiror
will seek to obtain such communications, whether by seeking a waiver of the
attorney-client privilege or through other means. Acquiror further agrees that
neither Acquiror nor any of its Affiliates (including any Acquired Entity) or
any of their respective successors or assigns may use or rely on any such
Privileged Communications in any Action against or involving any of the
Parties after the Closing, and Acquiror waives and will not assert, and agree
to cause its Affiliates (including any Acquired Entity) to waive and not to
assert, any attorney-client privilege with respect to such Privileged
Communication. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute
arises between Acquiror, any Acquired Entity or any of their Affiliates and a
third party (other than a Party or any of their respective Affiliates) after
the Closing, Acquiror may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent
disclosure of confidential communications by counsel for Seller or the Seller
Group to such third party; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither Acquiror nor
any of its Affiliates may waive such privilege without the prior written
consent of Seller.

 

4.09 __Nonsolicitation__. (a) Except as otherwise mutually agreed by the
Parties, Seller agrees that for a period from the date of this Agreement
until the date that is six months after the Closing Date, it will not, and
will cause the other members of the Seller Group not to, (i) solicit or
request any other Person to solicit any Continuing Employee to leave the
employment of Acquiror or another member of the Acquiror Group or to accept
any position or employment with the Seller Group, except for general
solicitations of employment not targeted towards the Continuing Employees, or
(ii) to the extent permitted by applicable law, employ (directly or
indirectly as a contractor) any Continuing Employee who has voluntarily
separated from employment with Acquiror or another member of the Acquiror
Group within the immediately preceding six months,  _provided_ that after the
six-month anniversary of the voluntary separation of such Continuing Employee,
Seller or any other member of the Seller Group may employ or retain as a
contractor such individual in its sole discretion.

 



50 (b) Except as otherwise mutually agreed by the Parties, Acquiror agrees that
for a period from the date of this Agreement, or, with respect to the
restrictions set forth in clause (i)(B) below, from the first day an
individual is included in _Section 4.09(b)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter,
until the date that is six months after the Closing Date, it will not, and
will cause the other members of the Acquiror Group not to, (i) solicit or
request any other Person to solicit (A) any officer of Seller or its
Subsidiaries who works in a business similar to the Business or who otherwise
negotiated or participated in the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or any Ancillary Agreement or (B) Sellers or another member of the Seller
Groups agents or contractors listed on _Section 4.09(b)(i)_ of the Seller
Disclosure Letter (which _Section 4.09(b)(i)_ may be updated by Seller from
time to time) who are or have been directly involved in supporting activities
relating to the effecting of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or any Ancillary Agreement (such as pre-signing diligence or pre-closing
readiness), _provided_ , that Acquiror shall be permitted to hire the
companies that employ such individuals but not the individual agents or
contractors who represented Seller or another member of the Seller Group, to
leave such employment or to accept any other position or employment with
Acquiror or its Affiliates except for general solicitations of employment not
targeted toward employees, agents or contractors of the Seller Group, (ii) to
the extent permitted by applicable law, employ directly the " _Restricted
Individuals_ ," defined for purposes of this Agreement as (A) any employee of
the Seller Group who has voluntarily separated from employment with Seller or
another member of the Seller Group within the immediately preceding six
months, _provided_ that after the six-month anniversary of the voluntary
separation of any such employee, Acquiror or another member of the Acquiror
Group may employ or retain as a contractor such individual in its sole
discretion, or (B) any Person set forth in _Section 4.09(b)(ii)_ of the Seller
Disclosure Letter who Acquiror has determined prior to the date of this
Agreement was not eligible for an offer of employment with a member of the
Acquiror Group in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, or (iii) to the extent permitted by applicable Law, employ the
Restricted Individuals indirectly as independent contractors unless the
Restricted Individual is engaged by a third party contractor that is not (A)
controlled by or affiliated with a current or former employee of Seller or
another member of the Seller Group or (B) solicited by Acquiror or another
member of the Acquiror Group to hire the Restricted Individual, or solicit the
Restricted Individual using a job description unique to Seller or another
member of the Seller Group. In no event shall Acquiror or another member of
the Acquiror Group directly or indirectly solicit or hire as a contractor any
individual it knows or should have known is a Restricted Individual.

 

4.10 __Termination and Settlement of Intercompany Agreements and Support
Services__. (a) Except as contemplated by _Section_ _ _ _4.04_ and _Section_
_ _ _4.10(b)_ , the Acquired Entities or the Business, on the one hand, and
Seller, on behalf of itself and each other member of the Seller Group (other
than the Acquired Entities), on the other hand, will terminate any and all
Contracts between or among any of the Acquired Entities or the

 



51  Business, on the one hand, and Seller or any member of the Seller Group
(other than the Acquired Entities), on the other hand (such Contracts, the "
_Affiliate Contracts_ "), effective without further action as of the Closing.
No such Contract (including any provision thereof which purports to survive
termination) will be of any further force or effect after the Closing and all
parties will be released from all Liabilities thereunder. Each Party will, at
the reasonable request of any other Party, take, or cause to be taken, such
other actions as may be necessary to effect the foregoing.

 

(b) The provisions of _Section_ _ _ _4.10(_ _a)_ will not apply to any
Contracts listed in  _Section_ _ _ _4.10(b)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter
(such Contracts, the " _Continuing Affiliate Contracts_ "), the Ancillary
Agreements, the Transfer Documents or any other Contract expressly
contemplated by this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement to be entered into
or continued by any of the Parties or any of the members of their respective
Groups. To the extent any of the Continuing Affiliate Contracts applies to
both the Business or the Continuing Employees, on the one hand, and any
Excluded Business or employees of Seller or its Affiliates other than the
Continuing Employees, on the other hand, Seller will, and will cause its
Subsidiaries to, split such Continuing Affiliate Contracts such that the
portion of each such Contract, to the extent relating to the Business or the
Continuing Employees, may be assigned and transferred to Acquiror (or another
member of the Acquiror Group) in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby (such portions of such Continuing Affiliate Contracts, together with
any Continuing Affiliate Contracts relating exclusively to the Business or the
Continuing Employees, the " _Transferred Affiliate Contracts_ "); _provided_
,  _however_ , that in connection with splitting such Continuing Affiliate
Contracts, neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates may amend in any material
respect any term of such Continuing Affiliate Contracts that relates to the
Business.

 

(c) Seller will use reasonable best efforts to cause all of the receivables,
payables, loans and other accounts, rights and Liabilities between any
Acquired Entity or the Business, on the one hand, and Seller or another member
of the Seller Group (other than the Acquired Entities), on the other hand, in
existence as of immediately prior to the Closing (but excluding all such items
pursuant to or arising out of any Transferred Affiliate Contracts)
(collectively, the " _Intercompany Accounts_ ") to be settled such that, as of
the Closing, there are no Intercompany Accounts outstanding. If, despite such
efforts, there is any outstanding balance in the Intercompany Accounts as of
the Closing, the net balance of such Intercompany Accounts will be deemed to
be a "payable" or "receivable," as applicable, and will be taken into account
in determining the prorations pursuant to _Section_ _1.11_.

(d) Acquiror acknowledges that the Business currently receives from Seller and
its Affiliates certain administrative and corporate services and benefits of
a type generally provided to other businesses and Subsidiaries of Seller,
including accounting, insurance, banking, personnel, legal, communications,
information technology, real estate, risk management, sourcing tax and
treasury services. Seller and Acquiror acknowledge that, except as provided in
the Transition Services Agreement or in the Transferred Affiliate Contracts,
all such support services will cease at Closing, and all agreements and
arrangements (whether or not in writing) in respect thereof will terminate as
of the Closing Date, with no further obligation of any party thereto.

 



52 4.11 __Use of__ _ _ __ _ _Business Names and Marks__. (a) " _Seller Names and
Marks_ " means the names and marks (in any style or design) used in connection
with the Business prior to the Closing, and any Trademark derived from,
confusingly similar to or including any of the foregoing, other than the
Transferred Marks. Subject to the terms and conditions of this _Section_ _ _
_4.11_ , Seller, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates as necessary, hereby
grants to Acquiror and the Acquired Entities (i) a limited, non-transferable,
non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, royalty-free license, for the six-month
period following the Closing Date (the " _Transition Period_ "), to use the
Seller Names and Marks in connection with the Business, and (ii) a limited,
royalty-free license to use the Seller Names and Marks as necessary to carry
out Acquirors obligations under _Section 4.18_ with respect to any Government
Contracts that have not been novated or otherwise transferred to the Acquiror
Group. Except as necessary to carry out Acquirors obligations under _Section
4.18_ with respect to any Government Contracts that have not been novated or
otherwise transferred to the Acquiror Group, Acquiror will use Commercially
Reasonable Efforts to transition from use of the Seller Names and Marks as
soon as reasonably practicable and in any event prior to expiration of the
Transition Period. Except as expressly provided in this _Section_ _ _ _4.11_
, Seller reserves for itself and its Affiliates all rights, title and interest
in the Seller Names and Marks, and no other rights, title or interest therein
are granted to any Acquired Entity, member of the Acquiror Group or any of
their respective Affiliates, whether by implication, estoppel or otherwise.
All use of the Seller Names and Marks by the Acquired Entities will inure to
the benefit of the owner of the Seller Names and Marks.

 

(b) As soon as practicable following the Closing Date, and in any event prior
to the expiration of the Transition Period, Acquiror will, and will cause the
other members of the Acquiror Group (including the Acquired Entities) to, (i)
change the name of any Acquired Entity whose name includes any Seller Names
and Marks to a name that does not include any of the Seller Names and Marks,
(ii) remove all Seller Names and Marks from building signage and vehicles
included in the Acquired Assets, (iii) remove all Seller Names and Marks from
internet or other electronic communications, including internet domain names
and the content of any internet websites within the Acquired Assets, and
remove all links to any internet domains of Seller or any of its Affiliates
from any of the foregoing, and (iv) remove or irreversibly cover or modify all
Sellers Names and Marks from or destroy any promotional materials and similar
materials included in the Acquired Assets that bear any of the Seller Names
and Marks.

 

(c) In no event will any of the Acquired Entities use, and Acquiror will not
use, and will cause the other members of the Acquiror Group to not use, any
of the Seller Names and Marks after the Closing in any manner or for any
purpose other than in the same or substantially same manner that such Seller
Names and Marks were used by the Business prior to the Closing.

 



53 (d) The license granted under this _Section_ _ _ _4.11_ may be terminated
by written notice if Acquiror or any Acquired Entity is in material breach of
any provision hereof that remains uncured for more than fifteen days after
written notice thereof from Seller. Upon such termination of the license
granted hereunder for any reason, Acquiror and its Affiliates will not use
any of the Seller Names and Marks.

4.12 __Insurance__ _ _ and Casualty Matters__. (a) The Acquiror Group will
have no rights with respect to any insurance policies of the Seller Group,
except as expressly set forth in _Section_ ___1.03(_ _e)_ , this _Section_
_ _ _4.12_ or in any Post-Closing Lease.

(b) If, prior to Closing, all or any portion of the Transferred Sites are
damaged or destroyed by fire or other casualty or taken as a result of any
condemnation or eminent domain proceeding, Seller will (i) promptly notify
Acquiror upon learning thereof, (ii) use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to
file, notice or otherwise continue to prosecute claims for recovery against
the relevant insurers under the applicable Business Insurance Policy for any
such damage or destruction (it being understood that any such claim will be
subject to all of the terms and conditions of the applicable Business
Insurance Policy), and (iii) assign (to the extent assignable, including by
adding Acquiror or an appropriate member of the Acquiror Group as an
additional insured in respect of the Acquired Assets eligible for coverage)
and remit to Acquiror at the Closing (unless such proceeds are received by
Seller or its Affiliates after the Closing in which case the same will be
remitted to Acquiror promptly following receipt thereof), the insurance or
condemnation proceeds (if any) payable to Seller or any of its Affiliates as
a result of such casualty or condemnation, net of any reasonable out-of-pocket
costs and expenses incurred by Seller or its Affiliates in connection with the
foregoing, including reasonable out-of-pocket collection costs and reasonable
out-of-pocket costs and expenses of replacement, restoration or repair of such
Transferred Site (such net amount, the " _Net Casualty Recovery_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that in lieu of remitting any such recovered
insurance or condemnation proceeds received by Seller or its Affiliates at or
prior to the Closing, Seller may elect to credit against the Global Purchase
Price an amount equal to the Net Casualty Recovery. Seller will, and will
cause its Affiliates to, reasonably cooperate after the Closing to collect any
proceeds or awards in the event of a condemnation or casualty that occurred
prior to the Closing, and to execute, acknowledge and deliver such further
acts, documents and notices as may be reasonably required in order to convey
such proceeds or awards to Acquiror after the Closing; _provided_ , _however_
, in each case Seller has no obligation to incur any cost or liability
(other than costs incurred by Seller or its Affiliates that are subject to
deduction from the insurance or casualty proceeds remitted to Acquiror
pursuant to the terms hereof and the deductible under the Business Insurance
Policy).

 

(c) Nothing in this _Section_ ___4.12_ will be construed to limit or otherwise
alter in any way each Partys indemnification obligations, whether pursuant
to this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement, by operation of law or otherwise.

(d) This Agreement is not intended as an attempted assignment of any policy
of insurance or as a Contract of insurance and will not be construed to waive
any right or remedy of any member of the Seller Group in respect of any
insurance policy or any other Contract or policy of insurance.

 



54 4.13 __Confidentiality__. (a) Prior to the Closing, Acquiror will, and will
cause its Representatives to, treat all nonpublic information obtained in
connection with this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby as confidential in accordance with the terms
of the Confidentiality Agreement. The terms of the Confidentiality Agreement
are hereby incorporated by reference and will continue in full force and
effect until the Closing.

 

(b) The Parties acknowledge that in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the Parties and their Affiliates
have disclosed and will disclose to each other Information which the Parties
consider proprietary and confidential (" _Confidential Information_ "),
including all nonpublic information obtained in connection with this
Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby. The Parties agree that, after the Closing, nonpublic Information
that constitutes or relates to an Acquired Asset or an Assumed Liability will
be Confidential Information of Acquiror, and Acquiror will not be subject to
this _Section_ _ _ _4.13(_ _b)_ with respect to such information, and Seller
will be deemed to be the Receiving Party of such Confidential Information for
purposes of this _Section_ _ _ _4.13(b)_. Each Party receiving Confidential
Information (including such Partys Affiliates, the " _Receiving Party_ ")
agrees that, for a period of two years following the Closing or the earlier
termination of this Agreement, as applicable:

(i) any Confidential Information disclosed by the other Party (including such
Partys Affiliates, the " _Disclosing Party_ ") will be received and held in
confidence by the Receiving Party and that such Receiving Party will not,
without the prior written consent of the Party from whom such Confidential
Information was obtained disclose, divulge or permit any Person to obtain any
Confidential Information disclosed by the Disclosing Party (whether or not
such Confidential Information is in written or tangible form), other than
to Subsidiaries of the Receiving Party and their employees, agents and
financing sources, in each case, who have a need to know such Confidential
Information and who are bound by duties of confidentiality and non-use
obligations with respect to such Confidential Information no less protective
of the Disclosing Party than those set forth herein;

(ii) the Receiving Party will keep the Confidential Information in confidence
and will take such steps as may be reasonably necessary to prevent the
disclosure of Confidential Information to others, including at least those
measures that the Receiving Party takes to protect its own confidential
information; and

(iii) the Receiving Party will use the Information only in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement to
perform its and its Groups obligations or to exercise its rights under this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement.

 



55 (c) The commitments set forth above will not extend to any portion of
Confidential Information (i) which was already known to the Receiving Party
at the time of disclosure or is or was independently developed by the
Receiving Party without using any Confidential Information of the Disclosing
Party (other than, after the Closing, any member of Seller Group with respect
to Confidential Information related to the Business), (ii) which is or becomes
generally available to the public other than as a result of an act or omission
by the Receiving Party, (iii) which is received on a non-confidential basis
from any third party not known to be subject to any confidentiality obligation
with respect thereto, or (iv) which is required to be disclosed by Law;
_provided_ , that with respect to any Information required to be disclosed by
Law, the Receiving Party provides reasonable prior written notice of such
required disclosure to the Disclosing Party following the Receiving Partys
knowledge of such requirement in order to provide the Disclosing Party with
an opportunity to prevent or limit such disclosure by seeking a protective
Order or other appropriate remedy at the sole expense of the Disclosing Party.
The Receiving Party agrees to cooperate with the Disclosing Party at
the Disclosing Partys expense in its efforts to obtain such a protective
Order or other appropriate remedy. In the event that such protective Order or
other remedy is not obtained, the Receiving Party will furnish only that
portion of the Confidential Information that it is advised by counsel it is
legally required to disclose and will exercise Commercially Reasonable Efforts
to obtain assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such
Confidential Information.

 

(d) From the date of this Agreement through the earlier of the Closing or the
termination of this Agreement, Seller agrees not to release or permit the
release of any Person (other than Acquiror and its Affiliates) from, or to
waive or permit the waiver of any provision of, any confidentiality or similar
agreement to which Seller or any of its Subsidiaries is a party with respect
to the Business.

severance and any other statutory obligations pursuant to applicable Law and
(ii) any employment contracts and/or agreements of the Colombia Business
Employees, in each case on terms and conditions at least as favorable to the
Colombia Business Employees as those existing as of the Closing Date. Colombia
Business Employees that continue employment with Hickory Colombia,
are collectively referred to herein as " _Colombia C_ _ontinuing Employees_."

 



57 (iv) __Continuing__ _ _Employees__ _._ The U.S. Continuing Employees, the
Brazil Continuing Employees, and the Colombia Continuing Employees are

(c) _Compensation_.

 

(i) __U.S. Continuing Employees__ _._ _ _ With respect to U.S. Continuing
Employees, for a period of one year following the Closing Date and subject to
their continued employment with Acquiror or a member of the Acquiror Group,
Acquiror will, or will cause another member of the Acquiror Group to, (A) pay
all such U.S. Continuing Employees at least the same rate of base cash salary
as was paid to each such U.S. Continuing Employee by Seller or the Seller
Group immediately prior to the Closing Date or the Delayed Transfer Date, as
applicable, (B) provide annual short-term incentive opportunities to each
such U.S. Continuing Employee comparable in the aggregate to the annual short-
term incentive opportunities provided to each such U.S. Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Closing Date or the Delayed Transfer Date,
as applicable, and (C) provide long-term incentive awards under Acquirors
(or another member of the Acquirors Group) long-term incentive (equity)
plan(s) to all such U.S. Continuing Employees who were eligible to receive
long-term incentive awards under Sellers long-term incentive (equity)
plan(s) immediately prior to the Closing Date or the Delayed Transfer Date, as
applicable, to the same extent and on the same basis as such awards are
provided to similarly situated employees of Acquiror or the Acquiror Group in
the United States.

(d) _Employee Benefits_.

 

(i) __U.S. Continuing Employees__.

 

(A) __U.S. Continuing Employees__. For one year following the Closing Date,
Acquiror will, or will cause another member of the Acquiror Group to,
continue to provide each U.S. Continuing Employee and, if and to the extent
applicable, dependents of such U.S. Continuing Employees, benefits which are
substantially comparable in the aggregate to those made available to
similarly situated employees of Acquiror or the Acquiror Group in the United
States.

(B) For all employment-related purposes (including, profit sharing, savings
and welfare plan eligibility and vesting, severance pay, incentive pay and
vacation pay), other than for the purposes of retiree medical benefits or
benefit accrual under any 

 



58  Acquiror retirement plan that is a defined benefit plan, each U.S.
Continuing Employee will receive from Acquiror full credit for all service
with Seller or the Seller Group prior to the Closing Date. Acquiror and the
Acquiror Group will have no liability with respect to any retiree medical plan
or similar benefits maintained by Seller or any other member of the Seller
Group.

 

(e) _Health and Welfare Plans for U.S. Continuing Employees_. Seller or one or
more Subsidiary of Seller maintain or contribute to health and welfare plans.
The health and welfare plans include, but are not limited to, plans providing
active severance and active health, dental and life insurance benefits, for
the benefit of eligible U.S. Business Employees and certain former employees
of the Business located in the United States who have retired as of the date
of this Agreement or will retire prior to the Closing Date or the Delayed
Transfer Date, as applicable (the " _U.S. Seller Welfare Plans_ "). As of the
Closing Date, each person who is a U.S. Continuing Employee or their dependent
on such date will cease to be covered under the U.S. Seller Welfare Plans.
Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, Seller and the
U.S. Seller Welfare Plans will be responsible for all Liabilities relating to
the U.S. Continuing Employees or their dependents under the U.S. Seller
Welfare Plans, including with respect to (i) former employees of the Business
located in the United States and (ii) U.S. Continuing Employees or their
dependents with respect to (A) medical, vision, or dental plan claims in

period prior to the Closing Date or the Delayed Transfer Date, as applicable,
and (D) any claims by U.S. Continuing Employees or their dependents that were
incurred prior to the Closing Date or the Delayed Transfer Date, as
applicable, under any long term care plans. For the avoidance of doubt, with
respect to any payments due to any U.S. Continuing Employee for short-term
disability, the obligations to make payments with respect to any period at or
after the Closing Date or the Delayed Transfer Date, as applicable, will be
the sole responsibility of Acquiror or the applicable Acquiror welfare benefit
plan (the " _U.S. Acquiror Welfare_ _Plan_ ").

 

(f) _Terms of Participation in U.S. Acquiror Welfare Plans_. Acquiror will
cause the U.S. Acquiror Welfare Plans to (i) waive all limitations as to
preexisting conditions, exclusions, service conditions and waiting period
limitations, and any evidence of insurability requirements applicable to any
U.S. Continuing Employees and their dependents other than such
limitations, exclusions, and conditions that were in effect with respect to
U.S. Continuing Employees and their dependents as of the Closing Date or the
Delayed Transfer Date, as applicable, in each case under the corresponding
U.S. Seller Welfare Plans and (ii) honor any expenses incurred by U.S.
Continuing Employees that have been applied toward deductibles, out-of-pocket
maximums and co-payments incurred by U.S. Continuing Employees and their
dependents under the corresponding U.S. Seller Welfare Plans in satisfying
the applicable deductibles, out-of-pocket expenses or co-payments under such
U.S. Seller Welfare Plans for the calendar

 



59  year in which the Closing Date or the Delayed Transfer Date, as applicable,
occurs. With respect to U.S. Continuing Employees, each U.S. Acquiror Welfare
Plan will provide that all service, all compensation and all other factors
affecting benefit determinations that, as of the Closing Date or the Delayed
Transfer Date, as applicable, were recognized under the corresponding U.S.
Seller Welfare Plan (for periods immediately before the Closing Date or the
Delayed Transfer Date, as applicable) will receive full recognition and credit
and be taken into account under such U.S. Acquiror Welfare Plan to the same
extent as though arising under such U.S. Acquiror Welfare Plan, except to the
extent that duplication of benefits would result.

(g) _Time-Off Benefits_. Seller shall be responsible for payment of accrued
but unused vacation time, sick time and other time-off benefits (together, the
" _Time-Off Benefits_ ") as of the Closing Date or the Delayed Transfer Date,
as applicable, as well as any other accrued statutory or contractual benefit
due to the U.S. Continuing Employees related to the services rendered to the
Seller Group prior to the Closing Date. Acquiror will provide U.S. Continuing

the aggregate to those made available to similarly situated employees of
Acquiror or the Acquiror Group in the United States.

respect to such accounts through the Closing Date or the Delayed Transfer
Date, as applicable. Seller will provide to Acquiror, within 30 calendar days
following the Closing Date or the Delayed Transfer Date, as applicable, all
necessary accounting; _provided_ , _however_ , if Acquiror notifies Seller of
any deficiencies in the information provided, Seller shall have an additional
90 calendar days to provide such information:

(i) Acquiror will take all actions necessary and legally permissible to ensure
that, as of the Closing or the Delayed Transfer Date, as applicable, it
includes the FRP Participants in the Acquiror Plan that constitutes a Code
Section 125 plan and any flexible spending arrangements thereunder ("
_Acquiror FSA_ "). Acquiror will further take all actions necessary and
legally permissible to amend Acquirors FSA to provide that as of the Closing
Date or the Delayed Transfer Date, as applicable, and for the plan year in
which the Closing Date or the Delayed Transfer Date, as applicable, occurs,
but not for any specific time thereafter, subject to any collective bargaining
obligations, (A) the FRP Participants will become participants in Acquirors
FSA as of the beginning of the FRPs plan year and at the level of coverage
provided under the FRP, (B) the FRP Participants salary reduction elections
will be taken into account for the remainder of Acquirors FSA plan year as if
made under Acquirors FSA, and (C) Acquirors FSA will reimburse medical
expenses incurred by the FRP Participants at any time during the FRPs plan
year (including, but not limited to, claims incurred prior to the Closing or
the Delayed Transfer Date, as applicable, but unpaid prior to the Closing

Participants election and reduced by amounts previously reimbursed by the
FRP.

the FRP to provide that the FRP Participants will cease to be eligible for
reimbursements from the FRP as of the Closing Date or the Delayed Transfer
Date, as applicable.

 

(iii) As soon as practicable following the Closing Date or the Delayed
Transfer Date, as applicable, Seller will transfer to Acquiror, and Acquiror
agrees to accept, those amounts (plus all related individual participant

the FRP of the FRP Participants and the transfer of such amounts will
take into account on a net basis participants payroll deductions and claims
paid through the Closing Date or the Delayed Transfer Date, as applicable.

 

(iv) Except for the FRP account balances described in this _Section_ _ _
_4.14(_ _h)_ , nothing in this Agreement will require Seller, any member of
the Seller Group or any U.S. Seller Welfare Plans to transfer Assets or
reserves with respect to the U.S. Seller Welfare Plans, including, but not
limited to, any plan providing severance, post-retirement health, dental or
life insurance benefits, to Acquiror, any other member of the Acquiror Group,
or the U.S. Acquiror Welfare Plans.

transferred from any U.S. tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan

have terminated employment with Seller for purposes of determining entitlement
to a distribution from any pension or retirement plan maintained by Seller or
any other member of the Seller Group. Acquiror and the Acquiror Group will
have no liability with respect to any pension, retirement or retiree medical
plan maintained by Seller or any other member of the Seller Group. Effective
as of the Closing Date or the Delayed Transfer Date, as applicable, and
subject to applicable Law and plan requirements, U.S. Continuing Employees
will be eligible to effect a "direct rollover" (as described in Section

Liabilities under Brazilian Law to provide coverage to any Former Business

continued employment. This Agreement will not limit the ability of Acquiror to
change, at any time after the Closing and in its sole discretion,
any Continuing Employees position, compensation or benefits for performance-
related, business or other reasons, in accordance with applicable Law, or
require any member of Acquiror Group to continue the employment of any
Continuing Employee for any particular period of time after the Closing Date,
_provided_ that Acquiror or another member of the Acquiror Group will bear all

(s) _Cooperation_.

 

(i) __Cooperation in Benefits, Plan, and Other Employee Transition__. Seller
will administer its Compensation and Benefit Plans with respect to the
Continuing Employees in the ordinary course between the date of this Agreement
and the Closing Date or the Delayed Transfer Date, as applicable. With respect
to the Delayed Transfer Employees, from the date of this Agreement until the
Delayed Transfer Date, Seller will not, without the prior written consent of
Acquiror, (A) increase the compensation of such Delayed Transfer Employees
individually or in the aggregate, except in the ordinary course consistent
with past practice or as required pursuant to the terms of the Collective
Bargaining Agreements or any agreements or plans currently in effect and
listed in _Section_ _2.11(c)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that Seller may increase benefits for Delayed Transfer Employees
as a result of the amendment of any Compensation and Benefit Plan to the
extent such increase applies generally to participants under such Compensation
and Benefit Plan, including any employees who are similarly situated to the
Delayed Transfer Employees but who are not Delayed Transfer Employees, (B)
enter into any new employment or severance agreements with any such Delayed
Transfer Employee (it being understood and agreed that Seller will not be
restricted from making changes to severance programs that affect Sellers
employees generally, unless such changes disproportionately affect Delayed
Transfer Employees as compared to other of Sellers employees), (C) without
first consulting with Acquiror, hire any new Delayed Transfer Employee prior
to the Delayed Transfer Date, except for a new hire replacing a former Delayed
Transfer Employee whose base compensation is no more than 15% higher than the
former Delayed Transfer Employee the new employee is replacing, or (D)
terminate any Delayed Transfer Employee except for cause. To the extent any
Delayed Transfer Employee resigns or is terminated for cause, Seller will use
Commercially Reasonable Efforts to identify a replacement candidate if
necessary, subject to any required review and approval by the government
customer. Without limitation, the Parties cooperation under this Agreement
will include Seller (and its employees and agents) acting to provide Acquiror
(and its employees and agents) with all information that is reasonably
requested by Acquiror in connection with meeting, and reasonably necessary for
Acquiror to comply with, its obligations under this Agreement, including but
not limited to, administering Acquirors ongoing

 



64  benefit plans for U.S. Business Employees and assessing appropriate
insurances for the period on and after the Closing Date. With respect to any
proposed changes to the Compensation and Benefit Plans applicable to Business
Employees following the date of this Agreement, Seller will provide Acquiror
information regarding such proposed changes prior to implementation of such
changes for informational purposes only. The Parties cooperation under this
Agreement will also include Acquiror (and its employees and agents) acting to
provide Seller (and its employees and agents) with all information, on a
timely and, as appropriate, recurring basis, that is reasonably requested and
necessary or appropriate for Seller to administer any plans applicable to
Continuing Employees with respect to Continuing Employees that are
participants in such plans.

 

(ii) __Communications__. Acquiror will not make any written communications
(including websites or other passive communication channels) that are

Subsidiaries pertaining to compensation or benefit matters that are affected
by the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without Sellers written
consent.

(iii) __Cooperation in Labor and Employment Disputes__. Seller will
timely consult Acquiror and obtain Acquirors consent with respect to the
resolution of any employment claims relating to the Business Employees
(including workers compensation, discrimination, payroll and wage and hour
claims) that are resolved following the date of this Agreement and within six
months before the date that Seller reasonably anticipates to be the Closing
Date or the Delayed Transfer Date, as applicable, and that have a potential
Liability to be assumed by Acquiror in excess of $5,000,000. For the
avoidance of doubt, except as otherwise expressly provided in the immediately
preceding sentence and in _Section_ ___4.01_ , until the Closing Date, or the
Delayed Transfer Date, as applicable, Seller will retain sole decision-making
authority with respect to all employment matters.

(iv) __Designated__ _ _ Employees__. To facilitate the purposes of _Section_
_ _ _4.14(s)(ii)_ and (iii) above, Seller and Acquiror will each designate an
employee who has knowledge of matters involving employment, labor relations,
compensation and benefits for their respective employers (the " _Designated
Employees_ "). Each Designated Employee will make him/herself available for
direct contact by the other partys Designated Employee during normal business
hours. It is understood that these contacts and communications will be
reasonably arranged to allow the timely exchange of relevant information
without undue disruption to the Designated Employees other responsibilities.

 

(v) __Changes in Employment Policies and Procedures__. Seller will promptly
notify Acquiror of any material changes in its hiring, classification or
other employment policies and procedures affecting the status of Business
Employees (including hiring employees who may become Continuing Employees)
between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date. 

 



65 (t) _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_.

 

(i) Nothing in this _Section_ _ _ _4.14_ will confer upon any person (nor any
beneficiary thereof) any rights under or with respect to any plan, program,
agreement or arrangement described in or contemplated by this _Section_ _ _
_4.14_ and each person (and any beneficiary thereof) will be entitled to look
only to the express terms of any such plan, program, agreement or arrangement
for his, her or its rights thereunder. The purpose of this _Section_ _ _
_4.14_ is to specify the respective potential responsibilities and obligations
of Seller and Acquiror (and their respective affiliates) as between each
other, but it does not affect, impair, enhance, modify, construe or interpret
the rights of any employee of Seller under or in respect of any such plan,
program, agreement or arrangement.

 

(ii) Nothing in this _Section_ _ _ _4.14_ will create any right of a Person to
object or to refuse to assent to the assumption of or succession to, by any
member of the Acquiror Group or the Acquiror Group, any benefit plan,
collective bargaining agreement or other agreement relating to conditions of
employment, termination of employment, severance or employee benefits, nor
will this _Section_ _ _ _4.14_ be construed as recognizing that any such
rights exist.

 

(iii) Nothing in this _Section_ _ _ _4.14_ will amend or will be construed to
amend, or interpret the terms of, any plan, program, agreement or arrangement
described in or contemplated by this _Section_ _ _ _4.14_ (other than to
change the sponsor of a plan in accordance with the express terms hereof).

 

4.15 __WARN Act__. Acquiror will, and will cause each member of the Acquiror
Group to, (a) provide any required notice under the Worker Adjustment and
Retraining Notification Act or any other similar Law (the " _WARN Act_ ") with
respect to U.S. Continuing Employees and (b) otherwise comply with the WARN
Act with respect to any "plant closing" or "mass layoff (as defined in the
WARN Act) or group termination or similar event affecting Continuing Employees
occurring on or after the Closing Date.

 

4.16 __Further Assurances__. Without limiting any other provision of this
Agreement or in any Ancillary Agreement, each Party will cooperate with each
other and use (and will cause their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates to
use) its Commercially Reasonable Efforts, prior to, at and after the Closing
Date, to take, or to cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or to cause
to be done, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part
under applicable Law or contractual obligations, in each case to consummate
and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the

conditions precedent to the obligations of any of the Parties hereto, (b)
negotiating and finalizing all Ancillary Agreements on terms consistent with

(e) executing and delivering instruments (including direction letters to
payors under Transferred Contracts), (f) if applicable, forming legal

granted, and (g) adopting plans or plan amendments;  _provided_ , _however_ ,
that (i) with respect to the matters that are the subject of _Section_ _ _
_4.04_ , such matters will be governed by that Section instead of this
_Section_ _ _ _4.16_ , (ii) with respect to the matters that are the subject
of _Section_ ___1.07_ , such matters will be governed by that Section instead
of this _Section_ _ _ _4.16_ from and after the Closing, and (iii) except as
otherwise provided in _Section_ _ _ _4.02_ , neither Party will be required to
make any non- _de minimis_ payments, incur any non- _de minimis_ Liability
(including any guarantees or other non-monetary security) or offer or grant
any non- _de minimis_ accommodation (financial or otherwise) to any third
party in connection with obtaining any Consent or Governmental Approval.

other encumbrances affecting all or any portion of the Transferred Sites and
(ii) deliver such assignments of declarants rights or other assignments,
documents or instruments as are reasonably necessary to (x) Convey all of
Sellers or the applicable Subsidiarys rights with respect to the Transferred
Sites pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (y)
clear any ministerial title matters, and (D) to the extent the Acquiror Group
has not obtained all of the Permits (including environmental Permits) required
for the ownership of the Acquired Assets or the operation of the Business
prior to the Closing, Acquiror will, and will cause the applicable members of
the Acquiror Group to, use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to obtain all such
Permits as soon as practicable after the Closing.

 



67 4.17 __Release of Seller Guaranties__. As promptly as practicable, Acquiror
will use reasonable best efforts to replace or secure back-to-back
arrangements with respect to the surety bonds, guarantees, indemnities,
letters of credit, letters of comfort and other similar obligations issued by
any member of the Seller Group in respect of the Business that are identified
in _Section_ _ _ _4.17_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter (the " _Seller
Guaranties_ "), in each case effective as of the Closing Date, and Seller will
provide reasonable cooperation in connection with Acquirors efforts;
_provided_ _,_ _however_ , that in no event will Acquiror be obligated to
obtain, replace or secure any such back-to-back arrangements to the extent
such arrangements support obligations that are Excluded Liabilities. In the
event the actions contemplated by the preceding sentence are not completed by
the Closing Date, (i) Acquiror will indemnify and hold harmless the Seller
Group from and against all Losses incurred by any member of the Seller Group
as a result of such failure and from and against any continuing obligations
and liabilities under any such Seller Guaranties; _provided_ that the
foregoing indemnity shall apply only to Losses that are not Excluded

Guaranties, and Seller will continue to provide reasonable cooperation in

permit the Business or any member of the Acquiror Group to, renew or extend
the term of, or increase the obligation under, or transfer to a third party,

Group is or would reasonably be expected to be liable under any Seller
Guaranty (other than any renewals or other such actions taken by the
counterparty to any such Contract pursuant to the terms thereof), and (iv) if
any member of the Seller Group has performance obligations under any such
Seller Guaranty in respect of the Business, Acquiror will perform, or cause
another member of the Acquiror Group to perform, such obligations on behalf

4.18 __Novation of Government Contracts__. (a) Prior to the Closing, Acquiror
and Seller will use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to cooperate with each
other and prepare a novation agreement in the form required by FAR 42.1204 for
each Government Contract that is a Transferred Customer Contract and Seller,
no later than 30 days after signing the Agreement, will notify the contracting
officer responsible for processing and executing the novation agreement
pursuant to FAR 42.1202 of the transaction and intention to novate
the Transferred Customer Contract to Acquiror. Prior to the Closing or
promptly thereafter, Seller will deliver such information as required under
the FAR to the relevant contracting officer at the appropriate Governmental
Authority in connection with the novation of such Government Contracts.
Following the Closing, Acquiror and Seller will continue to cooperate and use
Commercially Reasonable Efforts to finalize the novation agreements for such
Government Contracts.

 

(b) With respect to each Government Contract that is a Shared Customer
Contract, as soon as practicable after the Closing Date, Acquiror will use
Commercially Reasonable Efforts to establish and enter into, or cause another
member of the Acquiror Group to establish and enter into, a new Contract
(including new GSA schedule) with the applicable Governmental Authority with
respect to products and services under such Government Contract to the extent
relating to the Business (such new Contracts, together with any Governmental
Contracts that are Transferred Customer Contracts, the " _Transferred
Government Contracts_ "). Seller will use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to
assist Acquiror in connection with the actions contemplated by this _Section_
_4.18(_ _b)_.

 



68 (c) Notwithstanding the Closing, Seller will under applicable Law (including
FAR) remain the prime contractor to the government customers under any
Government Contract pending the government customers execution of a Novation
and/or Change of Name agreement or a new Contract to formally acknowledge and
agree to Acquiror or another member of the Acquiror Group as the successor to
Seller or its Subsidiary with respect to such Government Contract and related
accounts. From and after the Closing, subject to the services to be provided
by the Seller Group pursuant to the TSA, Acquiror will, and will cause the
applicable members of the Acquiror Group to, perform all of the duties of
Seller or other members of the Seller Group to the maximum extent permissible
under each Government Contract that is a Transferred Customer Contract
(excluding Secured Contracts) or otherwise as a subcontractor to Seller, and
in each case in accordance with the terms of such Government Contract
(including all provisions contained or incorporated by reference therein
imposing any administrative, regulatory, compliance, audit or legal
requirements under applicable Laws, including FAR (such provisions,
collectively, the " _Government Compliance Provisions_ ")) or, in the event
the relevant portions of such Government Contract have not been provided to
Acquiror, in compliance with the Colocation Agreement as though Acquiror and
its Affiliates were providing services with respect to such Government
Contract pursuant to the Colocation Agreement, until the earliest to occur of
(i) the novation of such Transferred Customer Contract to Acquiror, (ii) the
execution of a new Contract with the relevant government customer in respect
of the services provided by the Business under such Transferred Customer
Contract, (iii) the full performance of the obligations of the Business under
such Transferred Customer Contract, and (iv) the expiration or termination of
such Transferred Customer Contract. Similarly, from and after the
Closing, subject to the services to be provided by the Seller Group under the
TSA, Acquiror will serve as a subcontractor, sub-licensor or sub-lessor (as
applicable) of Seller or its Affiliates under each Government Contract that is
a Shared Customer Contract (excluding Secured Contracts, if any) and perform
all of the duties of Seller permissible to be performed by Acquiror under such
Contract to the extent relating to the Business, in each case in accordance
with the terms of such Government Contract (including all Government
Compliance Provisions) applicable to the services provided by the Business or,
in the event the relevant portions of such Government Contract have not been
provided to Acquiror, in compliance with the Colocation Agreement as though
Acquiror and its Affiliates were providing services with respect to such
Government Contracts pursuant to the Colocation Agreement, until the earliest
to occur of (i) the novation of the portion of such Shared Customer
Contract to the extent relating to the Business to Acquiror, (ii) the
execution of a new Contract between Acquiror and the relevant government
customer in respect of the services provided by the Business under such Shared
Customer Contract, (iii) the full performance of the obligations of the
Business under such Shared Customer Contract, and (iv) the expiration or
termination of such Shared Customer Contract. Seller may request audit of
invoices, vouchers or other relevant documentation issued or maintained by
Acquiror in respect of the Government Contracts pursuant to FAR 52.215-2.

 



69 (d) Acquiror acknowledges and agrees that it cannot perform any Secured
Contracts or access any classified materials without a facility security
clearance and that none of the Secured Contracts will be novated or otherwise
transferred to Acquiror until Acquiror obtains a facility security clearance
at the level required by the applicable Secured Contract. Acquiror will use
Commercially Reasonable Efforts to obtain, or cause the applicable members of
the Acquiror Group to obtain, prior to the Closing, all facility security
clearances and access authorizations necessary to (x) perform the Transferred
Government Contracts and safeguard any classified information required to be
stored or maintained at any Transferred Site, (y) sponsor the individual
security clearances of the Continuing Employees (including the
Delayed Transfer Employees) following the Closing, and (z) own the Acquired
Assets, assume the Assumed Liabilities and operate the Business. In the event
that the facility security clearances described in the preceding sentence have
not been obtained by the Acquiror Group prior to Closing, Acquiror will, and
will cause the other members of the Acquiror Group to, after Closing, continue
to use reasonable best efforts to obtain such clearances. Prior to the
novation or transfer of a Secured Contract, Acquiror will not, and will cause
other members of the Acquiror Group not to, (1) have any influence or control
(including influence or control over the acquisition of property or other
assets developed or acquired for the performance of such Secured Contract)
over the Sellers management of such Secured Contract in a manner that could
result in a compromise of classified information or that could adversely
affect the Sellers performance of such Secured Contract, (2) access
unclassified information, including business processes or other procedures in
addition to any sensitive U.S. Government information, developed or obtained
in connection with the performance of the Secured Contracts and/or where
access to unclassified information could reveal the scope and methods
employed to perform the Secured Contracts, or (3) access the identity of the
contracting Government agency or the existence of such Secured Contract itself
if that information is classified. Acquiror will, and will cause its
Affiliates to, provide the space set forth on _Schedule II_ hereto, power and
related colocation services (excluding services to be provided by Seller and
its Affiliates pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement) for all of the
Secured Contracts in accordance with the provisions of the Colocation
Agreement relating to Secured Contracts, as though such provisions thereof are
incorporated herein in full, until the earliest to occur of (i) the novation
of such Secured Contract to Acquiror, (ii) the execution of a new Contract
between Acquiror and the relevant government customer in respect of the
services provided by the Business under such Secured Contract, (iii) the full
performance of the obligations of the Business under such Secured Contract,
and (iv) the expiration or termination of such Secured Contract.

 

(e) After the Closing and prior to the novation or transfer of the Government
Contracts, Seller shall, without further consideration therefor, pay and
remit to Acquiror or its designated Affiliate all monies, rights and other
consideration received in respect of the Government Contracts (to the extent
relating to the Business) as promptly as reasonably practicable after receipt
thereof, and Acquiror or its designated Affiliate shall reimburse Seller or
its designated Affiliate for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs
and expenses incurred by the Seller Group in connection with the performance
of such Government Contracts (to the extent relating to the Business) prior
to their novation or transfer to the Acquiror Group (including Taxes incurred
as a result of the receipt of such consideration (net of any Tax benefit
realized as the result of the payment of such consideration), but excluding
any allocated overhead).

 



70 4.19 __Financing_._ Acquiror will use its reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, advisable or desirable to (a) satisfy on a timely basis all terms
and conditions applicable to Acquiror set forth in the Commitment Letter that
are within its control and (b) maintain in effect the Commitment Letter,
negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect thereto on the
terms and conditions contemplated by the Commitment Letter and enforce its
rights under the Commitment Letter. Acquiror will keep Seller apprised of
material developments relating to the Committed Financing and will give Seller
prompt written notice of any material adverse change with respect to the
Committed Financing, including prompt written notice (i) of any breach or
default (or any event or circumstance that, with or without the giving of
notice or the lapse of time, would constitute such a breach or default) by any
party to the Commitment Letter of which Acquiror becomes aware, (ii) if and
when Acquiror becomes aware that any portion of the Committed Financing may
not be available to consummate the funding of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, (iii) of the receipt by Acquiror of any written notice or
other written communication from any Person with respect to any actual or
threatened breach, default, termination or repudiation by, or dispute with,
any party to the Commitment Letter that would reasonably be expected to result
in the Committed Financing not being available or a material delay to the
Closing Date, and (iv) of any expiration or termination of the Commitment
Letter. Without limiting the foregoing, Acquiror will keep Seller informed on
a reasonably current basis and in reasonable detail of the status of its
efforts to arrange the Committed Financing. Acquiror will not replace, amend
or waive the Commitment Letter without Sellers prior written consent if such
replacement, amendment or waiver reduces the aggregate or net amount of the
Committed Financing; or amends the Committed Financing in a manner that would
reasonably be expected to delay or prevent the Closing or make the funding of
the Committed Financing less likely to occur.

 

4.20 __Financial Statements__. (a) At Sellers sole cost and expense, Seller
will:

 

(i) Deliver to Acquiror by January 31, 2017 audited statements of revenue and
direct expenses for the Business for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2014
and 2015 and an audited statement of assets acquired and liabilities assumed
as of December 31, 2015, together with an unqualified report thereon of
Sellers independent accountants; provided that the inclusion of explanatory
language in such accountants report describing the special purpose nature of
such financial statements, without more, will not make such report
unqualified;

 

(ii) Deliver to Acquiror by February 1, 2017 a draft unaudited and unreviewed
statement of revenue and direct expenses for the Business for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2016 and a draft unaudited and unreviewed statement of
assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of December 31, 2016, excluding
footnote disclosures;

 



71 (iii) Deliver to Acquiror by February 15, 2017 a draft unaudited and
unreviewed statement of revenue and direct expenses for the Business for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 and a draft unaudited and unreviewed
statement of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of December 31, 2016,
including footnote disclosures;

and direct expenses for the Business for the fiscal years ended December 31,
2014, 2015 and 2016 and an audited statement of assets acquired and
liabilities assumed as of each of December 31, 2015 and 2016, together with an
unqualified report thereon of Sellers independent accountants;  _provided_
that the inclusion of explanatory language in such accountants report
describing the special purpose nature of such financial statements, without
more, will not make such report unqualified;

 

(v) If the Closing has not occurred by May 1, 2017, August 1, 2017 or November
1, 2017, deliver to Acquiror by May 15, 2017, August 15, 2017 or November 15,
2017, respectively, an unaudited statement of assets and liabilities assumed
of the Business as of the most recent fiscal quarter end and an unaudited
statement of net revenues and direct expenses of the Business for the
applicable period(s) then ended, together with any applicable prior period(s)
(the financial statements delivered by Seller pursuant to clauses _(i)_ ,
_(iv)_ and _(v)_ of this _Section_ ___4.20(a)_ , the " _Financial Statements_
"). If the Financing has not been consummated at the time of the delivery of
such Financial Statements referred to in this clause (v), such Financial
Statements will be reviewed by Sellers independent auditors in accordance
with the procedures set forth in AU 722 (Interim Financial Information). The
cost of review will be borne by Acquiror unless such Financial Statements are
delivered prior to the Closing, in which case the cost of review will be
borne by Seller.

The Financial Statements will, in each case, be presented on a historical
basis and in compliance with the requirements of Regulation S-X and the
Financial Reporting Manual (including without limitation Section 2065
thereunder) and will, in the case of unaudited Financial Statements, be
reviewed by Sellers independent accountants in accordance with the
procedures set forth in AU 722 (Interim Financial Information). To the extent
the Financial Statements provided pursuant to this _Section_ _4.20(_ _a)_ do
not reflect any restructuring transaction contemplated by  _Section_ _1.01_
of this Agreement, Seller will prepare, at Acquirors expense, a schedule that
shows the pro forma effects of such transactions and reconciles any applicable
adjustments to the related Financial Statements or financial information as a
result of such restructuring. Seller will deliver the applicable pro forma
schedule to Acquiror no later than the date that Seller delivers the
corresponding Financial Statements pursuant to this _Section _ _4.20(_ _a)_.

 



72 (b) If reasonably requested by Acquiror with respect to the Business in
connection with Acquirors reporting obligations under the Securities Act and
the Exchange Act or any financing for the purpose of refinancing the bridge
facility contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter, Seller will use
Commercially Reasonable Efforts to, at Acquirors expense, provide Acquiror
with such financial information, on a historical basis, in compliance with the
requirements of Regulation S-X and the Financial Reporting Manual (including,
without limitation, Section 2065 thereunder), for the period from and after
January 1, 2017 through the date of the last completed fiscal quarter prior to
the Closing Date for which quarterly financial statements were not previously
provided to Acquiror, along with any applicable prior period. Such financial
information will be reviewed by Sellers independent auditors in accordance
with the procedures set forth in AU 722 (Interim Financial Information). To
the extent the financial information provided pursuant to this  _Section
4.20(b)_ does not reflect any restructuring transaction contemplated by
_Section 1.01_ of this Agreement, Seller will prepare, at Acquirors expense,
a schedule that shows the pro forma effects of such transactions
and reconciles any applicable adjustments to the related Financial Statements
or financial information as a result of such restructuring. Seller will
deliver the financial information and the applicable pro forma schedule to
Acquiror as promptly as practicable once it is available, but in no event
later than 45 days after the end of the prior fiscal quarter.

(c) Until one year following the Closing Date, Seller will use Commercially
Reasonable Efforts to provide to Acquiror such cooperation as is reasonably
requested by Acquiror and that is reasonably necessary in connection with
arranging and obtaining the Financing or any financing for the purpose of
refinancing the bridge facility contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter,
including:

 

(i) Providing to Acquiror, as promptly as practicable and at Acquirors
expense, any required adjustments and/or supporting documentation relating to
the Financial Statements or the financial information provided pursuant to
_Section 4.20(b)_ as Acquiror may reasonably require and reasonably request;

 

(ii) Prior to the Closing, participating in a reasonable number of meetings,
road shows and rating agency sessions, and participating in reasonable and
customary due diligence;

(iii) Requesting its independent accountants to provide reasonable assistance
and cooperation, including requesting they provide any necessary customary
consents to use or file with the SEC their audit reports relating to the
Business and requesting they provide any necessary customary comfort
letters; and

(iv) Furnishing other pertinent information regarding the Business within
Sellers possession and reasonably accessible to Seller without having to
incur any undue expense as may be reasonably requested by Acquiror.

 



73 (d) Without limiting the foregoing, the Seller Group will use Commercially
Reasonable Efforts to cooperate with Acquiror and use Commercially Reasonable
Efforts to provide to Acquiror and its Affiliates, from time to time, during
the period from the date hereof until the one year anniversary of the Closing
Date, upon reasonable advance notice from Acquiror, reasonable access to any
other relevant financial and other information pertaining to the Business
prior to the Closing Date, which information is reasonably necessary, in the
reasonable opinion of Acquiror or its Affiliates outside, third party
accountants, to prepare financial statements required in order for Acquiror to
comply with the requirements of Regulation S-X, the Financial Reporting Manual
(including, without limitation, Section 2065 thereunder) and any
other applicable rule issued by the SEC and applicable to Acquiror or its
Affiliates (including Acquirors reporting obligations under the Securities
Act and Exchange Act), to prepare any financial information relating to the
Business for filing or furnishing with the SEC, or to respond to any requests
for information from the SEC with respect to the Business, in each case with
respect to periods prior to the Closing. In furtherance of the foregoing,
Seller will use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to (i) deliver to Acquiror
the format and the methodology of the Financial Statements by December 9, 2016
and (ii) within five days after the date hereof, appoint a working group of
Sellers key accounting matter experts who will meet with Representatives of
Acquiror at reasonable intervals to use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to
support the preparation of financial information in connection with Acquirors
reporting obligations under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act or in
connection with the Financing or any financing for the purpose of refinancing
the bridge facility contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter, in each case
as reasonably requested as to substance and timing. Nothing in  _Section
4.20(b)_ , _Section 4.20(c)_ or this _Section 4.20(d)_ will require Seller to
take any action to the extent it would, in Sellers reasonable judgment,
interfere unreasonably with the Business or the business or operations of
Seller or any member of the Seller Group or result in the waiver of any legal
privilege. Acquiror will promptly, upon request by Seller, reimburse Seller
for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by
Seller or any of its Affiliates in connection with the cooperation of Seller
and its Affiliates contemplated by _Section 4.20(b)_ , _Section 4.20(c)_ and
this _Section 4.20(d)_ (other than relating to the preparation of
Financial Statements as set forth in _Section 4.20(a)_ ) and will indemnify
and hold harmless Seller, its Affiliates and their respective representatives
from and against any and all Losses suffered or incurred by any of them of any
type in connection with the arrangement of any financing and any information
provided or used in connection therewith (other than information provided by
Seller and its Subsidiaries) or otherwise in connection with the performance
of its obligations under this  _Section 4.20_.

4.21 ______DDTC Notifications__. Each of the Parties will submit to the DDTC
any and all notifications required under Section 122.4 of ITAR. Without
limiting the foregoing, each of the Parties will cooperate with each other and
exchange information necessary to prepare and submit any such required
notifications. 

 



74 4.22 ______Delivery of Books and Records__. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement and without limiting _Section_ _4.07_ hereof, (a)
Seller will use reasonable best efforts to deliver (i) within ten days after
the date hereof, to (A) Acquiror, the Transferred Real Property Leases,
Transferred Tenant Leases and the Transferred Supplier Contracts and (B)
Acquirors "clean team," access to database of Transferred Customer Contracts
and Shared Customer Contracts maintained by Axiom, (ii) within 30 days
following the end of such 10-day period, copies of any Transferred Customer
Contracts or Shared Customer Contracts referred to in clause _(a)(i)(B)_ above
to Acquiror, redacted (as applicable) to eliminate any portion thereof to the
extent related to the Excluded Business; _provided_ , _however_ , that if
Seller does not provide copies of such redacted Transferred Customer Contracts
or Shared Customer Contracts during such 30-day period, Seller will provide
Acquiror with access to such Axiom database (excluding Secured Contracts),
subject to advice of the Parties respective antitrust counsel, and (iii)
after the expiration of the 30-day period described above but prior to
Closing, any other Transferred Customer Contracts or Shared Customer Contracts
that were not delivered pursuant to clause _(ii)_ above that can be located by
Seller without undue effort or expense (redacted, as applicable, to eliminate
any portion thereof to the extent related to the Excluded Businesses),
provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to Secured
Contracts, Seller will only provide such portions of the Secured Contracts
that do not contain or otherwise constitute classified information, (b)

excuse it from its obligation to effect the transactions contemplated hereby

this Agreement.

 



78 VI. TERMINATION AND ABANDONMENT

 

6.01 __Basis for Termination__. This Agreement may be terminated and the
transactions contemplated hereby abandoned at any time prior to the Closing

(b) by either Seller or Acquiror:

 

(i) if the Closing does not occur on or prior to September 6, 2017 (the " _End
Date_ "); _provided_ , that if on such date, the conditions to Closing set

conditions to the Closing have been satisfied (or in the case of conditions
that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, are capable of being
satisfied on such date), then either Party may extend the End Date to December

or extend the End Date pursuant to this _Section_ _ _ _6.01(_ _b)(i)_ will
not be available to any Party whose breach of any provision of this Agreement
has been the cause of the failure to consummate the Closing by such time; or

 

(ii) if (A) there is any Law that makes consummation of the transactions
hereunder illegal or otherwise prohibited or (B) any Governmental Authority
having competent jurisdiction has issued an Order or taken any other action
permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting any material
component of the transactions contemplated hereunder, and such Order or other
action becomes final and non-appealable; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ _6.01(b)(ii)_
will not be available to any Party whose failure to fulfill or comply with
any obligation or covenant under this Agreement has been the cause of, or
resulted in, the issuance or enactment of such Law or Order; or

 

(c) by Seller, if Acquiror breaches any of its representations, warranties or
covenants contained in this Agreement, which breach (i) would give rise to
the failure of a condition set forth in _Section_ _ _ _5.01_ or _Section_ _ _
_5.03_ and (ii) cannot be or has not been cured by the earlier of (A) the End
Date and (B) 30 days after the giving of written notice to Acquiror of such
breach; _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section_ _ _ _6.01(c)_ will not be available if Seller is
then in material breach of any of its representations, warranties or
covenants contained in this Agreement; or

(d) by Acquiror, if Seller breaches any of its representations and warranties
or covenants contained in this Agreement, which breach (i) would give rise to
the failure of a condition set forth in _Section_ _ _ _5.01_ or _Section_ _ _
_5.02_  and(ii) cannot be or has not been cured by the earlier of (A) the End
Date and (B) 30 days after the giving of written notice to Seller of such

further action by any Party. If the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements are terminated as provided herein, (a)
each Party will return to the other Party or destroy all documents and copies
and other material received from such other Party and its Affiliates and its
and their Representatives relating to the transactions contemplated hereby and
by the Ancillary Agreements, whether so obtained before or after the
execution hereof and (b) the Confidentiality Agreement will continue in full
force and effect in accordance with its terms.

 

6.03 __Effect of Termination__. If this Agreement is duly terminated and the
transactions contemplated hereby are abandoned as described in this _Article_
_ _ _VI_ , this Agreement will become void and of no further force and effect,
except for the provisions of _Section_ _ _ _4.03_ relating to publicity, 
_Section_ _ _ _6.02_ , this _Section_ _ _ _6.03_ , _Article_ _ _ _IX_ and
_Article_ _ _ _X_ containing general provisions and definitions, respectively,
except that nothing in this _Article_ _ _ _VI_ will be deemed to release any
Party from any Liability for any Deliberate Breach by such Party of the terms
and provisions of this Agreement or to impair the right of any Party to compel
specific performance by another Party of its obligations under this Agreement
that specifically survive such termination as set forth in the immediately
preceding sentence.

 

6.04 __Termination Fee__. (a) In the event that (i) this Agreement is
terminated by either Party pursuant to  _Section_ _6.01(b)_ (i) and at the
time of such termination, (A) one or more of the conditions to Closing set
forth in _Section_ _5.01(a)_ (as a result of any Antitrust Law or any Order
under Antitrust Laws) or _Section _ _5.02(c)_ have not been satisfied and (B)
all other conditions to Closing set forth in _Section_ _5.01_ and _Section_
_5.02_ have been satisfied (or in the case of conditions that by their terms
are to be satisfied at the Closing are capable of being satisfied on such
date) or (ii) this Agreement has been terminated by either party pursuant to
_Section_ _6.01(b)(ii)_ as a result of any Antitrust Law or any Order under
Antitrust Laws, then Acquiror shall pay the Termination Fee to Seller,
_provided_ that no Termination Fee shall be payable by Acquiror (x) pursuant
to this _Section_ _ _ _6.04(a)_ if the failure of the conditions to Closing
set forth in _Section _ _5.01(a)_ or _Section_ _5.02(c)_ to be satisfied is
primarily caused by Sellers breach of any provision of this Agreement or (y)
pursuant to clause _(ii)_ of this _Section_ _ _ _6.04(a)_ if
Seller terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ _6.01(b)(ii)_ (1)
without first providing at least three Business Days notice of its intention
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ _6.01(b)(ii)_ or (2) after
providing at least three Business Days notice of its intention to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ _6.01(b)(ii)_ and, during such three
Business Day period, Acquiror irrevocably confirms to Seller in writing of its
intention to take all necessary actions (including the actions described in
_Section_ _4.02(b)_ ) to render such Law or Order inapplicable to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and thereafter continues to take
all such necessary actions to render such Law or Order inapplicable to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In no event will Acquiror be
required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion. Any amount due
under this _Section_ _6.04_ will be paid by wire transfer of same-day funds
to an account provided in writing by Seller to Acquiror within two Business
Days of the date of such termination.

 



80 (b) Except in the case of any Deliberate Breach or intentional fraud, in the
event that (i) the Termination Fee is payable pursuant to _Section 6.04(a)_
and (ii) Seller receives full payment of the Termination Fee pursuant to
_Section 6.04(a)_ , (A) the Termination Fee shall be deemed to be liquidated
damages, (B) the payment of the Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 6.04(a)_
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy available to Seller and its Affiliates
for any and all losses or damages suffered as a result of the failure of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement to be
consummated or for any breach or failure to perform hereunder, and (C) upon
payment of the Termination Fee, none of Acquiror or any of its Affiliates or
Representatives shall have any further liability or obligation to any other
Party or its Affiliates relating to or arising out of this Agreement or in
respect of any Ancillary Agreement or theory of Law or equity, whether in
equity or at Law, in contract, in tort or otherwise, and none of Seller
or its Affiliates shall be entitled to bring or maintain any Action against
Seller or its Affiliates arising out of or in connection with this Agreement
or the Ancillary Agreements, the transactions contemplated hereof and thereof,
or the termination hereof and thereof.

(c) The Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this _Section
6.04_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated hereby and that,
without these agreements, the Parties would not have entered into this
Agreement. Accordingly, if Acquiror fails to pay in a timely manner any amount
due pursuant to _Section 6.04(a)_ and, in order to obtain such payment,
Seller commences any Action that results in a judgment against Acquiror,
Acquiror will pay to Seller interest on such amount from and including the
date payment of such amount was due to but excluding the date of
actual payment at the prime rate set forth in the _Wall Street Journal_ in
effect on the date such payment was required to be made, together with
reasonable and documented legal fees and expenses incurred in connection with
such Action.

whether any breach of any representation or warranty has occurred), the
representations and warranties that are qualified as to materiality or by
reference to a Business MAE shall be deemed not to be so qualified).

7.03 __Calculation and Other Provisions Relating to Indemnity Payments.__

(a) _Insurance_. The amount of any Loss for which indemnification is provided
under this  _Article_ _ _ _VII_ will be net of any amounts actually recovered
by the Indemnitee or its Affiliates under third-party insurance policies with
respect to such Loss (less the cost to collect the proceeds of such
insurance), including any insurance proceeds received pursuant to _Section_
_1.03(e)_ and _Section_ _4.12_ ). If the Indemnitee or its Affiliates

 



83  actually receive a full or partial recovery under such insurance policies
following payment of indemnification by the Indemnifying Party in respect of
such Loss, then the Indemnitee will refund amounts received from the
Indemnifying Party up to the amount of indemnification actually received from
the Indemnifying Party with respect to such Loss (less the cost to collect the
proceeds of such insurance).

 

(b) _Taxes_. The amount that any Indemnifying Party is or may be required to
provide indemnification to or on behalf of any Indemnitee pursuant to this
Agreement (including under _Section_ _ _ _8.04_ ) will be decreased to offset
any net Tax benefit actually realized by the Indemnitee (or an Affiliate
thereof) arising from the incurrence or payment by such Indemnitee (or
Affiliate thereof) of the relevant indemnified item, in the year in which such
indemnification payment is made or for any prior year. The Indemnitee will
provide the other Party with supporting documentation addressing,
in reasonable detail, the amount of any such net Tax benefit.

(c) _Exclusion of Certain Items_. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof,
neither Party will have any right to make any claims against the other in
respect of any Liability (i) to the extent that the Liability was taken into
account in determining the prorations of expenses pursuant to _Section_ _ _
_1.11_ or (ii) to the extent it would result in a duplicative payment or
benefit of amounts recovered as part of the proration of expenses pursuant to
_Section_ ___1.11_.

 

7.04 __Procedures for Defense, Settlement and Indemnification of Claims__. (a)
_Direct Claims_. All claims made hereunder by (i) any member of the Seller
Group, on the one hand, against Acquiror or any member of the Acquiror Group,
on the other hand, or (ii) by any member of the Acquiror Group, on the one
hand, against Seller or any member of the Seller Group, on the other hand
(collectively, other than Third-Party Claims, " _Direct Claims_ "), will be
subject to the dispute resolution procedures set forth in  _Section_ _ _
_9.15_. An Indemnitee will give the Indemnifying Party written notice of any
Direct Claim (the " _Direct Claims Notice_ "), which notice will describe the
matter in reasonable detail, stating the nature, basis for indemnification
and the amount thereof, to the extent known, along with, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, copies of any relevant documents evidencing such
matter. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the delay or failure of any Indemnitee
or other Person to give notice as provided in this _Section_ _ _ _7.04(a)_
will not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations under this
_Article_ _ _ _VII_ , except to the extent that such Indemnifying Party is
materially prejudiced by such delay or failure to give notice. The
Indemnifying Party will have a period of 60 days within which to object to any
Direct Claims Notice, stating whether it disputes the existence or scope of
an obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party under this _Article_ _VII_ ,
and describing in reasonable detail the basis for its objection thereto, along
with, to the extent permitted by applicable Laws and available to
the Indemnifying Party, copies of any relevant documents supporting its
objection. If the Indemnifying Party does not so respond within such 60 day
period stating that the Indemnifying Party disputes its liability for such
Direct Claim, the Indemnifying Party will be deemed to have accepted such
Direct Claim, such Direct Claim will be deemed conclusively a liability of the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnifying Party will pay the amount of such
Direct Claim to the Indemnitee as soon as reasonably practicable after the
amount of

 



84  such Direct Claim (or any portion thereof) becomes finally determined, in
each case subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including the
limitations set forth in _Section _ _7.07_ and _Section_ _9.01_ ). If the
Indemnifying Party disputes all or any part of such Direct Claim, the
Indemnitee and the Indemnifying Party will attempt in good faith within 45
days to resolve such claim. If no such agreement can be reached through good
faith negotiations within 45 days, either the Indemnitee or the Indemnifying
Party may act to resolve such dispute in accordance with _Section_ ___9.15_.

 

(b) _Third-Party Claims_.

 

(i) _Notice of Claims_. If an Indemnitee receives written notice of the
assertion by a Person (including any Governmental Authority) which is not a
member of the Seller Group or the Acquiror Group of any claim or of the
commencement by any such Person of any Action with respect to which an
Indemnifying Party may be reasonably considered to be obligated to provide
indemnification under this _Article_ _ _ _VII_ (collectively, a " _Third-Party
Claim_ "), such Indemnitee will give such Indemnifying Party prompt (and in
any event within 30 days) written notice thereof (a " _Third-Party_ _Claims
Notice_ ") after becoming aware of such Third-Party Claim. Any such notice
will describe the Third-Party Claim in reasonable detail, stating the nature,
basis for indemnification and the amount thereof, to the extent known, along
with copies of any relevant documents evidencing such Third-Party Claim.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the delay or failure of any Indemnitee or other
Person to give notice as provided in this  _Section_ _ _ _7.04(b)(i)_ will
not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations under this _Article_ _ _
_VII_ , except to the extent that such Indemnifying Party is materially
prejudiced by such delay or failure to give notice.

(ii) _Opportunity to Defend_. The Indemnifying Party has the right,
exercisable by written notice to the Indemnitee within 45 days after receipt
of a Third-Party Claims Notice from the Indemnitee of the commencement or
assertion of any Third-Party Claim in respect of which indemnity may be sought
under this  _Article_ _ _ _VII_ , to assume and conduct the defense of such
Third-Party Claim in accordance with the limits set forth in this Agreement
with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party and reasonably acceptable to
the Indemnitee;  _provided_ , _however_ , that (A) the Third-Party Claim does
not relate to or arise in connection with any criminal proceeding, action,
indictment, allegation or investigation, (B) the Third-Party Claim solely
seeks (and continues to seek) monetary damages or equitable or corrective
relief (with or without monetary damages, fines or penalties), which equitable
relief would not adversely affect in any material respect the operations of
(1) Seller or its Affiliates, if Acquiror is the Indemnifying Party, or (2)
Acquiror or its Affiliates (including after the Closing, any Acquired
Entities), if Seller is the Indemnifying Party, and (C) the Indemnifying Party
expressly agrees with the Indemnitee in writing to be fully responsible for
all of the Losses that arise from the Third-Party Claim, subject to the
limitations thereon set forth in this _Article_ _ _ _VII_ (the conditions set
forth in clauses _(A)_ through _(C)_  are, collectively, the " _Litigation
Conditions_ "). For purposes of clause _(C)_ of the preceding sentence, if a
Third-Party Claim consists

 



85  of multiple claims by a plaintiff or group of plaintiffs, and it is
reasonably practicable for an Indemnifying Party to control the defense of a
subset of such claims, the Indemnifying Party may elect to agree to be fully
responsible, subject to the limitations thereon set forth in this _Article_ _
_ _VII_ , for only the Losses that arise from such subset of claims, and may
elect to control the defense of only such subset of claims; _provided_ , that
the other Litigation Conditions are satisfied. If the Indemnifying Party does
not assume the defense of a Third-Party Claim in accordance with this
_Section_ _ _ _7.04(_ _b)_ , the Indemnitee may continue to defend the Third-
Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense of a Third-
Party Claim as provided in this _Section_ _ _ _7.04(b)_ , the Indemnifying
Party will not be liable for any legal expenses subsequently incurred by the
Indemnitee in connection with the defense of the Third-Party Claim; _provided_
, _however_ , that if, in the reasonable judgment of the Indemnitee, based
on the advice of counsel, there exists a conflict of interest between the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnitee with respect to such Third-Party Claim,
the Indemnifying Party will pay the reasonable attorneys fees of one
additional counsel selected by the Indemnitee in connection with such defense
and reasonably acceptable to the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying Party or
the Indemnitee, as the case may be, has the right to participate, at its own
expense (subject to the prior sentence), in the defense of any Third-Party
Claim that the other is defending as provided in this Agreement. The
Indemnifying Party, if it has assumed the defense of any Third-Party Claim as
provided in this Agreement, may not, without the prior written consent of the
Indemnitee, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, consent
to a settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any such Third-
Party Claim unless (x) the Indemnifying Party promptly pays in full
any obligation imposed on the Indemnitee by such settlement or judgment, (y)
such settlement or judgment includes as an unconditional term thereof the
giving by the claimant or the plaintiff to the Indemnitee of a complete
release from all liability in respect of such Third-Party Claim without any
finding or admission of any violation of Law or admission of any wrongdoing
and (z) does not impose injunctive or other non-monetary equitable relief
against the Indemnitee or its Affiliates, or their respective businesses. The
Indemnitee may not settle any Third Party Claim without the prior written
consent of the Indemnifying Party, not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

 

7.05 __Additional Matters__. (a) _Cooperation in Defense and Settlement_.
With respect to any Third-Party Claim for which Acquiror, on the one hand,
and Seller, on the other hand, may have Liability under this Agreement or any
of the Ancillary Agreements, the Parties agree to cooperate fully in good
faith in the defense of such Action and maintain a joint defense (in a manner
that will preserve the attorney-client privilege, joint defense or other
privilege with respect thereto) so as to minimize such Liabilities and defense
costs associated therewith. The Party that is not responsible for managing
the defense of such Third-Party Claims will be entitled to participate in the
defense thereof and to retain counsel to monitor or assist in the defense of
such claims at its own cost.

 



86 (b) _Mitigation_. In respect of any Loss for which indemnification may be
sought pursuant to _Article_ _ _ _VII_ and _Article_ _VIII_ , the Indemnitee
will (and will cause its Affiliates to) use its Commercially Reasonable
Efforts to mitigate any Losses upon becoming aware of any event which
would reasonably be expected to, or does, give rise thereto; _provided_ that
the amount of any indemnifiable Losses shall be increased by the net amount of
any reasonable, documented out-of-pocket costs or expenses incurred by the
Indemnitee in pursuing such mitigation.

7.06 __Exclusive Remedy__. From and after the Closing, the sole and
exclusive remedy of a Party with respect to any and all claims relating to
the matters described in _Section_ ___7.01_ and _Section_ ___7.02_ of this
Agreement (other than (i) the ability of any Party to seek
specific performance or other equitable relief to require a Party to perform
its obligations under this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement to the extent
permitted hereunder and thereunder and (ii) except as otherwise provided
herein or in any Ancillary Agreement) will be pursuant to the indemnification
provisions set forth in this _Article_ _ _ _VII_ or, in the case of
indemnification relating to Taxes, _Article_ _ _ _VIII_ of this Agreement.

 

7.07 __Limitations on Indemnification__. (a) Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, (i) Seller will not have any liability under
_Section_ _ _ _7.02(d)_ (other than with respect to a breach of _Sections_ _ _
_2.01_ , _2.02_ , _2.04(a)-_ _(b)_ , _2.14_ , _2.20_ and  _2.21_
(collectively, the " _Seller Specified Representations_ ")) unless the
aggregate liability for Losses suffered by the Acquiror Indemnitees thereunder
exceeds $72,000,000 (the " _Deductible_ "), and then only to the extent of
such excess, (ii) Sellers aggregate liability under _Section_ _ _ _7.02(d)_
(other than with respect to a breach of any of the Seller Specified
Representations) will not exceed 360,000,000 (the " _Cap_ "), (iii) (A)
Acquiror will not have any liability under _Section_ _ _ _7.01(d)_ (other than
with respect to a breach of _Sections_ _ _ _3.01_ , _3.02_ and  _3.04(a)-_
_(b)_ (collectively, the " _Acquiror Specified Representations_ ")) unless the
aggregate liability for Losses suffered by the Seller Indemnitees thereunder
exceeds the Deductible, and then only to the extent of such excess, and (B)
Acquirors aggregate liability under _Section_ _ _ _7.01(d)_ (other than with
respect to a breach of any of the Acquiror Specified Representations) will not
exceed the Cap, (iv) no Party will have any liability under _Section_ _ _
_7.01(d)_ or _7.02(d)_ , as applicable, for any Loss arising out of any
individual claim (or any series of claims arising out of substantially the
same events, facts or circumstances, which will be aggregated for purposes of
this clause _(iv)_ ), unless such Loss exceeds $300,000, and any Losses that
are disregarded pursuant to this clause _(iv)_ will not be aggregated for
purposes of the preceding clauses _(i)_  through _(iii)_ , (v) in no event
will Sellers liability under _Section_ _7.02(b)_ (A) exceed $50,000,000 in
the aggregate, or (B) exceed, with respect to any Shared Customer Contract,
$15,000,000, and (vi) in no event will Acquirors liability under _Section_
_7.01(b)_ (A) exceed $50,000,000 in the aggregate, or (B) exceed, with respect
to any Shared Customer Contract, $15,000,000.

 

(b) Neither _Section_ ___7.07(_ _a)_ nor _Section_ _9.01_ shall limit any
Partys rights or remedies in the event of fraud.

 



87 7.08 __Tax Treatment of Indemnification__. For all Tax purposes, Acquiror and
Seller agree to treat any indemnity payment under this Agreement as an
adjustment to the Global Purchase Price to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law.

 

7.09 __Other__ _ _Indemnification Provisions__. Notwithstanding any provision
in this _Article _ _VII_ to the contrary, all indemnification for claims
relating to Taxes with respect to the transactions consummated pursuant to
this Agreement will be provided exclusively pursuant to _Article_ _VIII_ of
this Agreement and the provisions of this _Article_ _VII_ , except for
_Section_ ___7.03(b)_ , _Section_ ___7.05(b)_ , _Section_ ___7.06_ ,
_Section_ ___7.08_ and this _Section_ _ _ _7.09_ , will not apply.

VIII. TAX MATTERS

 

8.01 __Preparation and Filing of Tax Returns__. (a) Seller will prepare and
timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely filed, all Tax Returns
required to be filed by any Acquired Entity or solely in respect of the other
Acquired Assets that are (i) required to be filed (taking into account any
applicable extensions) on or before the Closing Date or (ii) required to be
filed (taking into account any applicable extensions) after the Closing Date
for any Tax period ending on or before the Closing Date. Seller will prepare
any Tax Return described in clause _(ii)_ of the immediately preceding
sentence on a basis consistent with the past practices with respect to
previously filed Tax Returns, except to the extent otherwise required by
applicable Law, and will deliver to Acquiror any such Tax Return (other
than Transfer Tax documentation, which is addressed in _Section_ _8.06_ ),
together with any additional information relating thereto that Acquiror may
reasonably request, at least 30 days prior to the due date for filing such Tax
Return (taking into account any applicable extensions). Acquiror will have
the right to review any such Tax Return and additional information, if any,
prior to the filing of such Tax Return, and Seller will consider in good faith
any comments submitted by Acquiror at least ten days prior to the due date of
such Tax Return before delivering such Tax Return to Acquiror for filing.
Acquiror will prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely
filed, all Tax Returns required to be filed by the Acquired Entities or
solely in respect of the other Acquired Assets for a Straddle Period. Any such
Tax Return required to be filed in respect of a Straddle Period will be
prepared on a basis consistent with the past practices with respect to
previously filed Tax Returns, except to the extent otherwise required by
applicable Law. Acquiror will deliver to Seller, at least 30 days prior to the
due date for the filing of such Straddle Period Tax Return (taking
into account any applicable extensions), a statement setting forth the amount
of Tax for which Seller is responsible pursuant to _Sections_ _ _ _8.04(a)_ ,
_8.04(b)_ and _8.04(c)_. Acquiror will also deliver a copy of such Tax
Return, together with any additional information relating thereto that Seller
may reasonably request, and Seller will have the right to review such Straddle
Period Tax Return, statement and additional information, if any, prior to the
filing of such Tax Return, and Acquiror will consider in good faith any
comments submitted by Seller at least ten days prior to the due date of such
Tax Return before filing such Tax Return. Neither Acquiror nor any of its
Affiliates (including any Acquired Entity) will file a Tax Return or agree to
any waiver or extension of the statute of limitations relating to Taxes with
respect to any Acquired Entity or the other Acquired Assets for a Tax period
ending on or before the Closing Date or a Straddle Period, in each case,
without the prior written consent of Seller (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), _provided_ that this sentence
shall not prevent Acquiror from filing any such Tax Return on the due date
for filing such Tax Return (taking into account any applicable extensions).

 



88 (b) The Party required by applicable Law to pay the Taxes due with respect to
Tax Returns prepared and filed in accordance with _Section_ _ _ _8.01(a)_
will timely pay such Taxes to the applicable Taxing Authority when due. At
least five Business Days prior to the due date for the payment of such Taxes,
the other Party will pay the amount of such Taxes for which it is responsible
pursuant to this _Article_ _ _ _VIII_ (including as determined pursuant to
_Section_ _ _ _8.04(c)_ ), if any, to the first Party. Acquiror will pay or
cause to be paid to the applicable Taxing Authority all other Taxes required
to be paid by or with respect to any Acquired Entity or the other Acquired
Assets.

 

8.02 __Carryforwards and Carrybacks__. Acquiror will cause the Acquired
Entities, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, to carry forward any Tax
asset, arising in any Post-Closing Tax Period that could, whether in the
absence of an election or otherwise, be carried back to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period. Acquiror will make, and cause its Affiliates (including the Acquired
Entities) to make all available elections to effect the foregoing. Acquiror,
on its own behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates, hereby waives any right to
use or apply in any Pre-Closing Tax Period any Tax asset arising in any Post-
Closing Tax Period.

8.03 __Refunds__. Seller will be entitled to any refund or Refund
Equivalent received or realized with respect to Taxes paid by Seller or an
Affiliate of Seller with respect to any Acquired Entity or the other Acquired
Assets for any Pre-Closing Tax Period (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
any such amounts arising by reason of amended Tax Returns or any formal or
informal claim for a refund of Taxes filed after the Closing Date in
accordance with the provisions of this _Section_ _ _ _8.03_ ), and to the
extent any such refund or Refund Equivalent is received or realized by
Acquiror or any member of the Acquiror Group (including the Acquired
Entities), Acquiror will pay to Seller the amount of such refund or Refund
Equivalent (including interest received from any Taxing Authority with
respect to such refund or Refund Equivalent, but reduced by the amount of any
reasonable out-of-pocket costs (including income Taxes) incurred by Acquiror
or any of its Affiliates (including any Acquired Entity) in obtaining such
refund or Refund Equivalent within ten days of receipt (or realization)
thereof. In connection with the foregoing, if Seller determines that any of
the Acquired Entities is entitled to file or make a formal or informal claim
for a refund of Taxes (including by filing an amended Tax Return) with
respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, Seller will be entitled to file or make,
or to request that Acquiror cause the applicable Acquired Entity to file or
make, such formal or informal claim for refund, at no out-of-pocket cost to
Acquiror, and Seller will be entitled to control the prosecution of such claim
for refund. Acquiror will cooperate, and cause the Acquired Entities to
cooperate, with respect to such claim for refund. With respect to any refund
of Taxes for a Straddle Period, Acquiror and Seller will equitably apportion
any refund or Refund Equivalent (including interest received from any Taxing
Authority with respect to such refund or Refund Equivalent) received or
realized with respect to such Taxes in a manner consistent with the principles
set forth in _Section_ _ _ _8.04(c)_.

 



89 8.04 __Tax Indemnification__. (a) Except to the extent the following have
been taken into account in determining the proration of payables or expenses
pursuant to _Section_ ___1.11_ , Seller will indemnify, defend and hold
Acquiror and its Affiliates harmless from and against _(i)_ all Excluded
Taxes, _(ii)_ all Taxes resulting from or arising in connection with any
breach by Seller or any member of the Seller Group of any of the
representations and warranties contained in _Sections_ _2.13_ or any covenant
in this Agreement, _(iii)_ all Transfer Taxes for which Seller is responsible
pursuant to _Section_ ___8.06_ and _(iv)_ all costs and expenses, including
reasonable legal fees and expenses, attributable to any item in clauses 
_(i)_ through _(iii)_. Subject to _Section_ _ _ _8.04(g)_ , Sellers
obligation to indemnify, defend or hold harmless Acquiror or any of its
Affiliates (including the Acquired Entities) from any Excluded Taxes pursuant
to this _Section_ _ _ _8.04(a)_ will terminate effective 30 days following the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (including extensions).

 

(b) Except to the extent the following have been taken into account in
determining the proration of payables or expenses pursuant to  _Section_
___1.11_ , Acquiror will indemnify, defend and hold Seller and its Affiliates
harmless from and against (i) all Taxes imposed on the Acquired Entities or
with respect to the other Acquired Assets for any Post-Closing Tax Period
(except to the extent such Taxes are subject to indemnification pursuant to
_Section_ ___8.04(a)_ ), (ii) all Transfer Taxes for which Acquiror is
responsible pursuant to _Section_ ___8.06_ , (iii) all Taxes resulting from
or arising in connection with any breach by Acquiror or any member of the
Acquiror Group of any covenant in this Agreement, and (iv) all costs and
expenses, including reasonable legal fees and expenses, attributable to
any item in clauses _(i)_ through _(iii)_. Subject to _Section_ _ _
_8.04(g)_ , Acquirors obligation to indemnify, defend or hold harmless Seller
or any of its Affiliates from Taxes pursuant to this  _Section_ _ _ _8.04(b)_
will terminate effective 30 days following the expiration of the applicable
statute of limitations (including extensions).

 

(c) In the case of any Straddle Period:

 

(i) Property Taxes and other periodic Taxes imposed on or with respect to the
Acquired Entities or the other Acquired Assets (that are not based on income,
receipts, services or transactions, including sales, use, withholding, payroll
and other employment Taxes), allocable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period will be
computed based upon the ratio of (A) the number of days in the portion of
such Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date to (B) the total
number of days in such Straddle Period; and

 

(ii) Taxes of the Acquired Entities for the Pre-Closing Tax Period, other than
Taxes subject to  _Section_ _ _ _8.04(c)(i)_ , will be computed as if such
Tax period ended as of the close of business on the Closing Date; _provided_ ,
that exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual
basis will be allocated between the portion of the Straddle Period ending as
of the close of business on the Closing Date and the portion of the Straddle
Period beginning after the Closing Date in proportion to the number of days in
each such portion.

 



90 (d) Any indemnity payment required to be made pursuant to this  _Section_ _ _
_8.04_ will be made within 30 days after the Indemnitee makes written demand
upon the Indemnifying Party, but in no case later than five Business Days
prior to the date on which the relevant Taxes are required to be paid to the
applicable Taxing Authority.

(e) If a claim or other Tax Proceeding is made or initiated by any Taxing
Authority which, if successful, could result in an indemnity payment pursuant
to _Section_ _ _ _8.04_ (a " _Tax Claim_ "), the Party receiving notice of
such Tax Claim will promptly notify the other Party in writing of such claim
(and provide copies of any documents received from the Taxing Authority in
respect of such claim) no later than ten Business Days after such Tax Claim is
made; _provided_ , that failure to provide such notice will not relieve such
other Party of its indemnification obligations except to the extent that such
other Party is materially prejudiced by such failure. With respect to any Tax
Claim relating to a Tax period ending on or before the Closing Date, Seller
will have the right, at its own expense, to participate in, and, upon notice
to Acquiror, to assume the defense thereof. If Seller assumes such defense,
Seller shall have sole discretion as to the conduct of the defense of such Tax
Claim (including selection of counsel) and, without limiting the foregoing,
may pursue or forgo any and all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings
and conferences with any Taxing Authority with respect thereto, and may either
pay the applicable Liability for Taxes and sue for a refund or contest the
Tax Claim). Without limiting the discretion of Seller to conduct the defense
of such Tax Claim, (i) Seller will keep Acquiror reasonably informed of any
material developments in such Tax Claim and consider any comments of Acquiror
in respect of the conduct of such Tax Claim in good faith with counsel of its
own choosing, at its own expense, and (ii) if and only to the extent that a
Tax Claim with respect to non-income Taxes would reasonably be expected to
increase the liability of the Acquiror or any of its Affiliates for such non-
income Taxes for any Post-Closing Tax Period, Seller shall not settle any Tax
Claim relating to an Acquired Asset without Acquirors consent, which shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(f) Acquiror will control all Tax Claims with respect to Straddle Period Tax
Returns of the Acquired Entities required to be prepared by Acquiror pursuant
to _Section_ _ _ _8.01(_ _a)_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the case of
any such Tax Claim, Acquiror will not settle, compromise or abandon any such
Tax Claim without the prior written consent of Seller, which consent will not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. For the avoidance of doubt,
Acquiror will control all Tax Claims with respect to Taxes of or with respect
to an Acquired Entity or the other Acquired Assets for any Tax period
beginning on or after the Closing Date.

 



91 (g) Without limiting Acquirors right with respect to any Tax Claims described
in clauses  _(e)_ and (f) above, if any Tax Reduction Proceeding (or any
claim or application with respect thereto) is pending as of the Closing Date
that is for any fiscal period that includes or precedes the Closing Date,
neither Seller nor Acquiror shall have the right to enter into any settlement
or compromise of any claim with respect to such Tax Reduction Proceeding (or
such claim or application) without the other partys prior written consent
(not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) to the extent such
action would reasonably be expected to increase the Property Taxes for any
Transferred Site.

 

(h) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, indemnification for any
and all Tax matters in respect of this Agreement, and the procedures with
respect thereto, will be governed exclusively by this _Article_ _ _ _VIII_ ,
and the provisions of _Article_ _ _ _VII_ (except for _Sections_ _ _ _7.03(b)_
, _7.05(b)_ ,  _7.06_ , _7.08_ and _7.09_ ) will not apply. The
representations and warranties set forth in _Section_ _s_ _2.13_ and the
provisions of this _Article_ _VIII_ will survive the Closing Date until 30
days following the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations
(including extensions); _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to be
indemnified with respect to any matter set forth in this _Section_ _ _ _8.04_
for which notice was provided within 30 days following the expiration of the
relevant statute of limitations will survive until such matter is fully
resolved.

 

(i) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Seller will have no
obligation to indemnify Acquiror or any of its Affiliates or equity holders
for any Losses attributable to, in respect of or arising out of the status of
Acquiror (or its failure to qualify) as a "real estate investment trust"
within the meaning of Section 856 of the Code.

 

8.05 __Allocation of Consideration__. (a) As promptly as practicable after the
date hereof but in any event no later than 30 days after the date hereof,
Acquiror and Seller will agree to an allocation of the Base Price among the
Hickory Brazil Acquired Entity Interests, the Hickory Colombia Acquired Entity
Interests, and, collectively, the Acquired Entity Interests of all of the
U.S. Acquired Entities (the " _Country Allocation_ ").

(b) As promptly as practicable after the date hereof and no later than
February 28, 2017, Acquiror will provide to Seller a draft allocation (the "
_Proposed Pre-Closing Allocation_ ") allocating the U.S. Base Price, the
Brazil Base Price and the Colombia Base Price among the Acquired Assets
within the United States, Brazil and Colombia, respectively, to the extent
under applicable Law the determination of any Transfer Tax or the filing of
any Tax Return with respect to such Transfer Tax requires an allocation of
the U.S. Base Price, the Brazil Base Price or the Colombia Base Price, as
applicable, based on the fair market value of any property. Seller will
deliver to Acquiror in writing any objections to the Proposed Pre-Closing
Allocation no later than 10 days after receipt thereof, and if Seller does
not deliver any such written objection within such 10 day period, Seller will
be deemed to have agreed with the Proposed Pre-Closing Allocation. Acquiror
and Seller will negotiate in good faith to resolve any such dispute for a
period of five days following delivery of any such objection by Seller. If
Acquiror and Seller are unable to resolve any such dispute within such five-
day period, Acquiror and Seller will submit such dispute to a mutually
agreeable nationally recognized independent accounting firm. Such accounting
firm will be instructed to resolve any such dispute in accordance with this
_Section_ _8.05_ within 15 days of engagement, but in any event prior to the
Closing. The determination of such accounting firm will be final and binding
on the Acquiror and Seller, and Acquiror and Seller will equally bear the fees
and expenses of such accounting firm. The allocation agreed to or
determined pursuant to this _Section_ _8.05(_ _b)_ will be the " _Final Pre-
Closing Allocation_."

 



92 (c) As promptly as practicable after the Closing, but not later than 180 days
after the Closing Date, Acquiror will provide to Seller a draft allocation
(the " _Proposed Post-Closing Allocation_ ") (i) modifying the Country
Allocation and the Final Pre-Closing Allocation, in each case, solely to
reflect any subsequent adjustments or prorations to the Brazil Base Price,
Colombia Base Price or U.S. Base Price as expressly set forth in _Section_
_1.07(c)_ , _Section_ _1.10(b)_ , _Section_ _1.10(c)_ or _Section_ _1.11_ and
(ii) allocating the U.S. Purchase Price, the Brazil Purchase Price and the
Colombia Purchase Price among the Acquired Assets within the United States,
Brazil and Colombia, respectively, to the extent the Final Pre-Closing
Allocation does not allocate the U.S. Purchase Price, the Brazil Purchase
Price or the Colombia Purchase Price among such Acquired Assets. Seller will
deliver to Acquiror in writing any objections to the Proposed Post-Closing
Allocation no later than 30 days after receipt thereof, and if Seller does
not deliver any such written objection within such 30 day period, Seller will
be deemed to have agreed with the Proposed Post-Closing Allocation. Acquiror
and Seller will negotiate in good faith to resolve any such dispute for a
period of 10 days following delivery of any such objection by Seller. If
Acquiror and Seller are unable to resolve any such dispute within such 10 day
period, Acquiror and Seller will submit such dispute to a mutually agreeable
nationally recognized independent accounting firm. Such accounting firm will
be instructed to resolve any such dispute in accordance with this _Section
8.05_ within 20 days of engagement. The determination of such accounting firm
will be final and binding on the Acquiror and Seller, and Acquiror and Seller
will equally bear the fees and expenses of such accounting firm. The
allocation agreed to or determined pursuant to this _Section 8.05(c)_ , will
be the " _Final Post-Closing Allocation_ and together with the Country
Allocation and the Final Pre-Closing Allocation, will be the " _Allocations_."

 

(d) Any allocation pursuant to this _Section 8.05_ will be in accordance with
Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder and any
similar provision of U.S. state, local or non-U.S. Tax Law.

(e) Seller and Acquiror will not, and will cause their respective Affiliates
to not, take a position on any Tax Return or before any Taxing Authority that
is inconsistent with the Allocations, except as required by applicable Law,
and Seller and Acquiror will file IRS Form 8594 and all federal, state, local
and foreign Tax Returns consistent with the Allocations.

8.06 __Transfer Taxes__. Seller will pay, and be responsible for, the lesser
of (a) 50% of all Transfer Taxes actually incurred in connection with the
transactions consummated pursuant to this Agreement, including any Transfer
Taxes resulting from the transactions contemplated by  _Section_ _ _ _1.01_ ,
and (b) 50% of the Transfer Taxes that would have been payable (as reasonably
determined in good faith by Seller) if Seller had Conveyed or caused to be
Conveyed the Acquired Assets and assigned or caused to be assigned the
Assumed Liabilities to Acquiror without consummating the transactions
contemplated by _Section_ _ _ _1.01_. Acquiror will pay, and be responsible
for, all other 

 



93  Transfer Taxes actually incurred in connection with the Conveyance of the
Acquired Assets pursuant to this Agreement, including any Transfer Taxes
resulting from the transactions contemplated by  _Section_ _ _ _1.01_. Any
Tax Return required to be filed with respect to any Transfer Taxes will be
filed by the Party primarily responsible for such filing under applicable Law
on a basis consistent with the Final Pre-Closing Allocation; _provided_ ,
that if Seller and Acquiror cannot in good faith agree as to the Party so
responsible under applicable Law, Acquiror will be deemed to be primarily
responsible for such filing for purposes of this _Section _ _8.06_ , and
Acquiror will acknowledge such responsibility by written notice to the Seller.
The primarily responsible Party will deliver to the other Party a draft of any
such Tax Return at least 15 days prior to the due date for the filing of any
such Tax Return (taking into account any applicable extensions), and any
additional information relating thereto that the other Party may reasonably
request, and will reflect on the applicable Tax Return any reasonable
comments submitted by such other Party at least five days prior to the
applicable due date. Each Party will, promptly upon reasonable request of the
other, use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to obtain any certificate or other
document from any Taxing Authority as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or
eliminate any such Transfer Taxes, including any available exemptions or
refunds with respect thereto.

 

8.07 __Miscellaneous__. (a) Acquiror and its Affiliates will pay and indemnify
and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates from and against any Taxes of
Seller or its Affiliates (including any Taxes for which such Seller or its
Affiliates are responsible under this Agreement) directly resulting from any
actions outside of the ordinary course of business taken, or caused to be
taken, by Acquiror or any of its Affiliates following the Closing on the
Closing Date (other than any transactions pursuant to, or specifically
contemplated by, this Agreement or effected with the written consent of
Seller (including the filing of any Tax Return and any position related
thereto)).

(b) Except as provided in _Section_ _8.07(e)_ , with respect to any Acquired
Entity, Acquiror will not, and will not permit any of its Affiliates
(including, after the Closing, the Acquired Entities) to, cause any election
pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 301.7701-3 to treat any such Acquired
Entity as a corporation for U.S. Federal Income tax purposes to be filed, or
make any other election or filing, in each case, if such election or filing
would be effective on or prior to the Closing Date.

 

(c) Each Party will provide the other with such information, records and other
assistance, and make such of its officers, directors, employees and agents
available, as may reasonably be requested by the other Party in connection
with any Tax matter under this Agreement, including the preparation of any Tax
Return and the conduct of any Tax Claim.

 

(d) Except to the extent otherwise required by applicable Law, and subject to
_Section 8.04(i)_ , Seller and Acquiror agree to treat (and to cause their
respective Affiliates to treat) for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes
(i) the Acquired Assets and the Assumed Liabilities as assets owned by, or as
liabilities of, the Acquiror or its Affiliates effective as of the Closing
and (ii) the Shared Customer Contracts as partially assigned effective as of
the Closing, and Seller and Acquiror will file all Tax Returns in

 



94  manner consistent with such treatment in clauses _(i)_ and _(ii)_.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if (A) any such Acquired Asset or Assumed
Liability cannot be Conveyed at Closing as contemplated by _Section 1.07_ ,
or any such Shared Customer Contract cannot be actually partially assigned or
amended at Closing as contemplated by _Section 4.04_ , and in either case, (B)
the arrangement by which the Acquiror provides the benefits and burdens of
such Acquired Asset or Assumed Liability or Shared Customer Contract is not
evidenced in a separate binding written document executed by Seller and
Acquiror (or their respective Affiliates, as applicable), then if a
Party determines that any such treatment is not more likely than not to
prevail on an audit by the IRS or other applicable Taxing Authority (taking
into account the Parties mutual intention as evidenced by the preceding
sentence), such Party will provide prompt written notice to the other Party
of such determination. Acquiror and Seller will negotiate in good faith to
resolve any such dispute for a period of 10 days following delivery of such
notice. If Acquiror and Seller are unable to resolve such dispute within such
10 day period, Acquiror and Seller will submit such dispute to a mutually
agreeable nationally recognized independent accounting firm or law firm. Such
accounting firm or law firm will be instructed to resolve any such dispute in
accordance with applicable Law within 20 days of engagement. The determination
of such accounting firm or law firm will be final and binding on the Acquiror
and Seller, and Acquiror and Seller will equally bear the fees and expenses
of such accounting firm or law firm.

(e) As promptly as practicable after the date hereof, and prior to the
Closing Date, Seller shall determine, in good faith, the consequences to it
and its Affiliates of making an election under Section 338(g) of the Code with
respect to Hickory Colombia. Unless Seller notifies Acquiror that it has
determined, in good faith, that the making of a Section 338(g) election with
respect to Hickory Colombia would have an adverse impact on the Tax liability
of Seller or its Affiliates, Acquiror shall be entitled to make a Section
338(g) election with respect to Hickory Colombia.

,  _Section 9.10_ , or _Section 9.17_ (or any provision of this Agreement to

Financing Sources party to the Commitment Letter. No course of dealing
between or among any Persons having any interest in this Agreement will be
deemed effective to modify, amend or discharge any part of this Agreement or
any rights or obligations of any Party under or by reason of this Agreement.

 



98 (b) No delay or failure in exercising any right, power or remedy hereunder
will affect or operate as a waiver thereof; nor will any single or partial
exercise thereof or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such
a right, power or remedy preclude any further exercise thereof or of any other
right, power or remedy. Except and solely to the extent set forth in
_Section_ _ _ _7.06_ , the rights and remedies hereunder are cumulative and
not exclusive of any rights or remedies that any Party would otherwise have.

 

9.07 __No Third-Party Beneficiaries__. This Agreement is solely for the
benefit of the Parties and does not confer on third parties (including any
employees of any member of the Seller Group or the Acquiror Group) any remedy,
claim, reimbursement, claim of action or other right in addition to those
existing without reference to this Agreement;  _provided_ _,_ _however_ _,_
that this _Section_ _ _ _9.07_ does not limit any rights of Seller to enforce
specifically the performance of the terms and provisions of _Section_ _ _
_4.14_ ;  _provided_ _ _,__ _further_ , that notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, the Financing Sources shall be express third party
beneficiaries of, and shall be entitled to enforce their rights under,
_Section 6.03_ ,  _Section 9.04_ , _Section 9.06_ , this _Section 9.07_ ,
_Section 9.10_ and _Section 9.17_.

in writing to be bound by the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement
and (b) such assignment or delegation will not relieve any Party of its
indemnification or other obligations under this Agreement. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, neither Seller nor Acquiror may assign the obligations set

hereto. Any attempted assignment or delegation in contravention of this
_Section 9.08_ will be void.

9.09  _ _Construction__. (a) The descriptive headings herein are inserted for

masculine, feminine or neuter forms, and the singular forms of
nouns, pronouns and verbs will include the plural and vice versa. Reference
to any agreement, document or instrument means such agreement, document or
instrument as amended or otherwise modified from time to time in accordance
with the terms thereof, and if applicable, hereof (including any supplements,
guarantees or assignments entered into in connection therewith). References in
this Agreement to any document, instrument or agreement (including this
Agreement) includes and incorporates all exhibits, disclosure letters,
schedules and other attachments thereto. Unless the context otherwise
requires, any references to an "Exhibit," "Section" or "Article" will be to an
Exhibit, Section or Article to or of this Agreement, and will be deemed to
include any provisions or matters set forth in any corresponding schedule or
section of the Acquiror Disclosure Letter or Seller Disclosure Letter. The use
of the words "include" or "including" in this Agreement or the Seller
Disclosure Letter or the Acquiror Disclosure Letter will be deemed to be
followed by the words "without limitation." The use of the words "or,"
"either" or "any" will not be exclusive. Days means calendar days unless
specified as Business Days. References to statutes will include all
regulations promulgated thereunder and will be construed to include all
statutory and regulatory 

 



99  provisions consolidating, amending or replacing the statute or regulation as
of the date hereof. Accounting terms which are not otherwise defined in this
Agreement have the meanings given to them under GAAP. The Parties have
participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement will be construed as if drafted jointly
by the Parties, and no presumption or burden of proof will arise favoring or
disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any of the provisions of
this Agreement.

 

(b) References to documents or other materials "provided" or "made available"
to Acquiror will mean that such documents or other materials were delivered
to Acquiror or its Representatives or were present in the online data room
(the " _Data Room_ ") available to Acquiror and its Representatives and
maintained by Seller for purposes of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as of 5:00 pm New York City time on the date immediately preceding
the date hereof. Seller will provide Acquiror with the ability to print and
download any such documents and materials or will otherwise provide Acquiror
with a copy of such documents and materials.

9.10 __Severability__. The Parties agree that (a) the provisions of this
Agreement will be severable in the event that for any reason whatsoever any of
the provisions hereof are invalid, void or otherwise unenforceable, (b) any
such invalid, void or otherwise unenforceable provisions will be replaced by
other provisions which are as similar as possible in terms to such invalid,
void or otherwise unenforceable provisions but are valid and enforceable, and
(c) the remaining provisions will remain valid and enforceable to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law, in each case so as to best preserve the
intention of the Parties with respect to the benefits and obligations of this
Agreement.

 

9.11 __Counterparts__. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (each of
which need not contain the signature of the other Party), each of which will
be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together will constitute
one and the same agreement. This Agreement, and any amendments hereto, to the
extent signed and delivered by means of a facsimile machine or other
electronic transmission, will be treated in all manner and respects as an
original agreement and will be considered to have the same binding legal
effects as if it were the original signed version thereof delivered
in person.

9.12 __Specific Performance__. The Parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur if any provision of this Agreement was not performed in accordance with
its specific terms or was otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that
the Parties will be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the performance of the
terms and provisions of this Agreement without proof of actual damages, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which any Party is entitled at Law or
in equity. Each Party further agrees that no other Party or any other Person
will be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in
connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this
_Section_ _ _ _9.12_ , and each Party irrevocably waives any right it may
have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or
similar instrument.

 



100 9.13 __Disclosure Letters__. There may be included in the Seller Disclosure
Letter or the Acquiror Disclosure Letter items and information that are not
"material," and such inclusion will not be deemed to be an acknowledgment or
agreement that any such item or information (or any non-disclosed item
or information of comparable or greater significance) is "material," or to
affect the interpretation of such term for purposes of this Agreement. Matters
reflected in the Seller Disclosure Letter and the Acquiror Disclosure Letter
are not necessarily limited to matters required by this Agreement to be
disclosed therein. The Seller Disclosure Letter and the Acquiror Disclosure
Letter set forth items of disclosure with specific reference to the particular
Section or subsection of this Agreement to which the information in the
Seller Disclosure Letter or the Acquiror Disclosure Letter, as applicable,
relates; _provided_ , _however_ , that any information set forth in one
Section of such disclosure letter will be deemed to apply to each other
Section or subsection thereof to which its relevance is reasonably apparent on
its face.

 

9.14 __Waiver of Conflicts Regarding Representation__. Acquiror acknowledges,
on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, that Jones Day has represented, is
representing and will continue to represent Seller and its Affiliates in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements, and that Jones Day will only represent the interests of
Seller and its Affiliates in connection with such transactions. Acquiror
hereby waives, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (including, after the
Closing, the Acquired Entities), any conflict of interest that it or they may
assert against Jones Day in connection with such representation and agrees not
to challenge Jones Days representation of Seller or its Affiliates with
respect to such transactions or to assert that a conflict of interest exists
with respect to such representation. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Acquiror agrees, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (including,
after the Closing, the Acquired Entities), that Jones Day may represent Seller
in any litigation, arbitration, mediation or other Action against or
involving Acquiror or any of its Affiliates, arising out of or in connection
with such transactions.

 

9.15 __Dispute Resolution__. Except as otherwise specifically provided in this
Agreement or in any Ancillary Agreement and subject to _Section_ _ _ _9.12_ ,
the procedures set forth in this _Section_ _ _ _9.15_ will govern dispute
resolution of any Direct Claim under _Section_ _ _ _7.04_ (a " _Dispute_ ").
Prior to commencing litigation as to any Dispute, Acquiror or Seller, as
applicable, will first deliver to the other Party a written notice of the
Dispute. Following receipt of such notice, each of the Parties will cause a
designated Representative to negotiate in good faith to resolve the Dispute.
If such Representatives are unable to resolve the Dispute within 30 Business
Days after the date of notice, either Party will have the right to commence
litigation in accordance with _Section_ _ _ _9.04_. The Parties agree that all
discussions, negotiations and other Information exchanged between the Parties
during the foregoing negotiations will be without prejudice to the legal
position of a Party in any subsequent Action and kept confidential and
protected against disclosure.

 



101 9.16 __Obligations of Affiliates__. Each of Seller and Acquiror will cause
all of the members of its Group to comply with their respective obligations
under this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements (whether or not any such
members of its Group are parties to this Agreement or Ancillary Agreements).
Seller hereby guarantees to Acquiror the performance of the other members of
the Seller Group of their respective obligations under this Agreement and the
other Ancillary Agreements, and Acquiror hereby guarantees to Seller the
performance of the other members of the Acquiror Group of their respective
obligations under this Agreement and Ancillary Agreements. Any breach of such
obligation by a member of a Group shall be deemed a breach by such Party, and
the other Party may proceed directly against such Party without any
obligation to first proceed against such member.

9.17 __Waiver of Rights __ _ _Against__ _ _Financing Sources__.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Seller (on behalf of
itself and its shareholders, managers, Affiliates, officers, employees
and representatives) hereby irrevocably waives any and all rights and claims
against any of the Financing Sources in connection with this Agreement, the
Commitment Letter and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby,
including, without limitation, the financing of the Purchase Price, whether
at Law or in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise. None of the Financing
Sources shall have any liability or obligation to the Seller (or any of its
shareholders, managers, Affiliates, officers, employees and representatives)
relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Commitment Letter or the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including, without limitation,
the financing of the Purchase Price, whether at law, or equity, in contract,
in tort or otherwise. In no event shall the Seller (or any of its
shareholders, managers, Affiliates, officers, employees and representatives)
be entitled to seek or obtain any other damages of any kind against any of
the Financing Sources for, or with respect to, this Agreement, the Commitment
Letter or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including, without
limitation, any failure to consummate the financing of the Purchase Price, any
breach by the Acquiror, the termination of this Agreement, the failure to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any claims or
actions under applicable Law arising out of any such breach, termination or
failure.
