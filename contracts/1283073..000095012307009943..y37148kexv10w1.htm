 3.15.2. The Company has furnished to Purchaser a true, correct and complete copy of each of the Company Employee Plans and related plan documents (including trust documents, insurance policies or Contracts, employee booklets, summary plan descriptions and other authorizing documents, and any material employee communications relating thereto) and has, with respect to each Company Employee Plan which is subject to ERISA reporting requirements, provided to Purchaser true, correct and complete copies of the Form 5500 reports filed for the last three plan years.

  ##### 

  

    

true, correct and complete copy of the most recent Internal Revenue Service
determination or opinion letter issued with respect to each such Company
Employee Plan, and nothing has occurred since the issuance of each such
letter which would reasonably be expected to cause the loss of the Tax-
qualified status of any Company Employee Plan subject to Section 401(a) of the
Code. The Company has also provided to Purchaser all registration statements
and prospectuses prepared in connection with each Company Employee Plan. All
individuals who, pursuant to the terms of any Company Employee Plan, are
entitled to participate in any Company Employee Plan, are
currently participating in such Company Employee Plan or have been offered an
opportunity to do so and have declined in writing. No employee of the Company
and no person subject to any health plan of the Company has made medical
claims through any such health plan during the 12 months preceding the date
hereof for more than $25,000 in the aggregate for which the Company is
responsible. For the purposes of the forgoing sentence, any exception to such
representation and warranty set forth in the Disclosure Letter shall be
stated generally and shall not identify any employee of the Company or person
subject to any health plan of the Company who has made medical claims. The
Company does not sponsor or maintain any self-funded employee benefit plan. 

   

 3.15.3. None of the Company Employee Plans promises or provides retiree medical or other retiree welfare benefits to any person other than as required under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended ("COBRA"), or similar state law. There has been no "prohibited transaction" (within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code and not exempt under Section 408 of ERISA and regulatory guidance thereunder) with respect to any Company Employee Plan. Each Company Employee Plan has been administered in accordance with its terms and in compliance with the requirements prescribed by any and all statutes, rules and regulations (including ERISA and the Code), and the Company and each ERISA Affiliate has performed all obligations required to be performed by it under, is not in default under or in violation of, and has no knowledge of any default or violation by any other party to, any of the Company Employee Plans. Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate is subject to any liability or penalty under Sections 4976 through 4980 of the Code or Title I of ERISA with respect to any of the Company Employee Plans. All contributions required to be made by the Company or any ERISA Affiliate to any Company Employee Plan have been made on or before their due dates and a reasonable amount has been accrued for contributions to each Company Employee Plan for the current plan years (and no further contributions will be due or will have accrued thereunder as of the Closing Date, other than contributions accrued in the ordinary course of business, consistent with past practice, after the Company Balance Sheet Date as a result of the operations of Company after the Company Balance Sheet Date). In addition, with respect to each Company Employee Plan intended to include a Code Section 401(k) arrangement, the Company and ERISA Affiliates have at all times made timely deposits of employee salary reduction contributions and participant loan repayments, as determined pursuant to regulations issued by the United States Department of Labor. No Company Employee Plan is covered by, and neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred or expects to incur any liability under Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code. Each Company Employee Plan can be amended, terminated or otherwise discontinued after the Closing in accordance with its terms, without liability to Purchaser and/or the Company (other than ordinary administrative expenses typically incurred in a termination event). With respect to each Company Employee Plan subject to ERISA as either an employee pension benefit plan within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA or an employee welfare benefit plan within the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA, the Company has prepared in good faith and timely filed all requisite governmental reports (which were true, correct and complete as of the date filed), including any required audit reports, and has properly and timely filed and distributed or posted all notices and reports to employees required to be filed, distributed or posted with respect to each such Company Employee Plan.

 3.15.5. There has been no amendment to, written interpretation or announcement (whether or not written) by the Company or any ERISA Affiliate relating to, or change in participation or coverage under, any Company Employee Plan which would materially increase the expense of maintaining such Company Employee Plan above the level of expense incurred with respect to such Company Employee Plan for the most recent fiscal year included in the Financial Statements. No Company Employee Plan will be subject to any surrender fees or service fees upon termination other than the normal and reasonable administrative fees associated with the termination of benefit plans. 

   

 3.15.6. Neither the Company nor any current or former ERISA Affiliate currently maintains, sponsors, participates in or contributes to, or has ever maintained, established, sponsored, participated in, or contributed to, any pension plan (within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA) which is subject to Part 3 of subtitle B of Title I of ERISA, Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code. Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate is a party to, or has made any contribution to or otherwise incurred any obligation under, any "multiemployer plan" as such term is defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA or any "multiple employer plan" as such term is defined in Section 413(c) of the Code. 

   

 3.15.7. Each compensation and benefit plan maintained or contributed to by the Company under the law or applicable custom or rule of the relevant jurisdiction outside of the United States (each such plan, a "Foreign Plan") is listed in Schedule 3.15.7 of the Disclosure Schedule. As regards each Foreign Plan, (i) such Foreign Plan is in material compliance with the provisions of the Legal Requirements of each jurisdiction in which such Foreign Plan is maintained, to the extent those Legal Requirements are applicable to such Foreign Plan, (ii) all contributions to, and material payments from, such Foreign Plan which may have been required to be made in accordance with the terms of such Foreign Plan, and, when applicable, the Legal Requirements of the jurisdiction in which such Foreign Plan is maintained, have been timely made or shall be made by the Closing Date, and all such contributions to such Foreign Plan, and all payments under such Foreign Plan, for any period ending before the Closing Date that are not yet, but will be, required to be made, are reflected as an accrued liability on the Company Balance Sheet, (iii) the Company and each ERISA Affiliate has materially complied with all applicable reporting and notice requirements, and such Foreign Plan has obtained from the Governmental Entity having jurisdiction with respect to such Foreign Plan any required determinations, if any, that such Foreign Plan is in compliance with the Legal Requirements of the relevant jurisdiction if such determinations are required in order to give effect to such Foreign Plan, (iv) such Foreign Plan has been administered in all material respects at all times in accordance with its terms and applicable Legal Requirements, (v) to the knowledge of the Company, there are no pending investigations by any governmental body involving such Foreign Plan, and no pending claims (except for claims for benefits payable in the normal operation of such Foreign Plan), suits or proceedings against such Foreign Plan or asserting any rights or claims to benefits under such Foreign Plan, (vi) the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not by itself create or otherwise result in any liability with respect to such Foreign Plan, and (vii) except as required by applicable Legal Requirements, no condition exists that would prevent the Company from terminating or amending any 

     ##### 

 

  

Foreign Plan at any time for any reason in accordance with the terms of each
such Foreign Plan without the payment of any fees, costs or expenses (other
than the payment of benefits accrued through the date of termination and any
normal and reasonable expenses typically incurred in a termination event).
The benefits available under all Foreign Plans in the aggregate do
not provide materially greater benefits to employees of the
Company participating in such plans than the benefits available under
the Company Employee Plans for employees of the Company in the
United States. No Foreign Plan has unfunded liabilities that will not
be offset by insurance or that are not fully accrued on the
financial statements of the Company in accordance with GAAP.

 3.15.9. None of the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the consummation of the transaction contemplated hereby or any termination of employment or service in connection therewith or subsequent thereto will, individually or together with the occurrence of some other event, (i) result in any payment (including severance, unemployment compensation, golden parachute, bonus or otherwise) becoming due to any Person, (ii) materially increase or otherwise enhance any benefits otherwise payable by the Company, (iii) result in the acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any such benefits, except as required under Section 411(d)(3) of the Code, (iv) increase the amount of compensation due to any Person, or (v) result in the forgiveness in whole or in part of any outstanding loans made by the Company to any Person.

From and after the date of this Agreement until the Closing or termination of this Agreement, neither the Sellers, the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries will, nor will any of them authorize or permit any of their respective officers, managers (or directors, as the case may be), affiliates, members (or stockholders, as the case may be) or employees or any investment advisor or banker, attorney or other advisor or representative retained by any of them (all of the foregoing collectively being the "Company Representatives") to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, seek, entertain, encourage, facilitate, support or induce the making, submission or announcement of any inquiry, expression of interest, proposal or offer that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter into, participate in, maintain or continue any communications (except solely to provide written notice as to the existence of these provisions) or negotiations regarding, or deliver or make available to any Person any non-public information with respect to, or take any other action regarding, any inquiry, expression of interest, proposal or offer that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) agree to, accept, approve, endorse or recommend (or publicly propose or announce any intention or desire to agree to, accept, approve, endorse or recommend) any Acquisition Proposal, (iv) enter into any letter of intent or any other Contract contemplating or otherwise relating to any Acquisition Proposal, or (v) submit any Acquisition Proposal to the vote of any Members (or securityholders, as the case may be) of Company or any Subsidiary. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries will immediately cease and cause to be terminated any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any Persons conducted prior to or on the date of this Agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. If any Company Representative, whether in his or her capacity as such or in any other capacity, takes any action that the Company is obligated pursuant to this Section 6.3 to cause such Company Representative not to take, then the Company shall be deemed for all purposes of this Agreement to have breached this Section 6.3. 

  

 6.3.2. The Sellers and the Company shall immediately (and in no event later than 24 hours) notify Purchaser orally and in writing after receipt by the Sellers, the Company and/or any Subsidiary (or, to the knowledge of the Company, by any of the Company Representatives), of (i) any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) any inquiry, expression of interest, proposal or offer that constitutes, or would 

   ##### 

  

 

reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) any other
notice that any Person is considering making an Acquisition Proposal, or (iv)

such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, expression of interest, proposal, offer,
notice or request. The Sellers and the Company shall keep Purchaser fully
informed of the status and details of, and any modification to, any such
inquiry, expression of interest, proposal or offer and any correspondence or
communications related thereto and shall provide to Purchaser a true, correct
and complete copy of such inquiry, expression of interest, proposal or offer
and any amendments, correspondence and communications related thereto, if it
is in writing, or a reasonable written summary thereof, if it is not in
writing. The Sellers and the Company shall provide Purchaser with 48 hours
prior notice (or such lesser prior notice as is provided to the members of its
management) of any meeting of the Members of the Company at which it is
reasonably expected to discuss any Acquisition Proposal. 

   

 6.4. _Non-Competition; Non-Disclosure_. 

  

 6.4.1. In order to induce Purchaser to purchase the Interest pursuant to this Agreement, Sellers covenant and agree that during the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the second (2nd) anniversary thereof (the "Non-Competition Period"), neither Sellers nor any of their respective Affiliates shall directly or indirectly, whether as an officer, director, stockholder, investor, partner, proprietor, business associate, employee, representative or otherwise, (i) promote, market, become or be financially interested in, consult with or for, or associate in a business relationship with, any other person, corporation, firm, partnership or other entity whatsoever (other then the Company) whose business is a Competitive Business (as defined below); (ii) solicit or otherwise encourage any customers or vendors of the Company to cease doing business with the Company or undertake any action, either directly or indirectly, that would reasonably be expected to cause any customer or vendors of the Company to cease, terminate or materially adversely change its relationship with the Company, or (iii) solicit the services of any of the Companys employees, consultants or independent contractor, or otherwise encourage any such employees, consultants or independent contractor to terminate their employment with, or services to, the Company or to become an employee, consultant or independent contractor or otherwise provide services to any Person other than the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section shall not prohibit a Seller or its Affiliates from owning up to 5% of the equity of any publicly traded company, whether or not such company is engaged in whole, or in part, in a Competitive Business. The term "Competitive Business" shall mean any business (or any component thereof) that is competitive with the business conducted by the Company during the twelve (12) months period prior to the Closing Date, including, without limitations, Internet reference content related business and any business associated with language reference, general reference or question and answer information delivered over the Internet. For the purpose of this Section 6.4, the term "Company" shall include the Company, Purchaser and their respective Affiliates. 

  

 6.4.2. Without limiting the generality of Section 6.4.1, during the Non-Competition Period, neither Sellers nor any of their respective Affiliates shall register, cause to be registered, claim, cause to be claimed or take any action to register or claim any rights in and to any trademark, service mark or any marks that are confusingly similar to any Company Web Site, domain names or URLs included (or which should have been included) in the Company Registered Intellectual Property, and shall not register any domain name that contains the word "Reference", "Dictionary", "Thesaurus" or any word which is a misspelling of, or potentially confusingly similar name to, any Company Web Site, domain names or URLs included (or which should have been included) in the Company Registered Intellectual Property. In addition, neither Sellers nor any of their respective Affiliates shall register or challenge any 

   ##### 

  

 

rights of the Company in any Company-Owned IP Rights. 

   

 6.4.3. Each of the Sellers expressly acknowledges that damages alone will be an inadequate remedy for any breach or violation of any of the provisions of this Section 6.4, and Purchaser, in addition to all other remedies available at law or hereunder, shall be entitled, as a matter of right, to injunctive relief, including specific performance, with respect to any such breach or violation, in any court of competent jurisdiction. If any of the provisions of this Section 6.4 are held to be in any respect an unreasonable restriction upon any party restricted hereby, then they shall be deemed to extend only over the maximum period of time, geographic area or range of activities as to which they may be enforceable. In the event that a Seller shall be in violation of the provisions of this Section 6.4, then the running of the Non-Competition Period with respect to such Seller shall be automatically suspended upon the date of such violation and shall resume on the date such violation ceases, and accordingly the Non-Competition Period shall be extended for a period of time equal to the period of time during which such breach shall occur; and, in the event that Purchaser should be required to seek relief from such breach in any court, board of arbitration or other tribunal, then the Non-Competition Period shall be extended for the period of time required for the pendency of such proceedings, including all appeals. 

  

 6.4.4. Each of the Sellers acknowledges that he has had access to, and became familiar with, Proprietary Information of the Company (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) and that such Proprietary Information is a valuable and unique asset of the Company and is and will remain the exclusive property of the Company. Therefore, each of the Sellers agrees and undertakes that he (i) will maintain securely and hold in strict confidence all Proprietary Information received, acquired or developed by him whether following or prior to the Closing, (ii) will not, in whole or in part, disclose Proprietary Information to any Person under any circumstances, and (iii) will not, in whole or in part, use any Proprietary Information for any purpose (other than for and as authorized in writing by the Company). Each Seller agrees to instruct his Representatives who obtain Proprietary Information to comply with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. The obligation of non-disclosure and non-use imposed shall not apply to information that (a) appears in issued patents or other printed publications; (b) received by Seller not in connection with his relationship to the Company and from a source that was not prohibited from disclosing such information to Seller by a confidentiality obligation or other fiduciary or legal duty, (c) is or becomes generally known to the public through no wrongful act or breach of Seller or any of his Representatives. Each Seller shall not be prohibited from disclosing Proprietary Information to the extent required by a court order or applicable law, provided that he shall notify the Company of such disclosure and shall use reasonable efforts to (and cooperate with Company in seeking to) seal, redact, or otherwise minimize such disclosure. The obligations contained in this Section 6.4.4 shall survive the Closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and remain in force and effect in accordance with their respective terms. 

  

 6.4.5. Each Seller agrees that documents, copies, records and other property or materials made or received by Seller that pertain to the business and affairs of the Company or its Affiliates, including all Proprietary Information, which is in Sellers possession or under his control, are the property of the Company and that the Seller will return same and any copies of same to the Company promptly after the Closing and shall not retain any copy, summary or reproduction of same.

In addition, the Company shall promptly prepare and deliver to Purchaser such other financial information reasonably requested by Purchaser.

Nothing in this Section 8 is intended to nor shall it derogate from or limit the rights and/or remedies any party may have pursuant to this Agreement, by law or equity at any time prior to termination of this Agreement, including, without limitation, the right to seek injunctive relief or specific performance in any court of competent jurisdiction. 

  

9. Escrow Fund and Indemnification  

   

 9.1. _Escrow Fund_. The Escrow Amount shall be deposited with the Escrow Agent, such deposit, together with any interest that may be earned thereon, to constitute an escrow fund (the "Escrow Fund") and to be governed by the provisions set forth herein and in the Indemnity Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Fund shall be available to compensate Purchaser on behalf of itself or any other Indemnified Person or Sellers, as the case may be, for Indemnifiable Damages pursuant to the indemnification obligations of the applicable Indemnifying Party hereunder. 

  

 9.2. _Indemnification by Sellers_. Subject to the limitations set forth in this Section 9, the Sellers shall, jointly and severally, indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser, its Affiliates and their respective officers, directors, agents and employees, and each person, if any, who controls or may control Purchaser within the meaning of the Securities Act from and against any and all losses, liabilities, damages, reductions in value, costs and expenses, including costs of investigation and defense and reasonable fees and expenses of lawyers, experts and other professionals (collectively, "Indemnifiable Damages") directly or indirectly arising out of, resulting from or in connection with: 

  

 9.2.1. any failure of any representation or warranty made by the Sellers or the Company in this Agreement or the Disclosure Schedule (including any exhibit or schedule to the Disclosure Schedule), and any certificate to be delivered pursuant to this Agreement, to be true and correct as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date as though such representation or warranty were made as of the Closing Date (except in the case of representations and warranties which specifically relate to another date, which representations and warranties shall be true and correct as of such date); 

  

 9.2.2. any breach of or default in connection with any of the covenants or agreements made by the Sellers or the Company in this Agreement or the Disclosure Schedule (including any exhibit or schedule to the Disclosure Schedule) and any certificate to be delivered pursuant to this Agreement; 

   ##### 

  

  

 9.2.3. imposition, assessment or assertion of any Taxes of the Company or any Subsidiary or any Taxes for which the Company or Subsidiary is or may become liable (including, without limitation, by reason of non-recognition of deductions, changes in accounting methods, failure to fully comply with applicable laws or failure to qualify in any foreign jurisdiction and including those incurred in a contest of good faith by appropriate proceedings of the imposition, assessment or assertion of any such Taxes) on account of (A) any taxable periods that ends on or before the Closing Date, and (B) any taxable period that both includes and ends after the Closing Date, for the portion of such taxable period that ends on the Closing Date; 

  

 9.2.4. any amounts determined following the Closing that should have been deducted from the Purchase Price pursuant to the adjustments in accordance with the provisions of Section 1.2.2.1 but were not so deducted or any amount determined following the Closing that should not have been deducted from the Purchase Price or permitted to be paid as dividend pursuant in accordance with the provisions of Section 1.2.2.2 but were so deducted or paid. 

  

 9.2.5. any Transaction Expenses paid by the Company prior to the Closing or which were not assumed and paid by the Sellers after the Closing. 

  

 9.2.6. any obligations of the Sellers to make contributions as provided in Chapter 5 of the Corporations Code (commencing with Section 17200), to return any unlawful distributions made under Chapter 6 (commencing with Section 17250) or Chapter 8 (commencing with Section 17350). 

  

 In determining the amount of any Indemnifiable Damages in respect of the failure of any representation or warranty to be true and correct as of any particular date, any materiality standard or qualification contained in such representation or warranty shall be disregarded. 

  

 9.3. _Indemnification by Purchaser_. Subject to the limitations set forth in this Section 9, Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless Sellers from and against any Indemnifiable Damages directly arising out of, resulting from or in connection with any failure of any representation or warranty made by the Purchaser in this Agreement to be true and correct as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date as though such representation or warranty were made as of the Closing Date (except in the case of representations and warranties which specifically relate to another date, which representations and warranties shall be true and correct as of such date), up to an amount equal to the Escrow Amount, as the sole and exclusive remedy for the indemnity obligations hereunder. 

  

 9.4. _Indemnifiable Damage Threshold; Other Limitations_. 

  

 9.4.1. No Indemnified Person shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant to Sections 9.2.1 or 9.2.2 (and that does not involve fraud, willful breach or intentional misrepresentation by the Sellers, the Company or any Subsidiary, any inaccuracy or breach of any of the representations and warranties in Section 3.3 (Capital Structure), Section 3.4 (Title to Interest), 3.5 (Authority; Non-Contravention), Section 3.12 (Intellectual Property and Internet Practices) or Section 3.14 (Tax Matters), or breach of Section 6.4), or pursuant to Section 9.3, unless and until an Officers Certificate describing Indemnifiable Damages in an aggregate amount greater than $100,000 (the "Threshold") has been delivered, in which case the Indemnified Person shall be entitled to indemnification for all Indemnifiable Damages in excess of the Threshold, subject to the limitations set forth in this Section 9. 

  

 9.4.2. If the Closing occurs, recovery from the Escrow Fund shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for the indemnity obligations under this Agreement for the matters listed in Sections 9.2.1 or 9.2.2, except in the case of (i) fraud, willful breach or intentional misrepresentation by the Sellers, the Company or any Subsidiary, (ii) any failure of any of the representations and warranties 

   ##### 

  

    

contained in Section 3.3 (Capital Structure), Section 3.4 (Title to Interest),
3.5 (Authority; Non-Contravention), Section 3.12 (Intellectual Property and
Internet Practices) or Section 3.14 (Tax Matters) to be true and correct as
aforesaid, and (iii) any breach of or default in connection with any covenant
or agreement to the extent such covenant or agreement is to survive or
be performed also after the Escrow Period (including, without limitation,
pursuant to Section 6.4); with respect to each the Sellers shall be liable
for any Indemnifiable Damages resulting therefrom after Indemnified Persons
have exhausted or made claims upon all amounts in the Escrow Fund
(after taking into account all other claims for indemnification from the
Escrow Fund made by Indemnified Persons). Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary, this Section 9 shall in no way limit an Indemnified Partys right
to seek injunctive relief or specific performance. 

  

 9.4.3. The amount of Indemnifiable Damages for which indemnification is provided under this Agreement will be (i) increased to take account of any Tax cost incurred (grossed up for such increase) by the Indemnified Persons arising from the receipt of indemnity payments hereunder and (ii) reduced to take account of any Tax benefit realized by the Indemnified Persons arising from the incurrence or payment of any such Indemnifiable Damages. In computing the amount of any such Tax cost or Tax benefit, the Indemnified Persons will be deemed to be subject to the applicable federal, state, local and/or local country income Taxes at the maximum statutory rate then in effect. 

  

 9.5. _Period for Claims Against Escrow Fund_. The period during which indemnification claims for Indemnifiable Damages may be made (the "Claims Period") shall commence at the Closing and terminate on the date that is 12 months following the Closing Date (the "Escrow Period"), provided, however, that the Claims Period for Indemnifiable Damages pursuant to Section 9.2 (i) resulting from or in connection with fraud, willful breach or intentional misrepresentation by the Company or any Subsidiary, (ii) arising from any breach of the representations and warranties contained in Section 3.3 (Capital Structure), Section 3.4 (Title to Interest), 3.5 (Authority; Non-Contravention), Section 3.12 (Intellectual Property and Internet Practices) or Section 3.14 (Tax Matters), (iii) arising from any breach of or default in connection with any covenant or agreement to the extent such covenant or agreement is to survive or be performed also after the Escrow Period (including, without limitation, pursuant to Section 6.4), or (iv) arising pursuant to either of Sections 9.2.3 through 9.2.6, shall terminate upon the date that is 30 days after expiration of the applicable statute of limitations with respect to any theretofore unasserted claims arising out of or otherwise in respect of the items covered by Sections (i) through (iv) above. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, such portion of the Escrow Fund at the conclusion of the Escrow Period as may be necessary to satisfy any unresolved or unsatisfied claims for Indemnifiable Damages specified in any Officers Certificate delivered to the Sellers Representative prior to expiration of the Escrow Period shall remain in the Escrow Fund until such claims for Indemnifiable Damages have been resolved or satisfied. The remainder of the Escrow Fund, if any, shall be paid to the Sellers promptly after the expiration of the Escrow Period in the same allocation as that of the Purchase Price. 

  

 9.6. _Claims_. 

  

 9.6.1. On or before the last day of the Escrow Period, Purchaser may deliver to the Escrow Agent a certificate signed by any officer of Purchaser (in case of an indemnification claim pursuant to Section 9.2), or Sellers Representative may deliver to the Purchaser a certificate (in case of an indemnification claim pursuant to Section 9.3) (an "Officers Certificate"): 

    

 9.6.1.1. stating that an Indemnified Person has incurred, paid, reserved or accrued, or reasonably anticipates that it may incur, pay, reserve or accrue, Indemnifiable Damages (or that with respect to any Tax matters, that any Tax Authority may raise such matter in audit of Purchaser or its Affiliates, which could give rise to Indemnifiable Damages); 

   ##### 

  

   

 9.6.1.2. stating the amount of such Indemnifiable Damages (which, in the case of Indemnifiable Damages not yet incurred, paid, reserved or accrued, may be the amount reasonably anticipated by Purchaser to be incurred, paid, reserved or accrued); and 

   

 9.6.1.3. specifying in reasonable detail (based upon the information then possessed by Purchaser) the individual items of such Indemnifiable Damages included in the amount so stated and the nature of the claim to which such Indemnifiable Damages are related. 

  

 No delay in providing such Officers Certificate within the Escrow Period shall affect an Indemnified Persons rights hereunder, unless (and then only to the extent that) the Indemnifying Person is materially prejudiced thereby. 

  

 9.6.2. In case of an indemnification claim pursuant to Section 9.2, at the time of delivery of any Officers Certificate to the Escrow Agent, a duplicate copy of such Officers Certificate shall be delivered to the Sellers Representative by or on behalf of Purchaser (on behalf of itself or any other Indemnified Person) and for a period of 20 days after such delivery to the Escrow Agent of such Officers Certificate, the Escrow Agent shall make no payment pursuant to this Section 9.6 unless the Escrow Agent shall have received written authorization from the Sellers Representative to make such delivery. After the expiration of such 20-day period, the Escrow Agent shall make delivery of cash from the Escrow Fund to Purchaser in accordance with this Section 9.6; provided, however, that no such delivery may be made if and to the extent the Sellers Representative shall in good faith object in a written statement to any claim or claims made in the Officers Certificate, and such statement shall have been delivered to the Escrow Agent and to Purchaser prior to the expiration of such 20-day period. 

  

 9.7. _Resolution of Objections to Claims_. 

  

 9.7.1. In case of an indemnification claim pursuant to Section 9.2, if the Sellers Representative in good faith objects in writing to any claim or claims by Purchaser made in any Officers Certificate within such 20-day period, Purchaser and the Sellers Representative shall attempt in good faith for 20 days after Purchasers receipt of such written objection to resolve such objection. If Purchaser and the Sellers Representative shall so agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be prepared and signed by both parties and delivered to the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any such memorandum and the Escrow Agent shall distribute cash from the Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms of such memorandum. 

  

 9.7.2. In case of an indemnification claim pursuant to Section 9.3, Purchaser and the Sellers Representative shall attempt in good faith for 20 days after Purchasers receipt of an Officers Certificate to resolve such objection. If Purchaser and the Sellers Representative shall so agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be prepared and signed by both parties. 

  

 9.7.3. If no such agreement pursuant to Sections 9.7.1 or 9.7.2, as the case may be, can be reached during the 20-day period for good faith negotiation, but in any event upon the expiration of such 20-day period, either Purchaser or the Sellers Representative may refer the matter to arbitration in accordance with Section 10.10 hereof to resolve the matter. The decision of the arbitrator as to the validity and amount of any claim in such Officers Certificate shall be non-appealable, binding and conclusive upon the parties to this Agreement and the Escrow Agent or Purchaser, as the case may be, shall be entitled to act in accordance with such decision and the Escrow Agent shall distribute cash from the Escrow Fund in accordance therewith. 

  

 9.7.4. Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. For purposes of this Section 9.7.4, in any suit hereunder in which any claim or 

   ##### 

  

    

the amount thereof stated in the Officers Certificate is at issue, the
Indemnified Person shall be deemed to be the non-prevailing party unless the
arbitration awards the Indemnified Person more than one-half of the amount in
dispute, in which case the Indemnifying Person shall be deemed to be the non-
prevailing party. The non-prevailing party to a suit shall pay its own
expenses and the expenses and the fees and expenses of the prevailing party,
including attorneys fees and costs, reasonably incurred in connection with
such suit. 

  

 9.8. _Sellers Representative_. 

  

 9.8.1. By virtue of their signature on this Agreement, the Sellers have appointed the Sellers Representative as the agent and attorney-in-fact for and on behalf of the Sellers to: (i) give and receive notices and communications, as an Indemnified Person or an Indemnifying Person, to or from Purchaser (on behalf of itself or any other Indemnified Person, or as an Indemnifying Person) relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions and other matters contemplated hereby or thereby (except to the extent that this Agreement expressly contemplates that any such notice or communication shall be given or received by such Seller individually); (ii) authorize deliveries to Purchaser of cash from the Escrow Fund in satisfaction of claims asserted by Purchaser (on behalf of itself or any other Indemnified Person, including by not objecting to such claims); (iii) object to claims made by or on behalf of an Indemnified Person, including pursuant to Section 9.6, or make claims as or on behalf of an Indemnified Person; (iv) consent or agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and comply with orders of courts or arbitration awards with respect to, such claims; (v) consent or agree to any amendment to this Agreement; and (vi) take all actions necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the Sellers Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing, in each case without having to seek or obtain the consent of any Person under any circumstance. The Person serving as the Sellers Representative may be replaced from time to time by the Sellers upon not less than ten days prior written notice to Purchaser. The Sellers Representative shall receive no compensation for its services. 

  

 9.8.2. The Sellers Representative shall not be liable to any Seller for any act done or omitted hereunder as the Sellers Representative while acting in good faith (and any act done or omitted pursuant to the advice of counsel shall be conclusive evidence of such good faith) and without gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Sellers shall severally indemnify the Sellers Representative and hold the Sellers Representative harmless against any loss, liability or expense incurred without gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith on the part of the Sellers Representative and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of the duties of the Sellers Representative hereunder, including any out-of-pocket costs and expenses and legal fees and other legal costs reasonably incurred by the Sellers Representative. If not paid directly to the Sellers Representative by the Sellers, such losses, liabilities or expenses may be recovered by the Sellers Representative from Escrow Fund otherwise distributable to the Sellers (and not distributed or distributable to an Indemnified Person or subject to a pending indemnification claim of an Indemnified Person) at the end of the Escrow Period pursuant to the terms hereof and of the Indemnity Escrow Agreement, at the time of distribution, and such recovery will be made from the Sellers according to their respective pro rata share of the Purchase Price. 

  

 9.8.3. Any notice or communication given or received by, and any decision, action, failure to act within a designated period of time, agreement, consent, settlement, resolution or instruction of, the Sellers Representative that is within the scope of the Sellers Representatives authority under Section 9.8.1 shall constitute a notice or communication to or by, or a decision, action, failure to act within a designated period of time, agreement, consent, settlement, resolution or instruction of all the Sellers and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon each such Sellers; and each Indemnified Person shall be entitled to rely upon any such notice, communication, decision, action, failure to act within a designated period of time, agreement, consent, settlement, resolution or instruction as being a notice or communication to or by, or a decision, action, failure to act within a designated period of time, agreement, 

   ##### 

  

    

consent, settlement, resolution or instruction of, each and every such
Seller. 

  

 9.9. _Third-Party Claims_. In the event an Indemnified Person becomes aware of a third-party claim that it believes may result in an indemnification claim against the Escrow Fund or the Indemnifying Person by or on behalf of an Indemnified Person, the Indemnified Person shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Person in writing and in reasonable detail of such third-party claim, provided however that no delay in providing such notice shall affect an Indemnified Persons rights hereunder, unless (and then only to the extent that) the Indemnifying Person is materially prejudiced thereby. The Indemnifying Person shall have the right in its sole discretion to conduct the defense of and to settle or resolve any such claim (and the costs and expenses incurred by it in connection with such defense, settlement or resolution (including reasonable attorneys fees, other professionals and experts fees and court or arbitration costs) shall be included in the Indemnifiable Damages for which the Indemnifying Person may seek indemnification pursuant to a claim made hereunder). The Sellers Representative or Purchaser, as the case may be, shall have the right to receive copies of all pleadings, notices and communications with respect to the third-party claim to the extent that receipt of such documents does not affect any privilege relating to any Indemnified Person and shall be entitled, at its expense, to participate in, but not to determine or conduct, any defense of the third-party claim or settlement negotiations with respect to the third-party claim. However, except with the consent of the Sellers Representative or Purchaser, as the case may be (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed and which shall be deemed to have been given unless the Sellers Representative or Purchaser, as the case may be, shall have objected within 15 days after a written request for such consent by Purchaser or Sellers Representative, as the case may be), no settlement or resolution of any such claim with any third-party claimant shall be determinative of the existence of or amount of Indemnifiable Damages relating to such matter. In the event that the Sellers Representative has consented to any such settlement or resolution, neither the Sellers Representative nor any Seller shall have any power or authority to object (including pursuant to Section 9.6 or any other provision of this Section 9) to the amount of any claim by or on behalf of any Indemnified Person against the Escrow Fund for indemnity with respect to such settlement or resolution. 

  

 9.10. _Sellers Claims Against the Company_. If Closing occurs, the Sellers agree that they will not seek, nor will they be entitled to, contribution from, or indemnification by, the Company, under its Charter Document, this Agreement, applicable corporate laws or other laws or otherwise, whether in respect of amounts due from the Sellers to the Purchaser under this Section 9 or otherwise under this Agreement, or for any other reason, and the Sellers will hold the Company, Purchaser and or any Indemnified Person harmless in respect of all such amounts and shall not seek to join the Company in connection with any suit arising under this Agreement or arising in connection with their service as a mangers, directors, officers, employees or agents of the Company prior to the Closing Date. Without limiting the foregoing, the Sellers, as Members of the Company, shall not demand nor shall any of them be entitled to receive a return of its contribution to the Company, and any such demand or right shall be deemed satisfied in full and waived by the payment of the Purchase Price in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. The Sellers also agrees that they will not make claim against any directors and officers insurance policy maintained or to be maintained by the Company in respect of amounts due by the Sellers to the Purchaser or any Indemnified Person under this Section 9, this Agreement or otherwise, if the carrier of such insurance policy would have any right of subrogation against the Company in respect of such claim and shall indemnify and hold harmless the Purchaser from any such action. The provisions of this Section 9.10 shall not be deemed a waiver by any of the Sellers for any indemnification or other rights any of them may have by reason of their employment by, or services to, the Company (or any successor thereto) following Closing. 

  

 9.11. _Apportionment_. In the case of any Taxes that are payable for a taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date, the portion of such Taxes that relates to the portion of 

   ##### 

  

    

such taxable period ending on the Closing Date shall (a) in the case of any
real property, personal property or other ad valorem Taxes be deemed to be
the amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the taxable period
ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days
in the entire taxable period, and (b) in the case of any other Tax be deemed
equal to the amount that would be payable if the relevant taxable period
ended on the Closing Date based on a closing of the books as of the close of
business on the Closing Date. 

  

10\. General Provisions. 

   

 10.1. _Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants_. If the Closing occurs, the representations and warranties of the Sellers and the Company contained in this Agreement, the Disclosure Schedule (including any exhibit or schedule to the Disclosure Schedule), and the other certificates contemplated hereby shall survive the Closing and remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation or disclosure made by or on behalf of any of the parties to this Agreement, until the end of the Escrow Period; provided, however, that (i) the representations and warranties of the Company contained in Section 3.3 (Capital Structure), Section 3.4 (Title to Interest), 3.5 (Authority; Non-Contravention), Section 3.12 (Intellectual Property and Internet Practices) or Section 3.14 (Tax Matters) will remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation or disclosure made by or on behalf of any of the parties to this Agreement, until the date that is 30 days after the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations for claims against the Sellers, which seek recovery of Indemnifiable Damages arising out of an inaccuracy or breach of such representations or warranties, and then expire with respect to any theretofore unasserted claims arising out of or otherwise in respect of any breach of such representations and warranties; (ii) no right to indemnification pursuant to Section 9 in respect of any claim that is set forth in an Officers Certificate delivered to the Escrow Agent prior to the expiration of the Escrow Period shall be affected by the expiration of such representations and warranties; and (iii) such expiration shall not affect the rights of any Indemnified Person under Section 9 or otherwise to seek recovery of Indemnifiable Damages arising out of any fraud, willful breach or intentional misrepresentation by the Company or any Subsidiary until the date that is 30 days after the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. If the Closing occurs, the representations, warranties and convents of Purchaser contained in this Agreement and the other certificates contemplated hereby shall expire and be of no further force or effect as of the Closing. If the Closing occurs, all covenants of the parties shall expire and be of no further force or effect as of the Closing, except to the extent such covenants provide that they are to survive or be performed after the Closing; provided, however, that no right to indemnification pursuant to Section 9 in respect of any claim based upon any breach of a covenant shall be affected by the expiration of such covenant. 

  

 10.2. _Notices_. All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed given if as follows: (a) if sent by registered or certified mail return receipt requested, upon receipt; (b) if sent designated for overnight delivery by nationally recognized overnight air courier (such as DHL or Federal Express), three business days after delivery to such courier; (c) if sent by facsimile transmission on a business day before 5:00 p.m. in time zone of the recipient, when transmitted and full receipt is electronically confirmed; (d) if sent by facsimile transmission on a business day after 5:00 p.m. in the time zone of the recipient or on a non-business day and full receipt is electronically confirmed, on the following business day; and (e) if otherwise actually personally delivered, when delivered, provided that such notices, requests, demands and other communications are delivered to the address set forth below, or to such other address as any party shall provide by like notice to the other parties to this Agreement:
