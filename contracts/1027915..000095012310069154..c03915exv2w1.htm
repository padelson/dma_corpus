in cash an amount equal to not less than the aggregate par value of such shares and by
executing and delivering to the Company a promissory note having a principal amount equal to
the balance of such purchase price, or any combination of the foregoing. Any such
promissory note shall accrue simple interest at the rate of eight percent (8%) per annum,

shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration which such holder
has the right to receive in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock formerly
represented by such Certificate, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be

holders of Certificates. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Company
Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the Merger
Consideration may be issued to a transferee if the Certificate representing such shares of
Company Common Stock is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents required

Taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this <U>Section&nbsp;4.2</U>, each

Information</U>,&#148; which is defined as any information, whether written, verbal, electronic or
otherwise, that is disclosed or made available to the Recipient by HealthGrades, its affiliates or
its clients in connection with the Transaction. Such &#147;Confidential Information&#148; may include, but
is not limited to, (i)&nbsp;reports, manuals, training materials, presentations, questionnaires,
analyses, tools, software, specifications, business plans or calculations and (ii)&nbsp;all materials
prepared by the Recipient or any of its Representatives to the extent containing, reflecting or
based upon, in whole or in part, any Confidential Information, and in each case regardless of
whether or not specifically marked as confidential. The Recipient acknowledges that the
Confidential Information constitutes protectable trade secrets and other sensitive information, and
agrees to hold the Confidential Information in confidence.

time, without the prior written consent of an authorized representative of HealthGrades, use for
itself or others, or disclose to any other entity or person, any of the Confidential Information,
except that the Recipient may use such Confidential Information solely in connection with the
Transaction and its evaluation thereof, and may provide such information to its directors,
officers, employees, agents, attorneys, accountants, consultants, bankers, financial sources,
advisors and any representatives of advisors (collectively, the Recipient&#146;s
&#147;<U>Representatives</U>,&#148;
<U>provided</U> that no person other than the Recipient&#146;s employees, officers or directors
shall be considered a Representative unless they receive Confidential Information from or on behalf
of the Recipient) on a need to know basis in connection with the Transaction and its evaluation
thereof. The Recipient will advise the Representatives of the confidential nature of the
Confidential Information, and will be responsible for any use of the Confidential Information by
the Representatives in violation of the terms of this Agreement.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt; text-indent: 4%">3.&nbsp;Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, each Party acknowledges that
Confidential Information shall not include information which: a) already is in the Recipient&#146;s or
any of its Representatives&#146; possession, b) is or becomes publicly known through no wrongful act of
the Recipient; c) is obtained from a third person who is not, to the knowledge of the Recipient,
prohibited from transmitting the Confidential Information to the Recipient or any of its
Representatives by a contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation to HealthGrades; or d) is

Agreement.

Confidential Information a) is explicitly approved for release by written authorization of
HealthGrades; or b) if the Recipient or any of its Representatives becomes (or if it is reasonably
likely that the Recipient or any of its Representatives shall become) required by applicable law,
regulation or any subpoena, court, arbitration or other legal process, or reasonably believes based
on advice from its counsel that it is, legally required to disclose any Confidential Information,
<U>provided</U> that the Party making the disclosure has given prompt notice to HealthGrades, to
the extent practicable without prejudicing any of the Recipient&#146;s or its
Representatives&#146; legal rights, privileges or obligations or unless prohibited by law, so
that HealthGrades, at HealthGrades&#146; sole cost and expense, may seek a protective order or other
appropriate remedy or waive compliance with the terms of this Agreement. In the event that no such
protective order is obtained within a reasonable period of time or compliance with the terms of
this Agreement are not waived, the Recipient or its Representatives, as applicable, shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to disclose only that portion of Confidential Information that the
Recipient or its Representatives, as applicable, are advised by counsel is required. Such
disclosure shall not be a violation of this Agreement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt; text-indent: 4%">5.&nbsp;HealthGrades agrees that the Recipient will have no obligation to continue to participate
in any negotiations or other activities in connection with the Transaction or the Recipient&#146;s
evaluation thereof or to effect the Transaction except pursuant to a definitive agreement (a
&#147;<U>Definitive Agreement</U>&#148;) executed by the Recipient and acceptable to the Recipient in its
sole and absolute discretion. Recipient agrees that HealthGrades reserves the right, in its sole
discretion, to both reject any and all proposals made by Recipient or its Representatives with
regard to a Transaction and/or to terminate discussions and negotiations with the Recipient or any
of its Representatives at any time for any reason or no reason. Except as otherwise agreed by the
Parties in a Definitive Agreement, all Confidential Information disclosed shall remain the sole
property of HealthGrades, and all documents and other materials constituting Confidential
Information shall remain the property of HealthGrades or its client. Upon request of HealthGrades,
the Recipient will immediately return to HealthGrades or destroy, at the Recipient&#146;s election, any
written material containing or reflecting Confidential Information (whether prepared by
HealthGrades, its advisors or otherwise) and will not retain any copies,
extracts or other reproductions in whole or in part of such written material;
<U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that the Recipient and its Representatives a) may retain i) any
attorney work product created in connection with the Recipient&#146;s evaluation and negotiation of a
Transaction, and ii) so much of the information as the Recipient or any of its Representatives
reasonably believes is necessary to comply with any legal, regulatory or data production
requirements, and b) will not be obligated to erase any Confidential Information that is contained
in an archived computer system backup in accordance with such Party&#146;s security and/or disaster
recovery procedures, and, in each case, such Confidential Information will continue to be subject
to the terms of this Agreement.

Recipient hereby agrees that, for a period of one (1)&nbsp;year from the date hereof, it will not, and
will cause its Representatives (other than third party advisors) not to, directly or indirectly,
without obtaining the prior written consent of HealthGrades, solicit for employment, hire or employ
any current employees of HealthGrades or any of its affiliates; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>,

Recipient&#146;s obligations under this Agreement are not specifically enforced and that HealthGrades
may not have an adequate remedy at law in the event of an actual or threatened violation by the
Recipient of its obligations. Therefore, the Recipient agrees that HealthGrades shall be entitled
to seek injunctive relief against any actual or threatened violations or breathes by the Recipient
without the necessity of HealthGrades showing actual damages or that monetary damages would not
afford an adequate remedy. In the event that any dispute between the Parties should result in
arbitration or litigation, the prevailing Party in such dispute shall be entitled to recover from
the
losing Party all fees, costs and expenses in connection with such arbitration or litigation,
including without limitation, such reasonable fees, costs and expenses of attorneys and
accountants, which shall include, without limitation, all reasonable fees, costs and expenses of
appeals.
