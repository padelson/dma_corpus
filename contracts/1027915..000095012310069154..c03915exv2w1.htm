in compliance with Rule 14e-1(c) promulgated under the Exchange Act. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

(g) _Schedule TO; Offer Documents_. As soon as practicable on the date the
Offer is commenced (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 promulgated under the
Exchange Act), Parent and Merger Sub shall: (i) file with the SEC a Tender
Offer Statement on Schedule TO (together with all amendments and supplements
thereto, and including all exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule TO_") with
respect to the Offer, which shall contain as an exhibit or incorporate by
reference an offer to purchase (the " _Offer to Purchase_ "), and forms of
the related letter of transmittal, a summary advertisement, if any, in respect
of the Offer, and such other ancillary documents and instruments to which the
Offer will be made or which are required to be filed in connection with the
filing of the Schedule TO (collectively, together with any supplements or

Documents to be disseminated to the Company Stockholders. The Company shall
promptly furnish to Parent and Merger Sub in writing all information
concerning the Company that may be required by applicable Law or
reasonably requested by Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion in the Schedule TO
and the Offer Documents. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall
promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule TO or
the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information shall have
become false or misleading in any material respect. Parent and Merger Sub
shall take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule TO and the Offer
Documents, as so corrected, to be filed with the SEC and the other Offer
Documents, as so corrected, to be disseminated to the Company Stockholders,
in each case as and to the extent required by applicable Laws. Parent and
Merger Sub shall provide the Company and its counsel a reasonable opportunity
to review and comment on the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents (and any
amendments thereto required to be filed with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange
Act) prior to the filing thereof with the SEC, and Parent and Merger Sub
shall give reasonable consideration to any such comments. Parent and Merger
Sub shall provide to the Company and its counsel copies of any and all

or their counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Schedule TO and the Offer Documents promptly after receipt thereof, and Parent
and Merger Sub shall provide the Company and its counsel a reasonable
opportunity to participate in the formulation of any response to any such
comments of the SEC or its staff.

Section 2.2 _Top-Up Option_. 

   

(a) The Company grants to Parent and Merger Sub an irrevocable option (the "
_Top-Up Option_ "), exercisable only after the Acceptance Time and only upon
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, to purchase from
the Company the lowest number (but not less than that number) of newly-issued
and/or treasury shares of Company Common Stock that, when added to the number
of shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent or Merger Sub at the time
of exercise of the Top-Up Option, constitutes one share more than 90% of the
number of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately after the
issuance of all shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Top-Up Option
or, as may be elected by Parent, the sum of (x) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock outstanding immediately after the issuance of all shares
of Company Common Stock subject to the Top-Up Option plus (y) all  shares of
Company Common Stock which the Company may be required to issue as of such
date upon the vesting (including vesting solely as a result of the
consummation of the Offer), conversion or exercise of all Company Options,
the Company Warrant and other derivative securities, including warrants,
options, convertible or exchangeable securities or other rights to acquire
Company Common Stock, regardless of the conversion or exercise price or other
terms and conditions thereof (the " _Short Form Threshold_"); _provided_ , 
_however_ , that the Top-Up Option shall not be exercisable (i) to the extent
the number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the
Top-Up Option would exceed the Companys then authorized and unissued shares
of Company Common Stock (including as authorized and unissued shares of
Company Common Stock, for purposes of this _Section 2.2_ , any shares of
Company Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries), and (ii) if immediately after such exercise and the issuance
of  shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Top-Up Option, the Short
Form Threshold would not be reached. 

   

(b) The Top-Up Option may be exercised by Parent or Merger Sub at any time at
or after the Acceptance Time. The aggregate purchase price payable for the
shares of Company Common Stock being purchased by Parent or Merger Sub
pursuant to the Top-Up Option shall be determined by multiplying the number
of such shares by the Offer Price. Such purchase price may be paid by Parent
or Merger Sub, at its election, either entirely in cash or by paying in cash
an amount equal to not less than the aggregate par value of such shares and
by executing and delivering to the Company a promissory note having a
principal amount equal to the balance of such purchase price, or any
combination of the foregoing. Any such promissory note shall accrue simple
interest at the rate of eight percent (8%) per annum, shall mature on the
first anniversary of the date of execution and delivery of such promissory
note and may be prepaid at any time and from time to time without premium
or penalty or prior notice. The unpaid principal amount and accrued interest
under such promissory note shall immediately become due and payable in the
event that (x) Merger Sub fails to make any payment of interest on the
promissory note as provided therein and such failure continues for a period
of 30 days or (y) Merger Sub files or has filed against it any petition under
any bankruptcy or insolvency law or makes a general assignment for
the benefit of creditors. 

   

(c) In the event Parent or Merger Sub wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option,
Parent or Merger Sub shall deliver to the Company a notice setting forth (i)
the number of shares of Company Common Stock that Parent or Merger Sub
intends to purchase pursuant to the Top-Up Option, (ii) the manner in which
Parent or Merger Sub intends to pay the applicable exercise price, and (iii)
the place and time at which the closing of the purchase of such shares
of Company Common Stock by Parent or Merger Sub is to take place. At the
closing of the purchase of such shares of Company Common Stock, Parent or
Merger Sub shall cause to be delivered to the Company the consideration
required to be delivered in exchange for such  shares, and the Company shall
cause to be issued to Parent or Merger Sub (as the case may be) a certificate
representing such shares. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

(d) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that the Shares which the Parent and
Merger Sub may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option shall not be
registered under the Securities Act and shall be issued in reliance upon an
exemption for transactions not involving a public offering. Parent and Merger
Sub agree that the Top-Up Option, and the shares to be issued upon exercise
of the Top-Up Option, if any, are being and shall be acquired by Parent and
Merger Sub for the purpose of investment and not with a view to, or for resale
in connection with, any distribution thereof (within the meaning of the
Securities Act). 

   

Section 2.3 _Schedule 14D-9_. 

   

(a) _Schedule 14D-9_. As promptly as practicable on the date of commencement
of the Offer (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 promulgated under the Exchange
Act), the Company shall (i) file with the SEC a Solicitation/Recommendation
Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with all amendments and supplements
thereto, and including all exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_"), and
(ii) cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be mailed to the Company Stockholders. To
the extent reasonably practicable, the Schedule 14D-9 shall be filed with the
SEC concurrently with the filing by Parent and Merger Sub of the Schedule TO
and shall be mailed to the Company Stockholders with the Offer Documents (and
if so, the expense thereof shall be borne by Parent in connection with its
dissemination of the Offer Documents). Subject to the provisions of _Section
7.6(d)_ hereof, the Schedule 14D-9 shall include a description of the
determinations and approvals and recommendations of the Company Board set
forth in _Section 5.3(d)_, including the Company Board Recommendation. Each
of Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly furnish to the Company upon request
all information concerning Parent and Merger Sub that may be required by
applicable Laws or reasonably requested by the Company for inclusion in the
Schedule 14D-9. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly
correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and
to the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in
any material respect. The Company shall take all steps necessary to cause the
Schedule 14D-9, as so corrected, to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to
the Company Stockholders, in each case as and to the extent required by
applicable Laws. Except in connection with a disclosure regarding a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change or an Acquisition Proposal, the Company shall
provide Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 and any amendments thereto required to be
filed with the SEC pursuant to Rule 14D-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act,
in any case prior to the filing thereof with the SEC. Except in
connection with a disclosure regarding a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change or an Acquisition Proposal, the Company shall provide to Parent,
Merger Sub and their counsel any written or oral comments the Company or its
counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule
14D-9 promptly upon receipt thereof, and the Company shall provide
Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel a reasonable opportunity to participate
in the formulation of any response to any such comments of the SEC or its
staff. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

(b) _Company Information_. In connection with the Offer, the Company shall,
or shall cause its transfer agent to, promptly following a request by Parent,
furnish Parent, at Parents cost and expense, with such information as Parent
or its Representatives may reasonably request in order to disseminate and
otherwise communicate the Offer to the record and beneficial holders of
Company Common Stock, including a list, as of the most recent practicable
date, of the Company Stockholders, mailing labels and any available listing
or computer files containing the names and addresses of all record
and beneficial holders of Company Common Stock, and lists of security
positions of Company Common Stock held in stock depositories (including
updated lists of stockholders, mailing labels, listings or files of
securities positions). Subject to any and all applicable Laws, and except for
such steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any
other documents necessary to consummate the Offer and the Merger, Parent and
Merger Sub shall (and shall cause their respective Representatives to): 

   

(i) hold in confidence the information contained in any such lists
of stockholders, mailing labels and listings or files of securities positions
on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the NDA; 

   

(ii) use such information only in connection with the Offer and the Merger;
and 

   

(iii) if (A) this Agreement shall be terminated and/or (B) Parent and
Merger Sub shall irrevocably withdraw the Offer, deliver (and shall cause
their Representatives to deliver) to the Company any and all copies and any
extracts or summaries from such information then in their possession or under
their control. 

   

Section 2.4 _Company Board and Company Board Committees_. 

   

(a) _Composition of Company Board and Board Committees_. Effective upon
the initial acceptance for payment by Merger Sub of shares of Company Common
Stock pursuant to the Offer (the " _Acceptance Time_ ," the use of which term
herein shall not, unless the context otherwise requires, depend upon whether
Parent shall exercise its rights under this  _Section 2.4(a)_) and from time
to time thereafter, Parent shall be entitled to designate up to such number
of directors on the Company Board equal to the product (rounded up to the
next whole number) obtained by multiplying (i) the number of directors on
the Company Board (giving effect to any increase in the number of directors
pursuant to this  _Section 2.4_) and (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which
is the number of shares of Company Common Stock held by Parent and Merger Sub
(giving effect to the shares of Company Common Stock purchased pursuant to
the Offer and, if the Top-Up Option is exercised, the  shares of Company
Common Stock purchased upon the exercise of the Top-Up Option), and
the denominator of which is the total number of then outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock. Promptly following a request by Parent, the Company
shall cause the individuals so designated by Parent to be elected or
appointed to the Company Board, including (at the election of Parent) either
by increasing the size of the Company Board or by seeking and accepting or
otherwise securing the resignations of such number of then incumbent
directors as is necessary to enable the individuals so designated by Parent
to be elected or appointed to the Company Board (the date on which the
majority of the Companys directors are designees of Parent that have been
effectively elected or appointed to the Company Board in accordance herewith,
the " _Board Appointment Date_ "). From time to time after the
Acceptance Time, the Company shall take all action necessary to cause the
individuals so designated by Parent to constitute substantially the same
percentage (rounding up where appropriate) as is on the Company Board on each
committee of the Company Board the fullest extent permitted by all applicable
Laws, including the rules of the Nasdaq. Solely for purposes of this 
_Section 2.4_, any and all members of the Company Board immediately prior to
such appointments by Parent who remain on the Company Board after such
appointments by Parent shall be referred to as " _Continuing Directors_." 

 

    ##### 

  

   

(b) _Continued Listing_. In the event that Parents designees are elected
or appointed to the Company Board pursuant to _Section 2.4(a)_, until the
Effective Time, the Company Board shall have at least such number of
directors as may be required by the rules of the Nasdaq or the federal
securities Laws who are considered independent directors within the meaning
of such Laws (" _Independent Directors_ "); _provided_ , that in the event
the number of Independent Directors shall be reduced below the number of
directors as may be required by such Laws for any reason whatsoever, the
remaining Independent Director(s) shall be entitled to designate persons to
fill such vacancies who shall be deemed to be Independent Directors for
purposes of this Agreement or, if no other Independent Director then remains,
the other directors shall designate such number of directors as may be
required by the rules of the Nasdaq or the federal securities Laws, to fill
such vacancies who shall not be stockholders or Affiliates of Parent or Merger
Sub, and such Persons shall be deemed to be Independent Directors for
purposes of this Agreement. 

   

(c) _Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act_. The Companys obligation to
appoint Parents designees to the Company Board pursuant to _Section 2.4(a)_
hereof shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1
promulgated thereunder. The Company shall promptly take all action required
pursuant to this _Section 2.4_ and Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and
Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder in order to fulfill its obligations under
this _Section 2.4_, and shall include in the Schedule 14D-9 such information
with respect to the Company and its directors and officers as is required
under such Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 in order to fulfill its obligations
under this _Section 2.4_. Parent shall provide to the Company in writing, and
be responsible for any information with respect to itself and its nominees,
directors, officers and Affiliates, required by such Section 14(f) of the
Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder. The provisions of this
_Section 2.4_ are in addition to, and shall not limit, any right that Merger
Sub, Parent or any affiliate of Merger Sub or Parent may have (with respect
to the election of directors or otherwise) under applicable Laws as a holder
or beneficial owner of shares of Company Common Stock. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

(d) _Required Approvals of Continuing Directors_. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, in the event that Parents
designees are elected or appointed to the Company Board prior to the
Effective Time pursuant to _Section 2.4(a)_ hereof and there shall be any
Continuing Directors, the approval of a majority of such Continuing Directors
(or the sole Continuing Director if there shall be only one (1) Continuing
Director) shall be required in order to, prior to the Effective Time, (i)
amend or terminate this Agreement, or agree or consent to any amendment
or termination of this Agreement, in any case on behalf of the Company, (ii)
extend the time for performance of, or waive, any of the obligations or other
acts of Parent or Merger Sub under this Agreement, (iii) waive any of the
Companys rights under this Agreement, or (iv) make any other determination
with respect to any action to be taken or not to be taken by or on behalf of
the Company relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger. If asked to take any
of the actions or to perform any of the duties set forth in this _Section
2.4(d)_, and with respect to any transactions where Parent has or reasonably
may be deemed to have interests that are materially different from or in
addition to the interests of the non-affiliate holders of Common Stock, the
Continuing Directors will have the authority to retain at the expense of the
Company one firm of independent counsel and other advisors as are reasonably
appropriate to the exercise and discharge of their fiduciary and other duties
and their obligations under this Agreement. In addition, the approval of the
Continuing Directors will be the only approval of the Company Board necessary
to institute any action by the Company to enforce the performance of this
Agreement and the Continuing Directors are hereby authorized to do so.

Surviving Corporation shall, subject to _Section 7.13_ hereof, be amended

prior to the Effective Time, shall become the by-laws of the Surviving

ARTICLE IV 
 CONVERSION OF SECURITIES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES 

   

Section 4.1 _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or their respective equityholders, the following shall occur: 

   

(a) _Conversion Generally_. Each share of Company Common Stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (i) any
shares of Company Common Stock to be cancelled pursuant to _Section 4.1(b)_,
and (ii) Dissenting Shares) shall be converted, subject to _Section 4.1(d)_,
into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the Offer Price, payable
to the holder thereof, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "),
payable in the manner set forth in _Section 4.2_. At the Effective Time, all
such shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each Certificate
which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares
shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration
therefor. 

   

(b) _Cancellation of Certain Shares_. Each share of Company Common Stock held
by Parent or Merger Sub or in the treasury of the Company immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and extinguished without any
conversion thereof and no payment shall be made with respect thereto. 

   

(c) _Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share,
of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into and be exchanged for one newly and validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of the Surviving Corporation. 

   

(d) _Change in Shares_. The Merger Consideration shall be adjusted
appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split,
stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities
convertible into Company Common Stock), cash dividend, reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of  shares or other
like change with respect to Company Common Stock occurring or with a
record date on or after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time, and
such adjustment to the Merger Consideration shall provide to the holders of
Company Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this
Agreement prior to such action; _provided_ that nothing in this _Section
4.1(d)_ shall be construed to permit the Company to take any action with
respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement. 

   

Section 4.2 _Exchange of Certificates_. 

   

(a) _Paying Agent_. At the Closing, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to
be deposited, with a bank or trust company designated by Parent and
reasonably satisfactory to the Company (the " _Paying Agent_ "), for the
benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, for exchange in
accordance with this _Article IV_, through the Paying Agent, cash in U.S.
dollars in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate amount of the Merger
Consideration payable in connection with the Merger (such cash, the "
_Exchange Fund_ ") pursuant to _Section 4.1_ in exchange for outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock. The Paying Agent shall deliver the Merger
Consideration contemplated to be paid pursuant to _Section 4.1_ out of the
Exchange Fund. The Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as
directed by Parent; _provided_ ,

 

    ##### 

  

   

 _however_ , that: (i) no such investment or losses thereon shall affect the
Merger Consideration payable to the holders of Company Common Stock; and (ii)
such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United
States of America or any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the
full faith and credit of the United States of America, in commercial paper
obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or
Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of
deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial
banks with capital exceeding $1 billion (based on the most recent financial
statements of such bank that are then publicly available). Any net profit
resulting from, or interest or income produced by, such investments shall be
payable to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, and any amounts in excess of
the amounts payable pursuant to _Section 4.1_ shall be promptly returned
to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, in each case as directed by Parent.
The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. 

   

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly following the Effective Time (but in
no event later than three (3) Business Days following the Effective Time),
Parent shall instruct the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a
certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Certificates_
," it being understood that any references herein to " _Certificates_ " shall
be deemed to include references to book-entry account statements relating to
the ownership of shares of Company Common Stock) and whose shares of Company
Common Stock have been converted into the right to receive Merger
Consideration pursuant to _Section 4.1_ (i) a letter of transmittal in
customary form and with such other provisions as Parent may determine (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to
the Paying Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of
a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent together with such letter
of transmittal, properly completed and duly executed, and such other
documents as may be reasonably required pursuant to such instructions (or, if
such shares are held in book-entry or other uncertificated form, upon the
entry through a book-entry transfer agent of the surrender of such shares on
a book-entry account statement), the holder of such Certificate shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration which such
holder has the right to receive in respect of the shares of Company Common
Stock formerly represented by such Certificate, and the Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued
on any Merger Consideration payable to holders of Certificates. In the event
of a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock which is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, the Merger Consideration
may be issued to a transferee if the Certificate representing such shares
of Company Common Stock is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all
documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that
any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this _Section 4.2_, each Certificate shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon
such surrender the Merger Consideration or the right to demand to be paid the
"fair value" of the shares represented thereby as contemplated by _Section
4.3_. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

(c) _Further Rights in Company Common Stock_. All Merger Consideration paid
in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been issued in
full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common
Stock. 

   

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
which remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for six
(6) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving
Corporation upon demand, and any holders of Company Common Stock who have not
theretofore complied with this _Article IV_ shall thereafter look only to
the Surviving Corporation as general creditors thereof for the payment of the
Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon. Any amounts
remaining unclaimed by holders of Certificates as of a date immediately prior
to such time that such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property
of any Governmental Entity shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become property of the Surviving Corporation on such date, free and clear of
any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. 

   

(e) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (d) above,
none of Parent, the Company, the Paying Agent or the Surviving Corporation
shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any cash
from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. 

   

(f) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable and
customary amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it with respect to such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration, without any
interest thereon. 

   

(g) _No Further Dividends_. No dividends or other distributions with respect
to capital stock of the Surviving Corporation with a record date on or after
the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificates. 

  

Section 4.3 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, any shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and are held by a
stockholder (each, a " _Dissenting Stockholder_ ") who is entitled to
exercise, and properly exercises, dissenters rights with respect to such
shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the provisions of
Section 262 of the DGCL (collectively, the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not
be converted into or exchangeable for or represent the right to receive the
Merger Consideration (except as provided in this _Section 4.3_ ) and shall
entitle such Dissenting Stockholder only to payment of the fair value of
such Dissenting Shares as may be determined to be due to the holder of such
Dissenting Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL, unless and
until such Dissenting Stockholder withdraws (in accordance with Section
262(k) of the DGCL) or effectively loses

the right to appraisal. If any Dissenting Stockholder shall have effectively
withdrawn (in accordance with Section 262(k) of the DGCL) or lost the right
to appraisal, then as of the later of the Effective Time or the occurrence of
such event, the Dissenting Shares held by such Dissenting Stockholder shall
be cancelled and converted into and represent the right to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 4.1_ without interest. The Company
shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make
(or cause or permit to be made on its behalf) any payment with respect to, or
settle or offer to settle, or otherwise negotiate with, any Dissenting
Stockholder regarding its exercise of dissenters rights prior to the
Effective Time. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any such
demands prior to the Effective Time, and Parent shall have the right to
participate in and control all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
any exercise by any Company Stockholder of dissenters rights. Notwithstanding
the generality of the foregoing, if the Merger becomes effective without a
meeting of Company Stockholders in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL,
the parties hereby agree that any holder of shares of Company Common Stock
that is entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL may demand
the appraisal of such shares, in accordance with the provisions of
Section 262(d)(2) of the DGCL. For the avoidance of doubt, it is acknowledged
and agreed that, in any appraisal proceeding with respect to the Dissenting
Shares and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, the fair value
of the Dissenting Shares shall be determined in accordance with Section
262(h) of the DGCL without regard to the Top-Up Option, the shares of Company
Common Stock issued pursuant to the Top-Up Option or any promissory note
delivered by Parent or Merger Sub to the Company in payment for the shares of
Company Common Stock issued pursuant to the Top-Up Option. 

  

Section 4.4 _Stock Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed (after giving effect to the items
contemplated by this _Article IV_ ) and thereafter there shall be no further
registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time on the records of the Company. From
and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates shall cease to have
any rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock except as
otherwise provided herein or by Law. 

   

Section 4.5 _Company Options, Company Restricted Stock and Company Warrant_. 

   

(a) _Waivers_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain any necessary waivers, consents or
releases, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, from
holders of Company Options, Company Restricted Stock and the Company Warrant
required to give effect to the transactions contemplated by this  _Section
4.5_. 

   

(b) _All Necessary Actions_. As promptly as practicable following the date
of this Agreement, the Company Board (or, if appropriate, any committee
thereof administering the Company Stock Plans) shall adopt such resolutions
or take such other actions as are required to give effect to the transactions
contemplated by this _Section 4.5_. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

(c) _Company Options_. At the Effective Time, each Company Option that is
then outstanding shall be cancelled and, in exchange therefor, Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to pay to each former holder of any such
cancelled Company Option as soon as practicable following the Effective Time
a cash amount equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of the per
share Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of such Company
Option, and (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock covered by such
Company Option, subject to applicable income and employment withholding
Taxes; _provided_ that if the exercise price per share of any such
Company Option is equal to or greater than the per share Merger
Consideration, such Company Option shall be canceled without any cash payment
being made in respect thereof. Promptly following the date of this Agreement,
the Company shall deliver written notice to each holder of a Company Option
informing such holder of the effect of the Merger on the Company Options. 

   

(d) _Company Restricted Stock_. Either (i) upon the commencement of the Offer
or (ii) immediately prior to the Acceptance Time, pursuant to the terms of
the applicable award agreement, each award of restricted Company Common Stock
(the " _Company Restricted Stock_ ") shall become fully vested and all
restrictions on the award shall lapse and each holder thereof shall have the
right to tender (or to direct the Company to tender on his or her behalf) the
shares of Company Common Stock underlying the award of Company
Restricted Stock then held (net of any shares of Company Common Stock
withheld to satisfy employment and income Tax obligations) into the Offer. To
the extent any shares of Company Common Stock that were formerly Company
Restricted Stock are not so tendered, upon the Effective Time, they shall be
converted into the right to receive the Offer Price in accordance with the
procedures set forth in _Section 4.2(b)_. 

   

(e) _Company Warrant_. At the Effective Time, the Company Warrant, whether
or not then exercisable and without any action on the part of the Company or
the holder of the Company Warrant, shall be converted automatically into the
right to receive at the Effective Time an amount in cash equal to the product
of (i) the excess, if any, of the per share Merger Consideration over the
exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to the Company
Warrant, and (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock for which
the Company Warrant is exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time,
without interest and subject to applicable withholding Taxes; _provided_ that
if the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to the
Company Warrant is equal to or greater than the per share Merger
Consideration, the Company Warrant shall be canceled without any cash payment
being made in respect thereof. As of the Effective Time, the Company Warrant
shall be deemed exercised and be of no further force or effect and the holder
thereof shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right
to receive the consideration set forth in this _Section 4.5(e)_. 

  

Section 4.6 _Withholding_. Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or
the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold or cause to be
deducted and withheld from any consideration otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement such amounts as Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation
or the Paying Agent are required to deduct and withhold under the Code,
or any provision of state, local or non-United States Tax Law, with respect
to the making of such payment. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or
withheld, such deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of whom such
deduction and withholding was made.

 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY 

   

Except (i) as expressly disclosed in the Annual Reports on Form 10-K,
Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K (other than
those furnished pursuant to Item 2.02 or Item 7.01) filed by the Company with
the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act (other than any disclosures contained or
referenced therein under the captions " _Risk Factors_ ," " _Forward-
Looking Statements_ ," " _Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About
Market Risk_ " and any other disclosures contained or referenced therein of
information, factors or risks that are predictive, cautionary or forward-
looking in nature), in each case on or after December 31, 2007 and prior
to the date of this Agreement (the " _Recent SEC Reports_ ") (it being
understood that any matter disclosed in any Recent SEC Report shall be deemed
to be disclosed in a section of the Company Disclosure Schedule only to the
extent that it is reasonably apparent from such disclosure in such Recent SEC
Report that such disclosure is applicable to such section of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, other than any matters required to be disclosed for
purposes of _Section 5.2_ (Capitalization) of this Agreement which matters
shall be specifically disclosed in _Section 5.2_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule) or (ii) as set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule, the
Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows: 

  

Section 5.1 _Organization and Qualification_. The Company is a corporation
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the
State of Delaware. Each Subsidiary of the Company (each, a " _Company
Subsidiary_ ") is duly organized, is validly existing and, where such concept
is recognized, in good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its
incorporation or organization, as the case may be, except to the extent the
failure of any such Company Subsidiary to be in good standing would not have
a Company Material Adverse Effect.  _Section 5.1_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule contains a correct and complete list of all of the Company
Subsidiaries, the ownership interest of the Company in each Company
Subsidiary, and the ownership interest of any other Person or Persons in each
Company Subsidiary. Each of the Company and each Company Subsidiary has the
requisite corporate or similar power and authority to own, lease and operate
its properties and assets and to carry on its business as
presently conducted, except where the failure to have such power or authority
would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company and each
Company Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed to do business, and, where
such concept is recognized, is in good standing, in each jurisdiction
where the character of the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the
nature of its business makes such qualification, licensing or good standing
necessary, except for such failures to be so qualified, licensed or in good
standing that would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company
has delivered to Parent complete and correct copies of the certificate of
incorporation and by-laws (or similar organizational documents) of the
Company and each Company Subsidiary, each as amended to date, and each as so
delivered is in full force and effect. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

Section 5.2 _Capitalization_. 

   

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 100,000,000 shares

exercise or settlement of Company Options have been duly reserved for issuance
by the Company, and upon any issuance of such shares in accordance with the
terms of the applicable Company Stock Plan, will be duly authorized, validly
issued and fully paid and nonassessable. 

   

(b) Except as set forth in _Section 5.2(a)_, there are no options, warrants
or other rights, agreements, arrangements or commitments of any character to
which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party or by which the
Company or any Company Subsidiary is bound relating to the issued or unissued
Equity Interests of the Company or obligating the Company to issue or sell
any Equity Interests in the Company. _Section 5.2(b)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule contains a complete and correct list of (i) the exercise
price for each outstanding Company Stock Option, and (ii) the outstanding

Company. Except as set forth in _Section 5.2(b)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, since July 27, 2010, the Company has not issued any Equity Interests
in the Company, except for issuances pursuant to exercise or settlement of
Company Options outstanding as of the close of business on July 27, 2010, and
only in accordance with the terms of such Company Options as in effect on
such date. There are no outstanding bonds, debentures, notes or other
indebtedness of the Company having the right to vote (or convertible into, or
exchangeable for, securities having the right to vote) on any matter on which
the Company Stockholders may vote. 

   

(c) Each outstanding share of capital stock or other Equity Interest of each
Company Subsidiary is duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid,
nonassessable and free of preemptive rights and is held, directly or
indirectly, by the Company or another Company Subsidiary free and clear of
all Liens. Except as set forth in _Section 5.2(c)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, there are no subscriptions, options, warrants, rights, calls,
contracts or other commitments, understandings, restrictions or arrangements

(d) _Section 5.2(d)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth the
name, jurisdiction of organization and the Companys (or the Company
Subsidiarys) percentage ownership of any and all Persons in which the
Company or any Company Subsidiary owns, or has the right or obligation to
acquire any Equity Interest (other than any Company Subsidiary)
(collectively, the " _Investments_ "). All of the Investments are owned by
the Company or by a Company Subsidiary free and clear of all Liens. Except
for the capital stock and other ownership interests of the Company
Subsidiaries and the Investments, the Company does not own, directly or
indirectly, any Equity Interest in any Person that is material to the
business of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. 

   

(e) Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has entered into
any Contract, or are otherwise obligated, to contribute capital, loan money
or otherwise provide funds or make additional investments in any other
Person, other than any such Contract entered into in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice with respect to wholly owned
Subsidiaries of the Company. There are no stockholder agreements,
voting trusts, proxies or other Contracts to which the Company or any Company
Subsidiary is a party or by which it is bound relating to the voting or
registration of any Equity Interests of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
or preemptive rights with respect thereto. 

   

Section 5.3 _Corporate Authority; Approval and Fairness_. 

   

(a) The Company has all necessary corporate power and authority to enter into
this Agreement and, subject to obtaining any necessary Company Stockholder
Approval, to perform its obligations hereunder. The execution and delivery of
this Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the Company of the
transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and validly authorized by all
necessary corporate action, and no other corporate proceedings on the part of
the Company and no stockholder votes are necessary to authorize this
Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby other than,
with respect to the Merger, the filing of appropriate merger documents as
required by the DGCL and any necessary Company Stockholder Approval. This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming
the due and valid execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and
Merger Sub, this Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation
of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms,
subject to bankruptcy, insolvency (including all Laws relating to fraudulent
transfers), reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws of general
applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights (the " _Bankruptcy
Exception_ "). 

   

(b) If the number of shares of Company Common Stock held by Merger Sub does
not meet the threshold required by Section 253 of the DGCL, the affirmative
vote of holders of a majority of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding
on the record date of the Company Stockholders Meeting, voting together as a
single class (the " _Company Stockholder Approval_ "), is the only vote of
the holders of any class or series of the Companys capital stock necessary
to adopt this Agreement and the Merger. 

   

(c) On or prior to the date of this Agreement, the Company Board has received
from Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (the " _Company Financial Advisor_ ") its
oral opinion, subject to the limitations, qualifications and assumptions set
forth therein, that the consideration to be received by the holders of
Company Common Stock in the Offer and the Merger, taken together, is fair
from a financial point of view to such holders, and such opinion has not been
withdrawn, revoked or modified on or prior to the date of this Agreement. The
Company will furnish a complete and correct copy of the Company
Financial Advisors written opinion to Parent promptly after receipt thereof
by the Company. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

(d) On or prior to the date of this Agreement, the Company Board (i) has

(ii) has unanimously authorized and approved this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, on the

Stockholders accept the Offer, tender their shares of Company Common Stock to
Merger Sub pursuant to the Offer and, if required by the DGCL, adopt this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (the " _Company Board
Recommendation_ "), which recommendation constitutes a recommendation of the
Company Board for purposes of Section 8.1 of the Company Certificate of
Incorporation and any Takeover Provisions. Such resolutions are sufficient to
render any "moratorium," "control share acquisition," "fair price,"
"interested stockholder," "affiliate transaction," "business combination" or
other antitakeover Laws, including Section 203 of the DGCL, or similar Law
that might otherwise apply to the Offer, the Merger, this Agreement, the
Support Agreements or any other transaction contemplated hereby or
thereby, and any restrictive provision in the Company Certificate of
Incorporation (including Section 8.2 of the Company Certificate of
Incorporation), the Company By-laws or comparable organizational documents of
any Company Subsidiary (collectively, the " _Takeover Provisions_ ")
inapplicable or satisfied with respect to (i) Parent or Merger Sub
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
Support Agreements, or (B) the Offer, the Merger, or any other transaction
contemplated by this Agreement or the Support Agreements. None of the actions
by the Company Board set forth in this _Section 5.3(d)_ , subject to _Section
7.6(d)_, has been subsequently withdrawn or modified in a manner adverse to
Parent. 

   

(e) The Company has been advised by each of its directors and executive
officers who are holders of shares of Company Common Stock that such
directors and executive officers intend to tender their shares of Company
Common Stock to Merger Sub pursuant to the Offer.

not required, conflict with or violate any provision of the Company

have been obtained prior to the Acceptance Time and all filings and

the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading. No Company Subsidiary is subject to the
periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. To the extent not
reported on the SECs EDGAR system, the Company has made available to Parent
correct and complete copies of all material correspondence between the SEC,
on the one hand, and the Company and any of the Company Subsidiaries, on the

consolidated Company Subsidiaries for the respective periods indicated
therein (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal adjustments
which, individually or in the aggregate, would not be material). The books

and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange
Act); such disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that
material information relating to the Company required to be included in
reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms and
is accumulated and made known to its principal executive officer and its
principal financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. 

   

(iii) Since the enactment of the Sarbanes Oxley Act, neither the Company
nor any Company Subsidiary has made any prohibited loans to any executive
officer of the Company (as defined in Rule 3b 7 under the Exchange Act) or
any director of the Company or any Company Subsidiary. There are no

Section 7.2 _Company Stockholders  Meeting; Proxy Statement_. 

   

(a) If approval of the Company Stockholders is required under applicable Law
in order to consummate the Merger, as promptly as practicable following the
later of the Acceptance Time or the expiration of any subsequent offering
period provided in accordance with Rule 14d-11 promulgated under the Exchange
Act, the Company, acting through the Company Board, shall, in accordance with
applicable Law and the Company Certificate of Incorporation and the Company
By-Laws (i) establish a record date for, call, give notice of, convene and
hold a meeting of the Company Stockholders (the " _Company Stockholders 
Meeting_") for the purpose of voting upon the adoption of this Agreement in
accordance with the DGCL. The Company shall solicit from the Company
Stockholders proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement in accordance
with Delaware Law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, the Companys obligation to establish a record date for, call,
give notice of, convene and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting pursuant
to this _Section 7.2(a)_ shall not be limited to, or otherwise affected by,
the commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission to the Company of
any Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall ensure that all proxies solicited
in connection with the Company Stockholders Meeting are solicited in
compliance with all applicable Laws. 

   

(b) In connection with the Company Stockholders Meeting, the Company shall
prepare and file with the SEC a proxy statement, letter to stockholders,
notice of meeting and form of proxy accompanying the Proxy Statement that
will be provided to the Company Stockholders in connection with the
solicitation of proxies for use at the Company Stockholders Meeting, and any
schedules required to be filed with the SEC in connection therewith
(collectively, as amended or supplemented, the " _Proxy Statement_ "). The
Company and Parent, as the case may be, shall furnish all information
concerning the Company or Parent as the other party hereto may reasonably
request in connection with the preparation and filing with the SEC of the
Proxy Statement and shall otherwise cooperate with each other in the
preparation of the Proxy Statement. Subject to all applicable Laws, the
Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be
disseminated to the Company Stockholders as promptly as practicable following
the clearing of any comments with the SEC. The Company shall provide Parent,
Merger Sub and their counsel reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
the Proxy Statement and all other materials used in connection with the
Merger that (i) constitute "proxy materials" or "solicitation materials" as
those terms are used in Rules 14a 1 through 14a 17 promulgated under the
Exchange Act or (ii) are otherwise used for the "solicitation" of "proxies"
as those terms are defined in Rule 14a 1 promulgated under the Exchange Act,
in each case prior to the filing thereof with the SEC or the
dissemination thereof to Company Stockholders. The Company shall advise
Parent, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of any request by the SEC
or its staff for an

  

    ##### 

  

   

amendment or revisions to the Proxy Statement, or comments thereon and
responses thereto, or requests by the SEC or its staff for additional
information in connection therewith. If at any time prior to the Company
Stockholders Meeting, any information relating to the Company or Parent, or
any of their respective directors, officers or Affiliates, should be
discovered by the Company or Parent which should be set forth in an amendment
or supplement to the Proxy Statement so that the Proxy Statement would not
include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, the Party which discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other Party or Parties, as the case may
be, and an appropriate amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement
describing such information shall be promptly prepared and filed with the SEC
and, to the extent required by applicable Law, disseminated to the Company
Stockholders. The Company shall cause the Proxy Statement to comply as to
form and substance in all material respects with the applicable requirements
of the Exchange Act and the Nasdaq. 

   

(c) Unless this Agreement is earlier terminated pursuant to _Article IX_
hereof or the Company makes an Company Adverse Recommendation Change in
accordance with _Section 7.6(d)_ , the Company shall include in the Proxy
Statement the Company Board Recommendation (other than with respect to the
Offer). 

   

(d) Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall vote all shares of Company Common
Stock acquired in the Offer (or otherwise beneficially owned by them or any
of their respective Subsidiaries as of the applicable record date) in favor
of the adoption of this Agreement in accordance with Delaware Law at the
Company Stockholders Meeting or otherwise. 

   

Section 7.3 _Employee Benefit Matters_. 

   

(a) Parent hereby agrees that, with respect to any employee of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary as of the Effective Time (a " _Continuing Employee_
"), for the period immediately following the Effective Time through and
including the first anniversary of the Effective Time (or such shorter period
of time that any such Continuing Employee remains an employee of the
Surviving Corporation following the Effective Time), it shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, provide base salary, wages, bonus opportunity
and employee benefits for such Continuing Employee, pursuant to plans and
programs sponsored or maintained by the Surviving Corporation (each such
plan, a " _Surviving Corporation Benefit Plan_ "), that are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to, the base salary, wages, bonus opportunity and
employee benefits (but not including equity compensation) provided to such
Continuing Employee by the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

(b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to honor in accordance with their terms all Company Plans listed
on _Section 5.11(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule that are applicable
to any Continuing Employee. Continuing Employees shall receive credit for
purposes of eligibility to participate in, and vesting under, any Surviving
Corporation Benefit Plan for such Continuing Employees service prior to the
Effective Time with the Company or any Company Subsidiary to the extent such
service was credited under the analogous Company Plan as of the Effective
Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that such crediting of service shall not
operate to duplicate any benefit or the funding of any such benefit.
In addition, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to waive, or
cause to be waived, any limitations on medical benefits relating to any pre-
existing conditions to the same extent such limitations were waived under any
analogous medical plan of Parent or its subsidiaries and recognize, for
purposes of annual deductible and out-of-pocket limits under its medical and
dental plans, deductible and out-of-pocket expenses paid by
Continuing Employees in the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs to
the extent such deductibles or expenses were recognized under the analogous
Company Plan in such year. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties hereto
acknowledge and agree that: (i) Parent retains in its sole discretion, at any
time after the Closing, the right to amend and/or terminate any or all of its
or the Surviving Companys employee benefit plans and arrangements from time
to time in accordance with their terms and (ii) the covenants set forth in
this _Section 7.3_ do not, and shall not be construed to (A) establish,
amend, or modify any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement
maintained by the parties hereto, (B) limit in any way the ability of Parent,
the Surviving Company, or any of its or their Subsidiaries to terminate the
employment of any employee (including any Continuing Employee) at any time and
for any lawful reason, and (C) confer upon any current or former employee
(including any Continuing Employee) or any other Person any right to
employment or continued employment for any specified period of time or to a
particular term or condition of employment. Nothing in this Agreement,
express or implied, is intended to confer any rights, benefits,
remedies, obligations or liabilities under this Agreement upon any Person
(including any Continuing Employee or any current or former employees), other
than the parties to this Agreement and their respective successors and
assigns. 

  

Section 7.4 _Short-Form Merger_. Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section
7.2_ hereof, in the event that Merger Sub shall acquire at least ninety
percent (90%) of the issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
pursuant to the Offer or otherwise (including as a result of the exercise of
the Top-Up Option), subject to _Section 8.1(c)_, the Parties shall take all
necessary and appropriate action to cause the Merger to become effective, in
accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL, as promptly as reasonably
practicable after such acquisition, without a meeting of the Company
Stockholders. 

   

Section 7.5 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

times during the period commencing with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the termination of

Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall instruct each Company Subsidiary
and each of its and their respective Representatives (collectively, "
_Company Representatives_ ") to: (i) provide to Parent and Merger Sub and
each of their respective Representatives (collectively, "
_Parent Representatives_ ") access at reasonable times during normal business
hours, upon reasonable prior notice, to the officers, agents, properties,
offices and other facilities of the Company or such Company Subsidiary and to
the books and records thereof, and (ii) furnish or cause

  

    ##### 

  

   

to be furnished such information concerning the business, properties,
Contracts, assets, liabilities, personnel and other aspects of the Company

Representative may reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_ , until the
Effective Time, the Company shall not be required to (A) furnish, or provide
any access to, any information to any Person not a party to, or otherwise
covered by, the NDA or any similar agreement with respect to such information
or (B) provide access to or furnish any information if doing so would violate
any applicable Law, or where such access to information would involve the
waiver of an attorney-client privilege so long as the Company has taken all
reasonable steps to permit inspection of or to disclose such information on
a basis that does not compromise the Companys or any Company Subsidiarys
privilege with respect thereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that such access and
information shall be disclosed or granted, as applicable, to external counsel
for Parent to the extent required for the purpose of complying with
applicable Laws, including Antitrust Laws. 

   

(b) _Confidentiality and Restrictions_. With respect to the
information disclosed pursuant to _Section 7.5(a)_, the Parties shall comply
with, and shall cause their respective Representatives to comply with, all of
their respective obligations under the NDA or any similar agreement entered
into between the Company and any Person to whom the Company, any Company
Subsidiary or any Company Representative provides information pursuant to
this _Section 7.5_. The NDA shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with its terms until the earlier of the Effective Time or the
expiration of the NDA according to its terms. 

   

Section 7.6 _No Solicitation_. 

   

(a) At all times during the period commencing with the execution and delivery

(i) provide information in response to a request therefor to a Person who
has made an unsolicited _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal after the
date of this Agreement (which Acquisition Proposal does not arise out of or
result from any breach of this _Section 7.6_) if and only if, prior to
providing such information, the Company has entered into an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement with the Person so requesting such information,
_provided_ that the Company shall promptly make available to Parent any

information then available and after consultation with its independent
financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal
either constitutes a Superior Proposal or is reasonably likely to result in
a Superior Proposal. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

(c) Except as expressly provided by _Section 7.6(d)_, at any time after the
date hereof, neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall:

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, at
any time prior to the Acceptance Time, if the Company has received an
unsolicited _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal from any Person that is
not withdrawn and that the Company Board concludes in good faith constitutes
a Superior Proposal, (x) the Company Board may effect a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change with respect to such Superior Proposal, and/or (y)
the Company Board may authorize the Company to terminate this Agreement to
enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior

such Person or group of Persons); 

   

(B) prior to effecting such Company Adverse Recommendation Change
or termination, (1) the Company shall, and shall cause its financial and
legal advisors to, during the Notice Period, negotiate with Parent and the
Parent Representatives in good faith (to the extent requested by Parent) to
make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement, so that
such Acquisition Proposal would cease to constitute a Superior Proposal, and
(2) at the end of such Notice Period, the Company Board still determines in
good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that failure to
make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change would violate its fiduciary
obligations under applicable Laws; _provided_ that, in the event of any
material revisions to the Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board has
determined to be a Superior Proposal, the Company shall be required
to deliver a new written notice to Parent and to comply with the requirements
of this  _Section 7.6_ (including _Section 7.6(d)_) with respect to such
new written notice; and

None of the Company, the Company Board or any committee of the Company Board
shall enter into any agreement with any Person to limit or not to give prior
notice to Parent of its intention (i) to effect a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change or (ii) to terminate this Agreement in light of
a Superior Proposal. 

   

(e) Nothing contained in this _Section 7.6_ shall be deemed to prohibit
the Company or the Company Board from (i) complying with its disclosure
obligations under applicable U.S. federal or state Law with regard to an
Acquisition Proposal, including taking and disclosing to its stockholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act
(or any similar communication to stockholders) _ provided_ that any such
disclosure (other than a "stop, look and listen" communication or similar
communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange
Act) shall be deemed to be a Company Adverse Recommendation Change unless the
Company Board expressly publicly reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation
within two (2) Business Days following any request by Parent, or (ii) making
any "stop-look-and-listen" communication or similar communication of the type
contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

(f) The Company agrees that it shall promptly (and, in any event, within
twenty-four (24) hours) notify Parent of (i) the receipt of any Acquisition
Proposal, (ii) any request for non-public information relating to the Company
or the Company Subsidiaries, other than requests for information not
reasonably expected to be related to an Acquisition Proposal, and (iii) any
inquiry or request for discussions or negotiations regarding an
Acquisition Proposal, in each case indicating, in connection with such
notice, the identity of the Person or group of Persons making such offer,
request or inquiry and the material terms and conditions of any proposals or
offers (including, if applicable, copies of any written requests, proposals
or offers, including proposed agreements) and thereafter shall keep Parent
reasonably informed, on a prompt basis, of the status and terms of any such
proposals or offers (including any amendments thereto) and the status of any
such discussions or negotiations. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Company shall provide to Parent, as soon as practicable and in
any event within twenty-four (24) hours after receipt or delivery thereof,
copies of all draft agreements (and any other written material to the extent
such material contains any financial terms, conditions or other material
terms relating to any Acquisition Proposal) sent by or provided to the
Company, any Company Subsidiary or any Company Representative in connection
with any Acquisition Proposal. 

   

(g) Unless the Company Board determines in good faith that failure to do so
would violate its fiduciary obligations, the Company will not grant any
waiver under any Existing Confidentiality Agreement to which the Company or
any Company Subsidiary is a party and will not permit any counterparty to any
such Contract to deviate from compliance with the terms thereof. The Company
shall promptly notify Parent of any breach of any Existing Confidentiality
Agreement (including the standstill provisions thereof) by the
counterparty thereto, or any request by the counterparty to any Existing
Confidentiality Agreement that the Company, the applicable Company Subsidiary
or the Company Board waive the standstill provision thereof or authorize or
give permission to such counterparty to take actions that would otherwise be
prohibited by the standstill provisions thereof. Unless the Company Board
determines in good faith that doing so would violate its fiduciary
obligations, to the extent Parent or the Company believes that there has been
a breach of any Existing Confidentiality Agreement by the counterparty
thereto, the Company shall take all necessary actions to enforce, to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law and such Contract, such
Existing Confidentiality Agreement, including by obtaining an injunction to
prevent any breaches of such agreements and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions thereof in any court of the United States of America or of any

required filings and timely seeking all such required consents, Permits,
authorizations, advance ruling certificates, no-action letters or

filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of Parent, the Company or

transactions contemplated by this Agreement so as to permit consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ that nothing in
this _Section 7.7(e)_ shall require either Party to undertake litigation
against any Governmental Entity.

(f) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use its reasonable efforts
to assist Parent in the arrangement of any third party debt financing
requested by Parent for the purpose of financing the Offer and/or the Merger,

creation of any Lien on any property or asset of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary pursuant to, the Loan Agreement. 

   

(b) At the request of the Company, Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to assist the Company in the arrangement of a letter of credit, which
letter of credit is required pursuant to the terms of the agreement set forth

of any such Party to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement
which, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to
result in any condition to the obligations of any Party to effect the Offer,
the Merger or any other transaction contemplated hereby not to be satisfied;
provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section

other the opportunity to participate in the defense, settlement and/or

other Party before issuing any such release or making any such press release
or public statement.

Incorporation and the Company By-laws or under any indemnification agreements
between any Indemnified Party and the Company or any Company Subsidiary
(which indemnification agreements have been previously provided to Parent)
(the " _Indemnification Agreements_ "), in each case as in effect on the date
of this Agreement, shall survive the Merger and continue in full force and
effect in accordance with their respective terms to the extent permitted by
applicable Law. For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time,
Parent agrees to, and shall cause the certificate of incorporation and by-

(b) From the Effective Time through the sixth (6th) anniversary of the

directors and officers liability insurance covering each officer and
director currently covered by the Companys directors and officers
liability insurance policy for acts or omissions occurring prior to
the Effective Time with respect to any matter claimed against such Person by
reason of him or her serving in such capacity on terms with respect to such
coverage and amounts no less favorable in the aggregate than those of such
policy in effect on the date of this Agreement; _provided_ that in no event
shall the aggregate costs of such insurance policies exceed in any one year
during the Tail Period 250% of the current aggregate annual premiums paid by
the Company for such purpose (which aggregate annual premiums with respect to
such period are hereby represented and warranted by the Company to be in the
amount set forth in _Section 7.13(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule),
it being understood that Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall
nevertheless be obligated to provide such coverage, with respect to each year
during the Tail Period, as may be obtained for such 250% annual amount;
_provided_ , _further_ , that Parent or the Surviving Corporation may (i)
substitute therefor policies of any reputable insurance company or (ii)
satisfy its obligation under this _Section 7.13(b)_ by causing the Company
to obtain prepaid (or "tail") directors and officers liability insurance
policy, in each case, the material terms of which including coverage and
amount, are no less favorable to such directors and officers than the
insurance coverage otherwise required under this _Section 7.13(b)_. Any
insurance policies provided pursuant to this _Section 7.13_ shall be from
an insurance company with an A.M. Best Co. rating at least as high as the
rating received by the Companys current insurance provider. 

   

(c) Following the Closing, the Surviving Corporation shall pursue collection
efforts in the matter set forth on _Section 7.13(c)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, in a manner consistent with the Companys pre-Closing

(d) In the event the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of the
Surviving Corporation (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then proper provision shall be made so
that such continuing or surviving corporation or entity or transferee of such
assets, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this
_Section 7.13_. 

   

(e) The provisions of this _Section 7.13_ shall survive the consummation of
the Merger and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties, their respective heirs and
representatives. 

  

Section 7.14 _Takeover Provisions_. Parent, the Company and their respective
Boards of Directors shall (a) take all reasonable action necessary to ensure
that no Takeover Provision is or becomes applicable to this Agreement, the
Support Agreements or the transactions provided for herein or therein,
including the Offer and the Merger, and (b) if any Takeover Provision
becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Support Agreements or
the transactions contemplated herein or therein, take all reasonable action
necessary to ensure that the transactions provided for in this Agreement and

this Agreement, the Support Agreements and the transactions provided for
herein or therein.

or arrangement pursuant to which compensation is paid or payable, or pursuant
to which benefits are provided, in each case to any current or
former director, manager, officer, employee or independent contractor of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary unless, prior to such entry into,
establishment, amendment or modification, the Compensation Committee (each
member of which the Company Board determined is an "independent director"
within the meaning of Listing Rule 5605(a)(2) of the Nasdaq rules and shall be
an "independent director" in accordance with the requirements of Rule
14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act at the time of any such action) shall
have taken all such steps as may be necessary to (a) approve as an Employment
Compensation Arrangement each such plan, program, agreement or arrangement
and (b) satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor under
Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act with respect to such plan, program,
agreement or arrangement; provided that nothing in this _Section 7.16_ shall
be construed to permit the Company to take any action with respect to its
securities that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement. 

  

Section 7.17 _Stock Exchange De-listing_. Prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall cooperate with Parent and use reasonable best efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things,

the Company Common Stock from the Nasdaq and the deregistration of the
Company Common Stock under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after
the Effective Time.

provide to Parent an affidavit, dated as of the Closing Date, signed under
penalty of perjury, and in form and substance required under the Treasury

together with evidence reasonably satisfactory to Parent that the Company has
provided notice to the IRS in accordance with the provisions of Treasury
Regulation section 1.897-2(h)(2), so that Parent is exempt from withholding
any portion of the aggregate consideration with respect to the Merger.

contemplated hereby in accordance with the terms of this Agreement; 
_provided_ , _further_ , that the Company shall not have the right

to Holdings promptly, but in any event within three (3) Business Days after

(iii) In the event that (A) this Agreement is terminated by either Parent
or the Company pursuant to _Section 9.1(b)(i)_ or _Section
9.1(b)(ii)(B)_ or by Parent pursuant to _Section 9.1(d)(i)_ and Parent is
not in material breach of this Agreement at the time of such termination, (B)
at or prior to the time of such termination an Acquisition Proposal shall
have been publicly announced, commenced or disclosed or submitted or made
known to the Company Board, and (C) at any time after the execution of this
Agreement and prior to the expiration of twelve (12) months after the
termination of this Agreement, the Company consummates an Acquisition
Proposal or enters into a letter of intent, agreement in
principle, definitive agreement or similar Contract with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal that is subsequently (x) consummated at any time (for
the avoidance of doubt, including consummation at any time after the twelve-
month period following termination of this Agreement) or (y) terminated and,
in connection with such termination, the Company receives a fee ("
_Acquisition Proposal Termination Fee_ "), the Company shall, on the date
such Acquisition Proposal is consummated or such Acquisition Proposal
Termination Fee is received by the Company, pay the Company Termination Fee
to Holdings by wire transfer of same day funds to one or more accounts
designated by Holdings; _provided_ that, for purposes of this  _Section
9.4(b)(iii)_, all percentages in the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall
be replaced with 50.1%. 

   

(iv) For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company be obligated
to pay, or cause to be paid, the Company Termination Fee on more than one
occasion. Holdings shall have right to assign the right to receive the
Company Termination Fee to one or more Persons in its sole discretion. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

(c) _Acknowledgement_. Each Party acknowledges that (i) the agreements
contained in this _Section 9.4_ are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) the damages resulting from termination
of this Agreement under circumstances where a Company Termination Fee is
payable are uncertain and incapable of accurate calculation and, therefore,
the amounts payable pursuant to _Section 9.4(b)_ are not a penalty but
rather constitute liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will
compensate Parent for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities
foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement
and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, and (iii) without the agreements contained in this  _Section 9.4_,
Parent would not have entered into this Agreement. Accordingly, if
the Company fails to promptly pay any amount due pursuant to _Section
9.4(b)_ and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent and/or Holdings
commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company for the
amount set forth in _Section 9.4(b)_ or any portion thereof, the Company
shall pay to Holdings costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred
by the Parent and its Affiliates in connection with such suit, together
with interest on such amount or portion thereof at the prime rate of Citibank
N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required to be made through the
date of payment. 

  

Section 9.5 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
subject to  _Section 2.4(d)_, the Parties may, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law and, subject to  _Section 9.6_, (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other Parties, (b)
waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein
or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, or (c) waive compliance with any
of the agreements or conditions contained herein; provided, however, that
after the Company Stockholder Approval has been obtained, there shall be made
no waiver that by Law (including the relevant rules of the Nasdaq) requires
further approval by the Company Stockholders without the further approval of
such stockholders. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument
signed on behalf of such Party. The failure of any Party to assert any of its
rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of
those rights. 

  

Section 9.6 _Amendment_. Subject to _Section 2.4(d)_ and compliance
with applicable Law, this Agreement may be amended by the Parties by action
taken by or on behalf of their respective Boards of Directors at any time
prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after the Acceptance Time or
the Company Stockholder Approval; _provided_ , _however_ , that (a) after the
Acceptance Time, there shall be no amendment that decreases the
Merger Consideration and (b) after the Company Stockholder Approval has been
obtained, there shall be made no amendment that by Law (including the
relevant rules of the Nasdaq) requires further approval by the Company
Stockholders without the further approval of such stockholders. This Agreement
may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed by Parent and
the Company.

Section 10.3 _Fees and Expenses_. The Surviving Corporation shall pay all
charges and expenses, including those of the Paying Agent and all transfer,
documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other similar such Taxes and
fees (including penalties and interest), incurred in connection with the
transactions contemplated by _Article IV_. The Company and Parent
shall cooperate in timely making all filings, returns, reports and forms as
necessary or appropriate to comply with the provisions of all applicable Laws
in connection with the payment of any such amounts, and shall cooperate in
good faith to minimize, to the fullest extent possible under such Laws, any
such amounts payable in connection therewith. Except as otherwise expressly
set forth in this Agreement, all fees and expenses incurred in connection
herewith and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the Party
incurring such expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

Section 10.4 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or
public policy, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect for so long as the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is
not affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties
as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner so that the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated as originally
contemplated to the greatest extent possible. 

  

Section 10.5 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (together with the Exhibits,
Parent Disclosure Schedule, Company Disclosure Schedule, the Equity Financing
Commitment and the other documents delivered pursuant hereto) and the NDA
constitute the entire agreement of the Parties with respect to the subject
matter hereof and thereof and supersede all prior agreements
and undertakings, both written and oral, among the Parties, or any of them,
with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof. EACH PARTY HERETO
AGREES THAT, EXCEPT FOR THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN THIS
AGREEMENT, NEITHER PARENT AND MERGER SUB, ON THE ONE HAND, NOR THE COMPANY,
ON THE OTHER HAND, MAKES ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES TO THE OTHER, AND
EACH PARTY HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS
OR IMPLIED, OR AS TO THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF ANY OTHER INFORMATION,
MADE (OR MADE AVAILABLE BY) BY ITSELF OR ANY OF ITS REPRESENTATIVES, WITH
RESPECT TO, OR IN CONNECTION WITH, THE NEGOTIATION, EXECUTION OR DELIVERY
OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, NOTWITHSTANDING
THE DELIVERY OR DISCLOSURE TO THE OTHER OR THE OTHERS REPRESENTATIVES OF ANY
DOCUMENTATION OR OTHER INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO ANY ONE OR MORE OF THE
FOREGOING. 

   

Section 10.6 _Specific Performance_. 

   

(a) The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that money damages or
other legal remedies would not be an adequate remedy for such damages. It is
accordingly agreed that, the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically
the performance of the terms and provisions hereof. Each of the Parties
agrees not to raise any objections to the availability of the remedy of
specific performance to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce
specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof. 

   

(b) The Company hereby agrees that, except as provided in Section 10.6(c)
below, specific performance shall be its sole and exclusive remedy with
respect to breaches by Parent or Merger Sub or any other Person or otherwise
in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
and, except as provided in Section 10.6(c) below, that it may not seek or
accept any other form of relief that may be available for breach under this
Agreement or otherwise in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby (including monetary damages). 

 

    ##### 

  

   

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Court of competent jurisdiction in a
final, non-appealable determination as to the availability of specific
performance does not specifically enforce the obligations of Parent and
Merger Sub to consummate the Offer, the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement pursuant to a claim for specific performance
brought against Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to this  _Section 10.6_, the
Company may pursue any other remedy available to it at law or in equity,
including monetary damages; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company may not
pursue another remedy if the Court has made a final, non-appealable
determination that Parent and/or Merger Sub has not materially breached their
obligations under this Agreement; and _provided_ , _further_ , that
notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the maximum aggregate
liability of Parent, Merger Sub, Holdings and their Affiliates under this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby to the Company shall be
limited to twelve million five hundred thousand dollars ($12,500,000). If
such a Court has granted an award of damages for such alleged breach against
Parent and/or Merger Sub, the Company may enforce such award and accept
damages for such alleged breach only if, within two (2) weeks following such
award or as promptly as possible thereafter, Parent and Merger Sub have
not consummated the Offer and the Merger. In addition, the Company agrees to
cause any Action still pending to be dismissed with prejudice at such time as
Parent and Merger Sub consummate the Offer and the Merger. 

   

Section 10.7 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_. 

   

(a) THIS AGREEMENT, AND ALL CLAIMS OR CAUSES OF ACTION (WHETHER AT LAW, IN
CONTRACT OR IN TORT) THAT MAY BE BASED UPON, ARISE OUT OF OR RELATE TO THIS
AGREEMENT, THE EQUITY FINANCING COMMITMENT, THE SUPPORT AGREEMENTS OR THE
NEGOTIATION, EXECUTION OR PERFORMANCE HEREOF OR THEREOF, SHALL BE CONSTRUED,
PERFORMED AND ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE
WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO ITS PRINCIPLES OR RULES OF CONFLICT OF LAWS TO THE
EXTENT SUCH PRINCIPLES OR RULES WOULD REQUIRE OR PERMIT THE APPLICATION OF THE
LAWS OF ANOTHER JURISDICTION. Any Action against, arising out of or relating
to this Agreement, the Equity Financing Commitment, the Support Agreements or
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, including any Action against
any member of the Parent Group, shall be brought solely and exclusively in
the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware;  _provided_ that if (and only
after) such courts determine that they lack subject matter jurisdiction over
any such legal Action, such legal Action shall be brought solely and
exclusively in the federal courts of the United States located in the State of
Delaware;  _provided_ , _further_ , that if (and only after) both the Court
of Chancery of the State of Delaware and the federal courts of the United
States located in the State of Delaware determine that they lack subject
matter jurisdiction over any such legal Action, such legal Action shall be
brought in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New
York. Each of the Parties agrees that a final judgment (subject to
any appeals therefrom) in any such Action shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other
manner provided by applicable Law. Each Party hereby irrevocably submits to
the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts, in accordance with the foregoing
order of priority, in respect of any Action arising out of or relating to
this Agreement, the Equity Financing Commitment, the Support Agreements or the

  

    ##### 

  

   

transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, and hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively
do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of
venue of any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby in any such court in accordance with the
provisions of this  _Section 10.7_. Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, the defense of an
inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any
such court. Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices in 
_Section 10.2_ (Notices). Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of
any Party to serve process in any other manner permitted by applicable Law. 

   

(b) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, THE EQUITY FINANCING COMMITMENT OR THE SUPPORT
AGREEMENTS IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND
THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY
RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE
EQUITY FINANCING COMMITMENT, THE SUPPORT AGREEMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY, INCLUDING ANY CONTROVERSY INVOLVING ANY
MEMBER OR REPRESENTATIVE OF THE PARENT GROUP UNDER ANY SUCH AGREEMENT. EACH
PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR
ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT
SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE
THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (ii) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE
IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (iii) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY,
AND (iv) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG
OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION
10.7(B). 

  

Section 10.8 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Except as provided in _Section
7.13_ (Indemnification of Directors and Officers), each of Parent, Merger Sub
and the Company hereby agrees that their respective representations,
warranties and covenants set forth herein are solely for the benefit of the
other Parties, in accordance with and subject to the terms of this Agreement,
and this Agreement is not intended to, and does not, confer upon any Person
other than the Parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder, including the
right to rely upon the representations and warranties set forth herein. The
Parties further agree that the rights of third party beneficiaries under
_Section 7.13_ shall not arise unless and until the Effective Time occurs. 

  

Section 10.9 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the Parties
(whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written consent
of the other Parties; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that prior to the Closing,
Merger Sub may assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement to any
other wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent and to any parties providing
debt financing to the Surviving Corporation for purposes of creating a
security interest herein or otherwise assigning as collateral in respect of
such debt financing. No assignment by any Party shall relieve such Party of
any of its obligations hereunder. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement
will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the
Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

Section 10.10 _Obligations of Parent and of the Company_. Whenever this
Agreement requires a Subsidiary of Parent to take any action, such
requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Parent
to cause such Subsidiary to take such action. Whenever this Agreement
requires a Subsidiary of the Company to take any action, such requirement
shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of the Company to cause
such Subsidiary to take such action and, after the Effective Time, on the
part of the Surviving Corporation to cause such Subsidiary to take such
action. 

  

Section 10.11 _Mutual Drafting_. Each Party has participated in the drafting
of this Agreement, which each Party acknowledges is the result of extensive
negotiations between the Parties; accordingly, in the event an ambiguity or
question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be
construed as if drafted jointly by the Parties, and no presumption or burden
of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the
authorship of any provisions of this Agreement. 

  

Section 10.12 _Headings_. The headings contained in this Agreement are for
reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement. 

  

Section 10.13 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed by facsimile and
in counterparts, and by the different Parties in separate counterparts, each
of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which
taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. 

  

Section 10.14 _Delivery by Facsimile or Email_. This Agreement, and any
amendments hereto, to the extent signed and delivered by means of a facsimile
machine or by email with facsimile or scan attachment, shall be treated in
all manner and respects as an original Contract and shall be considered to
have the same binding legal effects as if it were the original signed version
thereof delivered in person. At the request of any Party, each other Party
shall re-execute original forms thereof and deliver them to all other
Parties. No Party shall raise the use of a facsimile machine or email to
deliver a signature or the fact that any signature or Contract was
transmitted or communicated through the use of facsimile machine or by email
with facsimile or scan attachment as a defense to the formation of a
Contract, and each such Party forever waives any such defense.

EXHIBIT A 

   

Form of Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement 

   

Health Grades, Inc. 
 Confidentiality and Nondisclosure Agreement 

   

THIS CONFIDENTIALITY AND NONDISCLOSURE AGREEMENT is entered into as of [],
2010 (" _Effective Date_ "), by and between Health Grades, Inc., a Delaware
corporation with its principal offices at 500 Golden Ridge Road, Suite 100,
Golden, Colorado 80401 (" _HealthGrades_ "), and [] (the " _Recipient_ "),
(the " _Agreement_ "). The Recipient and HealthGrades may be referred to
herein individually as a "Party" or collectively as the "Parties". 

  

WHEREAS, HealthGrades has or will be providing the Recipient and its
Representatives with access to data and information from HealthGrades, its
affiliates, and its clients for the purpose of the Recipients evaluation and
negotiation of a potential transaction involving the Recipient and
HealthGrades (the " _Transaction_ "); and 

  

WHEREAS, each Party desires that all of the confidential and proprietary
information that is furnished or made available to the Recipient or any of
its Representatives by HealthGrades be subject to the confidentiality and
non-disclosure restrictions imposed by this Agreement. 

  

NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties hereby agree as
follows: 

  

1. The Recipient acknowledges that, in connection with its evaluation and negotiation of a Transaction, it and its Representatives have been and may be given access to " _Confidential Information_ ," which is defined as any information, whether written, verbal, electronic or otherwise, that is disclosed or made available to the Recipient by HealthGrades, its affiliates or its clients in connection with the Transaction. Such "Confidential Information" may include, but is not limited to, (i) reports, manuals, training materials, presentations, questionnaires, analyses, tools, software, specifications, business plans or calculations and (ii) all materials prepared by the Recipient or any of its Representatives to the extent containing, reflecting or based upon, in whole or in part, any Confidential Information, and in each case regardless of whether or not specifically marked as confidential. The Recipient acknowledges that the Confidential Information constitutes protectable trade secrets and other sensitive information, and agrees to hold the Confidential Information in confidence. 

  

2. The Recipient will not, and the Recipient shall cause its Representatives not to, at any time, without the prior written consent of an authorized representative of HealthGrades, use for itself or others, or disclose to any other entity or person, any of the Confidential Information, except that the Recipient may use such Confidential Information solely in connection with the Transaction and its evaluation thereof, and may provide such information to its directors, officers, employees, agents, attorneys, accountants, consultants, bankers, financial sources, advisors and any representatives of advisors (collectively, the Recipients " _Representatives_ ,"  _provided_ that no person other than the Recipients employees, officers or directors shall be considered a Representative unless they receive Confidential Information from or on behalf of the Recipient) on a need to know basis in connection with the Transaction and its evaluation thereof. The Recipient will advise the Representatives of the confidential nature of the Confidential Information, and will be responsible for any use of the Confidential Information by the Representatives in violation of the terms of this Agreement.

3. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, each Party acknowledges that Confidential Information shall not include information which: a) already is in the Recipients or any of its Representatives possession, b) is or becomes publicly known through no wrongful act of the Recipient; c) is obtained from a third person who is not, to the knowledge of the Recipient, prohibited from transmitting the Confidential Information to the Recipient or any of its Representatives by a contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation to HealthGrades; or d) is independently developed by the Recipient or any of its Representatives without breach of this Agreement. 

  

4. The Recipient will be relieved of its obligation hereunder if, and to the extent, that Confidential Information a) is explicitly approved for release by written authorization of HealthGrades; or b) if the Recipient or any of its Representatives becomes (or if it is reasonably likely that the Recipient or any of its Representatives shall become) required by applicable law, regulation or any subpoena, court, arbitration or other legal process, or reasonably believes based on advice from its counsel that it is, legally required to disclose any Confidential Information,  _provided_ that the Party making the disclosure has given prompt notice to HealthGrades, to the extent practicable without prejudicing any of the Recipients or its Representatives legal rights, privileges or obligations or unless prohibited by law, so that HealthGrades, at HealthGrades sole cost and expense, may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy or waive compliance with the terms of this Agreement. In the event that no such protective order is obtained within a reasonable period of time or compliance with the terms of this Agreement are not waived, the Recipient or its Representatives, as applicable, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to disclose only that portion of Confidential Information that the Recipient or its Representatives, as applicable, are advised by counsel is required. Such disclosure shall not be a violation of this Agreement. 

  

5. HealthGrades agrees that the Recipient will have no obligation to continue to participate in any negotiations or other activities in connection with the Transaction or the Recipients evaluation thereof or to effect the Transaction except pursuant to a definitive agreement (a " _Definitive Agreement_ ") executed by the Recipient and acceptable to the Recipient in its sole and absolute discretion. Recipient agrees that HealthGrades reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to both reject any and all proposals made by Recipient or its Representatives with regard to a Transaction and/or to terminate discussions and negotiations with the Recipient or any of its Representatives at any time for any reason or no reason. Except as otherwise agreed by the Parties in a Definitive Agreement, all Confidential Information disclosed shall remain the sole property of HealthGrades, and all documents and other materials constituting Confidential Information shall remain the property of HealthGrades or its client. Upon request of HealthGrades, the Recipient will immediately return to HealthGrades or destroy, at the Recipients election, any written material containing or reflecting Confidential Information (whether prepared by HealthGrades, its advisors or otherwise) and will not retain any copies, extracts or other reproductions in whole or in part of such written material;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the Recipient and its Representatives a) may retain i) any attorney work product created in connection with the Recipients evaluation and negotiation of a Transaction, and ii) so much of the information as the Recipient or any of its Representatives reasonably believes is necessary to comply with any legal, regulatory or data production requirements, and b) will not be obligated to erase any Confidential Information that is contained in an archived computer system backup in accordance with such Partys security and/or disaster recovery procedures, and, in each case, such Confidential Information will continue to be subject to the terms of this Agreement.

6. The Recipient shall not remove any copyright or proprietary rights notice attached to or included in any Confidential Information and shall not copy the Confidential Information without HealthGrades written consent, except in connection with disclosures otherwise permitted hereunder (including to the Recipients Representatives). 

  

7. Except as otherwise permitted hereunder, neither Party shall disclose the terms and conditions of this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other Party. The Recipient acknowledges and, to the Recipients knowledge, agrees that HealthGrades is the exclusive owner the HealthGrades service marks, including the name, HealthGrades. The Recipient shall not directly or indirectly use or display HealthGrades name or service marks without the prior written consent of HealthGrades. This provision shall survive the termination of this Agreement. 

  

8. The Recipient agrees that, without the prior written consent of HealthGrades, all communications from the Recipient or its Representatives regarding the proposed Transaction, including, without limitation, inquiries, requests for additional information, requests for access to personnel or other business contacts, requests for facility tours or discussions or questions regarding procedures, will be submitted only to [] of Citigroup Global Markets Inc., except that you or your counsel may direct questions regarding this Agreement to [] of Shearman and Sterling LLP. 

  

9. In consideration of Confidential Information being furnished to the Recipient, the Recipient hereby agrees that, for a period of one (1) year from the date hereof, it will not, and will cause its Representatives (other than third party advisors) not to, directly or indirectly, without obtaining the prior written consent of HealthGrades, solicit for employment, hire or employ any current employees of HealthGrades or any of its affiliates; _provided_ , _however_ , that the restriction on solicitation above shall not restrict the Recipients ability to conduct generalized searches for employees by use of advertisements in periodicals of general circulation. 

  

10. The Recipient acknowledges that HealthGrades could be irreparably harmed if the Recipients obligations under this Agreement are not specifically enforced and that HealthGrades may not have an adequate remedy at law in the event of an actual or threatened violation by the Recipient of its obligations. Therefore, the Recipient agrees that HealthGrades shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief against any actual or threatened violations or breathes by the Recipient without the necessity of HealthGrades showing actual damages or that monetary damages would not afford an adequate remedy. In the event that any dispute between the Parties should result in arbitration or litigation, the prevailing Party in such dispute shall be entitled to recover from the losing Party all fees, costs and expenses in connection with such arbitration or litigation, including without limitation, such reasonable fees, costs and expenses of attorneys and accountants, which shall include, without limitation, all reasonable fees, costs and expenses of appeals.

11. HealthGrades agrees to hold in confidence the Recipients confidential or proprietary information upon the same terms as are set forth herein with respect to the Recipients treatment of HealthGrades confidential information; _provided_ that the Recipient hereby acknowledges and agrees that nothing contained in this Agreement shall in any manner restrict or prohibit HealthGrades from complying with its obligations contained in the Agreement and Plan of Merger, by and among Mountain Acquisition Corp., Mountain Merger Sub Corp., Mountain Holdings, LLC and HealthGrades, dated as of July 27, 2010, as amended from time to time. 

  

12. This Agreement contains the entire agreement between the Recipient and HealthGrades concerning the confidentiality of the Confidential Information, and no provision of this Agreement may be waived, amended or modified, in whole or in part, not any consent given, unless approved in writing by duly authorized representatives of both Parties, which writing specifically refers to this Agreement and the provision so amended or modified or for which such waiver or consent is given. In the event that any provision of this Agreement is deemed invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement will not in any way be affected or impaired thereby. 

  

13. This Agreement may not be assigned by either Party, except that HealthGrades may assign this Agreement to any purchaser of all or substantially all of its assets, equity securities or businesses. The obligations of either Party shall not terminate upon any attempted assignment. This Agreement may only be amended in writing by an instrument signed by both Parties. This Agreement shall be governed by the internal laws of the State of Colorado without regard its conflict of law provisions. If any provision of this Agreement shall be held invalid in a court of law, the remaining provisions shall be construed as if the invalid provision were not included in this Agreement. Except as otherwise expressly indicated herein, this Agreement will terminate two (2) years from the date hereof.
