fraction, the numerator of which is equal to the number of shares of the Cody
Company Common Stock held by such Shareholder at the Closing (following the
Redemption Transaction) and the denominator of which is equal to the total
number of shares of the Cody Company Common Stock issued and outstanding at the
Closing

                                       6

Consideration.

          (ii) Accredited Shareholders.  Each Accredited Shareholder shall be
               -----------------------
entitled to receive an amount of cash at the Closing equal to the product of (A)
the difference between the total Cash Portion of the Merger Consideration and
the aggregate amount of the Cash Portion that the Non-Accredited Shareholders

     (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if between the date of this Agreement
and the Effective Time the outstanding shares of the Acquiror Common Stock or
the Cody Company Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number of
shares or a different class, by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision,
reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of shares,
the allocation of the Merger Consideration set forth in Section 2.01(b) shall
correspondingly be adjusted to reflect such stock dividend, subdivision,
reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of shares.

     (d) All shares of the Cody Company Common Stock shall cease to be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired at the Effective
Time, and each certificate previously evidencing the Cody Company Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "Cody Company

Consideration as allocated in accordance with Section 2.01(b), (ii) if
applicable, the Stock Portion of the Merger Consideration, and (iii) if
applicable, cash in lieu of fractional shares of Acquiror Common Stock pursuant

shall be delivered with respect thereto.

     (e)  If any Cody Company Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Cody Company Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed (which affidavit
shall be reasonably satisfactory to Acquiror and

                   --------------------
fractional shares of the Acquiror Common Stock shall be issued upon the
surrender for exchange of Cody Company Certificates, and such fractional share
interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to any rights of a stockholder of
Acquiror. In lieu of any such fractional shares, each holder of a Cody Company
Certificate who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fractional share of the
Acquiror Common Stock, upon surrender of such certificate for exchange pursuant
to this Article II, shall be paid an amount in cash (without interest), rounded
to the nearest cent, determined by multiplying (i) the Acquiror Average Price by
(ii) the fractional interest to which such holder would otherwise be entitled
(after taking into account all of the shares of the Cody Company Common Stock
held of record by such holder at the Effective Time).

     SECTION 2.04. Withholding. Acquiror shall be entitled to deduct and
                   -----------

Agreement to any former holder of the Cody Company Common Stock such amounts as
Acquiror (or any affiliate thereof) is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of state,
local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by
Acquiror, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the former holder of the Cody Company Common
Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Acquiror
and such amounts shall be remitted by Acquiror in accordance with applicable
law.

respect to each other under the terms of this Agreement with regard to the
matters described in Section 2.05(b) or Section 2.05(c) for which a Negative
Balance Sheet Adjustment Notice or a Positive Balance Sheet Adjustment Notice
has been given prior to the Closing, even if some other provision of this
Agreement, by its terms, would otherwise cover such matters.

     SECTION 2.07.  Reserved Amount; Calculation, Adjustment.
                    ----------------------------------------

     (a)  The daily balance of the Reserved Amount shall bear interest at the
Applicable Rate from the Closing Date to the Reserved Termination Date and shall
be payable in a single amount at the Reserve Termination Date.

     (b)  Acquiror agrees to pay and discharge in due course the Non-Tax Portion

Liabilities from the Reserved Amount and to account to the Cody Tax
Representative for such payments. All Losses resulting from Acquiror's failure
to pay an item of the Non-Tax Portion of the Cody Company Reserved Liabilities
or the Tax Portion of the Cody Company Reserved Liabilities when due shall be
borne solely by Acquiror and shall not give rise to a Shareholder
indemnification obligation under Section 8.08, unless such failure is
attributable to an act or failure to act of the Cody Tax Representative that is
(i) requested by Acquiror (to the extent such act or omission does not produce a
cost to the Cody Tax Representative for which it is not indemnified) or (ii)
required or expressly contemplated by this Agreement.

     (c)  After the filing of the final Return of Cody Company relating to a
Cody Energy Pre-Closing Tax Liability for the Stub Period, Acquiror and the Cody
Tax Representative shall cooperate with each other in good faith to determine

Energy Adjustment Tax Liabilities"). If Acquiror and the Cody Tax Representative
---------------------------------
are unable to agree on the actual amount of the Cody Energy Adjustment Tax
Liabilities within 10 business days following the filing of the final Return of
Cody Company relating to a Cody Energy Pre-Closing Tax Liability for the Stub
Period, Acquiror and the Cody Tax Representative shall each appoint a Tax
Expert, and the two Tax Experts so appointed shall select a third Tax Expert, to
resolve the dispute in accordance with the standards set forth in Section
8.11(a)(iii). A decision of the majority of the Tax Experts shall be binding on
the Parties. If the amount of the actual Cody Energy Adjustment Tax Liabilities,
as finally determined, exceeds the actual amount of all distributions made by
Cody Energy to Cody Company from January 1, 2000, through the Closing (the "Cody
                                                                            ----
Energy Adjustment Distributions"), the balance of the Reserved Amount shall be
--------------------------------
deemed to have been increased by the amount of such excess at the Closing Date.
If the actual amount of the Cody Energy Adjustment Distributions exceeds the
amount of the actual Cody Energy Adjustment Tax Liabilities, as finally
determined, the balance of the Reserved Amount shall be deemed to have been
decreased by the amount of such excess at the Closing Date.

     (d)  Within 10 business days of the later (the "Reserve Termination Date")
                                                     ------------------------

relating to the Stub Period or any Pre-Closing Period for which a required
Return for such Pre-Closing Period has not been filed as of July 20, 2001, (ii)
the filing of the final remaining Return (taking into account extensions)
relating to a Transaction Transfer Tax Liability, and (iii) the decision by the
Tax Experts pursuant to Section 2.07(c) as to the actual amount of the Cody
Energy Pre-Closing Tax Liabilities, (x) if any portion of the Reserved Amount
remains (after taking into account any adjustments required under Section
2.07(c)), Acquiror shall pay such remaining unused portions of the Reserved
Amount to the Shareholders or (y) if the actual amount of Cody Company Reserved
Liabilities exceeds the amount of the Reserved Amount (after taking into account
any adjustments required under Section 2.07(c)), the Cody Tax Representative, on
behalf of the Shareholders shall pay the amount of such deficiency to Acquiror.
Any payment made pursuant to clause (x) or (y) of this Section 2.07(d) shall be
characterized as adjustments to the Merger Consideration.

     SECTION 2.08.  Post-Closing Adjustments.  To the extent that the actual
                    ------------------------
amount of any adjustment to the Merger Consideration for Defect Adjustments,
Environmental Adjustments or Interest Addition Adjustments as determined in
accordance with the dispute

resolution procedures of Article XI, differs from the amount of the adjustments
to the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.05(e), Section 7.02 or Section
7.05, the difference between such amounts plus interest at the Applicable Rate
from the Closing Date to the date of payment shall be paid within 10 business
days after the final determination under Article XI: (i) by Acquiror to the
Shareholders as additional Merger Consideration, if the amount of the adjustment
to the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.05(e), Section 7.02 or Section
7.05 exceeds the actual amount of the adjustment to the Merger Consideration for
Title Defects, Environmental Defects, or Interest Additions, determined in
accordance with the dispute resolution procedures of Article XI, or (ii) by the
Shareholders to Acquiror as a reduction in the Merger Consideration, if the
actual amount of such adjustment to the Merger Consideration for Title Defects,
Environmental Defects, or Interest Additions, determined in accordance with the
dispute resolution procedures of Article XI.

          (i)  Each Cody Benefit Plan has at all times been in compliance, in
form and in operation, in all material respects with all applicable requirements
of law and regulations, including without limitation the Code, ERISA and the
applicable regulations. Each Cody Benefit Plan that is intended to be a
qualified plan has received a favorable determination letter from the Internal
Revenue Service or is a standardized master or prototype plan that is subject to
a notification letter issued by the Internal Revenue Service; nothing has
occurred since the date

                                      17

procedures have not been exhausted) pending, threatened or imminent against or
with respect to any Cody Benefit Plan, any plan sponsor, or any fiduciary (as
such term is defined in Section 3(21) of ERISA) of such Cody Benefit Plan, and
neither Cody Company nor any member of its ERISA Group has any Knowledge of any
facts that could reasonably be expected to give rise to any action, suit,
grievance, arbitration or other manner of litigation, or action.

multiemployer plan (as such term is defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA).

          (iv)   Neither Cody Company nor any party in interest (as such term is
defined in ERISA section 3(14)) nor any disqualified person (as defined in Code
section 4975(e)(2)) has engaged in any prohibited transaction within the meaning
of ERISA section 406 or Code section 4975 that could reasonably be expected to
result in a Cody Material Adverse Effect.

          (v)    The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this

     SECTION 7.01.  Notice of Title Defects. In connection with Acquiror's due
                    -----------------------
diligence review conducted prior to Closing, Acquiror may give Cody Company
notice (a "Defect Notice") of any Title Defect. Such Defect Notice shall comply
           -------------
with the following:

                                      46
<PAGE>

     (a)  Such Defect Notice must be received by Cody Company on or before 5:00
P.M. (Denver time) on July 24, 2001, or if the Closing is postponed by Acquiror
pursuant to Section 1.02, not later than 5:00 P.M. (Denver time) on the date
seven days before the Postponement Date (as applicable, the "Notice Deadline").
                                                             ---------------

     (b)  Such Defect Notice shall be in writing and shall include the
following: (i) a description of each Asset that is affected by the Title Defect
(a "Defective Interest"); (ii) the basis for treating such Asset as a Defective
    ------------------
Interest and copies of supporting documents reasonably necessary for Cody
Company to verify the existence of such asserted Title Defect; (iii) the
Allocated Value (as defined below) of the affected Asset; and (iv) Acquiror's
good faith estimate of the amount by which the Allocated Value of a Defective
Interest has been reduced by the Title Defect (the "Defect Value") (calculated
                                                    ------------
pursuant to Section 7.01(c)).

     (c)  In determining which portion of an Asset is a Defective Interest, the
Defect Value may not exceed the Allocated Value of the Asset and shall be
determined by the parties in good faith taking into account all relevant
factors, including without limitation, the following:

          (i)   The Allocated Value of the affected property;

          (ii)  As to the Well, Lease and Unit interests, the potential for or
actual reduction in the NRI of the Defective Interest, or the potential for or
actual increase in the WI to the extent such increase is not accompanied by a
corresponding increase in NRI;

          (iii) The legal effect of the Title Defect and whether applicable
limitations periods regarding such Title Defect have run; and

          (iv)  If the Title Defect is a lien or encumbrance on the property,
the cost of removing such lien or encumbrance.

     SECTION 7.02.  Remedy for Title Defects.
                    ------------------------

     (a)  Subject to Section 7.01, if an Asset is a Defective Interest the
Merger Consideration with regard to such Defective Interest will be reduced at
Closing by the Defect Value asserted by Acquiror in its Defect Notice related
thereto, unless (i) the basis for treating such Asset as a Defective Interest
         ------
has been removed by Cody Company at its sole cost and expense prior to Closing,
(ii) Acquiror agrees to waive the relevant Title Defect, (iii) Cody Company
elects to cure the relevant Title Defect not less than 90 days after the
Closing, in which case the Merger Consideration shall be reduced at Closing by
the Defect Value asserted by Acquiror in its Defect Notice as set forth in
Section 7.02(b), (iv) Cody Company elects to have Cody Energy assign the
affected Asset to Cody Resources at or prior to the Closing, in which case the
Merger Consideration shall be reduced at Closing by the Allocated Value of such
Asset, or (v) Cody Company and Acquiror agree to an adjustment to the Merger
Consideration with regard to such Title Defect. If Cody Company disputes such
Defect Value, the Merger Consideration shall be reduced at the Closing by the
Defect Value asserted by Acquiror in its Defect Notice related thereto, but Cody
Company may submit the issue of the appropriate reduction in the Merger
Consideration for such Defective Interest to the dispute resolution provisions
of Article XI. If Cody Company elects to assign a Defective Interest to Cody
Resources pursuant to clause (iv) of this Section, Acquiror shall have the right
to negate such

                                      47
<PAGE>

election by agreeing before Closing to waive the relevant Title Defect pursuant
to clause (ii) of this Section. Any adjustment to the Merger Consideration
pursuant to this Section 7.02(a) is referred to herein as a "Defect Adjustment."
                                                             -----------------

     (b)  If Cody Company elects to cure a Title Defect after the Closing
pursuant to Section 7.02(a)(iii), the Merger Consideration shall be reduced at
Closing by the amount of the Defect Value asserted by Acquiror in its Defect
Notice for such Title Defect. If such Title Defect is cured on or before 90 days
after Closing, within 10 business days after Acquiror's receipt of curative
materials removing the Title Defect in a manner acceptable to Acquiror, in its
reasonable discretion, based on the standards for a Title Defect set forth in
this Agreement. Acquiror shall pay to the Shareholder Representative the Defect
Value with respect to such Title Defect plus interest on such amount at the
Applicable Rate from the Closing Date to the date of payment. If the parties
dispute the adequacy of Cody Company's curative material, the issue of whether
such Title Defect has been cured shall be resolved under Article XI, which
dispute resolution mechanism must be invoked by the Shareholder Representative
within 10 business days after receipt of written notice ("Cure Objection
                                                          --------------
Notice") from Acquiror that the curative materials did not cure the Title
------
Defect, which Acquiror must deliver within 20 business days after receipt of
such curative materials. If Acquiror does not timely deliver the Cure Objection
Notice, Acquiror shall be deemed to have accepted the cure as removing the Title
Defect. If the Shareholder Representative does not invoke the dispute resolution
process within the 10-day period after receipt of the Cure Objection Notice, the
Shareholders shall be deemed not to have cured such Title Defect. If the Title
Defect is not cured within the 90-day period, the Defect Val ue with regard to
such Title Defect shall be retained by Acquiror. For purposes of this post-
closing curative procedure, Acquiror shall cooperate with the Shareholder
Representative in performing necessary actions for the Shareholders, which shall
be carried out after Closing by Cody Energy Employees to the extent reasonably
possible at no cost or expense to the Shareholders, but any third party out of
pocket expenses for such curative actions shall be the obligation of the
Shareholders.

     SECTION 7.03.  Interest Additions. Promptly on discovery, Acquiror or Cody
                    ------------------
Company, whichever is the discovering party, shall notify the other of any
interest that would be an Asset hereunder, but that is not described in Schedule
                                                                        --------
A or Schedule A-1 hereto, including any interest that entitles Cody Energy or
-    ------------
any of its Subsidiaries to receive more than the NRI set forth in Schedule A or
                                                                  ----------
Schedule A-1 hereto, obligates Cody Energy or any of its Subsidiaries to bear
------------
costs and expenses in an amount less than the WI set forth in Schedule A or
                                                              ----------
Schedule A-1 hereto, or any interest that entitles Cody Energy or any of its
------------
Subsidiaries to more than the net acreage figures for non-producing Leases
described in Schedule A-1 (collectively, "Interest Additions"). The party who
             ------------                 ------------------
discovers Interest Additions must give the other party written notice of
Interest Additions as soon as possible, but in no event later than on or before
the Notice Deadline. This notice must be in writing and must include (a) a
description of each Interest Addition, (b) the basis for each Interest Addition,
(c) the Allocated Value of the Asset affected by the Interest Addition, and (d)
the value of the Interest Addition or the amount by which the notifying party,
in good faith, estimates the Allocated Value of the Asset has been increased by
the Interest Addition (the "Value of Interest Addition"). The Value of the
                            --------------------------
Interest Addition shall be determined by the parties in good faith taking into
account all relevant factors (the "Interest Addition Adjustment"). If the
                                   ----------------------------
Parties fail to agree on an Interest Addition Adjustment, then the dispute
resolution procedures of Article XI shall apply.

<PAGE>

     SECTION 7.04.  Notice of Environmental Defects. In connection with
                    -------------------------------
Acquiror's due diligence review conducted prior to Closing, Acquiror may give
Cody Company notice (an "Environmental Defect Notice") of any environmental
                         ----------------------------
condition, violation of Environmental Laws or the presence of hazardous
substances (an "Environmental Defect") related to the assets of Cody Energy or
                --------------------
any assets of Cody Company existing as of the Effective Time other than the
assets assigned to Cody Resources pursuant to the Assignment and Assumption
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any breach of the representations in
Article IV relating to (i) restoration or reclamation that does not involve a
violation of Environmental Laws or the release or disposal of hazardous
substances or other pollutants; (ii) plugging and abandonment liabilities that
do not involve a violation of Environmental Laws; or (iii) employee health and
safety, shall not be considered an Environmental Defect for purposes of any pre-
closing adjustments to the Merger Consideration. Such Environmental Defect
Notice shall be in writing, must be delivered by the Notice Deadline and shall
include:

     (a)  a description of each Asset that is affected by the Environmental
Defect (an "Environmental Defective Interest");
            --------------------------------

     (b)  sufficient detail to put Cody Company on reasonable notice of the
nature of the Environmental Defect identified;

     (c)  a description in reasonable detail of the investigation, removal,
remediation or other action required to remedy the Environmental Defect (the
"Cleanup") and a calculation of the amount necessary to carry out the Cleanup,
 -------
itemized in reasonable detail in accordance with the requirements of this
Section 7.04; and

     (d)  if applicable, a statement of the amount of Losses or Liabilities
likely to be incurred by Acquiror (or Cody Company) on account of the
Environmental Defect, such amount to include the likely expense of defense in
connection with any existing or probable third party action. The aggregate of
claimed amounts in Section 7.04(c) and (d) is herein called the "Environmental
                                                                 -------------
Defect Value." The Environmental Defect Value shall be determined in accordance
------------
with the Lowest Cost Response applicable to such Environmental Defect and shall
not include any internal costs of Acquiror associated with the Cleanup.

     To the extent Acquiror asserts an Environmental Defect or seeks
indemnification for a breach of any of the representations in Section 4.09, the
Acquiror shall have the right to conduct and control any Cleanup provided (i) it
uses its good faith, commercially reasonable efforts to achieve the Lowest Cost
Response and (ii) it provides the Shareholder Representative with the
opportunity to: (A) review and comment upon any work plans for any Cleanup prior
to finalization and implementation; (B) attend meetings with regulators
concerning the Cleanup; and (C) have a representative present during the
performance of any Cleanup.

     SECTION 7.05.  Remedy for Environmental Defects. If Cody Company receives
                    --------------------------------
an Environmental Notice on or before the Notice Deadline, Cody Company, at its
option may elect to provide the remedy in either Section 7.05(a) or (b) below
with respect to the Environmental Defect that is the subject of such notice, but
each such remedy, and the aggregate of all remedies, shall be limited in
accordance with Section 7.07. If Cody Company disputes such Environmental Defect
Value the Merger Consideration shall be reduced by the

                                      49
<PAGE>

Environmental Defect Value asserted by Acquiror in its Environmental Defect
Notice related thereto but Cody Company may submit the issue of the appropriate
reduction in the Merger Consideration for such Environmental Defective Interest
to the dispute resolution procedures of Article XI.

     (a)  Subject to the limitations of Section 7.04, if Cody Company and
Acquiror agree upon the amount of the Environmental Defect Value, the Merger
Consideration shall be reduced by the agreed amount of the Environmental Defect
Value.

     (b)  If Cody Company and Acquiror are unable to agree on an adjustment to
the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 7.05(a), Cody Company may elect to
have Cody Energy assign the affected asset to Cody Resources at or prior to
Closing, in which case the Merger Consideration shall be reduced at Closing by
the Allocated Value of such Asset (an "Exclusion Adjustment (Environmental)").
                                       -----------------------------------
If Cody Company elects to assign an Environmental Defective Interest to Cody
Resources pursuant to Section 7.05(b), Acquiror shall have the right to negate
such election by agreeing before Closing to waive the relevant Environmental
Defect. Any adjustment to the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Section 7.05
is referred to herein as an "Environmental Adjustment."
                             -------------------------

     SECTION 7.06.  Defect Consultation. Prior to the Notice Deadline Acquiror
                    -------------------
agrees to take reasonable steps to keep Cody Energy informed as to the progress
of Acquiror's title and environmental reviews and to consult with Cody Energy on
title and environmental issues during such reviews.

     SECTION 7.07.  Limitations on Title and Environmental Defects.
                    ----------------------------------------------
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (a) an individual claim for a
Title or Environmental Defect for which a Defect Notice or Environmental Defect
Notice is given prior to the Notice Deadline shall only be subject for
adjustment under this Article VII if the Defect Value or Environmental Defect
Value with respect thereto exceeds $100,000 (the "Pre-Closing Defects
                                                  -------------------
Threshold"), and (b) there shall be no adjustment for any claims for Title or
---------
Environmental Defects pursuant to this Article VII unless and until the
aggregate amount of Defect Values and Environmental Defect Values exceeds
$2,000,000 (the "Pre-Closing Defects Deductible"). At such time as the aggregate
                 ------------------------------
amount of claims for Title and Environmental Defects under this Article VII
exceeds the Pre-Closing Defects Deductible, Acquiror shall be entitled to
adjustments determined in accordance with this Article VII to that portion of
the Defect Value and Environmental Defect Value in excess of the Pre-Closing
Defects Deductible. For purposes hereof, an individual claim for a Title Defect
or Environmental Defect shall include all claims arising or resulting from, or
associated or in connection with: (i) a single condition, event or occurrence or

other provision of this Agreement by its terms would otherwise cover such

                    ---------------
allocated to an Asset as set forth in Schedule 7.09 is referred to herein as the

                     -------------------
adversary proceeding or other matter which would have been required to be

<PAGE>

     (a)  Cody Energy Employees.

          (i)   Terminated Employees. Cody Energy shall terminate the employment
of those Cody Energy employees designated by Acquiror on a written schedule
delivered to Cody Energy not fewer than 7 business days prior to Closing (the
"Terminated Employees"). Acquiror agrees as to itself and its Subsidiaries that
 --------------------
it will not violate any federal, state or local statute or ordinance prohibiting
discrimination in employment or any regulations or administrative
interpretations thereof in designating the employees of Cody Energy whose
employment will be terminated by Cody Energy immediately prior to the Closing as
provided in the preceding sentence. Termination of employment shall be effective
immediately prior to Closing. Cody Energy shall pay the Terminated Employees for
their accrued, but unused, vacation time as required by applicable law and in
the ordinary course of business. Terminated Employees shall receive the payment
to which they are entitled under the Transaction Bonus Plan or the Equity
Appreciation Incentive Plan at Closing or as soon as administratively
practicable after Closing and those Terminated Employees who are participants in
the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan shall receive payment of their
benefit under such plan on the first day of the month following the Closing or
as soon as administratively practicable thereafter. Payments under the
Transaction Bonus Plan, Equity Appreciation Incentive Plan, and Supplemental
Executive Retirement Plan shall be made only if all conditions for payment under
such plans shall have been satisfied. Acquiror and Cody Energy shall cooperate
to offer COBRA continuation coverage to the Terminated Employees under the Cody
Energy group health plan. If Acquiror terminates the Cody Energy group health
plan after Closing, any Terminated Employees and their covered dependents who
have elected COBRA continuation coverage shall be offered COBRA continuation
coverage under an Acquiror group health plan for the remainder of the applicable
COBRA continuation period so long as Acquiror maintains any group health plan.

          (ii)  Transition Employees. Acquiror in its discretion may engage some
or all of the Terminated Employees to provide services to Acquiror on terms and
conditions negotiated between Acquiror and such Terminated Employees prior to
Closing. After Closing, Acquiror in its discretion may engage Terminated
Employees, other former employees of Cody Energy or its subsidiaries, or current
employees of Cody Energy or its subsidiaries to continue their service as
temporary employees to aid in performing activities necessary to facilitate the
transition of ownership of Cody Energy. Individuals described in this Section
8.05(a)(ii) shall be referred to as "Transition Employees". The Transition
                                     --------------------
Employees shall provide services to Acquiror on terms and conditions negotiated
between Acquiror and such Transition Employees, and, unless Acquiror decides to
the contrary, such Transition Employees will not be covered by either the
benefit plans sponsored by Acquiror or the Cody Benefit Plans. Acquiror shall
provide COBRA continuation coverage to those Transition Employees who lose
coverage under the Cody Energy or Acquiror group health plan.

          (iii) Remaining Employees. As of the time immediately after Closing,
all other individuals who are employed by Cody Energy and its subsidiaries
immediately prior to Closing, whether or not actively at work, will remain
employees of Cody Energy, as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Acquiror (the "Cody
                                                                         ----
Energy Employees"). Thereafter Cody Energy may terminate the employment of any
----------------
Cody Energy Employee in its sole discretion at any time. The Cody Energy
Employees shall receive the amounts to which they are entitled under the
Transaction Bonus Plan or the Equity Appreciation Incentive Plan at Closing or
as soon as administratively

                                      53
<PAGE>

practicable after Closing and those Cody Energy Employees who are participants
in the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan shall receive payment of their
benefit under such plan on the first day of the month following the Closing or
as soon as administratively practicable thereafter. Payments under the
Transaction Bonus Plan, Equity Appreciation Incentive Plan, and Supplemental
Executive Retirement Plan shall be made only if all conditions for payment under
such plans shall have been satisfied.

     (b)  Cody Energy Benefit Plans. Acquiror shall, or shall cause Cody Energy
to, maintain the Cody Benefit Plans other than the plans specified on Schedule
8.05(d) (the "Cody Energy Benefit Plans") through the end of the calendar year
in which Closing occurs, and the Cody Energy Employees shall continue their
participation in such plans without interruption and without any diminution of
benefits. Acquiror shall cause Cody Energy to make a payment under the Cody
Energy Profit Sharing Program for the second quarter of 2001 equal to 2.4% of
Cody Energy's net income for the first two quarters of 2001 and reduced by the
amount paid under the Profit Sharing Program for the first quarter of 2001;
provided that the Program guidelines have been satisfied. The payment amount
shall be calculated according to past practice on a cumulative basis. In its
sole discretion, Acquiror may increase the percentage for the second quarter.
Payments for the third quarter of 2001 and any succeeding period shall be made
in Acquiror's sole discretion. Effective on or after January 1, 2002, Acquiror
may amend, terminate or merge any Cody Energy Benefit Plan into a comparable
Acquiror Benefit Plan. In addition, the Cody Energy Employees shall retain
credit for all accrued, but unused vacation to which they were entitled at
Closing.

     (c)  Participation in Acquiror Benefit Plans; Credit for Service With Cody.
The Cody Energy Employees shall commence participation in all employee benefit
plans (within the meaning of ERISA (S) 3(3)) and any other retirement, pension,
stock option, stock appreciation right, profit sharing, incentive compensation,
deferred compensation, savings, thrift, vacation pay, severance pay, or other
employee compensation or benefit plan, agreement, practice, or arrangement,
whether written or unwritten, whether or not legally binding, maintained or
contributed to by Acquiror or any member of the controlled or affiliated group
within the meaning of Code (S)(S) 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of which Acquiror is a
member ("Acquiror Benefit Plans") at the time determined by Acquiror in its sole
discretion after Closing, according to the terms and conditions of the Acquiror
Benefit Plans, and shall receive credit for all of their service with Cody, Cody
Energy, and their affiliates and predecessors under all Acquiror Benefit Plans
for purposes of participation and vesting only under such plans; except that the
Cody Energy Employees shall receive credit for their prior service for purposes
of accruals under Acquiror's vacation policy. Notwithstanding the foregoing
sentence, immediately following the Closing, the Cody Energy Employees shall
commence participation in Acquiror's qualified defined contribution plan, with
full credit for prior service as provided in the preceding sentence. The Cody
Energy Employees shall commence participation in Acquiror's qualified defined
benefit plan at the same time that they commence participation in the Acquiror
Benefit Plans (other than Acquiror's defined contribution plan) with full credit
for their prior service for purposes of participation and vesting only. No pre-
existing condition limitation or exclusion shall be applicable to the
participation and coverage of any Cody Energy Employee or dependent in any
Acquiror Benefit Plan that is a health plan except to the extent that such
conditions would not have been covered under the Cody Energy group health plan
or are not covered under Acquiror's group health plan. Expenses incurred by a
Cody Energy Employee or his or her

                                      54
<PAGE>

dependents that (i) applied toward any deductibles or out-of-pocket expense
limitations for the year in which the Closing or the transition to an Acquiror
health plan occurs or (ii) applied to any lifetime limitations shall be
recognized under the applicable Acquiror Benefit Plans and applied,
respectively, toward any applicable deductibles, out-of-pocket limitations or
lifetime limitations.

     (d)  Cody Company Benefit Plans. Acquiror shall not assume any benefit plan
set forth on Schedule 8.05(d) or the liability for any benefits provided under
any such plan. Prior to the Closing, Cody shall take all action necessary to
cause Cody Resources LP to become the sponsor of the benefit plans set forth on
Schedule 8.05(d). Following the Closing, Acquiror shall cause Cody to cooperate
with Cody Resources LP in complying with the requirements under Revenue
Procedure 96-60, relating to the reporting and withholding of employment taxes
for the year in which the Closing occurs with respect to the employees of Cody
Company who become employees of Cody Resources LP.

     (e)  401(k) Plan. Acquiror shall cause the trustee for an Acquiror Benefit
Plan that is a defined contribution plan to accept the direct rollover
(including outstanding plan loans) from the Cody Energy 401(k) Plan with respect
to Cody Energy Employees.

     (f)  COBRA. For periods subsequent to the Closing, Acquiror shall be
responsible for COBRA continuation coverage for all Cody Energy Employees,
Terminated Employees, and Transition Employees who lose coverage under the Cody
Energy group health plan or an Acquiror group health plan, and individuals who
were receiving COBRA continuation coverage under the Cody Energy group health
plan. Prior to the Closing, (i) Cody shall be responsible for all COBRA
continuation coverage for all Cody and Cody Energy Employees and (ii) Cody shall
take all action necessary to cause Cody Resources LP to assume responsibility
for COBRA continuation coverage for periods after the Closing for all employees
of Cody Company who were not or are not Cody Energy Employees.

     SECTION 8.06.  Merger Sub. Prior to the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall
                    ----------
not conduct any business or make any investments other than as specifically
contemplated by this Agreement and will not have any assets (other than a de
minimis amount of cash paid to Merger Sub for the issuance of its stock to
Acquiror) or liabilities.

     SECTION 8.07.  Director and Officer Liability.

     (a)  From and after the Effective Time, Cody Company and the Surviving
Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless, and provide advancement of
expenses to, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, each person
who is a current or former officer, director or Manager of Cody Energy or any of
its Subsidiaries (each a "Cody Energy Indemnified Agent") against all losses,
                          -----------------------------
claims, damages, liabilities, costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys'
fees), judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement in connection
with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation arising out of or
pertaining to acts or omissions, or alleged acts or omissions, by them in their
capacities as such, which acts or omissions occurred prior to or as of the
Effective Time. Acquiror shall have the option to control any such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation; and shall have the option to choose
counsel to represent the Cody Energy Indemnified Agent after discussion with the
Cody Energy Indemnified Agent.
<PAGE>

     (b)  Acquiror agrees that the provisions of Cody Company's Articles of
Incorporation and Bylaws and Cody Energy's Articles of Organization and
Operating Agreement in effect as of the date of this Agreement affecting the
Cody Energy Indemnified Agents' rights to indemnification, limitation of
liability and advancement of expenses shall survive the consummation of the
Merger and shall continue in full force and effect, without any amendment
thereto (unless required by law), for a period of six years from the Effective
Time.

     (c)  From and after the Effective Time, the Shareholders shall cause Cody
Resources to indemnify and hold harmless, and provide advancement of expenses
to, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, each person who is a
current or former officer or director of Cody Company or any of its Subsidiaries
other than Cody Energy and its Subsidiaries (each a "Cody Company Indemnified
                                                     ------------------------
Agent") against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs or expenses
-----
(including reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, penalties and amounts
paid in settlement in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation arising out of or pertaining to acts or omissions, or alleged acts
or omissions, by them in their capacities as such, which acts or omissions
occurred prior to or as of the Effective Time.  Cody Resources shall have the
option to control any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, and
shall have the option to choose counsel to represent the Cody Company
Indemnified Agent after discussion with the Cody Company Indemnified Agent.

     (d)  The Shareholders shall cause Cody Resources to agree that the
provisions of Cody Company's Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws in effect as
of the date of this Agreement affecting the Cody Company Indemnified Agents'
rights to indemnification, limitation of liability and advancement of expenses
shall be incorporated into Cody Resources organization documents and be binding
on Cody Resources, without amendment thereto (unless required by law), for a
period of six years from the Effective Time.

     (e)  The provisions of this Section 8.07 are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Cody Company and Cody Energy
Indemnified Agents, as applicable, their heirs and their representatives, and no
amendment or waiver under this Agreement will have any effect on the rights of
the Cody Company and Cody Energy Indemnified Agents, as applicable.

     SECTION 8.08.  Indemnification.
                    ---------------

     (a)  Cody Company Indemnification by Shareholders.  The Shareholders shall,
          --------------------------------------------
jointly and not severally, indemnify and hold harmless Acquiror and each of
Acquiror's Subsidiaries, Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents and
their successors and assigns (collectively, the "Acquiror Indemnified Parties")
                                                 ----------------------------
from and against any and all Cody Company Liabilities (as defined below). For
this purpose, "Cody Company Liabilities" means any and all Losses to the extent
               ------------------------
such Losses would not have been covered by the insurance of Cody Company or its
Subsidiaries in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time incurred or
suffered by any of the Acquiror Indemnified Parties as a result of, in
connection with, or arising from (i) any inaccurate representation or warranty
in or pursuant to Article III, (ii) the operations of Cody Company prior to the
Effective Time, excluding Losses as a result of, in connection with, or arising
from the assets or operations of Cody Energy and its Subsidiaries, or (iii) any
breach or nonfulfillment of any of the obligations, covenants or agreements made
by Cody Company under Section 6.01

                                      56
<PAGE>

or Article VIII; provided, however, that Cody Company Liabilities shall not
include Losses incurred or suffered by any of the Acquiror Indemnified Parties
as a result of, in connection with, or arising from any inaccurate
representation or warranty in or pursuant to Article III that relates to the
assets or operations of Cody Energy or its Subsidiaries, except for inaccurate
representations or warranties in or pursuant to Article III that relate to Cody
Energy Prior Taxes.

     (b)  Cody Energy Indemnification by Shareholders.  The Shareholders shall,
          -------------------------------------------
jointly and not severally, indemnify and hold harmless the Acquiror Indemnified
Parties from and against any and all Cody Energy Liabilities (as defined below).
"Cody Energy Liabilities" means any and all Losses to the extent Losses and
 -----------------------
Liabilities would not have been covered by the insurance of Cody Company or its
Subsidiaries in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time incurred or
suffered by any of the Acquiror Indemnified Parties as a result of, in
connection with, or arising from any inaccurate representation or warranty made
in or pursuant to Article IV; provided, however, that Cody Energy Liabilities
shall not include any Cody Company Liabilities.

     (c)  Indemnification by Acquiror. Acquiror shall indemnify and hold
          ---------------------------
harmless the Shareholders and their trustees, officers, directors, employees,
agents, and their successors and assigns (the "Shareholder Indemnified Parties")
                                               -------------------------------
from and against any and all Acquiror Liabilities (as defined below). For this
purpose, "Acquiror Liabilities" means Losses incurred or suffered by any of the
          --------------------
Shareholder Indemnified Parties as a result of, in connection with, or arising
from (i) any inaccurate representation or warranty made by Acquiror in or
pursuant to Article V, (ii) the assets or operations of Cody Company and its
Subsidiaries after the Effective Time (except to the extent of Losses covered by
Section 8.08(b)), or (iii) breach or non-fulfillment of any of the obligations,
covenants or agreements made by Acquiror in or pursuant to Section 6.02 and
Article VIII or the termination by Cody Energy of the Terminated Employees
pursuant to Section 8.05(a).

     d)   Indemnification Procedures.
          --------------------------

          (i)  Procedure for Third Party Claims. Promptly after service of
               --------------------------------
notice of any claim or of process on a party hereto by any third person in any
matter in respect of which indemnity may be sought from the other party pursuant
to this Agreement, the party so served shall notify the indemnifying party in
writing of the receipt thereof. The indemnifying party shall have the right to
participate in, or assume, at its own expense, the defense of any such claim or
process or settlement thereof. If the indemnifying party does not, within 15
days (or such earlier date as a response is due) of the receipt of a notice of
claim, acknowledge in writing to the indemnified party that the indemnifying
party shall be obligated under the terms of its indemnity hereunder in
connection with such claim, the indemnifying party shall be deemed to have
elected not to assume the defense, and the indemnified party may (but shall be
under no obligation to) contest any such lawsuit or other proceeding forming the
basis for such claim and the indemnifying party shall be bound by the result
obtained with respect thereto by the indemnified party. After notice from the
indemnifying party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the
indemnifying party shall not be liable to the indemnified party for any legal or
other expenses subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with
such defense except as otherwise set forth in this Section 8.08(d). Such defense
shall be conducted expeditiously (but with due regard for obtaining the most
favorable outcome reasonably likely under the

                                      57
<PAGE>

circumstances, taking into account costs and expenditures) and the indemnified
party shall be advised promptly of all significant developments and shall be
furnished with such other information as it shall reasonably request. The
indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any claim
or process the defense of which has been assumed by the indemnifying party and
to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expense of such counsel
shall be the expenses of such indemnified party except as otherwise set forth in
this Section 8.08(d). To the extent the Shareholders are the indemnifying party
and it becomes reasonably likely that the claim will not be fully covered by the
indemnities of the Shareholders and the security therefor, the indemnified party
may participate in the defense and the fees, costs and expenses incurred by the
indemnified party shall be paid by the indemnifying party. The failure of the
indemnified party to give the other party notice in accordance with this Section
8.08(d) shall not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to the
extent that the indemnifying party shall have been actually prejudiced as a
result of such failure. Settlement of any claim with respect to which the
indemnifying party has assumed the defense shall not be made without the prior
written consent of the indemnifying party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld. The indemnifying party may not settle any claim without
the prior written consent of the indemnified party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld.

          (ii) Procedures for Cody Company Liabilities. To the extent an
               ---------------------------------------
Acquiror Indemnified Party seeks indemnity from the Shareholders with respect to
Cody Company Liabilities, the Acquiror Indemnified Party shall give notice to
the Shareholder Representative and Cody Resources. Such notice shall constitute
a claim for indemnification under this Section 8.08. The Acquiror Indemnified
Party shall attempt to satisfy its indemnity claim first against Cody Resources
in its individual capacity; however, if in the Acquiror Indemnified Party's good
faith determination, Cody Resources is not capable of satisfying such claim,
does not engage in good faith negotiations regarding such claim, or is non-
responsive or otherwise unwilling or refuses to deal with such claim, the
Acquiror Indemnified Party may give notice thereof to the Shareholder
Representative if the Shareholder Representative is not Cody Resources. If Cody
Resources is the Shareholder Representative, the Acquiror Indemnified Party may,
at any time after such determination, invoke the dispute resolution procedures
of Article XI for the sole purpose of determining the amount of the Loss, if
any, for which the Acquiror Indemnified Party may be indemnified pursuant
hereto. If Cody Resources is not the Shareholder Representative, within thirty
(30) days after such notice is given to the Shareholder Representative, if Cody
Resources does not engage in good faith negotiations regarding and deal with
such claim in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the Acquiror Indemnified
Party, the Acquiror Indemnified Party may invoke the dispute resolution
provisions of Article XI for the sole purpose of determining the amount of the
Loss, if any, for which the Acquiror or Acquiror Indemnified Party may be
indemnified pursuant hereto. Invocation of the dispute resolution mechanism of
Article XI pursuant to this Section 8.08 shall entitle each of the Acquiror or
Acquiror Indemnified Party and the Shareholder Representative to present
evidence to the arbitration panel concerning the validity and the amount of Loss
claimed to have been incurred by the Acquiror Indemnified Party. In such event,
if Acquiror and the Shareholder Representative do not otherwise reach agreement
on the claim, the final decision of the arbitration panel shall be delivered
directly to the Escrow Agent, which decision shall constitute an instruction to
the Escrow Agent to disburse from the Cody L/C the amount represented by the
decision, if any, to Acquiror or the Acquiror Indemnified Party. Nothing herein
shall prevent the Parties from mutually agreeing to the amount of the Loss
sustained by Acquiror or Acquiror

                                      58
<PAGE>

Indemnified Party and submitting a joint instruction to the Escrow Agent to
disburse the agreed upon amount to Acquiror or Acquiror Indemnified Party.

          (iii)   Procedures for Cody Energy Liabilities. To the extent an
                  --------------------------------------
Acquiror Indemnified Party seeks indemnity from the Shareholders with respect to
Cody Energy Liabilities, the Acquiror Indemnified Party shall simultaneously
give notice of the indemnity claim to the Shareholder Representative and the
Escrow Agent. To the extent that such indemnity claim stems from a breach of any
of the representations in Section 4.09, such notice to the Shareholder
Representative shall comply with the requirements of an Environmental Defect
Notice pursuant to Section 7.04 and the Lowest Cost Response provisions thereof.
Such notice shall constitute a claim for indemnification under this Section
8.08. If the Shareholder Representative fails to deliver a notice in writing to
each of Acquiror and the Escrow Agent setting forth in reasonable detail, the
grounds for disputing such indemnity claim or the amount of such indemnity claim
within 30 days after such notice of indemnity claim is given to the Shareholder
Representative, Acquiror shall be entitled to a disbursement in the principal
amount of Acquiror's indemnity claim from the principal amount held in escrow of
the Cody Energy L/C. If within 30 days after such dispute notice is given to
Acquiror, the Shareholder Representative fails to engage in good faith
negotiations regarding and deal with such indemnity claim in a manner reasonably
satisfactory to the Acquiror Indemnified Party, the Acquiror Indemnified Party
may invoke the dispute resolution provisions of Article XI for the sole purpose
of determining the amount of the Loss, if any, for which the Acquiror or
Acquiror Indemnified Party may be indemnified pursuant hereto. Invocation of the
dispute resolution mechanism of Article XI pursuant to this Section 8.08 shall
entitle each of the Acquiror or Acquiror Indemnified Party and the Shareholder
Representative to present evidence to the arbitration panel concerning the
validity and the amount of Loss claimed to have been incurred by the Acquiror
Indemnified Party. In such event, if Acquiror and the Shareholder Representative
do not otherwise reach agreement on the claim, the final decision of the
arbitration panel shall be delivered directly to the Escrow Agent, which
decision shall constitute an instruction to the Escrow Agent to disburse from
the Cody Energy L/C the amount represented by the decision, if any, to Acquiror
or the Acquiror Indemnified Party. Nothing herein shall prevent the Parties from
mutually agreeing to the amount of the Loss sustained by Acquiror or Acquiror
Indemnified Party and submitting a joint instruction to the Escrow Agent to
disburse the agreed upon amount to Acquiror or Acquiror Indemnified Party.

     (e)  Security.
          --------

          (i)  As security for the Shareholders' indemnification obligations in
Section 8.08(a), the Shareholder Representative shall secure on behalf of the

                   ---------       ----------------
irrevocable, and transferable letter of credit from JP Morgan or another
financial institution reasonably acceptable to Acquiror and in a form reasonably
acceptable to Acquiror for the benefit of the Acquiror Indemnified Parties in
the amount of $30 million (the "Cody L/C"). The Cody L/C shall be returned to
                                --------
the Shareholder Representative at the end of the indemnification period set
forth in Section 12.01(a)(i); provided, however, if an Acquiror Indemnified
                              --------  -------
Party has made a claim for indemnification with respect to a matter covered by
the Cody L/C, the Cody L/C shall be maintained in an amount (not to exceed

                                      59
<PAGE>

$30 million) sufficient to satisfy such claim until such claim has been settled,
dismissed, or fully adjudicated.

          (ii)    As security for the Shareholders' indemnification obligations
in Section 8.08(b), the Shareholder Representative shall secure on behalf of the
Shareholders and deposit into escrow pursuant to the Escrow Agreement an
unconditional, irrevocable, and transferable letter of credit from JP Morgan or
another financial institution reasonably acceptable to Acquiror and in a form
reasonably acceptable to Acquiror for the benefit of the Acquiror Indemnified
Parties in the amount of $10 million (the "Cody Energy L/C"). The Cody Energy
                                           ---------------
L/C shall be returned to the Shareholder Representative at the end of the
indemnification period set forth in Sections 12.01(a)(ii)(A-C); provided,
                                                                --------
however, if an Acquiror Indemnified Party has made a claim for indemnification
-------
with respect to a matter covered by the Cody Energy L/C, the Cody Energy L/C
shall be maintained in an amount (not to exceed $10 million) sufficient to
satisfy such claim until such claim has been settled, dismissed, or fully
adjudicated.

     (f)  Limitations.  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section
          -----------
8.08:

          (i)  Cody Company Liabilities. The aggregate amount of the
               ------------------------
Shareholders' liability pursuant to Sections 8.08(a) and, with respect to Cody
Company Liabilities, 8.08(d) shall not exceed $30,000,000; all of which shall be
satisfied under the terms of the Cody L/C, and the Escrow Agreement.

          (ii) Cody Energy Liabilities.
               -----------------------

               (A)  There shall be no liability for any individual claim for
indemnification under Sections 8.08(b) and, with respect to Cody Energy
Liabilities, 8.08(d) except if the Losses that have been incurred or suffered by
the Acquiror Indemnified Parties attributable to such claim exceed $100,000 (the
"Cody Energy Individual Claim Threshold"). For purposes hereof, an individual
claim for indemnification shall include all claims arising or resulting from, or
associated in connection with (i) a single condition, event or occurrence or
series of related conditions, events or occurrences, or (ii) claims attributable
to a single third party (or such third party and any affiliate thereof) whether
attributable to one lease, contract, event, condition or occurrence or multiple
leases, contracts or series of related events, conditions or occurrences.

               (B)  There shall be no liability for indemnification under
Section 8.08(b) unless and until the Losses that have been incurred or suffered
by the Acquiror Indemnified Parties under Sections 8.08(b) and 8.08(d) exceeds
$2,000,000 (the "Cody Energy Indemnification Deductible"). At such time as the
                 --------------------------------------
aggregate amount of Cody Energy Liabilities exceeds the Cody Energy
Indemnification Deductible, the Acquiror Indemnified Parties shall be entitled
to all Cody Energy Liabilities in excess of the Cody Energy Indemnification
Deductible.

               (C)  The aggregate amount of the Shareholders' liability pursuant
to Sections 8.08(b) and, with respect to Cody Energy Liabilities, Section
8.08(d), shall not exceed $10,000,000; all of which shall be satisfied under the
terms of the Escrow Agreement and the Cody Energy L/C.

<PAGE>

          (iii)   Claims for indemnification under this Section 8.08 can be
made only during the period of survival of representations, warranties or
covenants as set forth in Section 12.01.

     (g)  Materiality Irrelevant. In determining a breach for indemnification
          ----------------------
purposes and calculating damages pursuant to this Section 8.08, any
"materiality" or "Material Adverse Effect" qualifier herein shall be
disregarded.

     (h)  Exclusive Remedy.  Acquiror's sole post-closing recourse against the
          ----------------
Shareholders for any breach by Cody Company of the representations, warranties,
covenants, and agreements contained in Articles III and IV are as set forth
in this Section 8.08.

     (i)  Liability of a Private Foundation Shareholder. Notwithstanding the
          ---------------------------------------------
foregoing, any Shareholder that is a "private foundation" as defined in section
509 of the Code shall have no liability under this Section 8.08 in excess of its
pro-rata share (determined on the basis of the number of shares of the Cody
Company Common Stock held at the Effective Time) of the aggregate liability of
the Shareholders under this Section 8.08.

     SECTION 8.09.  Closing Balance Sheet. Within 20 days after the Closing, the
                    ---------------------
Shareholder Representative shall deliver separate closing balance sheets for
Cody Company and each of its Subsidiaries and a consolidated closing balance
sheet for Cody Company and its Subsidiaries (the "Cody Company Closing Balance
                                                  ----------------------------
Sheet").
-----

     SECTION 8.10.  Transfer Taxes. Acquiror and the Shareholders shall each
                    --------------
bear 50 percent of any sales, use, transfer, stamp, documentary or other similar
Taxes and any recording and filing fees (collectively, "Transaction Transfer Tax
Liability") incurred in connection with the Merger, and, as provided in Section
1.06(c), the Shareholders' portion of such Transaction Transfer Tax Liability
shall be included in the Reserved Amount. Notwithstanding the previous sentence,
100 percent of any Tax liability related to the formation of Resources
Management, the Asset Contribution, the Redemption Transaction or the
termination of the SAB Position is to be paid by Cody Company and borne by the
Shareholders through inclusion in the Reserved Amount.

     SECTION 8.11.  Cody Company Tax Returns; Tax Audits. For purposes of this
                    ------------------------------------
Section 8.11, references to holders of the Cody Company Common Stock shall refer
to holders of the Cody Company Common Stock as of the date hereof.

     (a)  (i)  The holders of Cody Company stock shall cause Cody Company (at
Cody Company's expense) to prepare all Returns for Cody Company for all Pre-
Closing Periods, except for the Stub Period. The Cody Tax Representative shall
prepare a draft of any Return due for a Stub Period and deliver such draft
Return to Acquiror no later than forty-five (45) days prior to the due date
(including extensions) for such Return. If Acquiror identifies any item or
reporting position that it believes should be reported differently than how it
is reported on such draft Return, Acquiror shall notify the Cody Tax
Representative within 15 days of the receipt of such draft Return of the items
or reporting position that Acquiror believes should be reported differently. If
the Cody Tax Representative agrees with the changes requested by Acquiror, the
Cody Tax Representative shall prepare and file such Return to reflect such
changes. If the

                                      61
<PAGE>

parties cannot agree, the Cody Tax Representative and Acquiror shall each
appoint a Tax Expert, and the two Tax Experts so appointed shall select a third
Tax Expert to resolve the dispute. The Tax Experts shall decide whether to
incorporate the changes requested by Acquiror into the Return at issue based on
whether the changes requested by Acquiror are more likely than not to be
sustained if challenged. The Tax Experts shall render their decision at least
three business days prior to the due date of such Return. The decision of a
majority of the Tax Experts shall be binding on the parties, and the Cody Tax
Representative shall file the Return at issue to reflect the decision by the
majority of the Tax Experts. Acquiror and Cody Tax Representative shall
cooperate fully and promptly with each other in the preparation and filing of
the Returns described in this paragraph and the payment of any Tax. The books
and records of Cody Company shall be maintained so as to accurately reflect the
operations of Cody Company through the end of the Closing Date.

          (ii)    Acquiror shall cause to be prepared and filed all Returns
(other than those described in Section 8.11(a)(i)) required to be filed by Cody
Company after giving the Cody Company Tax Representative the opportunity to
review and approve (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) any such
Return that could affect any Tax item of Cody Company for a Pre-Closing Period.
Acquiror shall not take any position on any Returns with respect to a Post-
Closing Period that would adversely affect the Shareholders with respect to
their indemnity obligations under Section 8.08 or their liability for tax
matters of Cody Company with respect to Pre-Closing Periods of Cody Company or
that would adversely affect Cody Resources with respect to its liability under
the Assignment and Assumption Agreement; provided, however, that Acquiror may
take a position that (i) is consistent with a position taken on a Pre-Closing
Period Return of Cody Company or its Subsidiaries or (ii) is inconsistent with a
position taken on a Pre-Closing Period Return of Cody Company or its
Subsidiaries, if such inconsistent position is (A) required by a change in law
since the filing of the Return with the prior position, (B) consistent with or
required by a settlement with the IRS on such position for a Pre-Closing Period
or the final decision reached by a court on such position for a prior taxable
period, or (C) constitutes an Identified Inconsistent Position.

          (iii)   The Taxes allocable to the Stub Period shall be determined on
the accrual accounting method and on the basis of a closing of the books of Cody
Company, Cody Energy and each of its Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date.

          (iv)    With respect to transactions on the Closing Date but after the
Closing, Acquiror shall cause Cody Company and its Subsidiaries to only engage
in transactions that are in the ordinary course of business (and for this
purpose dividend or redemption transactions shall not be considered to be
transactions in the ordinary course of business).

     (b)  Cody Company shall pay all Taxes on or with respect to the Returns
described in paragraph (a)(i) any and all Taxes imposed with respect to or as a
result of the transactions (excluding the sale of Cody Company Common Stock by
the Shareholders) contemplated by this Agreement.

     (c)  The Cody Company Tax Representative and Acquiror shall cooperate fully
with each other in connection with the filing of Returns and amended Returns
pursuant to this Section 8.11 and with respect to any audits, disputes,
administrative or judicial proceeding, or

                                      62
<PAGE>

other proceeding with respect to the Tax obligations of Cody Company (a "Tax
                                                                         ---
Controversy"), and each such party shall honor the reasonable requests of the
-----------
other party with respect to such matters. Such cooperation shall include the
retention and the provision of records and information that are relevant to any
such Return or Tax Controversy and shall include making available employees and
other third parties to provide information and assistance. The Shareholders
agree to provide information requested by the Cody Company Tax Representative,
and otherwise cooperate with the Cody Company Tax Representative on a timely
basis, so that the Cody Company Tax Representative can fulfill its obligation to
cooperate with Acquiror as provided in this Section 8.11(c).

     (d)  For so long as the Cody Company Tax Representative is diligently
pursuing Tax Controversy matters in good faith, the Cody Company Tax
Representative shall have complete control over the handling and disposition
(including the settlement thereof) of any Tax Controversy or potential Tax
Controversy with respect to any Return of Cody Company that includes any Tax
items of Cody Company for a Pre-Closing Period. All costs with respect to such
Tax Controversies shall be borne by Cody Tax Representative to the extent the
Cody Tax Representative controls such Tax Controversy and such costs relate to
the Cody Tax Representative's handling of such Tax Controversy. Acquiror shall
cause Cody Company, or the appropriate party, to execute powers of attorney or
other documents to enable the Cody Company Tax Representative to take actions
desired by the Cody Company Tax Representative with respect to such Tax
Controversies.

     (e)  In the event that the Cody Company Tax Representative, Acquiror, Cody
Company or their affiliates receives notice of any pending or threatened action
by any governmental agency with respect to Taxes that could affect Cody Company
for any Pre-Closing Period, the party receiving such notice shall notify the
other parties in writing within seven calendar days thereafter. The failure of
any party to give the notice required by this paragraph shall not impair that
party's rights under this Agreement except to the extent that the other party
demonstrates that it has been damaged thereby.

     (f)  Acquiror shall use reasonable efforts to keep the Cody Company Tax
Representative advised as to the status of Tax Controversies involving any Tax
items of Cody Company for any Pre-Closing Period. Acquiror shall furnish to the
Cody Company Tax Representative copies of any inquiries, requests for
information or other correspondence from any taxing authority concerning any
such matters.

     (g)  Acquiror agrees, upon request by the Cody Company Tax Representative,
to use reasonable efforts to obtain any document from any Governmental Entity or
any other Person that may be helpful with respect to the matters described in
this Section 8.11.

     (h)  Neither Acquiror nor any of its affiliates shall file any Return or
any other document that attempts to carryback to any Pre-Closing Period of Cody
Company any item of income, loss, deduction or credit (including, without
limitation, any net operating loss) incurred, created or sustained during any
Post-Closing Period.

     (i)  If Acquiror or Cody Company receives a Tax refund with respect to
Taxes of Cody Company attributable to a Pre-Closing Period, Acquiror shall pay,
within 30 days

                                      63
<PAGE>

following the receipt of such Tax refund, the amount of such Tax refund to the
Cody Company Tax Representative on behalf of the Shareholders.

     (j)  Subject to the provisions of the next sentence, Acquiror shall not
 file, or cause Cody Company or any third party to file, any amended Return or
 refund claim with respect to a Pre-Closing Period of Cody Company without the
 prior written consent of the Cody Company Tax Representative. If requested by
 the Cody Company Tax Representative, and if the request meets conditions (w),
 (x), (y) or (z) of this Section 8.11(j), Cody Company shall not make an Amended
 Filing unless (w) both Acquiror and the Cody Tax Representative consent to such
 Amended Filing (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) or (x) such
 Amended Filing does not increase the liability (on a past, present or future
 basis) of Acquiror, Cody Company or the Shareholders to a Governmental Entity
 or under this Agreement or (y) such Amended Filing relates to an Identified
 Amended Return Issue or (z) prior to making such Amended Filing, the Cody Tax
 Representative pays to Cody Company or Acquiror the amount of the increase to
 the liability (on a past, present or future basis) of Cody Company or Acquiror
 to a Governmental Entity or under this Agreement. For purposes of clause (z) of
 this Section 8.11(j), Acquiror and the Cody Tax Representative will jointly
 agree on the amount of the increase in liability to Cody Company or Acquiror
 caused by any such Amended Filing. If the Acquiror and Cody Tax Representative
 cannot agree on such amount before making such Amended Filing, the Acquiror and
 Cody Tax Representative shall each appoint a Tax Expert, and the two Tax
 Experts so appointed shall select a third Tax Expert to resolve the dispute.
 The Tax Experts shall decide the amount of increased liability that Cody
 Company or Acquiror (i) will incur and/or (ii) the amount of increased
 liability that Cody Company or Acquiror may incur. The Cody Tax Representative
 shall pay prior to making such Amended Filing the amount of any increased
 liability the Tax Experts decide Cody Company or Acquiror will incur. For
 amounts of increased liability the Tax Experts decide Cody Company or Acquiror
 may incur, the Cody Tax Representative shall pay prior to making such Amended
 Return the amount of increased liability the Tax Experts decide Cody Company or
 Acquiror may incur to a third party escrow agent acceptable to, and pursuant to
 an escrow agreement acceptable to, Acquiror and Cody Tax Representative. The
 escrow agent shall pay from the amounts in escrow the actual amount of such
 liability to Cody Company or Acquiror, as the case may be, when Cody Company or
 Acquiror incurs such liability. If such liability is not actually incurred by
 Cody Company or Acquiror or if the amount placed in escrow is greater than the
 actual amount of such liability actually incurred by Cody Company or Acquiror,
 the escrow agent shall return such amounts in escrow attributable to such
 liabilities to the Cody Company Tax Representative. The decisions of a majority
 of the Tax Experts shall be binding on the Parties. Any refund of Tax
 (including interest and related amounts) received for a Pre-Closing Period of
 Cody Company shall be paid to the Cody Company Tax Representative on behalf of
 the Shareholders as provided in paragraph (i) above.

     (k)  If the Shareholders are required to make an additional payment of
Taxes with respect to any Pre-Closing Period for Cody Company (either directly
to a governmental agency or to Acquiror as an indemnity payment under Section
8.08 of this Agreement) or to otherwise make any indemnity payment to Acquiror
under Section 8.08 or if Cody Resources is required to make a payment to
Acquiror under the Assignment and Assumption Agreement, and, due to such payment
(or an item giving rise to such payment), Acquiror, Cody Company, or any
affiliate obtains a deduction or credit, Acquiror shall pay to the Shareholders
an amount equal to the

                                      64
<PAGE>

actual Tax savings produced by such deduction or credit. The amount of any such
Tax savings for any period shall be the amount of the actual reduction in Taxes
reflected on any Return for such period as compared to the Taxes that would have
been reflected on such Return in the absence of such deduction or credit. Any
deduction or credit not resulting in an actual Tax savings for the taxable
period to which it relates or for any earlier period shall be carried forward to
succeeding taxable years or carried back to preceding taxable years until used
to the extent permitted by law. Acquiror shall compute the amount of any such
payment required under this Section 8.11(k) and certify the accuracy of such
payment to the Cody Tax Representative which certificate shall be signed by the
Chief Financial Officer of Acquiror. If within 15 days of such certification the
Cody Tax Representative does not agree with the amount of such payment, then the
Acquiror and the Shareholder shall each appoint a Tax Expert, and the two Tax
Experts so appointed shall select a third Tax Expert to resolve the dispute. The
Tax Experts may review Acquiror's and Cody Company's Tax Returns to compute such
amount but must agree in writing on terms reasonably acceptable to Acquiror that
any review of such Returns will be confidential and that it will not share the
contents of such Returns with the Cody Tax Representative or with any person
other than Acquiror and Cody Company. The majority of the Tax Experts shall
issue a certification of their decision (in a form reasonably satisfactory to
the Cody Tax Representative) that the amount computed by them is accurate under
the foregoing provisions of this Section 8.11(k). The decision of a majority of
the Tax Experts shall be binding on the Parties. All payments pursuant to this
paragraph (k) shall be made within 30 days after the later of (A) the filing of
the applicable Return for the period in which such deduction or credit results
in a reduction in the Taxes paid by the entity receiving such deduction or
credit, and (B) the decision by a majority of the Tax Experts under this Section
8.11(k). For all Tax purposes, the Shareholders and the Acquiror agree that any
payment made by or on behalf of the Shareholders to Acquiror as part of an
indemnification claim or under Section 2.07(b) shall be treated as an adjustment
to the Merger Consideration.

     (l)  Acquiror shall: (i) retain all books and records with respect to Tax
matters pertinent to Cody Company relating to any Tax period beginning before
the Closing Date until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitation
(including any extensions thereof) of the respective Tax period, and shall
comply with all record retention agreements entered into with any taxing
authority and (ii) give the Cody Company Tax Representative reasonable written
notice prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and
records and, if the Shareholders or the Cody Company Tax Representative so
request, Acquiror shall allow the Cody Company Tax Representative to take
possession of such books and records.

     (m)  Acquiror shall not make any election or deemed election under section
338 of the Code or any similar state or local election with respect to the
purchase of the stock of the Company.

     (n)  Initially, the Cody Company Tax Representative shall be Cody
Resources. A replacement or successor representative may be appointed at any
time by the act of the Shareholders (or their successors) who hold a majority of
the Cody Company Common Stock at the time of Closing.

     (o)  The Parties covenant and agree that they will treat the Merger as the
purchase by Acquiror and the sale by the Shareholders of Cody Company Common
Stock for all accounting

                                      65
<PAGE>

and financial reporting purposes pursuant to the purchase method of accounting.
The Parties covenant and agree that they will treat the Merger as the purchase
by Acquiror and the sale by the Shareholders of Cody Company Common Stock for
all Tax purposes.

     SECTION 8.12.      Registration of Acquiror Common Stock. At the Closing,
                        -------------------------------------
Acquiror and the Shareholders shall enter into a Registration Rights Agreement
in substantially the form of Exhibit C hereto (the "Registration Rights
                             ---------              -------------------
Agreement").
---------

     SECTION 8.13.      Shareholder Representative.
                        --------------------------

     (a)  Designation.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Section
          -----------
8.13, Cody Resources is designated as the representative of the Shareholders
(the Shareholder Representative") by each Shareholder to serve, and Acquiror
     --------------------------
hereby acknowledges that the Shareholder Representative shall serve, as the sole
representative of the Shareholders from and after the date hereof with respect
to the matters set forth in this Agreement, such service to be without
compensation except for the reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses and
indemnification specifically provided herein. The Shareholder Representative has
accepted such designation as of the date hereof. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, the Shareholder Representative shall have
no duties or responsibilities except those expressly set forth herein, and no
implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or
liabilities on behalf of any Shareholder shall otherwise exist against the
Shareholder Representative.

     (b)  Authority.    Each of the Shareholders, by executing this Agreement,
          ---------
will and hereby does, effective as of the date hereof, irrevocably appoint the
Shareholder Representative as the agent, proxy and attorney-in-fact for such
Shareholder for all purposes of this Agreement, including full power and
authority on such Shareholder's behalf (i) to take all actions which the
Shareholder Representative considers reasonably necessary or desirable in
connection with the defense, pursuit or settlement of any determinations
relating to any claims for indemnification pursuant to Section 8.08, including
to sue, defend, negotiate, settle and compromise any such claims for
indemnification made by or against, and other disputes with, the Acquiror or the
Acquiror Indemnified Parties pursuant to this Agreement or any of the agreements
or transactions contemplated hereby; (ii) to engage and employ agents and
representatives (including accountants, legal counsel and other professionals)
and to incur such other expenses as the Shareholder Representative shall deem
necessary or prudent in connection with the administration of the foregoing;
(iii) to accept and receive notices to the Shareholders pursuant to this
Agreement; (iv) to receive services of process on behalf of all Shareholders in
any proceeding instituted by Acquiror or any Acquiror Indemnified Party pursuant
to this Agreement; and (v) to take all other actions and exercise all other
rights which the Shareholder Representative (in its sole discretion) considers
necessary or appropriate in connection with this Agreement. Each of the
Shareholders, by executing this Agreement, agrees that such agency and proxy are
coupled with an interest, and are therefore irrevocable without the consent of
the Shareholder Representative and shall survive the death, incapacity,
bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation of any Shareholder. All decisions and
acts by the Shareholder Representative shall be binding upon all of the
Shareholders, and no Shareholder shall have the right to object, dissent,
protest or otherwise contest the same.

                                      66
<PAGE>

     (c)  Reliance by Third Parties on the Shareholder Representative's
          -------------------------------------------------------------
Authority. The Shareholder Representative is authorized to act on the
---------
Shareholders' behalf and, notwithstanding any dispute or disagreement among the
Shareholders and the other parties hereto, shall be entitled to rely on any and
all action taken by the Shareholder Representative without any liability to, or
obligation to inquire of, any of the Shareholders even if such party shall be
aware of any actual or potential dispute or disagreement among the Shareholders.
Each of the other parties hereto is expressly authorized to rely on the
genuineness of the signature of the Shareholder Representative and, upon receipt
of any writing which reasonably appears to have been signed by the Shareholder
Representative, the other parties hereto may act upon the same without any
further duty of inquiry as to the genuineness of the writing.

     (d)  Exculpation and Indemnification. Neither the Shareholder
          -------------------------------
Representative nor any agent employed by it shall be liable to any Shareholder
relating to the performance of its duties under this Agreement for any errors in
judgment, negligence, oversight, breach of duty or otherwise, except to the
extent it is finally determined in a court of competent jurisdiction by clear
and convincing evidence that the actions taken or not taken by the Shareholder
Representative constituted fraud or were taken or not taken in bad faith. The
Shareholder Representative shall be indemnified and held harmless by the
Shareholders against all Losses paid or incurred in connection with any action,
suit, proceeding or claim to which the Shareholder Representative is made a
party by reason of the fact that he was acting as the Shareholder Representative
pursuant to this Agreement; provided, however, that the Shareholder
                            --------  -------
Representative shall not be entitled to indemnification hereunder to the extent
it is finally determined in a court of competent jurisdiction that the actions
taken or not taken by the Shareholder Representative constituted fraud or were
taken or not taken in bad faith. The Shareholder Representative shall be
protected in acting upon any notice, statement or certificate believed by him to
be genuine and to have been furnished by the appropriate person and in acting or
refusing to act in good faith on any matter.

     SECTION 8.14.  Post-Closing Title Review.
                    -------------------------

     (a)  After the Closing Acquiror may give the Shareholder Representative
written notice (a "Post-Closing Defect Notice") of any Title Defects not covered
                   --------------------------
by Defect Notice provided under Section 7.01 (a "Post-Closing Defect"). Such
                                                 -------------------
Post-Closing Defect Notice must be received by the Shareholder Representative no
later than the end of the 90-day indemnity survival period for title matters set
forth in Section 12.01(a)(ii), shall contain the same type of information as
provided in Section 7.01(b), and shall be subject to the provisions of Section
7.01(c).

     (b)  The Shareholders shall have 30 days after receipt of any Post-Closing
Defect Notice to either cure the Post-Closing Defect or reasonably dispute such
Post-Closing Defect, in which case the dispute resolution provisions of Article
XI shall apply. If a Post-Closing Defect claim is cured to Acquiror's
satisfaction by such date, no further claim for indemnity with respect thereto
shall be made. However, if the Shareholders do not cure or dispute any Post-
Closing Defect by such date then the Defect Value asserted by Acquiror in its
Post-Closing Defect Notice shall constitute a valid and finally determined
indemnity claim under Section 8.08, which shall be paid by the Shareholders to
Acquiror in accordance with this Agreement. If the parties dispute the adequacy
of the Shareholders' curative materials, whether such Title Defect has been

                                      67
<PAGE>

cured shall be resolved under Article XI, which dispute resolution mechanism
must be invoked by the Shareholder Representative within 10 business days after
receipt of a Cure Objection Notice from Acquiror as defined in Section 7.02(b).
If Acquiror does not deliver the Cure Objection Notice within 20 business days
after receipt of the Shareholders' curative materials, it shall be deemed to
have accepted the cure as removing the Title Defect. If the Shareholder
Representative does not invoke the dispute resolution process within the 10-day
period after receipt of a Cure Objection Notice, the Shareholders shall be
deemed not to have cured such Post-Closing Defect. The post-closing procedure
set forth in this Section 8.14 shall also be subject to the provisions of the
last sentence of Section 7.02(b).

     (c)  All Post-Closing Defect claims hereunder are subject to the applicable
indemnity provisions of Section 8.08(e)(ii) and 8.08(f). The procedure set forth
in this Section 8.14 shall constitute part of the indemnification procedure of
Section 8.08(d) and shall be the sole remedy of Acquiror under Section 8.08 with
regard to Post-Closing Defect claims.

     SECTION 8.15.  Non-Disclosure of Schedules. Acquiror and its agents and
                    ---------------------------
representatives will hold in strict confidence all of the schedules, attachments
and exhibits to the Assignment and Assumption Agreement, and none of such
schedules, attachments or exhibits shall be disclosed except as required by law,
which required disclosure shall, to the extent reasonably possible, be preceded
by three days prior written notice of such disclosure to the Shareholder
Representative, and in any event the Shareholder Representative shall be
provided with immediate notice of any disclosure made without giving such prior
notice.

Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") as such rules are in
                                                ---
effect as of the date of this Agreement, except to the extent such rules
conflict with the express provisions of this Article XI (which provisions shall
prevail in the event of a conflict), with discovery to be conducted in
accordance with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and with any disputes over
the scope of discovery to be determined by the arbitrator(s). The party hereto
desiring arbitration shall commence arbitration in the manner specified in said
rules._

     (a)  For all disputes involving a claim in excess of $1,000,000, the
arbitration hereunder shall be by three independent and impartial arbitrators.
Cody Company and Acquiror shall each appoint one arbitrator within thirty days
after initiation of arbitration and the two arbitrators so appointed shall

<PAGE>

     (b)  For all disputes involving a claim for less than $1,000,000, the
arbitration hereunder shall be conducted by a single independent and impartial
arbitrator to be appointed by the AAA. Unless as otherwise required hereunder
for a particular dispute, the AAA shall appoint an independent arbitrator that

than ten years of practical experience in the relevant field of the oil and gas
industry that is implicated by the dispute in issue in accordance herewith. No

arbitration, the AAA shall submit a list of three potential arbitrators to each
of Cody Company and Acquiror. Cody Company and Acquiror shall have a period of
five business days in which to register objections to any of the proposed
arbitrators based upon lack of independence, lack of qualification or any other
material factor which would substantially impair such arbitrator's effectiveness
for the dispute in issue. The AAA shall then consider such objections, if any,
and shall then appoint a sole arbitrator no more than 30 days after the dispute
has been submitted for arbitration. Cody Company and Acquiror each hereby agree
that such appointment by the AAA shall be final and binding.

     SECTION 11.02.  Arbitration Procedures. All matters arbitrated hereunder
                     ----------------------

choose, with or without counsel. Adherence to formal rules of evidence shall not
be required but the arbitration panel shall consider any evidence and testimony
that it determines to be relevant, in accordance with procedures that it
determines to be appropriate. The arbitration award shall be in writing and
shall specify the factual and legal bases for the award. The role of the
arbitration panel shall be the determination of the amount in controversy for
any given dispute and such arbitration panel may not award legal or equitable
relief, including but not limited to specific performance of any nature that is
not otherwise expressly provided for by the terms of this Agreement. Neither
Cody Company nor Acquiror shall be entitled to and no award shall include any
amount for lost profits, lost business opportunities, business interruption, or
punitive or exemplary damages for any claim arbitrated pursuant to this Article
XI, but all awards shall be subject to the dollar thresholds, deductibles and
limitations provided for by this Agreement.

     (b)  The arbitrator(s) shall be entitled to a fee commensurate with their
fees for professional services requiring similar time and effort. The fees of
the arbitrator(s) and other costs of the arbitration shall be borne 50% by the
Shareholders and 50% by Acquiror.

                     -----------
submission and agreement to arbitrate shall be governed by and specifically
enforceable in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware. Arbitration
may proceed in the absence of any party if notice of the proceedings has been
given to such party. Each of Cody Company and Acquiror agrees to abide by all
awards rendered in such proceedings and such awards shall be final and binding
on each of Cody Company and Acquiror.

     All awards may be filed with the clerk of one or more courts, state,
federal or foreign, having jurisdiction over the party against whom such award
is rendered or his property, as a

for entry and enforcement of any arbitration award. Each of Cody Company and
Acquiror shall continue to perform its obligations under this Agreement pending
conclusion of the arbitration.

     SECTION 11.04.  Limitation Periods. The arbitration procedures provided by
                     ------------------
this Article XI are provided for the limited purpose of resolving the types of
disputes enumerated above and no party hereto shall have the right to cause the
other party to arbitrate a dispute pursuant to the provisions hereof if such

within the specified time frame for such claim as provided for herein.

further exercise thereof or of any other right. All rights and remedies existing
under this Agreement are cumulative to, and not exclusive of, any rights or
remedies otherwise available.

be executed as of the date first written above by their respective officers
thereunto duly authorized.

          (a) Each of Cody Company and Cody Resources shall cooperate with and
     assist the other party in making claims under insurance policies relating
     to periods prior to the Closing Date and collecting Recoveries with respect
     thereto.  Cody Company and Cody Resources shall give each other prompt
     notice of any dispute that is anticipated to give rise to a claim against
     any insurance carrier with respect thereto.

          (b) Cody Company agrees that: (i) Cody Resources shall administer any
     claim for a Recovery relating to an Assumed Liability; (ii) Cody Resources
     shall be subrogated to any rights of Cody Company under insurance policies
     that were maintained by Cody Company on or prior to the Closing Date that
     may afford insurance coverage for such Assumed Liability and, for such
     purpose, may pursue such insurance claim in the name of Cody Company;
     provided, however, that Cody Resources shall bear all costs, fees and
     expenses incurred in connection with such claim and shall indemnify and
     hold Cody Company harmless from any Liability arising from Cody Resource's
     actions in pursuing such claim.  In the event that a Recovery is obtained
     pursuant to Section 6.6(b)(ii), such Recovery shall, first, be used to pay
     the costs, fees and expenses incurred by Cody Company pursuant to such
     Section; second, be used to pay or settle the associated Assumed Liability
     or, as appropriate, to reimburse the party that paid or settled such
     Assumed Liability; third, to pay the fees, costs and expenses (including
     any applicable retainage) incurred by Cody Resources in connection with
     such claim or Assumed Liability; and, fourth, any remainder shall be paid
     to Cody Company.

          Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a joint claim for a Recovery is
     asserted by both Cody Company and Cody Resources, Cody Company shall
     administer the claim, and Cody Resources shall pay its proportionate share
     of the reasonable out-of-pocket costs of such administration, based on the
     reasonable estimate of the proportionate amount of each party's claim, as
     agreed to by the parties.  If the amount of any Recovery is less than the
     joint claims of Cody Company and Cody Resources to be paid from such
     Recovery, the parties shall agree upon an equitable allocation of the
     Recovery based upon the proportionate amount of each party's claim as
     previously agreed to by the parties.

          6.7  Pending Claims and Litigation.  After the Closing Date, and
               -----------------------------

their respective Affiliates) may settle or compromise, or consent to the entry
of any judgment with respect to any claim or Action brought against both Cody
Company and Cody Resources without the prior written consent of the other party
if such settlement, compromise or consent to such judgment includes any form of
injunctive relief binding upon such other party or would have a Material Adverse
Effect upon such other party.

     (3) Claims for Indemnification and Satisfaction Thereof.  If an Acquiror
         ---------------------------------------------------
Indemnified Party submits a claim for indemnification under the Agreement,
Acquiror shall simultaneously give notice thereof to the Escrow Agent ("Notice
of Claim").  The Notice of Claim shall specify whether the indemnification is
sought for a Third Party Claim, to which L/C the claim applies and shall state
that such claim takes into account the applicable thresholds and deductibles
pursuant to Section 8.08(f) of the Agreement.  If the Shareholder Representative
fails within thirty (30) days after having received a Notice of Claim, to give
the Escrow Agent notice that:  (a) with respect to any Third Party Claim, that
the Shareholders have assumed the defense thereof, or (b) with respect to any
claim (including a Third Party Claim), that the Shareholders object to such
claim or dispute the amount of such claim; then the Shareholders shall be deemed
to have acknowledged the correctness of such claim for the full amount thereof
and the Escrow Agent shall draw on the applicable L/C and disburse the drawn
funds to Acquiror to satisfy such claim as follows:

               (i)   With respect to a Third Party Claim for which the
Shareholders did not assume the defense, Acquiror shall submit documentation of
costs actually incurred in connection with such Third Party Claim to each of the
Shareholder Representative and the Escrow Agent and the Escrow Agent shall
disburse funds equal to such documented costs from the applicable L/C as
requested from time to time by Acquiror to pay the costs of defense thereof and
any result by settlement or judgment with respect to such Third Party Claim as
evidenced by a certificate delivered to the Escrow Agent and the Shareholder
Representative as to such costs, settlement or judgment;

               (ii)  With respect to any other claim, the Escrow Agent shall
draw on the applicable L/C and disburse the drawn funds to Acquiror in the
amount of the claim provided in the Notice of Claim.

     If the Shareholder Representative delivers a notice in writing to each of
Acquiror and the Escrow Agent within thirty (30) days of having received a
Notice of Claim, setting forth in reasonable detail the grounds for disputing
such claim for indemnification, the Escrow Agent shall not disburse funds from
the applicable L/C unless and until it receives (i) joint instructions to do so
from Acquiror and the Shareholder Representative, (ii) a copy of a binding
arbitration award or (iii) a valid court order pursuant to the terms of the
Agreement.

     (4) Return of L/C's.  To the extent the Escrow Agent has not received a
         ---------------
Notice of Claim that has not been resolved, the Escrow Agent, upon the receipt
of joint written instructions from the Acquiror and the Shareholder
Representative certifying to the expiration of the applicable indemnification
period as set forth in the Agreement, shall return (a) the Cody Energy L/C to
the Shareholders within five business days after the one year anniversary of the
Closing Date and (b) the Cody L/C within five business days after the close of
business 20 business days after the expiration of all statutes of limitations
applicable to Cody Energy Pre-Closing Tax Liabilities.

     To the extent a Notice of Claim is unresolved at the expiration of the
applicable indemnification period, the Escrow Agent shall not return the L/C's
unless and until a replacement L/C sufficient to cover any unresolved claims is
delivered to Escrow Agent and

<PAGE>
                                      -3-

Escrow Agent has received joint instruction from Acquiror and the Shareholder
Representative certifying to such facts.

     (5)  Termination of Escrow.  This Escrow Agreement shall terminate on the
          ---------------------
earlier to occur of (a) the date on which the L/C's are fully drawn by the
Acquiror in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement, or (b) the date
on which the last L/C held by the Escrow Agent is returned to the Shareholders.

     (6)  Account Records.  The Escrow Agent shall forward all account records
          ---------------
or statements related to the L/Cs and draws thereon to Acquiror and the
Shareholder Representative. The Escrow Agent shall deliver to Acquiror and the

the Escrow Agent shall not be obligated to act except upon written instructions
or direction.  The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any action (or
refraining from any action) taken by it in good faith and believed by it to be

connection with the performance of its duties hereunder; provided, however, that
the Escrow Agent shall not be indemnified for any loss, damage, liability or
expense caused by or arising out of the Escrow Agent's gross negligence, willful
misconduct or failure to act in good faith.

          (d) It shall be the Escrow Agent's responsibility for the safekeeping
of the L/Cs, draws on the L/Cs and the disbursement and delivery of such draws
in accordance with this Escrow Agreement and the Agreement, and the maintenance
of records in accordance with this Escrow Agreement, and the Escrow Agent shall

hereunder, the Escrow Agent shall have the absolute right at its election to do
either or both of the following:  (i) withhold or stop all performance under
this Escrow Agreement (save and except the safekeeping of the L/Cs) until the

upon under any court order or by federal, state or local taxing authorities, or
in case the payment, assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery of any such
property shall be stayed or enjoined by any court order, or in case any order,
judgment or decree shall be made or entered by any court affecting such property
or any part thereof, then and in any of such events, the Escrow Agent is
authorized to rely upon and comply with any such order, writ, levy, judgment or
decree which it is advised by legal counsel of its own choosing is binding upon
it; and if it complies with any such order, writ, levy, judgement or decree, it
shall not be liable to any of the parties hereto, or any other person, firm or
corporation, by reason of such compliance even though such order, writ, levy,
judgment or decree may be subsequently reversed, modified, annulled, set aside
or vacated.

          (g) The Escrow Agent shall not be required or have a duty to notify
any person of any payment or the maturity of any security held hereunder nor
shall it be required to take any legal action to enforce payment of any security
held hereunder; provided however, it shall be obligated to provide notice to the
Acquiror and the Shareholder Representative of any draws made on the L/C's
disbursement therefrom or any return of any L/C.

securities now or hereafter deposited hereunder, or of endorsement thereon, or
for any lack of endorsement thereon, or for any description therein, nor shall

such Registrable Securities under such other securities or blue sky laws of such

Securities owned by such Holder; provided that the Company shall not be required
to (i) qualify generally to do business in any jurisdiction where it would not
otherwise be required to qualify but for this paragraph (d), (ii) subject itself
to taxation in any such jurisdiction or (iii) consent to general service of

          (e)  immediately notify each Holder, at any time when a prospectus
relating to the Registrable Securities is required to be delivered under the
Securities Act, of the occurrence of an event known to the Company requiring the
preparation of a supplement or amendment to such prospectus so that, as
thereafter delivered to the purchasers of such Registrable Securities, such
prospectus will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading, and make available to each Holder any such
supplement or amendment when available;

          (f)  enter into or arrange for the furnishing of customary agreements
and documents (including an underwriting agreement in customary form) and take
such other actions as are reasonably required in order to expedite or facilitate
the disposition of such Registrable Securities;

          (g)  make available for inspection by any Holder, any underwriter
retained by any such Holder and any counsel or other professional for either
(collectively, the "Inspectors") all financial and other records and pertinent
corporate documents of the Company or its subsidiaries (collectively, the
"Records") as shall be reasonably necessary to enable them to exercise their due
diligence responsibility, and cause the Company's and its subsidiaries'
officers, directors and employees to supply all information reasonably requested
by any such Inspector in connection with the Shelf Registration, it being agreed
by each Holder that (i) each Inspector that actually reviews Records supplied by
the Company or its subsidiaries shall be

                                      -3-
<PAGE>

required, prior to any such review, to execute an agreement with the Company
providing that such Inspector shall not disclose any confidential information of
the Company unless such disclosure is required by applicable law or legal
process, (ii) each Holder will not make any market transaction in securities of
the Company based on such confidential information in violation of applicable
securities laws, (iii) each Holder will, upon learning that disclosure of
confidential information is sought in a court of competent jurisdiction, give

in a manner which shall not unreasonably disrupt the operations of the Company
or the work performed by the Company's officers and employees;

          (h)  use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain (i) an opinion
or opinions of counsel to the Company and (ii) a comfort letter or comfort
letters from the Company's independent public accountants each in customary
form, addressed to any underwriters engaged by the Holders and covering such
matters of the type customarily covered by such opinion and comfort letters as
the managing underwriter reasonably requests; and

          (i)  otherwise use its commercially reasonable efforts to comply with
all applicable rules and regulations of the Commission.

          The Company may require each Holder to furnish to the Company such
information regarding the distribution of such Registrable Securities as the
Company may from time to time reasonably request in writing and such other
information as may be legally required in connection with such registration.

          Each Holder agrees that, upon receipt of any notice from the Company
of the happening of any event of the kind described in Section 3(a) or 3(e)
hereof, such Holder will forthwith discontinue disposition of Registrable
Securities pursuant to the Shelf Registration until such Holder's receipt of the
copies of the supplemented or amended prospectus contemplated by Section 3(e)
hereof, and, if so directed by the Company, such Holder will deliver to the
Company all copies, other than permanent file copies, then in such Holder's
possession of the prospectus covering such Registrable Securities current at the
time of receipt of such notice. Each Holder also agrees to notify the Company if
any event relating to such Holder occurs that would require the preparation of a
supplement or amendment to the prospectus so that such prospectus will not
contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading.

          If a Holder delivers to the Company a request to remove the legend
from certificates representing Registrable Securities together with (i) the
Holder's certification that the Holder has sold Registrable Securities in
accordance with this Agreement and in the manner described in the Shelf
Registration and (ii) any documentation required by the Company's transfer agent
to transfer the Registrable Securities, the Company will within one business day
after its receipt of such materials instruct its transfer agent to permit the
transfer and the issuance of unlegend certificates registered in the name of the
transferee representing the Registrable Securities so sold.

                                      -4-
<PAGE>

          The Company will cooperate with the Shareholders, at the Shareholders'
sole expense, to take reasonable actions specified by the Shareholders that do
not have an adverse effect on the Company to assist the Shareholders in any

amendment or supplement thereto or in any preliminary prospectus, or arising out
of or based upon any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or
expenses arise out of, or are based upon, any such untrue statement or omission
or allegation thereof based upon information furnished in writing to the Company
by such Holder or on such Holder's behalf expressly for use therein; provided,
however, that the Company shall not be liable to any such person with respect to
any loss, claim, damage or liability (or actions in respect thereof) arising out
of or based on any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or
alleged omission to state a material fact in any preliminary prospectus, which
is correct in a final prospectus if the person asserting any such loss, claim,
damage or liability was not sent or given a copy of the prospectus at or prior
to the written confirmation of the sale of such shares to such person. The
Company also agrees to indemnify any underwriters of the Registrable Securities,
their officers and directors and each person who controls such underwriters on
the same basis as that of the indemnification of the Holders provided in this
Section 5(a).

          (b)  Conduct of Indemnification Proceedings.  If any action or
proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be brought or
asserted against any Holder (or its officers, directors, partners or agents) or
any person controlling any such Holder in respect of which indemnity may be
sought from the Company, the Company shall assume the defense

                                      -5-
<PAGE>

thereof, including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to such
Holder, and shall assume the payment of all fees and expenses. Such Holder or
any controlling person thereof shall have the right to employ separate counsel
in any such action and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and
expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Holder or such
controlling person unless (i) the Company has agreed to pay such fees and
expenses or (ii) the named parties to any such action or proceeding (including
any impleaded parties) include both such Holder or such controlling person and
the Company, and such Holder or such controlling person shall have been advised
by counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available to such Holder
or such controlling person which are different from or additional to those
available to the Company, in which case, if such Holder or such controlling
person notifies the Company in writing that it elects to employ separate counsel
at the expense of the Company, the Company shall not have the right to assume
the defense of such action or proceeding on behalf of such Holder or such
controlling person; it being understood, however, that the Company shall not, in
connection with any one such action or proceeding or separate but substantially
similar or related actions or proceedings in the same jurisdiction arising out
of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the fees and
expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (together with appropriate
local counsel) at any time for all Holders and such controlling persons, and
that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. The
Company shall not be liable for any settlement of any such action or proceeding
effected without the Company's written consent, but if settled with its written
consent, or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff in any such action or
proceeding, the Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless such Holder and
such controlling person from and against any loss or liability (to the extent
stated above) by reason of such settlement or judgment.

          (c)  Indemnification by Holders of Registrable Securities.  Each
Holder agrees, severally but not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the
Company, its directors and officers who sign the registration statement and each
person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of either Section 15
of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as
the foregoing indemnity from the Company to such Holder, but only with respect
to information concerning such Holder furnished in writing by such Holder or on
such Holder's behalf expressly for use in any registration statement or
prospectus relating to the Registrable Securities, or any amendment or
supplement thereto, or any preliminary prospectus. In case any action or
proceeding shall be brought against the Company or its directors or officers, or
any such controlling person, in respect of which indemnity may be sought against
such Holder, such Holder shall have the rights and duties given to the Company,
and the Company or its directors or officers or such controlling person shall
have the rights and duties given to such Holder, by the preceding paragraph.
Each Holder also agrees to indemnify and hold harmless underwriters of the
Registrable Securities, their officers and directors and each person who
controls such underwriters on the same basis as that of the indemnification of
the Company provided in this Section 5(c).

          (d)  Contribution.  If the indemnification provided for in this
Section 5 is unavailable to any indemnified party in respect of any losses,
claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to herein, then each
indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall
contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result
of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses in such proportion as
is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party and the
indemnified parties in

                                      -6-
<PAGE>

connection with the actions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages,
liabilities or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
The relative fault of such indemnifying party and indemnified parties shall be
determined by reference to, among other things, whether any action in question,
including any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission
or alleged omission to state a material fact, relates to information supplied by
such indemnified party or indemnified parties, and the parties' relative intent,
knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such
action.

          The Company and the Holders agree that it would not be just and
equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 5(d) were determined by pro
rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account
of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding
paragraph. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the
losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to in the immediately
preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set
forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified
party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 5(d), no underwriter shall be
required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total
price at which the Registrable Securities underwritten by it and distributed to
the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which
such underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or
alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of
fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the
Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not
guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

6.   Participation in Registrations.

          No Holder may participate in any registration hereunder unless it
completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities,
underwriting agreements and other documents reasonably required under the terms
of this Agreement.

          Each Holder agrees that it will not, directly or indirectly, effect a
Disposition of any Company Securities (or solicit any offers to effect a
Disposition of any Company Securities), except in compliance with the Securities
Act and either (x) with the written consent of the Company or (y) in a broad
distribution of such Company Securities so that not more than 20% of the Common
Stock shall be sold to any one purchaser (which shall include the affiliates and
associates of, and any person acting in concert with, such purchaser)

7.   Miscellaneous.

          (a)  Binding Effect.  Unless otherwise provided herein, the provisions
of this Agreement shall be binding upon and accrue to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective heirs, legal representatives, permitted transferees,
successors, and permitted assigns.

          (b)  Amendment.  This Agreement may be amended or terminated only by a
written instrument signed by the Company and the Holders of a majority of the
shares of Registrable Securities.

                                      -7-

          (c)  Applicable Law. The internal laws of the State of Delaware
(without regard to choice of law provisions thereof) shall govern the
interpretation, validity and performance of the terms of this Agreement.

          (d)  Notices.  All notices provided for herein shall be in writing and
shall be deemed to have been duly given if delivered personally or sent by
registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, as set forth in Section 12.02 of
the Merger Agreement.

          (e)  Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of
this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void
or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and
restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have caused this Agreement to be duly
executed by their respective authorized officers as of the day and year first
above written.
