AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

   

 THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement") dated as of July 21, 2007, is by and among Transocean Inc., a company incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands ("Transocean"), GlobalSantaFe Corporation, a company incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands ("GlobalSantaFe"), and Transocean Worldwide Inc., a company incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Transocean ("Merger Sub"). 

  

RECITALS 

   

 A. The Merger and the Reclassification. GlobalSantaFe and Merger Sub intend to effect the Merger described in Section 1.1 and Transocean intends to effect the Reclassification described in Section 1.2 pursuant to schemes of arrangement, each under Section 86 of The Companies Law (2007 Revision) of the Cayman Islands (the "Companies Law"), so that GlobalSantaFe will merge with Merger Sub, and Transocean will reclassify its outstanding Transocean Ordinary Shares into the number of new Transocean Ordinary Shares and the amount of cash described in Section 4.1. 

  

 B. Intended U.S. Tax Consequences of the Merger. It is intended that, for United States federal income tax purposes, the Merger shall qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and the regulations promulgated thereunder, and this Agreement is hereby adopted as a plan of reorganization for purposes of Section 368(a) of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder. 

  

 C. Intended U.S. Accounting Treatment. The parties to this Agreement intend that the Merger be treated as the purchase of GlobalSantaFe by Transocean for U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, and of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

Merger Sub and GlobalSantaFe; and all and singular, the rights, privileges,

property, real, personal and mixed, and all debts due to any of said
constituent companies on whatever account, as well as for share subscriptions
as all other things in action or belonging to each of such companies shall be
vested in Merger Sub; and all property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises, and all and every other interest shall be thereafter as
effectually the property of Merger Sub as they were of the two constituent
companies, and the title to any real estate vested by deed or otherwise,
under the laws of the Cayman Islands, in either of such constituent
companies, shall not revert or be in any way impaired by reason of the
Merger; but all rights of creditors and all liens upon any property of either
of said constituent companies shall be preserved unimpaired, and all debts,
liabilities and duties of the constituent companies shall thenceforth attach
to Merger Sub, and may be enforced against it to the same extent as if such
debts, liabilities and duties had been incurred or contracted by it.

Consideration"), and (ii) $22.46 in cash (the "GlobalSantaFe Cash
Consideration" and, together with the GlobalSantaFe Share Consideration,
the "GlobalSantaFe Merger Consideration"), in exchange for each GlobalSantaFe

nonassessable ordinary share, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Entity.

Each Transocean Option shall, to the extent provided by the Transocean Stock Plans and the option agreements entered into pursuant thereto, be fully vested and exercisable as of the Initial Effective Time and shall otherwise be subject to the same terms and conditions as under the applicable Transocean Stock Plan, the applicable option agreement and any other governing instrument with respect to such Transocean Option entered into pursuant thereto, except that immediately following the Initial Effective Time (A) each Transocean Option shall be exercisable for that whole number of Transocean Ordinary Shares equal to the product (rounded down to the nearest whole share) of the number of Transocean Ordinary Shares subject to such Transocean Option immediately prior to the Initial Effective Time multiplied by the Transocean Adjustment Fraction, and (B) the exercise price per Transocean Ordinary Share shall be an amount equal to the exercise price per Transocean Ordinary Share subject to such Transocean Option in effect immediately prior to the Initial Effective Time divided by the Transocean Adjustment Fraction (the price per share, as so determined, being rounded up to the nearest whole cent). As of the Initial Effective Time, each Transocean Option identified in Section 4.1(c) of the Transocean Disclosure Letter shall remain exercisable in accordance with the terms of such Transocean Option and, if such Transocean Option would otherwise expire earlier, it shall be deemed modified to remain exercisable for the full scheduled term of such Transocean Option in the event the holder of such Transocean Option is involuntarily terminated, for any reason other than Cause (as defined in the applicable award agreements or, if not so specified, as agreed by the parties hereto and set forth on Section 4.1(c)(i) of the Transocean Disclosure Letter), within twelve months after the Initial Effective Time. In this Agreement, (x) "VWAP" means, as of any specified date, the volume-weighted average price per share of Transocean Ordinary Shares or GlobalSantaFe Ordinary Shares, as the case may be, on the New

Stock Exchange) and ending at 4:00 p.m., New York City time (or such other
time as is the official close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange), as
calculated by Xignite, Inc., (y) the "Transocean Adjustment Fraction" means
(i) the VWAP of the Transocean Ordinary Shares on the last trading day
immediately preceding the Closing Date, divided by (ii) the Post-Closing
Transocean Ordinary Share Fair Market Value, and (z) the "Post-Closing
Transocean Ordinary Share Fair Market Value" means (A) the VWAP of the
Transocean Ordinary Shares on the last trading day immediately preceding the
Closing Date minus the Transocean Cash Consideration, divided by (B)

 (iii) Except as otherwise specifically provided by this Section 4.1(c), the terms of the Transocean Options and the relevant Transocean Stock Plans, as in effect at the Initial Effective Time, shall remain in full force and effect with respect to the Transocean Options after giving effect to the Reclassification. From and after the date of this Agreement, no action shall be taken by Transocean or its Subsidiaries to provide for the acceleration of the exercisability of any Transocean Options in connection with the Merger (except to the extent such acceleration is required under the terms of the governing instruments with respect to such Transocean Options). As soon as practicable following the Initial Effective Time, Transocean shall deliver to the holders of Transocean Options appropriate notices setting forth such holders rights pursuant to the respective Transocean Stock Plans and the agreements evidencing the grants of such Transocean Options and that such Transocean Options and such agreements shall continue in effect on the same terms and conditions (subject to the adjustments required by this Section 4.1(c)). 

   

 (iv) At the Effective Time, all options to acquire GlobalSantaFe Ordinary Shares (individually, a "GlobalSantaFe Option" and collectively, the "GlobalSantaFe Options") identified in Section 4.1(c) of the GlobalSantaFe Disclosure Letter (as hereinafter defined) and any other GlobalSantaFe Options granted after the date of this Agreement in accordance with the terms of this Agreement that are outstanding at the Effective Time under GlobalSantaFes stock plans (collectively, the "GlobalSantaFe Stock Plans") shall remain outstanding following the Effective Time, subject to the modifications described in this Section 4.1(c)(iv). Prior to the Effective Time, GlobalSantaFe and Transocean shall take all actions (if any) as may be required to permit the assumption of such GlobalSantaFe Options by Transocean pursuant to this Section 4.1(c)(iv). At the Effective Time, the GlobalSantaFe Options shall be assumed by Transocean in such manner that Transocean (i) is a corporation "assuming a stock option in a transaction to which Section 424(a) applies" within the meaning of Section 424 of the Code, or (ii) to the extent that the GlobalSantaFe Option is not or ceases to qualify as an "incentive stock option" within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code, would be such a 

    ##### 

  

    

corporation were Section 424 of the Code applicable to such option. Each
GlobalSantaFe Option assumed by Transocean shall, to the extent provided by
the GlobalSantaFe Stock Plans, the option agreements entered into
pursuant thereto and any other governing instrument with respect to such
GlobalSantaFe Option, and to the extent not already fully vested and
exercisable, be fully vested and exercisable as of the Effective Time and
shall otherwise be subject to the same terms and conditions as under
the applicable GlobalSantaFe Stock Plan, the applicable option agreement and
any other governing instrument with respect to such GlobalSantaFe Option
entered into pursuant thereto, except that immediately following the
Effective Time (A) each GlobalSantaFe Option shall be exercisable for that
whole number of Transocean Ordinary Shares equal to the product (rounded down
to the nearest whole share) of the number of GlobalSantaFe Ordinary Shares
subject to such GlobalSantaFe Option immediately prior to the Effective Time
multiplied by the GlobalSantaFe Adjustment Fraction, and (B) the exercise
price per Transocean Ordinary Share shall be an amount equal to the exercise
price per GlobalSantaFe Ordinary Share subject to such GlobalSantaFe Option
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by the
GlobalSantaFe Adjustment Fraction (the price per share, as so determined,
being rounded up to the nearest whole cent). As of the Effective Time,
each GlobalSantaFe Option identified in Section 4.1(c) of the GlobalSantaFe
Disclosure Letter shall remain exercisable in accordance with the terms of
the governing instruments of such GlobalSantaFe Option and, if such
GlobalSantaFe Option would otherwise expire earlier, it shall be
deemed modified to remain exercisable for the full scheduled term of such
GlobalSantaFe Option in the event the holder of such GlobalSantaFe Option is
involuntarily terminated, for any reason other than Cause (as defined in the
applicable governing instruments or, if not so specified, as agreed by the
parties hereto and as set forth on Section 4.1(c)(iv) of the GlobalSantaFe
Disclosure Letter), within twelve months after the Effective Time. In this
Agreement, the "GlobalSantaFe Adjustment Fraction" means (i) the VWAP of the
GlobalSantaFe Ordinary Shares on the last trading day immediately preceding

Fair Market Value.

 (vi) At the Effective Time, all GlobalSantaFe stock-settled stock appreciation rights (individually, a "GlobalSantaFe SAR" and collectively, the "GlobalSantaFe SARs") identified in Section 4.1(c) of the GlobalSantaFe Disclosure Letter outstanding at the Effective Time under the GlobalSantaFe Stock Plans shall remain outstanding following the Effective Time, subject to the modifications described in this Section 4.1(c)(vi). Prior to the Effective Time, GlobalSantaFe and Transocean shall take all actions (if any) as may be required to permit the assumption of such GlobalSantaFe SARs by Transocean pursuant to this Section 4.1(c)(vi). Each GlobalSantaFe SAR assumed by Transocean shall, to the extent provided by the GlobalSantaFe Stock Plans, the award agreements entered into pursuant thereto and any other governing instrument with respect to such GlobalSantaFe SAR, and to the extent not already fully vested and exercisable, be fully vested and exercisable as of the Effective Time and shall otherwise be subject to the same terms and conditions as under the applicable GlobalSantaFe Stock Plan, the applicable award agreement with respect to such GlobalSantaFe SAR and any 

    ##### 

  

    

other governing instrument entered into pursuant thereto, except that
immediately following the Effective Time (A) each GlobalSantaFe SAR shall be
exercisable for that whole number of Transocean Ordinary Shares equal to the
product (rounded down to the nearest whole share) of the number of
GlobalSantaFe Ordinary Shares subject to such GlobalSantaFe SAR immediately
prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the GlobalSantaFe Adjustment
Fraction, and (B) the exercise price per Transocean Ordinary Share shall be an
amount equal to the exercise price per GlobalSantaFe Ordinary Share subject
to such GlobalSantaFe SAR in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time
divided by the GlobalSantaFe Adjustment Fraction (the price per share, as so
determined, being rounded up to the nearest whole cent). As of the Effective
Time, each GlobalSantaFe SAR identified in Section 4.1(c) of the GlobalSantaFe
Disclosure Letter shall remain exercisable in accordance with the terms of
the governing instruments of such GlobalSantaFe SAR and, if such
GlobalSantaFe SAR would otherwise expire earlier, it shall be deemed modified
to remain exercisable for the full scheduled term of such GlobalSantaFe SAR in
the event the holder of such GlobalSantaFe SAR is involuntarily terminated,
for any reason other than Cause (as defined in the applicable governing
instruments or, if not so specified, as agreed by the parties and set forth
on Section 4.1(c)(vi) of the GlobalSantaFe Disclosure Letter), within
twelve months after the Effective Time. 

   

 (vii) At or prior to the Effective Time, Transocean shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a number of Transocean Ordinary Shares equal to the number of Transocean Ordinary Shares issuable upon the exercise of the GlobalSantaFe Options and GlobalSantaFe SARs assumed by Transocean pursuant to this Section 4.1(c). From and after the date of this Agreement, no action shall be taken by GlobalSantaFe or its Subsidiaries to provide for the acceleration of the exercisability of any GlobalSantaFe Options or GlobalSantaFe SARs in connection with the Merger (except to the extent such acceleration is required under the terms of the governing instruments with respect to such GlobalSantaFe Options or GlobalSantaFe SARs). On the Closing Date, Transocean shall file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") a Registration Statement on Form S-8 (or a post-effective amendment on Form S-8 with respect to the Form S-4 (as defined in Section 7.8) or such other appropriate form) covering all such Transocean Ordinary Shares. 

   

 (viii) Except as otherwise specifically provided by this Section 4.1(c), the terms of the GlobalSantaFe Options and GlobalSantaFe SARs, and the relevant GlobalSantaFe Stock Plans, as in effect at the Effective Time, shall remain in full force and effect with respect to the GlobalSantaFe Options and GlobalSantaFe SARs after giving effect to the Merger and the assumptions by Transocean as set forth above. As soon as practicable following the Effective Time, Transocean shall deliver to the holders of GlobalSantaFe Options and GlobalSantaFe SARs appropriate notices setting forth such holders rights pursuant to the respective GlobalSantaFe Stock Plans and the agreements evidencing the grants of such GlobalSantaFe Options or GlobalSantaFe SARs, and that such GlobalSantaFe Options or GlobalSantaFe SARs and such agreements shall be assumed by Transocean and shall continue in effect on the same terms and conditions (subject to the adjustments required by this Section 4.1(c)). 

   

 (ix) At the Initial Effective Time, all warrants (the "Warrants") to purchase Transocean Ordinary Shares issued pursuant to the Warrant Agreement dated April 22, 1999 between RandB Falcon Corporation and American Stock Transfer and Trust Company, as 

    #####

provided under the terms of the Warrant Agreement and the respective
indentures governing the Transocean Zero Coupon Convertible Debentures and
the Transocean 1.5% Convertible Debentures. The parties agree that Transocean
may, at any time prior to the Effective Time, call all or any portion of the
Transocean Zero Coupon Convertible Debentures and/or the Transocean 1.5%
Convertible Debentures for redemption and issue Transocean Ordinary Shares
upon the conversion of such debentures in accordance with the terms thereof,
if any holder of such debentures elects to convert the debentures.

Transocean shall also provide the Exchange Agent immediately following the Effective Time cash sufficient to pay cash in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with Section 4.2(e). Such cash and certificates for Transocean Ordinary Shares together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto are hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund." 

  

 (b) Promptly after the Effective Time, Transocean shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of one or more certificates ("Certificates") that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Transocean Ordinary Shares or GlobalSantaFe Ordinary Shares: (A) a letter of transmittal (the "Letter of Transmittal") which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Transocean may reasonably specify and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for certificates representing Transocean Ordinary Shares, cash (including cash in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with Section 4.2(e)) and any unpaid dividends and distributions on Transocean Ordinary Shares in accordance with Section 4.2(c). Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent together with such Letter of Transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (x) a certificate representing that number of whole Transocean Ordinary Shares and (y) a check representing the aggregate amount of the Transocean Cash Consideration or the GlobalSantaFe Cash Consideration, as applicable, and cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any,

effect to any required withholding tax, and the Certificate so surrendered
shall forthwith be canceled. No interest will be paid or accrued on the cash
in lieu of fractional shares and unpaid dividends and distributions, if any,
payable to holders of Certificates. In the event of a transfer of ownership
of Transocean Ordinary Shares which is not registered in the transfer records
of Transocean, or a transfer of ownership of GlobalSantaFe Ordinary Shares
that is not registered in the transfer records of GlobalSantaFe, a
certificate representing the proper number of Transocean Ordinary Shares
together with a check representing the amount of the Transocean Cash
Consideration or the GlobalSantaFe Cash Consideration, as applicable, and
cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, may be issued to such a transferee
if the Certificate representing such Transocean Ordinary Shares or
GlobalSantaFe Ordinary Shares, as the case may be, is presented to the
Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect
such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have
been paid. 

  

 (c) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, no dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with respect to Transocean Ordinary Shares with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the Transocean Ordinary Shares represented by such Certificate as a result of the conversion provided in Section 4.1(a) or 4.1(b) until such Certificate is surrendered as provided herein. Subject to the effect of Applicable Laws, following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the holder of the Certificates so surrendered, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore payable and not paid with respect to the number of whole Transocean Ordinary Shares issued pursuant to Section 4.1, less the amount of any withholding taxes, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment date subsequent to surrender payable with respect to such whole Transocean Ordinary Shares, less the amount of any withholding taxes.

"affiliate" of Transocean or GlobalSantaFe for purposes of Rule 145(c) under
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), shall not be
exchanged until Transocean or GlobalSantaFe, as applicable, has received a
written agreement from such Person as provided in Section 7.11, unless the
parties have adjusted Section 7.11 to eliminate the requirements of Section
7.11 with respect to such agreement in accordance with the last sentence of

 (f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any investments thereof and any certificates for Transocean Ordinary Shares) that remains undistributed to the former shareholders of Transocean and GlobalSantaFe one year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Transocean. Any former shareholders of Transocean or GlobalSantaFe who have not theretofore complied with this Article 4 shall thereafter look only to Transocean for delivery of certificates representing their Transocean Ordinary Shares and the amount of the Transocean Cash Consideration or the GlobalSantaFe Cash Consideration, as applicable, cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, and any unpaid dividends and distributions on the Transocean Ordinary Shares deliverable to such former shareholders pursuant to this Agreement. 

  

 (g) None of Transocean, GlobalSantaFe, the Surviving Entity, the Exchange Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any Person for any portion of the Exchange Fund properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. 

  

 (h) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Transocean, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Transocean may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate certificates representing the Transocean Ordinary Shares and the amount of the Transocean Cash Consideration or the GlobalSantaFe Cash Consideration, as applicable, cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, and unpaid dividends and distributions on Transocean Ordinary Shares, as provided in Section 4.2(c), deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

 (i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the parties intend that Transocean be permitted to implement a direct registration system in accordance with NYSE rules and Applicable Laws for the Transocean Ordinary Shares at the Closing, and if Transocean determines to implement such a system at such time, all or any portion of the Transocean Ordinary Shares issued in connection with this Agreement may be in uncertificated book entry form unless a physical certificate is requested in writing by a holder of Certificates. 

  

 Section 4.3 _Adjustment of Share Consideration_. If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time (as permitted by Section 7.l), the outstanding Transocean Ordinary Shares or the outstanding GlobalSantaFe Ordinary Shares shall have been increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a different number of shares or different class, in each case, by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split, split-up, combination or exchange of shares or a stock dividend or dividend payable in other securities shall be declared with a record date within such period, or any similar event shall have occurred, the applicable Transocean Share Consideration or GlobalSantaFe Share Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to provide to the holders of Transocean Ordinary Shares or GlobalSantaFe Ordinary Shares, as the case may be, the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Reclassification shall not result in any adjustment pursuant to this Section 4.3. 

  

 Section 4.4 _Rule 16b-3 Approval_. The Board of Directors of Transocean or a committee thereof, at or prior to the Effective Time, shall adopt resolutions specifically approving, for purposes of Rule 16b-3 ("Rule 16b-3") under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), the receipt, pursuant to Section 4.1, of Transocean Ordinary Shares, and of options to acquire Transocean Ordinary Shares, by executive officers or directors of Transocean and GlobalSantaFe who become executive officers or directors of Transocean subject to Rule 16b-3.

GlobalSantaFe is duly qualified to do business and, to the extent such concept or similar concept exists in the relevant jurisdiction, is in good standing under the laws of any jurisdiction in which the character of the properties owned or leased by it therein or in which the transaction of its business makes such qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified does not and is not reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a GlobalSantaFe Material Adverse Effect (as defined in Section 10.9). GlobalSantaFe has all requisite corporate power and authority to own, operate and lease its properties and to carry on its business as now conducted.

securities convertible into or exchangeable for such shares, securities or
equity interests, (y) there are no outstanding or authorized

 (b) Except for such matters as do not and are not reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a GlobalSantaFe Material Adverse Effect, no event relating specifically to GlobalSantaFe or its Subsidiaries (as opposed to events affecting the drilling service industry in general) has occurred that is reasonably likely, after the date of this Agreement, to result in an upward adjustment in premiums under any insurance policies they maintain. Excluding insurance policies that have expired and been replaced in the ordinary course of business, no excess liability, hull or protection and indemnity insurance policy has been canceled by the insurer within one year prior to the date hereof, and to GlobalSantaFes knowledge, no threat in writing has been made to cancel (excluding cancellation upon expiration or failure to renew) any such insurance policy of GlobalSantaFe or any Subsidiary of GlobalSantaFe during the period of one year prior to the date hereof. Prior to the date hereof, no event has occurred, including the failure by GlobalSantaFe or any Subsidiary of GlobalSantaFe to give any notice or information or by giving any inaccurate or erroneous notice or information, which materially limits or impairs the rights of GlobalSantaFe or any Subsidiary of GlobalSantaFe under any such excess liability, hull or protection and indemnity insurance policies.

 (b) The Board of Directors of GlobalSantaFe has received the opinion of each of Lehman Brothers Inc. and Simmons and Company International to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion, the GlobalSantaFe Merger Consideration to be received by holders of GlobalSantaFe Ordinary Shares is fair from a financial point of view to such holders.

 Section 5.23 _Certain Contracts_. 

  

 (a) Section 5.23 of the GlobalSantaFe Disclosure Letter contains a list of all of the following contracts, commitments or agreements (other than those set forth on an exhibit index in the GlobalSantaFe Reports filed prior to the date of this Agreement) to which GlobalSantaFe or any Subsidiary of GlobalSantaFe is a party or by which any of them or their assets is bound as of the date of this Agreement: (i) any non-competition agreement that purports to limit the manner in which, or the localities in which, all or any portion of their respective businesses is conducted, other than any such limitation that is not material to GlobalSantaFe and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and will not be material to Transocean and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, following the Effective Time, (ii) any drilling unit construction or conversion contract with respect to which the drilling unit has not been delivered and paid for, (iii) any drilling contracts of one year or greater remaining duration, including fixed price customer options, (iv) any contract or agreement for the borrowing of money with a borrowing capacity or outstanding indebtedness of $50 million or more, (v) any employment agreement between GlobalSantaFe or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any of GlobalSantaFes officers and key employees, on the other hand, (vi) any agreement which, upon the consummation of the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, will (either alone or upon the occurrence of any additional acts or events, including the passage of time) result in any payment or benefit (whether of severance pay or otherwise) becoming due, or the acceleration or vesting of any right to any payment or benefits, from Transocean or GlobalSantaFe or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any officer, director, consultant or employee of any of the foregoing, (vii) any agreement which is a material joint venture agreement, joint operating agreement, partnership agreement or other similar contract or agreement involving a sharing of profits and expenses with one or more third Persons, (viii) any agreement the benefits of which will be increased, or the vesting of the benefits of which will be accelerated, by the occurrence of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or the value of any of the benefits of which will be calculated on the basis of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including any stock option plan, stock appreciation rights plan, restricted stock plan or stock purchase plan) or (ix) any "material contract" (as such term is defined in Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K of the SEC). Each contract, arrangement, commitment or understanding of the type described in this Section 5.23(a), whether or not included as an exhibit to any GlobalSantaFe Report or included in Section 5.23 of the GlobalSantaFe Disclosure Letter, is referred to herein as a "GlobalSantaFe Material Contract," and for purposes of Section 7.1 and the bringdown of Section 5.23(b) pursuant to Section 8.3(a), "GlobalSantaFe Material Contract" shall include any such contract, arrangement, commitment or understanding that is entered into after the date of this Agreement. 

  

 (b) Each GlobalSantaFe Material Contract is, to the knowledge of GlobalSantaFe, in full force and effect, and GlobalSantaFe and each of its Subsidiaries have in all material respects performed all obligations required to be performed by them to date under each GlobalSantaFe Material Contract to which it is a party, except where such failure to be binding or in full force and effect or such failure to perform does not and is not reasonably likely to create, individually or in the aggregate, a GlobalSantaFe Material Adverse Effect. Except for 

   ##### 

  

    

such matters as do not and are not reasonably likely to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a GlobalSantaFe Material Adverse Effect, neither
GlobalSantaFe nor any of its Subsidiaries (x) knows of, or has received
written notice of, any breach of or violation or default under (nor, to the
knowledge of GlobalSantaFe, does there exist any condition which with
the passage of time or the giving of notice or both would result in such a
violation or default under) any GlobalSantaFe Material Contract or (y) has
received written notice of the desire of the other party or parties to any
such GlobalSantaFe Material Contract to exercise any rights such party has to
cancel, terminate or repudiate such contract or exercise remedies thereunder.
Except as would not be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a GlobalSantaFe Material Adverse Effect, the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not breach or violate any
GlobalSantaFe Material Contract or permit any other party to a
GlobalSantaFe Material Contract to exercise rights adverse to GlobalSantaFe.
Each GlobalSantaFe Material Contract is enforceable by GlobalSantaFe or a
Subsidiary of GlobalSantaFe in accordance with its terms, subject to
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other
similar laws relating to creditors rights and general principles of equity
(regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding at law or
in equity), except where such unenforceability is not reasonably likely to
create, individually or in the aggregate, a GlobalSantaFe Material Adverse
Effect. 

  

 Section 5.24 _Capital Expenditure Program_. As of the date of this Agreement, the GlobalSantaFe Disclosure Letter accurately sets forth in all material respects, for each of GlobalSantaFes sustaining, life extension and newbuild capital expenditure programs, the capital expenditures for all such programs that were forecasted to be incurred in 2007 and 2008 on a quarterly basis, as previously provided to Transocean. The construction in progress attributable to the newbuilds and included in the consolidated balance sheet of GlobalSantaFe at March 31, 2007 included in the GlobalSantaFe Reports (excluding capitalized interest on such newbuilds) and the projected newbuild capital expenditures to be incurred in 2007 and 2008 equal the projected total construction costs to complete such newbuilds, as at the time of such forecast. 

  

 Section 5.25 _Derivative Transactions_. Section 5.25 of the GlobalSantaFe Disclosure Letter contains a complete and correct list of all Derivative Transactions (including each outstanding commodity or financial hedging position) entered into by GlobalSantaFe or any of its Subsidiaries or for the account of any of its customers as of the date of this Agreement. All such Derivative Transactions were, and any Derivative Transactions entered into after the date of this Agreement will be, entered into in accordance with Applicable Laws, and in accordance with the investment, securities, commodities, risk management and other policies, practices and procedures employed by GlobalSantaFe and its Subsidiaries, and were, and will be, entered into with counterparties believed at the time, and except as set forth in Section 5.25 of the GlobalSantaFe Disclosure Letter, still believes to be financially responsible and able to understand (either alone or in consultation with their advisers) and to bear the risks of such Derivative Transactions. GlobalSantaFe and each of its Subsidiaries have, and will have, duly performed all of their respective obligations under the Derivative Transactions to the extent that such obligations to perform have accrued, and, to the knowledge of GlobalSantaFe, there are and will be no breaches, violations, collateral deficiencies, requests for collateral or demands for payment, or defaults or allegations or assertions of such by any party thereunder. "Derivative Transaction" means any swap transaction, option, warrant, forward purchase or sale transaction, 

   ##### 

  

    

futures transaction, cap transaction, floor transaction or collar transaction
relating to one or more currencies, commodities, bonds, equity securities,
loans, interest rates, catastrophe events, weather-related events, credit-
related events or conditions or any indexes, or any other similar
transaction (including any option with respect to any of these transactions)
or combination of any of these transactions, including collateralized
mortgage obligations or other similar instruments or any debt or equity
instruments evidencing or embedding any such types of transactions, and any
related credit support, collateral or other similar arrangements related to
such transactions. 

  

 Section 5.26 _Disclosure Controls and Procedures_. GlobalSantaFe has established and maintains "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules 13a-14(c) and 15d-14(c) of the Exchange Act) that are reasonably designed to ensure that all material information (both financial and non-financial) required to be disclosed by GlobalSantaFe in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that all such information is accumulated and communicated to GlobalSantaFes management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of GlobalSantaFe required under the Exchange Act with respect to such reports. Except as set forth in GlobalSantaFes Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006, since January 1, 2006, neither GlobalSantaFe nor its independent auditors have identified any "significant deficiencies" or "material weaknesses" in GlobalSantaFes or any of its Subsidiaries internal controls as contemplated under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. 

  

 Section 5.27 _Affiliate Transactions_. There are no material agreements, contracts, transfers of assets or liabilities or other commitments or transactions (other than GlobalSantaFe Benefit Plans described in Section 5.11 of the GlobalSantaFe Disclosure Letter), whether or not entered into in the ordinary course of business, to or by which GlobalSantaFe or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any of their respective Affiliates (other than GlobalSantaFe or any of its direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiaries) on the other hand, are or have been a party or otherwise bound or affected, and that (a) are currently pending, in effect or have been in effect at any time since December 31, 2005 or (b) involve continuing liabilities and obligations that, individually or in the aggregate, have been, are or will be material to GlobalSantaFe and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole. "Affiliate" means, as to any specified Person, any other Person that, directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries or otherwise, controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the specified Person. As used in this definition, "control" means the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management or policies of a Person (whether through ownership of capital stock of that Person, by contract or otherwise). 

  

 Section 5.28 _Disclaimer_. 

  

 (a) Except for the representations and warranties contained in this Article V of this Agreement, Transocean acknowledges that neither GlobalSantaFe nor any other Person on behalf of GlobalSantaFe makes any other express or implied representation or warranty with respect to GlobalSantaFe with respect to any other information provided to Transocean. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither GlobalSantaFe nor any other Person will have or be subject to any liability or indemnification obligation to Transocean or any other Person 

   ##### 

  

    

resulting from the distribution to Transocean, or use by Transocean of, any
such information, including any information, documents, projections,
forecasts or other material made available to Transocean in certain "data
rooms" or management presentations in expectation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 (b) In connection with investigation by Transocean of GlobalSantaFe and its Subsidiaries, Transocean has received or may receive from GlobalSantaFe and/or GlobalSantaFes Subsidiaries certain projections, forward-looking statements and other forecasts and certain business plan information. Transocean acknowledges that there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such estimates, projections and other forecasts and plans, that Transocean is familiar with such uncertainties, that Transocean is taking full responsibility for making its own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, projections and other forecasts and plans so furnished to it (including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections, forecasts or plans), and that, absent fraud or willful misrepresentation, Transocean shall have no claim against anyone with respect thereto. Accordingly, Transocean acknowledges that GlobalSantaFe makes no representation or warranty with respect to such estimates, projections, forecasts or plans (including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections, forecasts or plans). 

  

ARTICLE 6 

   

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES 
 OF TRANSOCEAN AND MERGER SUB  

  

 Except as set forth in (i) other than with respect to Sections 6.1, 6.2 and 6.3, the Transocean Reports filed on or after December 31, 2006 and prior to the date of this Agreement (excluding any risk factor disclosure contained in any such Transocean Report under the heading "Risk Factors" or "Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" or similar heading and excluding information set forth in any exhibit thereto), to the extent a matter is disclosed in such Transocean Reports in such a way as to make its relevance to the applicable representation or warranty reasonably apparent), and (ii) the disclosure letter delivered to GlobalSantaFe by Transocean at or prior to the execution hereof (the "Transocean Disclosure Letter") (each section of which qualifies the correspondingly numbered representation, warranty or covenant to the extent specified therein and such other representations, warranties or covenants to the extent a matter in such section is disclosed in such a way as to make its relevance to such other representation, warranty or covenant reasonably apparent), Transocean and Merger Sub, jointly and severally, represent and warrant to GlobalSantaFe that: 

  

 Section 6.1 _Existence; Good Standing; Corporate Authority_.

 (b) Except for such matters as do not and are not reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Transocean Material Adverse Effect, no judicial or administrative proceedings or governmental investigations are pending or, to the knowledge of Transocean, threatened against Transocean or its Subsidiaries that allege the violation of or seek to impose liability pursuant to any Environmental Law, and there are no past or present facts, conditions or circumstances at, on or arising out of, or otherwise associated with, any current (or, to the knowledge of Transocean or its Subsidiaries, former) businesses, assets or properties of Transocean or any Subsidiary of Transocean, including but not limited to on-site or off-site disposal, release or spill of any Hazardous Materials which violate Environmental Law or are reasonably likely to give rise under any Environmental Law to (i) costs, expenses, liabilities or obligations related to any cleanup, remediation, investigation, disposal or corrective action, (ii) claims arising for personal injury, property damage or damage to natural resources, or (iii) fines, penalties or injunctive relief. 

  

 (c) Neither Transocean nor any of its Subsidiaries has (i) received any notice of noncompliance with, violation of, or liability or potential liability under any Environmental Law or (ii) entered into any consent decree or order or is subject to any order of any court or Governmental Entity or tribunal under any Environmental Law or relating to the cleanup of any Hazardous Materials, except for any such matters as do not and are not reasonably likely to have a Transocean Material Adverse Effect. 

  

 (d) Transocean has delivered or otherwise made available for inspection to GlobalSantaFe true, complete and correct copies and results of any material reports, studies, analyses, tests or monitoring possessed or initiated by Transocean pertaining to Hazardous Materials in, on, beneath or adjacent to any property currently or formerly owned, operated or leased by Transocean or any of its Subsidiaries, or regarding Transoceans or its Subsidiaries compliance with applicable Environmental Laws.

 Section 6.14 _Intellectual Property_. Transocean and its Subsidiaries own or possess adequate licenses or other valid rights to use all intellectual property used or held for use in connection with their respective businesses as currently being conducted, except where the failure to own such intellectual property or possess such licenses and other rights does not and is not reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Transocean Material Adverse Effect. Neither Transocean nor any of its Subsidiaries has received notice of any claims challenging the validity of such intellectual property, licenses or rights that are reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Transocean Material Adverse Effect. To the knowledge of Transocean, the conduct of Transoceans and its Subsidiaries respective businesses as currently conducted does not infringe on any intellectual property rights of others, except as would not be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Transocean Material Adverse Effect. To the knowledge of Transocean, there is no infringement of any intellectual property owned by Transocean or any of its Subsidiaries that is reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Transocean Material Adverse Effect. 

  

 Section 6.15 _Decrees, Etc_. Except for such matters as do not and are not reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Transocean Material Adverse Effect (i) no order, writ, fine, injunction, decree, judgment, award or determination of any Governmental Entity or any arbitral or other dispute resolution body has been issued or entered against Transocean or any Subsidiary of Transocean or any of Transoceans officers or directors (in their capacities as such) that continues to be in effect that affects the ownership or operation of any of their respective assets or the conduct of their respective businesses, and (ii) since January 1, 1997, no criminal order, writ, fine, injunction, decree, judgment or determination of any Governmental Entity has been issued against Transocean or any Subsidiary of Transocean.

 (a) Except for such matters as do not and are not reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Transocean Material Adverse Effect, Transocean and its Subsidiaries maintain insurance coverage with financially responsible insurance companies in such amounts and against such losses as are customary in the international offshore drilling business as of the date hereof. 

  

 (b) Except for such matters as do not and are not reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Transocean Material Adverse Effect, no event relating specifically to Transocean or its Subsidiaries (as opposed to events affecting the drilling service industry in general) has occurred that is reasonably likely, after the date of this Agreement, to result in an upward adjustment in premiums under any insurance policies they maintain. Excluding insurance policies that have expired and been replaced in the ordinary course of business, no excess liability, hull or protection and indemnity insurance policy has been canceled by the insurer within one year prior to the date hereof, and to Transoceans knowledge, no threat in writing has been made to cancel (excluding cancellation upon expiration or failure to renew) any such insurance policy of Transocean or any Subsidiary of Transocean during the period of one year prior to the date hereof. Prior to the date hereof, no event has occurred, including the failure by Transocean or any Subsidiary of Transocean to give any notice or information or by giving any inaccurate or erroneous notice or information, which materially limits or impairs the 

   ##### 

  

    

rights of Transocean or any Subsidiary of Transocean under any such excess
liability, hull or protection and indemnity insurance policies. 

  

 Section 6.17 _No Brokers_. Transocean has not entered into any contract, arrangement or understanding with any Person which may result in the obligation of GlobalSantaFe or Transocean to pay any finders fees, brokerage or other like payments in connection with the negotiations leading to this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, except that Transocean has retained Goldman, Sachs and Co. as its financial advisor, the arrangements with which have been disclosed in writing to GlobalSantaFe prior to the date hereof.

 (b) The Board of Directors of Transocean has received the opinion of Goldman, Sachs and Co. to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion, and after taking into consideration the Reclassification, the GlobalSantaFe Merger Consideration to be received by holders of GlobalSantaFe Ordinary Shares is fair, from a financial point of view, to Transocean.

 Section 6.21 _Ownership of Drilling Units_. 

  

 (a) As of the date hereof, Transocean or a Subsidiary of Transocean has good and marketable title to the drilling units listed in Transoceans most recent annual report on Form 10-K, in each case free and clear of all Liens except for (i) defects or irregularities of title or encumbrances of a nature that do not materially impair the ownership or operation of these assets and which have not had and are not reasonably likely to, individually or in the aggregate, have a Transocean Material Adverse Effect, (ii) Liens that secure obligations not yet due and payable or, if such obligations are due and have not been paid, Liens securing such obligations that are being diligently contested in good faith and by appropriate proceedings (any such contests involving an amount in excess of $25 million being described in the Transocean Disclosure Letter), (iii) Liens for taxes, assessments or other governmental charges or levies not yet due or which are being contested in good faith, (iv) Liens in connection with workmens compensation, unemployment insurance or other social security, old age pension or public liability obligations not yet due or which are being contested in good faith, (v) operators, vendors, suppliers of necessaries to Transoceans drilling units, carriers, warehousemens, repairmens, mechanics, workmens, materialmens, construction or shipyard liens (during repair or upgrade periods) or other like Liens arising by operation of law in the ordinary course of business or statutory landlords liens, each of which is in respect of obligations that have not been outstanding more than 90 days (so long as no action has been taken to file or enforce such Liens within said 90-day period) or which are being contested in good faith and (vi) other Liens disclosed in the Transocean Disclosure Letter (the Liens described in clauses (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), (v) and (vi), collectively, "Transocean Permitted Liens"). No such asset is leased under an operating lease from a lessor that, to Transoceans knowledge, has incurred non-recourse indebtedness to finance the acquisition or construction of such asset. 

  

 (b) Except as would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Transocean Material Adverse Effect, Transocean has caused the drilling units listed in Transoceans most recent annual report on 10-K to be maintained consistent with general practice in the offshore drilling industry, and all such drilling units are in good operating condition and repair consistent with general practice in the offshore drilling industry. 

  

 Section 6.22 _Undisclosed Liabilities_. Neither Transocean nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations of any nature, whether or not fixed, accrued, contingent or otherwise, except liabilities and obligations that (i) are disclosed in the Transocean Reports filed prior to the date of this Agreement, (ii) are referred to in the Transocean Disclosure Letter, (iii) were incurred since March 31, 2007 in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice or (iv) do not and are not reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Transocean Material Adverse Effect. 

  

 Section 6.23 _Certain Contracts_. 

  

 (a) Section 6.23 of the Transocean Disclosure Letter contains a list of all of the following contracts, commitments or agreements (other than those set forth on an exhibit index in the Transocean Reports filed prior to the date of this Agreement) to which Transocean or any Subsidiary of Transocean is a party or by which any of them or their assets is bound as of the date of this Agreement: (i) any non-competition agreement that purports to limit the manner 

   ##### 

  

    

in which, or the localities in which, all or any portion of their respective
businesses is conducted other than any such limitation that is not material
to Transocean and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and will not be
material to Transocean and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, following the
Effective Time, (ii) any drilling unit construction or conversion contract
with respect to which the drilling unit has not been delivered and paid for,
(iii) any drilling contracts of one year or greater remaining duration,
including fixed price customer options, (iv) any contract or agreement for
the borrowing of money with a borrowing capacity or outstanding indebtedness
of $50 million or more, (v) any employment agreement between Transocean or
any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any of Transoceans officers
and key employees, on the other hand, (vi) any agreement which, upon the
consummation of the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by
this Agreement, will (either alone or upon the occurrence of any additional
acts or events, including the passage of time) result in any payment or
benefit (whether of severance pay or otherwise) becoming due, or the
acceleration or vesting of any right to any payment or benefits,
from Transocean or GlobalSantaFe or any of their respective Subsidiaries to
any officer, director, consultant or employee of any of the foregoing, (vii)
any agreement which is a material joint venture agreement, joint operating
agreement, partnership agreement or other similar contract or agreement
involving a sharing of profits and expenses with one or more third Persons,
(viii) any agreement the benefits of which will be increased, or the vesting
of the benefits of which will be accelerated, by the occurrence of any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or the value of any of the
benefits of which will be calculated on the basis of any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including any stock option plan,
stock appreciation rights plan, restricted stock plan or stock purchase plan)
or (ix) any "material contract" (as such term is defined in Item 601(b)(10)
of Regulation S-K of the SEC). Each contract, arrangement, commitment or
understanding of the type described in this Section 6.23(a), whether or not
included as an exhibit to any Transocean Report or included in Section 6.23
of the Transocean Disclosure Letter, is referred to herein as a "Transocean
Material Contract," and for purposes of Section 7.1 and the bringdown of
Section 6.23(b) pursuant to Section 8.2(a), "Transocean Material Contract"
shall include any such contract, arrangement, commitment or understanding
that is entered into after the date of this Agreement. 

  

 (b) Each Transocean Material Contract is, to the knowledge of Transocean, in full force and effect, and Transocean and each of its Subsidiaries have in all material respects performed all obligations required to be performed by them to date under each Transocean Material Contract to which it is a party, except where such failure to be binding or in full force and effect or such failure to perform does not and is not reasonably likely to create, individually or in the aggregate, a Transocean Material Adverse Effect. Except for such matters as do not and are not reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Transocean Material Adverse Effect, neither Transocean nor any of its Subsidiaries (x) knows of, or has received written notice of, any breach of or violation or default under (nor, to the knowledge of Transocean, does there exist any condition which with the passage of time or the giving of notice or both would result in such a violation or default under) any Transocean Material Contract or (y) has received written notice of the desire of the other party or parties to any such Transocean Material Contract to exercise any rights such party has to cancel, terminate or repudiate such contract or exercise remedies thereunder. Except as would not be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Transocean Material Adverse Effect, the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not breach or violate any Transocean Material Contract or permit any other party to a Transocean Material Contract to exercise rights adverse 

   ##### 

  

    

to Transocean. Each Transocean Material Contract is enforceable by Transocean
or a Subsidiary of Transocean in accordance with its terms, subject to
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar
laws relating to creditors rights and general principles of equity
(regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding at law or
in equity), except where such unenforceability is not reasonably likely to
create, individually or in the aggregate, a Transocean Material Adverse
Effect. 

  

 Section 6.24 _Capital Expenditure Program_. As of the date of this Agreement, the Transocean Disclosure Letter accurately sets forth in all material respects, for each of Transoceans sustaining, life extension and newbuild capital expenditure programs, the capital expenditures for all such programs that were forecasted to be incurred in 2007 and 2008 on a quarterly basis, as previously provided to GlobalSantaFe. The construction in progress attributable to the newbuilds and included in the consolidated balance sheet of Transocean at March 31, 2007 included in the Transocean Reports (excluding capitalized interest on such newbuilds) and the projected newbuild capital expenditures to be incurred in 2007 and 2008 equal the projected total construction costs to complete such newbuilds, as at the time of such forecast. 

  

 Section 6.25 _Derivative Transactions_. Section 6.25 of the Transocean Disclosure Letter contains a complete and correct list of all Derivative Transactions (including each outstanding commodity or financial hedging position) entered into by Transocean or any of its Subsidiaries or for the account of any of its customers as of the date of this Agreement. All such Derivative Transactions were, and any Derivative Transactions entered into after the date of this Agreement will be, entered into in accordance with Applicable Laws, and in accordance with the investment, securities, commodities, risk management and other policies, practices and procedures employed by Transocean and its Subsidiaries, and were, and will be, entered into with counterparties believed at the time, and except as set forth in Section 6.25 of the Transocean Disclosure Letter, still believes to be financially responsible and able to understand (either alone or in consultation with their advisers) and to bear the risks of such Derivative Transactions. Transocean and each of its Subsidiaries have, and will have, duly performed all of their respective obligations under the Derivative Transactions to the extent that such obligations to perform have accrued, and, to the knowledge of Transocean, there are and will be no breaches, violations, collateral deficiencies, requests for collateral or demands for payment, or defaults or allegations or assertions of such by any party thereunder. 

  

 Section 6.26 _Disclosure Controls and Procedures_. Transocean has established and maintains "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules 13a-14(c) and 15d-14(c) of the Exchange Act) that are reasonably designed to ensure that all material information (both financial and non-financial) required to be disclosed by Transocean in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that all such information is accumulated and communicated to Transoceans management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of Transocean required under the Exchange Act with respect to such reports. Except as set forth in Transoceans Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006, since January 1, 2006, neither Transocean nor its independent auditors have identified any "significant deficiencies" or "material weaknesses" in Transoceans 

   ##### 

  

    

or any of its Subsidiaries internal controls as contemplated under Section
404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. 

  

 Section 6.27 _Affiliate Transactions_. There are no material agreements, contracts, transfers of assets or liabilities or other commitments or transactions (other than Transocean Benefit Plans described in Section 6.11 of the Transocean Disclosure Letter), whether or not entered into in the ordinary course of business, to or by which Transocean or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any of their respective Affiliates (other than Transocean or any of its direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiaries) on the other hand, are or have been a party or otherwise bound or affected, and that (a) are currently pending, in effect or have been in effect at any time since December 31, 2005 or (b) involve continuing liabilities and obligations that, individually or in the aggregate, have been, are or will be material to Transocean and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole. 

  

 Section 6.28 _Disclaimer_. 

  

 (a) Except for the representations and warranties contained in this Article VI of this Agreement, GlobalSantaFe acknowledges that neither Transocean nor Merger Sub nor any other Person on their behalf makes any other express or implied representation or warranty with respect to Transocean or Merger Sub with respect to any other information provided to GlobalSantaFe. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither Transocean nor Merger Sub nor any other Person will have or be subject to any liability or indemnification obligation to GlobalSantaFe or any other Person resulting from the distribution to GlobalSantaFe, or use by GlobalSantaFe of, any such information, including any information, documents, projections, forecasts or other material made available to GlobalSantaFe in certain "data rooms" or management presentations in expectation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 (b) In connection with investigation by GlobalSantaFe of Transocean and its Subsidiaries, GlobalSantaFe has received or may receive from Transocean and/or Transoceans Subsidiaries certain projections, forward-looking statements and other forecasts and certain business plan information. GlobalSantaFe acknowledges that there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such estimates, projections and other forecasts and plans, that GlobalSantaFe is familiar with such uncertainties, that GlobalSantaFe is taking full responsibility for making its own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, projections and other forecasts and plans so furnished to it (including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections, forecasts or plans), and that, absent fraud or willful misrepresentation, GlobalSantaFe shall have no claim against anyone with respect thereto. Accordingly, GlobalSantaFe acknowledges that Transocean makes no representation or warranty with respect to such estimates, projections, forecasts or plans (including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections, forecasts or plans).

 Section 7.2 _No Solicitation by GlobalSantaFe_. 

  

 (a) GlobalSantaFe agrees that (i) neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, and it shall not authorize or permit any of its officers, directors, employees, agents or representatives (including any investment banker, attorney or accountant retained by it or any of 

   ##### 

  

    

its Subsidiaries) (the "GlobalSantaFe Representatives") to, and on becoming
aware of it will use its reasonable best efforts to stop such GlobalSantaFe
Representative from continuing to, directly or indirectly, solicit, initiate
or knowingly encourage (including by way of furnishing nonpublic information),
or take any action designed to approve, endorse, recommend, or facilitate,
directly or indirectly, any inquiry, proposal or offer (including any
proposal or offer to its shareholders) with respect to a tender or exchange
offer, scheme of arrangement, merger, consolidation, business
combination, purchase or similar transaction or series of transactions (other
than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) involving, individually
or in the aggregate, 15% or more of the assets, net revenues or net income of
GlobalSantaFe and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis or 15% or more of
any class of share capital of GlobalSantaFe, including any scheme of
arrangement, merger, consolidation, business combination, purchase or similar
transaction in which 15% or more of GlobalSantaFes share capital is issued
to a third party or its shareholders (any such inquiry, proposal or offer
being hereinafter referred to as a "GlobalSantaFe Acquisition Proposal"),
or cooperate with or assist, participate or engage in any substantive
discussions or negotiations concerning a GlobalSantaFe Acquisition Proposal,
or amend, terminate, waive or fail to enforce, or grant any consent under,
any confidentiality, standstill or similar agreement, or resolve to propose
or agree to do any of the foregoing; and (ii) it will immediately cease and
cause to be terminated any existing negotiations with any parties conducted
heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing; provided that (1) nothing
contained in this Agreement shall prevent GlobalSantaFe or its Board of
Directors from (A) complying with Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange
Act with regard to a GlobalSantaFe Acquisition Proposal, (B) prior to the
Cutoff Date (as defined herein), providing information (pursuant to a
confidentiality and standstill agreement in reasonably customary form with
terms at least as favorable to GlobalSantaFe as the Confidentiality
and Standstill Agreement dated June 26, 2007, between Transocean and
GlobalSantaFe (the "Confidentiality and Standstill Agreement") and which does
not contain terms that prevent GlobalSantaFe from complying with its
obligations under this Section 7.2) to or engaging in any negotiations or
substantive discussions with any Person who has made an unsolicited bona
fide written GlobalSantaFe Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors
of GlobalSantaFe determines in good faith constitutes a GlobalSantaFe
Superior Proposal (as defined herein), to the extent the Board of Directors
of GlobalSantaFe, after consultation with its outside legal counsel,
determines that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
obligations, or (C) prior to the Cutoff Date, taking any action permitted
pursuant to Section 7.1(s) hereof and (2) notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, the Board of Directors of GlobalSantaFe or
any committee thereof may make a GlobalSantaFe Adverse Recommendation Change
(as defined herein) in accordance with Section 7.4(d). For the purposes of
making a GlobalSantaFe Superior Proposal determination pursuant to this
Section 7.2(a), it is understood that such determination necessarily will (i)
be based on limited information compared to the determination made for
purposes of Section 9.3(c), (ii) require assumptions that shall be made in
the good faith judgment of the GlobalSantaFe Board of Directors and (iii) not
be as complete or informed as, and will be distinct from, a GlobalSantaFe
Superior Proposal determination made for purposes of Section 9.3(c). For
the avoidance of doubt, it is understood that a GlobalSantaFe Superior
Proposal determination made for purposes of Section 7.2(a) shall not
constitute a GlobalSantaFe Superior Proposal determination for any other
purpose under this Agreement (except for Section 9.5(a)(i)(A)(1)(a) of this
Agreement) and shall not by itself constitute a GlobalSantaFe Adverse
Recommendation Change for purposes of this Agreement. Without limiting the
foregoing, it is understood that any violation of this 

   ##### 

  

    

Section 7.2 by any Subsidiary of GlobalSantaFe or the GlobalSantaFe
Representatives shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section 7.2 by
GlobalSantaFe. 

  

 (b) As promptly as practicable after receipt thereof (and in any event within 24 hours), and prior to participating in any substantive discussions or negotiations, GlobalSantaFe will notify Transocean orally and in writing of any request for information from any Person that has made a GlobalSantaFe Acquisition Proposal (or has indicated to GlobalSantaFe that it is seeking such information in contemplation of making a GlobalSantaFe Acquisition Proposal) or the receipt of any GlobalSantaFe Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry with respect to a GlobalSantaFe Acquisition Proposal, including the identity of the Person or group engaging in such substantive discussions or negotiations, requesting such information or making such GlobalSantaFe Acquisition Proposal, and the material terms and conditions of any GlobalSantaFe Acquisition Proposal. GlobalSantaFe will (i) keep Transocean reasonably informed on a timely basis (and in any event within 24 hours) of the status and material details of any GlobalSantaFe Acquisition Proposals, (ii) provide to Transocean as soon as practicable (and in any event within 24 hours) after receipt or delivery thereof with copies of all correspondence and other written material sent or provided to GlobalSantaFe from any third party in connection with any GlobalSantaFe Acquisition Proposal or sent or provided by GlobalSantaFe to any third party in connection with any GlobalSantaFe Acquisition Proposal and (iii) provide or make available to Transocean any material nonpublic information concerning GlobalSantaFe or any of its Subsidiaries that is provided to the Person making such GlobalSantaFe Acquisition Proposal which was not previously provided or made available to Transocean as promptly as practicable (and in any event within 24 hours) after it provides such information to such Person. Any written notice under this Section 7.2 shall be given by facsimile with receipt confirmed or personal delivery. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no failure by GlobalSantaFe to comply with any notice or delivery requirement set forth in this Section 7.2 shall constitute a breach of this Section 7.2 unless such failure is intentional or materially prejudicial to Transocean. 

  

 (c) Without limiting the ability to take action pursuant to Section 7.1(s), nothing in this Section 7.2 shall permit GlobalSantaFe to enter into any agreement with respect to a GlobalSantaFe Acquisition Proposal during the term of this Agreement, it being agreed that during the term of this Agreement (except pursuant to Section 9.3(c)), GlobalSantaFe shall not enter into any agreement with any Person that provides for, constitutes or relates to, a GlobalSantaFe Acquisition Proposal, other than a confidentiality and standstill agreement in reasonably customary form with terms at least as favorable to GlobalSantaFe as the Confidentiality and Standstill Agreement and which does not contain terms that prevent GlobalSantaFe from complying with its obligations under this Section 7.2 and an executed copy of which shall be promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) provided to Transocean.

    ##### 

  

    

by this Agreement or (ii) recommend, adopt or approve, or propose publicly to
recommend, adopt or approve, any GlobalSantaFe Acquisition Proposal; 

   

 (ii) "GlobalSantaFe Superior Proposal" means an unsolicited bona fide written GlobalSantaFe Acquisition Proposal with respect to all the outstanding GlobalSantaFe Ordinary Shares or all or substantially all the assets of GlobalSantaFe that, in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of GlobalSantaFe, taking into account the likelihood of financing, shareholder approval and other requirements for consummation, after consultation with a financial advisor of recognized national reputation, is superior to the Merger; and 

   

 (iii) "Cutoff Date," when used with respect to GlobalSantaFe, means the time the condition set forth in Section 8.1(a)(ii) is satisfied. 

   

 Section 7.3 _No Solicitation by Transocean_.

failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations, or (C)
prior to the Cutoff Date, taking any action permitted pursuant to Section
7.1(s) hereof and (2) notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the Board of Directors of Transocean or any committee thereof may
make a Transocean Adverse Recommendation Change (as defined herein) in
accordance with Section 7.4(c). For the purposes of making a Transocean
Superior Proposal determination pursuant to this Section 7.3(a), it is
understood that such determination necessarily will (i) be based on
limited information compared to the determination made for purposes of
Section 9.4(c), (ii) require assumptions that shall be made in the good faith
judgment of the Transocean Board of Directors and (iii) not be as complete or
informed as, and will be distinct from, a Transocean Superior
Proposal determination made for purposes of Section 9.4(c). For the avoidance
of doubt, it is understood that a Transocean Superior Proposal determination
made for purposes of Section 7.3(a) shall not constitute a Transocean
Superior Proposal determination for any other purpose under this
Agreement (except for Section 9.5(b)(i)(A)(1)(a) of this Agreement) and shall
not by itself constitute a Transocean Adverse Recommendation Change for
purposes of this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood
that any violation of this Section 7.3 by any Subsidiary of Transocean or the
Transocean Representatives shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section 7.3
by Transocean. 

  

 (b) As promptly as practicable after receipt thereof (and in any event within 24 hours), and prior to participating in any substantive discussions or negotiations, Transocean will notify GlobalSantaFe orally and in writing of any request for information from any Person that has made a Transocean Acquisition Proposal (or has indicated to Transocean that it is seeking such information in contemplation of making a Transocean Acquisition Proposal) or the receipt of any Transocean Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry with respect to a Transocean Acquisition Proposal, including the identity of the Person or group engaging in such substantive discussions or negotiations, requesting such information or making such Transocean Acquisition Proposal, and the material terms and conditions of any Transocean Acquisition Proposal.

Any written notice under this Section 7.3 shall be given by facsimile with receipt confirmed or personal delivery. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no failure by Transocean to comply with any notice or delivery requirement set forth in this Section 7.3 shall constitute a breach of this Section 7.3 unless such failure is intentional or materially prejudicial to GlobalSantaFe. 

  

 (c) Without limiting the ability to take action pursuant to Section 7.1(s), nothing in this Section 7.3 shall permit Transocean to enter into any agreement with respect to a Transocean Acquisition Proposal during the term of this Agreement, it being agreed that during the term of this Agreement (except pursuant to Section 9.4(c)), Transocean shall not enter into

Prior to the Effective Time, (i) Transocean shall cause to be prepared and delivered to GlobalSantaFe a list identifying all Persons who Transocean believes, at the date of the meeting of Transoceans shareholders to consider and vote upon the adoption of this Agreement, may be deemed to be "affiliates", as that term is used in paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145 under the Securities Act (the "Rule 145 Affiliates") of Transocean and (ii) GlobalSantaFe shall cause to be prepared and delivered to Transocean a list identifying all Persons who GlobalSantaFe believes, at the date of the meeting of GlobalSantaFes shareholders to consider and vote upon the adoption of this Agreement, may be deemed to be Rule 145 Affiliates of GlobalSantaFe. Each of Transocean (if required by Rule 145) and GlobalSantaFe shall use reasonable best efforts to cause each Person who is identified as a Rule 145 Affiliate in such list to deliver to the other party, not less than 15 business days prior to the Effective Time, a written agreement, in the form of Exhibit 7.11. Transocean shall be entitled to place restrictive legends on any Transocean Ordinary Shares issued to such Rule 145 Affiliates pursuant to the Merger and the Reclassification. The parties shall make appropriate adjustments to the requirements of this Section 7.11 in the event that Rule 145 is rescinded or amended after the date of this Agreement. 

  

 Section 7.12 _Expenses_. Whether or not the Merger and the Reclassification are consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses, except (i) as Section 9.5 otherwise provides, (ii) as Section 7.16 otherwise provides and (iii) that Transocean and GlobalSantaFe shall share equally (A) the fees incident to the filings referred to in Section 7.5(a)(i), (B) the SEC and other filing fees incident to the Form S-4 and the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the costs and expenses associated with printing the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and (C) the fees associated with the New York Stock Exchange listing referred to in Section 7.9 and (iv) as otherwise agreed in writing by the parties. 

  

 Section 7.13 _Indemnification and Insurance_. 

  

 (a) From and after the Effective Time, Transocean and the Surviving Entity shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless to the fullest extent permitted under Applicable Law each Person who is, or has been at any time prior to the Effective Time, an executive officer or director of Transocean or GlobalSantaFe (or any Subsidiary or division thereof) and each Person who served at the request of Transocean or GlobalSantaFe as a director, officer, trustee or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise (individually, an "Indemnified Party" and, collectively, the 

   ##### 

  

    

"Indemnified Parties") against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities,
costs or expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines, penalties
and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation arising out of or pertaining to acts or
omissions, or alleged acts or omissions, by them in their capacities as such,
whether commenced, asserted or claimed before or after the Effective Time. In
the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (an
"Action"), (i) Transocean and the Surviving Entity shall pay, as incurred,
the fees and expenses of counsel selected by the Indemnified Party, which
counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to Transocean and the Surviving
Entity, in advance of the final disposition of any such Action to the fullest
extent permitted by Applicable Law and, if required, upon receipt of
any undertaking required by Applicable Law, and (ii) Transocean and the
Surviving Entity will cooperate in the defense of any such matter; provided,
however, Transocean and the Surviving Entity shall not be liable for any
settlement effected without its written consent (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed), and provided further, that Transocean
and the Surviving Entity shall not be obligated pursuant to this Section 7.13
to pay the fees and disbursements of more than one counsel for all
Indemnified Parties in any single Action, unless, in the good faith judgment
of any of the Indemnified Parties, there is or may be a conflict of interests
between two or more of such Indemnified Parties, in which case there may be
separate counsel for each similarly situated group. 

  

 (b) Each of the parties agrees that the rights to indemnification, including provisions relating to advances of expenses incurred in defense of any action or suit, in its memorandum of association and articles of association with respect to matters occurring through the Effective Time, shall survive the Merger. 

  

 (c) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Transocean and the Surviving Entity shall cause to be maintained officers and directors liability insurance covering the Indemnified Parties who are, or at any time prior to the Effective Time were, covered by Transocean and GlobalSantaFes existing officers and directors liability insurance policies on terms substantially no less advantageous to the Indemnified Parties than such existing insurance,  _provided_ that Transocean and the Surviving Entity shall not be required to pay annual premiums in excess of 250% of the last annual premium paid by Transocean prior to the date hereof (the amount of which premium is set forth in the Transocean Disclosure Letter), but in such case shall purchase as much coverage as reasonably practicable for such amount (but in no event shall Transocean or the Surviving Entity be required to purchase coverage in an amount in excess of the coverage currently maintained by Transocean). 

  

 (d) The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in addition to any other rights such Indemnified Party may have under the memorandum of association, articles of association or comparable organizational documents of Transocean or any of its Subsidiaries or GlobalSantaFe or any of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, under Applicable Law or otherwise. The provisions of this Section 7.13 shall survive the consummation of the Merger and expressly are intended to benefit each of the Indemnified Parties. 

  

 (e) In the event Transocean, the Surviving Entity or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then and in either such case, proper 

   ##### 

  

    

provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Transocean or
the Surviving Entity, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set
forth in this Section 7.13. 

  

 Section 7.14 _Employee Matters_. 

  

 (a) At the Effective Time, Transocean and its Subsidiaries will continue the employment of all of the employees who are employed by Transocean, GlobalSantaFe or any of their Subsidiaries as of the day immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "Affected Employees") initially at the same salaries and wages of such employees immediately prior to the Effective Time. During the period from the Effective Time to and including December 31, 2008, Transocean and its Subsidiaries (i) shall provide each Affected Employee with an annual salary rate or hourly wage rate, as applicable, that is no less favorable to such Affected Employee than the salary rate or wage rate provided to such Affected Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) shall provide Affected Employees who are so employed by GlobalSantaFe or its Subsidiaries as of the day immediately prior to the Effective Time, in the aggregate, with employee compensation and benefits no less favorable in the aggregate than those provided by GlobalSantaFe or its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time. Nothing in this Agreement shall be considered a contract between Transocean and its Subsidiaries and any Affected Employee or consideration for, or inducement with respect to, any such employees continued employment and, without limitation, all such employees are and will continue to be considered to be employees at will pursuant to the applicable employment at will laws or doctrines, subject to any express written agreement to the contrary with such employee. From and after the Effective Time, Transocean shall honor, and shall cause Transocean Offshore Deepwater Drilling Inc. ("TODDI") to honor each severance agreement listed in Section 7.14(a) of the GlobalSantaFe Disclosure Letter and to perform the obligations of GlobalSantaFe thereunder and, prior to the Effective Time, Transocean shall, and shall cause TODDI to, enter into a novation agreement in the form of Exhibit 7.14 with respect thereto, which novation agreement shall become effective immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 (b) With respect to each Affected Employee, Transocean shall credit, or cause its Subsidiaries to credit, the period of employment and service recognized by the applicable employer immediately prior to the Effective Time (for purposes of its corresponding plans, programs, policies or similar employment-related arrangements) to have been employment and service with Transocean for purposes of determining the Affected Employees eligibility to join (subject to satisfaction of all non-service related eligibility criteria) and vesting (but not benefit accrual for any purpose other than vacation pay, severance and termination pay, sick leave, post-retirement health coverage and satisfaction of early retirement criteria) under all employee benefit plans, programs, policies or similar employment related arrangements of Transocean and its Subsidiaries in which the Affected Employee is eligible to participate; provided, however, no such credit shall be provided to the extent that it would result in a duplication of credit or benefits. Transocean shall waive, and to the extent necessary to effect the terms hereof, shall use its best efforts to cause the relevant insurance carriers and other third parties to waive, any restrictions and limitations for medical conditions existing as of the Effective Time of those Affected Employees and their dependents who were covered immediately prior to the Effective Time under a group health plan maintained by Transocean or GlobalSantaFe, but only to the extent that such medical condition would be covered by Transoceans group health plan if it were not a pre-existing condition and only to the extent that such limitations would not have 

   ##### 

  

    

applied under Transocean or GlobalSantaFes group health plan prior to the
Effective Time. Further, Transocean shall offer, or cause its Subsidiaries to
offer, at the Effective Time to each Affected Employee coverage under a group
health plan (as defined in Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code) which credits such
Affected Employee towards the deductibles, coinsurance and maximum out-of-
pocket provisions imposed under such group health plan, for the year
during which the Effective Time (or such later date as the Affected Employees
participate in such group health plan) occurs, with any applicable expenses
already incurred during such year under Transocean or GlobalSantaFes group
health plan. 

  

 (c) Transocean and GlobalSantaFe agree that Transocean shall establish a severance plan, the general terms of which have been agreed upon and are set forth in Section 7.14 of the Transocean Disclosure Letter, effective for no less than the period from the Effective Time until the second anniversary of the Effective Time, for the benefit of Affected Employees on a U.S. dollar payroll who are eligible to participate pursuant to the terms as so set forth. Transocean and GlobalSantaFe agree to cooperate in good faith to take appropriate and substantially consistent actions to retain key employees and provide for a smooth transition, including such action as they deem appropriate to provide for retention payments under substantially consistent terms following the Closing Date. 

  

 (d) Transocean and GlobalSantaFe agree to cooperate in good faith to establish a process to promptly integrate the Transocean Benefit Plans and the GlobalSantaFe Benefit Plans following the Effective Time. 

  

 (e) Transocean shall pay, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to pay, to each Affected Employee who was employed by Transocean or its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time an amount, to the extent then unpaid, equal to the annual incentive bonus to which the Affected Employee would be entitled under the terms of Transoceans 2007 Performance Award and Cash Bonus Plan and applicable award letters. On March 14, 2008, Transocean shall pay, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to pay, to each Affected Employee who was employed by GlobalSantaFe or its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time (or if the Effective Time shall have not yet occurred, GlobalSantaFe shall pay, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to pay, to each person who is an employee of GlobalSantaFe or its Subsidiaries on March 14, 2008) amounts equal to (i) any annual incentive bonus to which GlobalSantaFe determined (prior to the Effective Time) the Affected Employee (or employee, as the case may be) would be entitled under GlobalSantaFes 2007 non-equity annual incentive plan(s) and (ii) any amount to which GlobalSantaFe determined (prior to the Effective Time) that the Affected Employee (or employee, as the case may be) would be entitled with respect to GlobalSantaFes outstanding cash-based performance units. If the employment of an Affected Employee who would otherwise be entitled to a payment under clause (i) and/or clause (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence is involuntarily terminated, or such an Affected Employee voluntarily terminates employment after attaining age 55 and five years of service, prior to March 14, 2008, the payment or payments shall nevertheless be made to such Affected Employee on March 14, 2008. In the event the Effective Time occurs in 2008, immediately prior to the Effective Time, (i) Transocean shall have the right to pay each Affected Employee who was eligible to receive an annual incentive bonus under the Transocean Performance Award and Cash Bonus Plan in effect at such time (the "Transocean 2008 Annual Incentive Plan"), a cash bonus for the period from January 1, 2008 through the Effective Time equal to a pro rata portion of the total maximum 

   ##### 

  

    

bonus payable for 2008 under the Transocean 2008 Annual Incentive Plan, which
shall not exceed the maximum target payout percentage established for 2007,
provided that the CFROMC factor used for this purpose will not exceed 1.0,
and (ii) GlobalSantaFe shall have the right to pay each Affected Employee who
was eligible to receive an annual incentive bonus under GlobalSantaFes 2007
non-equity annual incentive plan(s) a cash bonus for the period from January
1, 2008 through the Effective Time which shall not exceed a pro rata portion
of the total bonus paid or payable to the Affected Employee under the
applicable 2007 plan, in each case determined on the basis of the number of
days elapsed from January 1, 2008 through the Effective Time, with such
payments to be in lieu of the portion of the annual bonus that would
otherwise be paid with respect to such period. The Board of Directors of
Transocean, or any committee designated by the Board of Directors, shall
establish performance goals and cash bonus targets for the period following
the Effective Time in its discretion. 

  

 (f) All Transocean cash-settled stock appreciation rights (individually, a "Transocean Cash SAR" and collectively, the "Transocean Cash SARs") outstanding at the Initial Effective Time under the Transocean Stock Plans shall remain outstanding following the Initial Effective Time, except that immediately following the Initial Effective Time (A) each Transocean Cash SAR shall be exercisable with respect to that whole number of Transocean Ordinary Shares equal to the product (rounded down to the nearest whole share) of the number of Transocean Ordinary Shares to which the Transocean Cash SAR related immediately prior to the Initial Effective Time multiplied by the Transocean Adjustment Fraction, and (B) the exercise price per Transocean Ordinary Share shall be an amount equal to the exercise price per Transocean Ordinary Share in effect immediately prior to the Initial Effective Time divided by the Transocean Adjustment Fraction (the price per share, as so determined, being rounded up to the nearest whole cent) and, as adjusted, each Transocean Cash SAR shall remain exercisable in accordance with its terms. 

  

 (g) Except with respect to offers of employment to prospective new employees in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practices, Transocean and GlobalSantaFe agree that they shall not make, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries not to make, any representations or promises, oral or written, to any of their employees concerning continued employment following the Effective Time, or the terms and conditions of that employment, except in writing with the prior written consent of the other party. 

  

 (h) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement, whether express or implied, shall be treated as an amendment or other modification of any Transocean Benefit Plan, GlobalSantaFe Benefit Plan or compensation or benefit plan, program or arrangement of Transocean or its Subsidiaries, or shall limit the right of Transocean, GlobalSantaFe or any of their Subsidiaries, to amend, terminate or otherwise modify any such plan or arrangement. In the event that (i) a party other than Transocean, GlobalSantaFe or any of their Subsidiaries makes a claim or takes other action to enforce any provision in this Agreement as an amendment to any such plan or arrangement, and (ii) such provision is deemed to be an amendment to such plan or arrangement even though not explicitly designated as such in this Agreement, then such provision shall lapse retroactively and shall have no amendatory effect. 

  

 (i) For the avoidance of doubt, Transocean deems that the Merger, the Reclassification and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement constitute a change of 

   ##### 

  

    

control of Transocean with respect to (i) the Transocean Executive Change of
Control Severance Benefit, (ii) the Long-Term Incentive Plan of Transocean,
(iii) the Deferred Compensation Plan of Transocean, (iv) the Performance
Award and Cash Bonus Plan of Transocean and (v) any awards under the
Transocean Stock Plans, except for the awards specified on Section 7.14 of
the Transocean Disclosure Letter. 

  

 Section 7.15 _Schemes of Arrangement_. 

  

 (a) As soon as practicable after the date hereof and in accordance with this Agreement, Transocean will (i) issue a petition seeking the sanction of the Reclassification and cause application to be made to the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands (the "Court") requesting the Court to summon such meetings of the holders of the ordinary shares of Transocean as the Court may direct, (ii) convene such meetings to obtain the approvals required under Section 86(2) of the Companies Law and, subject to such approvals being obtained, (iii) following the obtaining of the approval required under Section 86(2) of the Companies Law, issue a summons before the Court seeking the sanction of the Reclassification pursuant to Section 86 of the Companies Law and file such other documents as are required to be duly filed with the Court to effect the Reclassification. Transocean shall undertake to the Court that it shall issue and pay, subject to the provisions of this Agreement, at the Initial Effective Time, the Transocean Reclassification Consideration and, at the Effective Time, the GlobalSantaFe Merger Consideration. As soon as practicable following the satisfaction or waiver (subject to Applicable Laws) of the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Closing, Transocean shall cause the order of the Court sanctioning the Reclassification pursuant to Section 86 of the Companies Law and making such facilitating order as is appropriate pursuant to Section 87(2) of the Companies Law (the "Transocean Court Order") to be filed with the Registrar of Companies of the Cayman Islands. The Reclassification shall become effective at the time of filing of the Transocean Court Order (the "Initial Effective Time"). 

  

 (b) As soon as practicable after the date hereof and in accordance with this Agreement, GlobalSantaFe will (i) issue a petition seeking the sanction of the Merger and cause an application to be made to the Court requesting the Court to summon such meetings of the holders of the ordinary shares of GlobalSantaFe as the Court may direct, (ii) convene such meetings to obtain the approval required under Section 86(2) of the Companies Law and, subject to such approval being obtained, (iii) following the obtaining of the approval required under Section 86(2) of the Companies Law, seeking the sanction of the Merger pursuant to Section 86 of the Companies Law on the hearing of the petition and file such other documents as are required to be duly filed with the Court to effect the Merger. As soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement and in accordance with this Agreement, Merger Sub will take, and Transocean will cause Merger Sub to take, any and all actions necessary to effect the Merger. Transocean shall undertake to the Court that, at the Effective Time, it shall issue and pay, subject to the provisions of this Agreement, the GlobalSantaFe Merger Consideration. As soon as practicable following the satisfaction or waiver (subject to Applicable Laws) of the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Closing, GlobalSantaFe and Merger Sub shall cause the orders of the Court sanctioning the Merger pursuant to Section 86 of the Companies Law and making such facilitating orders as are appropriate pursuant to Section 87(2) of the Companies Law (the "GlobalSantaFe Court Orders") to be filed with the Registrar of Companies of the Cayman Islands. The Merger shall become effective at the later of the time of the filing of the 

   ##### 

  

    

GlobalSantaFe Court Orders and one minute following the Initial Effective
Time (the "Effective Time"). 

  

 Section 7.16 _Financing._  

  

 (a) Section 7.16 of the Transocean Disclosure Letter sets forth copies of an executed debt commitment letter, related term sheet and related fee letter (collectively, the "Financing Commitments") pursuant to which, and subject to the terms and conditions thereof, certain lenders have committed to provide Transocean with loans in the amounts described therein, the proceeds of which may be used to consummate the Merger and the Reclassification and the other transactions contemplated hereby (the "Financing"). To the knowledge of each party, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, could reasonably be expected to constitute a material breach by any party hereto or failure to satisfy a condition precedent set forth in the Financing Commitments. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Financing Commitments may be superseded at the option of Transocean with the consent of GlobalSantaFe after the date of this Agreement but prior to the Effective Time by new Financing Commitments, including financing commitments from one or more additional or other parties, in accordance with this Section 7.16 (the "New Financing Commitments"). In such event, the term "Financing Commitment" as used herein shall be deemed to include the New Financing Commitments to the extent then in effect. 

  

 (b) Transocean and GlobalSantaFe shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain the financing on the terms and conditions described in the Financing Commitments or terms more favorable to Transocean. Transocean and, at the direction and guidance of Transocean, GlobalSantaFe shall use their reasonable best efforts (consistent with the terms and obligations of each party under this Agreement) (i) to negotiate definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and conditions contained in the Financing Commitments and (ii) to consummate the Financing at or prior to the Closing. Each party shall give the other prompt notice upon becoming aware of any termination of the Financing Commitments. Transocean shall keep GlobalSantaFe informed on a reasonably current basis and in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing. In the event that either party becomes aware of any event or circumstance that makes procurement of any portion of the Financing unlikely to occur in the manner or from the sources contemplated in the Financing Commitments, that party shall notify the other party, and Transocean and, at the direction and guidance of Transocean, GlobalSantaFe shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to assist in arranging as promptly as practicable any such portion from alternative sources on terms and conditions substantially no less favorable to Transocean. Transocean shall take and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause its Subsidiaries, and shall cause each of its and their respective Representatives, including legal and accounting, to take all actions reasonably necessary in connection with the Financing. At the reasonable request of Transocean, GlobalSantaFe shall provide, and shall use reasonable best efforts, consistent with the terms of and the obligations of each party under this Agreement, to cause its Subsidiaries, and shall cause each of its and their respective Representatives, including legal and accounting, to provide all cooperation reasonably requested by Transocean in connection with the Financing. In performing its respective foregoing obligations under this Section 7.16, each of Transocean, Transoceans Subsidiaries, GlobalSantaFe and GlobalSantaFes Subsidiaries shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) provide reasonably required information relating to that party and its Subsidiaries to the parties 

   ##### 

  

    

providing the Financing, (ii) participate in meetings, drafting sessions and
due diligence sessions in connection with the Financing, (iii) assist in
the preparation of (A) any offering documents for any portion of the
Financing, and (B) materials for rating agency presentations, including
execution and delivery of customary representation letters in connection with
bank information memoranda, (iv) reasonably cooperate with the marketing
efforts for any portion of the Financing, (v) execute and deliver (or use
reasonable best efforts to obtain from its advisors), and cause its
Subsidiaries to execute and deliver (or obtain from its advisors), customary
certificates (including a certificate of the principal financial officer
of Transocean, GlobalSantaFe or any Subsidiary of Transocean or GlobalSantaFe
with respect to solvency matters), accounting comfort letters (including
consents of accountants for use of their reports in any materials relating to
the Financing), legal opinions, surveys, title insurance or other documents
and instruments relating to guarantees, the pledge of collateral and other
matters ancillary to the Financing as may be reasonably necessary in
connection with the Financing, (vi) enter into one or more secured or
unsecured credit or other agreements on terms satisfactory to Transocean and
that are reasonably necessary in connection with the Financing immediately
prior to the Effective Time, (vii) as promptly as practicable, furnish
Transocean and its Financing sources with all financial and other information
regarding Transocean, GlobalSantaFe and their respective Subsidiaries as may
be reasonably necessary of a type generally used in connection with
a syndicated bank financing as well as a registered public offering or an
offering pursuant to Rule 144A of the Securities Act, (viii) take all actions
reasonably necessary in connection with the pay off of existing indebtedness
and the release of related Liens (including the prepayment of Transoceans or
GlobalSantaFes existing indebtedness on or prior to the Closing Date), and
(ix) take all corporate actions, subject to the occurrence of the Closing,
reasonably necessary to permit the consummation of the Financing and the
direct borrowing or incurrence of all of the proceeds of the Financing, by
Transocean immediately following the Effective Time; provided, however, that
no obligation of Transocean or GlobalSantaFe or any of their respective
Subsidiaries under any such agreement, certificate, document or instrument
shall be required to be effective until the Effective Time and, other than
commitment fees with respect to the Financing Commitments, none of
Transocean, GlobalSantaFe or any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be
required to pay any commitment or other similar fee or incur any liability in
connection with the Financing prior to the Effective Time. Transocean shall
pay two-thirds, and GlobalSantaFe shall pay one-third, of all reasonable out-
of-pocket third party costs incurred by Transocean, GlobalSantaFe or any
of their respective Subsidiaries in connection with this Section 7.16 and
shall promptly (and in any event no later than five business days), upon
request by a party, reimburse the other party therefor. 

  

 (c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event that the Merger, the Reclassification and/or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement are not consummated due to circumstances arising out of any failure to obtain the Financing, no party shall have any liability to any other party arising out of such failure; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not relieve Transocean or GlobalSantaFe of its respective obligation to use reasonable best efforts to obtain the Financing to the extent required by Section 7.16(b). Each party acknowledges that (i) notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Transocean is not intended to have any greater risk or liability than GlobalSantaFe with respect to any failure to obtain the Financing or with respect to any other matters contemplated by this Section 7.16 and (ii) no other party would have entered into this Agreement but for the agreement of the parties set forth in this Section 7.16(c). 

    ##### 

 

   

 Section 7.17 _Tax Treatment_. 

   

 (a) Prior to and at the Effective Time, each party hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to qualify as a reorganization described in Section 368(a) of the Code, and shall not take any action reasonably likely to cause the Merger not to so qualify. Without limiting the foregoing, the parties will take all actions required for Merger Sub, at the Effective Time, to be disregarded as an entity separate from its owner, Transocean, for United States federal tax purposes. 

   

 (b) Each of GlobalSantaFe and Transocean shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the opinions referred to in sections 8.2(b) and 8.3(b), respectively, including by executing officers certificates substantially in the form of Exhibits 8.2 and 8.3, respectively.

Adverse Effect, and (iv) GlobalSantaFe shall have received a certificate of

 (C) by GlobalSantaFe pursuant to Section 9.3(c) [fiduciary out]; 

 

then (x) at the time of entry into such definitive agreement or consummation
of such GlobalSantaFe Acquisition Proposal, in the case of clause (A)(1)(b),
or (y) at the time of such termination, in each other case, GlobalSantaFe
shall pay Transocean a fee of $300 million in cash by wire transfer to an
account designated by Transocean. 

   

 (ii) If this Agreement is terminated by GlobalSantaFe pursuant to Section 9.3(c) and in accordance with the terms thereof, no fee additional to the fee specified in Section 9.3(c) shall be payable by GlobalSantaFe to Transocean. 

  

 (b) (i) If this Agreement is terminated: 

   

 (A) by Transocean or GlobalSantaFe pursuant to Section 9.2(c) [failure to obtain Transocean Shareholder Approvals] (1) after the public disclosure of a Transocean Acquisition Proposal (unless such disclosure occurs after the date of the failure to obtain shareholder approval pursuant to Section 9.2(c)), whether or not the Transocean Acquisition Proposal is still pending or has been consummated, and either (a) prior to such failure to obtain shareholder approval, the Board of Directors of Transocean determines that such Transocean 

   ##### 

  

    

Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Transocean Superior Proposal (as determined
in accordance with the provisions of Section 7.3) or (b) within 12 months
after the termination of this Agreement, Transocean or any of its
Subsidiaries enters into a definitive agreement providing for a Transocean
Acquisition Proposal, or a Transocean Acquisition Proposal is consummated, or
(2) if the failure to obtain the Transocean Shareholder Approvals was
proximately caused by a breach by Transocean of Section 7.3 or 7.4; or 

  

 (B) by GlobalSantaFe pursuant to Section 9.3(b) [Transocean Adverse Recommendation Change], if such Transocean Adverse Recommendation Change (or resolution to make such Transocean Adverse Recommendation Change) was in response to a Transocean Acquisition Proposal; or 

  

 (C) by Transocean pursuant to Section 9.4(c) [fiduciary out]; 

 

then (x) at the time of entry into such definitive agreement or consummation
of such Transocean Acquisition Proposal, in the case of clause (A)(1)(b), or
(y) at the time of such termination, in each other case, Transocean shall pay
GlobalSantaFe a fee of $300 million in cash by wire transfer to an account
designated by GlobalSantaFe. 

   

 (ii) If this Agreement is terminated by Transocean pursuant to Section 9.4(c) and in accordance with the terms thereof, no fee additional to the fee specified in Section 9.4(c) shall be payable by Transocean to GlobalSantaFe. 

  

 (c) If this Agreement is terminated by GlobalSantaFe or Transocean pursuant to Section 9.2(b) or by Transocean pursuant to Section 9.4(b) (in either case other than in any circumstances where a fee is payable under Section 9.5(a)), then GlobalSantaFe shall reimburse Transocean for its third party costs and expenses in connection with this transaction, up to a maximum of $30 million. If this Agreement is terminated by GlobalSantaFe or Transocean pursuant to Section 9.2(c) or by GlobalSantaFe pursuant to Section 9.3(b) (in either case other than in any circumstances where a fee is payable under Section 9.5(b)), then Transocean shall reimburse GlobalSantaFe for its third party costs and expenses in connection with this transaction, up to a maximum of $30 million. In circumstances where this Section 9.5(c) requires a reimbursement of costs and expenses, the reimbursing party shall reimburse the other party for such costs and expenses on the later of (i) the day that is three business days after the date of termination of this Agreement and (ii) the day that is three business days after the delivery of documentation of such costs and expenses. In the event the payment of a fee by GlobalSantaFe is required pursuant to Section 9.5(a)(i)(A)(1)(b) or the payment of a fee by Transocean is required pursuant to Section 9.5(b)(i)(A)(1)(b), and such party has already reimbursed Transocean or GlobalSantaFe, respectively, for its third party costs and expenses pursuant to this Section 9.5(c), the amount of such costs and expenses so reimbursed will be offset against the fee payable. 

   

 (d) In the event of termination of this Agreement and the abandonment of the Merger and the Reclassification pursuant to this Article 9, all obligations of the parties hereto shall terminate, except the obligations of the parties pursuant to this Section 9.5, the last sentence of Section 7.6, Section 7.12 and Section 7.16(c) and except for the provisions of Sections 10.2, 10.3, 10.4, 10.6, 10.8, 10.9, 10.11, 10.12, 10.13, 10.14 and 10.15, provided that nothing herein 

    ##### 

  

    

shall relieve any party from any liability for any willful and material breach
by such party of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements set forth in this Agreement and all rights and remedies of such
nonbreaching party under this Agreement in the case of such a willful and
material breach, at law or in equity, shall be preserved. The Confidentiality
and Standstill Agreement shall survive any termination of this Agreement, and
the provisions of the Confidentiality and Standstill Agreement shall apply to
all information and material delivered by any party hereunder. 

   

 (e) In the event that GlobalSantaFe shall fail to pay the termination fee and/or expenses when due, or Transocean shall fail to pay the termination fee and/or expenses when due, as contemplated in either case by Section 9.5, such fee and/or expenses, as the case may be, shall accrue interest for the period commencing on the date such fee and/or expenses, as the case may be, became past due, at a rate equal to the rate of interest publicly announced by Citibank, in the City of New York, from time to time during such period, as such banks prime lending rate. In addition, if either party shall fail to pay the fee and/or expenses, as the case may be, when due, such owing party shall also pay to the owed party all of the owed partys costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) in connection with efforts to collect such fee and/or expenses, as the case may be. Transocean and GlobalSantaFe acknowledge that the fees, expense reimbursement and the other provisions of this Section 9.5 are an integral part of the Merger and the Reclassification and that, without these agreements, Transocean and GlobalSantaFe would not enter into this Agreement. 

   

 Section 9.6 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, each party may by action taken by its Board of Directors or by any committee of the Board of Directors, or any director or officer, properly delegated by the Board of Directors, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made to such party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for the benefit of such party contained herein.

 Section 10.3 _Assignment; Binding Effect; Benefit_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other parties. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, except for (a) the provisions of Section 7.13, (b) the right of GlobalSantaFe shareholders to receive the GlobalSantaFe Merger Consideration after the Closing (a claim with respect to which may not be made unless and until the Closing shall have occurred), (c) the right of Transocean shareholders to receive the Transocean Reclassification Consideration after the Closing (a claim with respect to which may not be made unless and until the Closing shall have occurred), (d) the right of each party, on behalf of its shareholders, to pursue damages in the event of the other partys willful breach of this Agreement, or fraud, which right is hereby acknowledged and agreed, nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, is intended to confer on any Person other than the parties hereto or their respective heirs, successors, executors, administrators and assigns any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement.

The parties agree that in the event that it becomes reasonably apparent to both parties that the consummation of a direct amalgamation of GlobalSantaFe with Transocean by way of a scheme of arrangement is more practicable than the Merger, the parties agree to take such actions as shall be reasonably necessary to restructure the transaction contemplated hereby accordingly, and that thereafter all references herein to the "Merger" shall be deemed to refer to such alternate scheme. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto.
