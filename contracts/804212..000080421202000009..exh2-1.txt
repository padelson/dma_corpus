     SECTION 3.  PURCHASE PRICE; ADJUSTMENT

3.1  Purchase Price.  The purchase price shall consist of the sum
of the Deposit and the Closing Date Payments, as adjusted
pursuant to Section 3.2.  Each Closing Date Payment shall be made
by the applicable Purchaser to the Seller in immediately
available funds by wire transfer to such account as the Seller
shall designate in writing prior to the date payment is due.

(a)  Deposit.  (i) NWS agrees to pay to the Seller upon execution
of this Agreement $300,000, and (ii) Airgas agrees to pay to the
Seller upon execution of this Agreement $5,000,000 less the
amount paid by NWS upon execution of this Agreement (the
aggregate amount of $5,000,000 hereinafter referred to as, the
"Deposit").  The Deposit shall be made by the Purchasers to the
Seller by wire transfer to such account as designated by the
Seller in writing, which account shall be a segregated, interest
bearing account.  All interest or other income earned on the
Deposit (the "Income") shall be paid to or applied for the
benefit of the Seller if the Closing occurs or if the Seller is
otherwise entitled to the Deposit pursuant to Section 15.2(b).
In all other events, the Income shall be paid to or applied to
the benefit of the Purchasers on a pro rata basis (based upon
each Purchaser's contribution to the Deposit).  Any party
receiving any part of the Income or having the same applied for
its benefit shall be responsible for paying any Taxes thereon.
The Deposit and any Income will be retained by the Seller or
returned to the Purchasers in accordance with Section 15.2(b).

(b)  Closing Date Payment. (i) NWS agrees to pay to the Seller on
the Closing Date $17,600,000 (the "NWS Closing Date Payment") and
(ii) Airgas agrees to pay to the Seller on the Closing Date
$265,000,000 less the amount paid by NWS at the Closing (each, a
"Closing Date Payment" and, together with the Deposit, the "Base
Purchase Price"), as payment for the Purchased Assets, pending
determination of the adjustment referred to in Section 3.2
hereof, and to assume their respective Assumed Liabilities
pursuant to Sections 2.6 and 2.7 hereof.  For avoidance of doubt,
in the event that NWS does not for any reason pay the NWS Closing
Date Payment at the Closing, Airgas shall pay to the Seller at
the Closing the full amount of the Closing Date Payments without
deduction except pursuant to the next sentence of this paragraph.
The amount of the Closing Date Payment to be paid by Airgas shall
be reduced by $16,200,000, which represents the amount of the
Unsegregable Receivables as of September 30, 2001.

3.2  Current Assets Adjustment Statement.  Within 45 days after
the Closing Date, the Seller will prepare and deliver to Airgas a
statement of the Current Assets as of the Closing Date (the

                             (18)
<PAGE>

"Adjustment Statement") setting forth calculations showing the
determination of the amount of the post-closing adjustment
payable by Airgas to the Seller, or by the Seller to Airgas, as
the case may be.  The Adjustment Statement shall be prepared in
accordance with the accounting methodologies used to prepare the
Financial Documents.  The amount of such post-closing adjustment
shall be determined and paid as follows:  either (a) Airgas shall
pay to the Seller the amount by which the Current Assets on the
Adjustment Statement exceed $16,600,000, or (b) the Seller shall
pay to Airgas the amount by which the Current Assets on the
Adjustment Statement is less than $16,600,000.  The Purchasers
shall determine the allocation, if any, between them of any such
payments or amounts received, and the Seller shall have no
obligation or liability with respect thereto and shall be
indemnified by Airgas under Section 14.5(e) with respect thereto.

3.3  Cooperation.  The Purchasers will fully cooperate with the
Seller with respect to the Seller's preparation of the statements
referred to in Section 3.2, and will give the Seller, its
employees, representatives and agents access to such books and
records of the Packaged Gas Business and the assistance of such
Packaged Gas Business personnel as the Seller reasonably requests
in connection therewith.

3.4  Objections.  If the Purchasers have objections to the
Adjustment Statement, then Airgas shall submit such objections in
writing, stating in reasonable detail the reason and basis for
the Purchasers' objections, within 20 Business Days after
delivery to the Purchasers of such statement ("Objection
Period").  If Airgas and the Seller are unable to resolve such
objection within 20 Business Days after delivery to the Seller of
such written objection, the matter or matters in dispute will be
submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm for resolution
within 20 Business Days of their engagement.  The decision of the
Independent Accounting Firm will be binding on both the
Purchasers and the Seller.  The cost of the Independent
Accounting Firm shall be paid as follows: (i) the cost of the
Independent Accounting Firm shall be fully payable by Airgas if
the adjustment determined by the Independent Accounting Firm
shall not be in an amount at least $100,000 more favorable to the
Purchasers than the proposed adjustment set forth in the
Adjustment Statement and (ii) the cost of the Independent
Accounting Firm shall be fully payable by the Seller if the
adjustment determined by the Independent Accounting Firm is an
amount at least $100,000 more favorable to the Purchasers than
the proposed adjustment set forth in the Adjustment Statement.

3.5  Payment.  Within three (3) Business Days after the
expiration of the Objection Period (or the date upon which any
disputes are resolved as provided above), Airgas will pay to the
Seller or the Seller will pay to Airgas the amount of the
adjustment shown in the Adjustment Statement, as modified by any
actions pursuant to Section 3.4, in immediately available funds
by wire transfer to an account designated in writing by the
Seller or Airgas, as the case may be, together with interest on
such amount at the Prime Rate from and including the Closing
Date.  The Purchasers shall determine the allocation between them
of any such payments or amounts received pursuant to this Section
3.5, and the Seller shall have no obligation or liability with
respect thereto and shall be indemnified by Airgas under Section
14.5(e) with respect thereto.

3.6  Allocation.

(a)  Within one hundred twenty (120) days of the Closing Date,
the Purchasers shall jointly prepare and deliver to Seller a
schedule (the "Allocation Schedule") allocating the Purchase

                             (19)
<PAGE>

Price and Assumed Liabilities among the Purchased Assets and the
non-competition covenant provided for in Section 7.4, in such
amounts as are consistent with the valuation and techniques and
practices of the Purchasers and are reasonably determined by the
Purchasers to be consistent with Section 1060 of the Code (the
"Allocation").

(b)  The Seller shall have a period of twenty (20) Business Days
after the delivery of the Allocation Schedule to present in
writing to the Purchasers notice of any objections the Seller may
have to the allocations set forth therein (an "Allocation
Objection Notice").  Unless the Seller timely objects, such
Allocation Schedule shall be final, absent manifest error.  In
the event that the Purchasers do not deliver to the Seller the
Allocation Schedule within the time period specified in Section
3.6(a), the Seller shall be free to allocate the Purchase Price
and the Assumed Liabilities in such manner as the Seller shall
determine in its sole discretion.

(c)  If the Seller presents an Allocation Objection Notice to the
Purchasers within the applicable twenty-Business Day period, the
Purchasers and the Seller agree to use commercially reasonable
efforts to agree on the Allocation Schedule as soon as
practicable after the Closing in a manner consistent with the
requirements and methods that apply to Section 1060 of the Code;
provided, however, that if the Purchasers and the Seller shall
not have agreed on the Allocation Schedule by the twentieth
Business Day following the delivery of such Allocation Objection
Notice, the Allocation Schedule shall be made in accordance with
the appraisals of an Independent Accounting Firm, which shall be
instructed by the parties to determine an allocation in a manner
consistent with the requirements and methods that apply to
Section 1060 of the Code.  The fees and expenses of such
Independent Accounting Firm shall be paid one-half by the
Purchasers and one-half by the Seller unless the Independent
Accounting Firm shall determine that the allocation suggested by
the Purchasers or the Seller, as the case may be, shall be used
in its entirety, in which case, the other party shall pay all of
such fees and expenses.

(d)  The Purchasers and the Seller each agree to (i) file any
additional information return required to be filed pursuant to
Section 1060 of the Code, (ii) be bound by the Allocation
Schedule, (iii) act in a manner consistent with the Allocation
Schedule in the preparation of financial statements and filing of
all state and United States federal income tax returns
(including, without limitation, providing the other parties for
their review a draft of Form 8594 and thereafter filing Form 8594
with their United States federal income tax return for the
taxable year that includes the Closing Date) and in the course of
any Tax audit, Tax review or Tax litigation relating thereto, and
(iv) take no position and cause their Affiliates to take no
position inconsistent with the Allocation Schedule for any Tax
purposes.

(e)  The Seller's employer identification number is 23-1274455.
Airgas' employer identification number is 56-0732648.  NWS'

                             (28)
<PAGE>

5.13 Conduct of the Packaged Gas Business.  Except as set forth
on Schedule 5.13, since September 30, 2001, the Seller has
conducted the Packaged Gas Business in the Ordinary Course of
Business consistent with the Seller's past practice in the
previous 12 months.

5.14 Permits.  Schedule 5.14 includes a list of all licenses,
permits, authorizations, orders, registrations and approvals of
any Governmental Body currently held or being applied for by the
Seller which are material to or necessary to carry on the
Packaged Gas Business as presently conducted or material to the
Seller's current use of the Purchased Assets (collectively, the
"Permits").  Except as set forth in Schedule 5.14, and except

notice that any material Acquired Permits are not in full force
and effect, and no claim of which the Seller has received written
service is pending or, to the Knowledge of the Seller, threatened
to revoke or limit any such Acquired Permit.

5.15 Financial Documents.

(a)  The Financial Documents have been prepared from financial
statements or records used by the management of the Seller in the
operation of the Packaged Gas Business. The Financial Documents
fairly present in all material respects the financial condition
of the Packaged Gas Business as of the dates thereof and for the
periods referred to therein.  The Pro-forma Packaged Gas Business
Statement of Sales and Direct Profit included as Schedule 5.15(a)
hereto has been prepared specifically for the Purchasers from
financial systems used by the management of the Seller in the
operation of the Packaged Gas Business and fairly presents in all
material respects the direct profit of the Packaged Gas Business
and does not differ from the Financial Documents except in the
following respects: (1) it does not include the cost of certain
services provided from Seller's corporate units as described in
the unaudited Statement of Direct Profit (footnote 4) included in
the Financial Documents, (2) it includes the cost for gases using
the prices in the proposed Enabling Agreements between the Seller
and Purchaser(s) rather than arms-length pricing for Seller's
average customer and (3) it includes certain other reductions in
costs for on-going operations which cost reductions were agreed
between Seller and Purchasers and are reflected on Schedule
5.15(b)(iii).  Schedule 5.15(b) reconciles the difference in the
Direct Profit included in the Financial Documents and that set
forth on Schedule 5.15(a).

(b)  The "full time equivalents" reflected in the first column on
Schedule 5.15(c), are sufficient to support those activities
specified on such Schedule as such activities have been conducted
by the Seller in the Packaged Gas Business for the 12 month
period ended September 30, 2001.  Other activities involving
general, administrative and other corporate and group services
substantially based in the Allentown, PA area, would be necessary
to operate the Packaged Gas Business on a standalone basis.  The
average salaries and fringe benefit percentage reflected in the
second and third columns, respectively, on Schedule 5.15(c) are
correct in all material respects for the 12 month period ended
September 30, 2001.  The amounts reflected in the fourth and
fifth columns on Schedule 5.15(c) represent estimates agreed upon
by the Seller and the Purchasers, and the Seller is not making
any representation or warranty with respect thereto.  The sixth
column on Schedule 5.15(c) represents the sum of the amounts in
the first through fifth columns on Schedule 5.15(c).

                             (29)
<PAGE>

(c)  The Seller's costs of operating the Computers Unlimited
administrative billing system with respect to the Packaged Gas
Business as represented on Schedule 5.15(d) were approximately
$4.474 million in fiscal year 2001, which costs included
reasonable allocations for cost elements such as facility
expenses made by the Seller to such operation.  The Seller is not
making any representation or warranty with respect to any
information contained on Schedule 5.15(d) other than the $4.474
million aggregate number.

5.16 Accounts Receivable.  The Accounts Receivable arose in the
Ordinary Course of Business of the Packaged Gas Business.  There
are no setoffs, counterclaims or disputes asserted in writing or
conditions precedent to payment therefor with respect to any such
Accounts Receivable, and no discount or allowance from any such
Accounts Receivable has been made or agreed to, other than such
setoffs, counterclaims, disputes, discounts or allowances that
are usual and customary in the packaged gas industry.

5.17 Purchased Inventory.  Set forth on Schedule 5.17 is a list
of the material Purchased Inventory as of September 30, 2001.
The Purchased Inventory is reflected in the Financial Documents
in all material respects and have been valued in accordance with
the notes contained therein.  The Purchased Inventory has been
purchased or maintained by the Seller in the Ordinary Course of
Business.  After taking into account the reserves on the
Financial Documents, the Purchased Inventory is usable or salable
in the Ordinary Course of Business and meets accepted industry
standards for quality.

5.18 Taxes.  There are no Liens (other than Permitted Liens) for
Taxes (other than Taxes not yet due and payable) upon the
Purchased Assets.

5.19 Customers.  Schedule 5.19(a) lists, by dollar volume paid
for the twelve (12) months ended on September 30, 2001, each of
the customers of the Packaged Gas Business that accounted for
more than 2% of the Seller's revenues from the Packaged Gas
Business during such period.  Except as set forth on Schedule
5.19(b), no customer listed on Schedule 5.19(a) has, within the
last twelve (12) months, to the Knowledge of the Seller,
threatened in writing to cancel or otherwise terminate, the
relationship of such customer with the Seller or materially to
decrease or limit its purchase of the services or products of the
Packaged Gas Business, which cancellation, termination, decrease
or limitation would have a Business Material Adverse Effect.

5.20 Real Property.

(a)  Ownership of Premises.  The Seller is the owner of good,
marketable and insurable fee title to the Owned Real Property,
free and clear of all Liens except for Permitted Liens.

(b)  Leased Properties.  The Seller has heretofore made available
to Airgas, and to the extent related to the Carolina Assets, to
NWS, true, correct and complete copies of all Real Property
Leases (including all modifications, amendments and supplements
thereto).  Except as set forth on Schedule 5.20(b), each Real
Property Lease is valid, binding and in full force and effect,

                             (30)
<PAGE>

and all rent and other sums and charges due and payable by the
Seller as tenant thereunder are current; no written notice of any
default or termination under any Real Property Lease is
outstanding; no termination event or condition or uncured default
on the part of the Seller or, to the Knowledge of the Seller, the
landlord, exists under any Real Property Lease; and to the
Knowledge of the Seller, no event has occurred and no condition
exists which, with the giving of notice or the lapse of time or
both, would constitute such a material default or termination
event or condition.  The Seller has no ownership, financial or
other interest in the landlord under any Real Property Lease.

(c)  No Options.  Except as set forth in Schedule 5.20(c) and as
set forth in the Real Property Leases, the Seller does not own or
hold, and is not obligated under or a party to, any option, right
of first refusal or other contractual right to purchase, acquire,
sell or dispose of any of the Owned Real Property or the Leased
Real Property or any portion thereof or interest therein.

(d)  Condemnation.  There are no pending, and the Seller has not
received written notice and has no Knowledge of any threatened or
contemplated, condemnation proceeding affecting any part of the
Owned Real Property or the Leased Real Property or of any sale or
other disposition of any part of the Owned Real Property or the
Leased Real Property in lieu of condemnation.

(e)  Casualty.  No portion of the Owned Real Property or the
Leased Real Property has suffered any material damage by fire or
other casualty which has not been repaired and substantially
restored to its original condition.

5.21 Disclaimer of Warranties.  EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN
THIS Section 5 (INCLUDING THE SCHEDULES ATTACHED HERETO), THE
SELLER MAKES NO WARRANTY OR REPRESENTATION, WHETHER ORAL OR
WRITTEN, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, CONCERNING THE PURCHASED ASSETS OR
THE PACKAGED GAS BUSINESS, OR THE MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS
THEREOF FOR ANY PURPOSE.  IT IS UNDERSTOOD AND AGREED THAT ANY
COST ESTIMATES, PROJECTIONS OR OTHER PREDICTIONS CONTAINED OR
REFERRED TO IN ANY OTHER MATERIAL THAT HAS BEEN PROVIDED TO A
PURCHASER OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES, AGENTS OR REPRESENTATIVES
(INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY DUE DILIGENCE PRESENTATIONS OR
DOCUMENTS) ARE NOT AND SHALL NOT BE DEEMED TO BE REPRESENTATIONS
OR WARRANTIES OF THE SELLER OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES, AGENTS,
EMPLOYEES OR REPRESENTATIVES.

     SECTION 6.  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES REGARDING PURCHASERS

     Each Purchaser represents and warrants (as to itself only,
subject in any event to Sections 7.18(a) and 14.5) to the Seller
as of the date hereof as follows; provided, however, that NWS
makes no representation or warranty as to Section 6.5(a) below:

6.1  Corporate Organization.  The Purchaser is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws
of the state of its incorporation.  It has all requisite
corporate power to own, lease and operate its properties and to
carry on its business as now being conducted.

                             (31)
<PAGE>

6.2  Corporate Authority.  The Purchaser has all requisite
corporate power and authority (a) to enter into, execute and
deliver the Transaction Documents to which it is or shall be a
party, (b) to consummate the transactions contemplated by the
Transaction Documents to which it is or shall be a party, and (c)
to perform fully its obligations under the Transaction Documents
to which it is or shall be a party.  All corporate acts and other
proceedings required to be taken by or on the part of the
Purchaser to authorize it to execute, deliver and perform the
Transaction Documents to which it is or shall be a party and the
transactions contemplated thereby have been duly and properly
taken, and no other corporate action by the Purchaser or its
stockholders is required for the due execution, delivery or
performance of this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents
to which it is or shall be a party.  This Agreement has been duly
authorized, executed and delivered by the Purchaser and
constitutes, and each of the other Transaction Documents to which
it is or shall be a party has been duly authorized by the
Purchaser and when duly executed and delivered by the Purchaser
will constitute, valid and binding obligations of the Purchaser,
enforceable against the Purchaser in accordance with their
respective terms, assuming due execution and delivery hereof and
thereof by the Seller, and except as limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other
similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally or by
general principles of equity (regardless of whether such
enforcement is considered in a proceeding at law or in equity).

6.3  No Violation. Except for the consents and approvals to be
obtained under Sections 6.4 and 7.8, the execution and delivery
by the Purchaser of the Transaction Documents and its
consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby will not
(a) violate the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the
Purchaser, (b) violate any Law or binding arbitration ruling or
order by which the Purchaser is bound or subject, (c) result in
the creation of a Lien on the assets of the Purchaser or (d)
violate, conflict with or result in any breach of any provision
of, or constitute, whether after the giving of notice or lapse of
time or both, a default under any Contract to which the Purchaser
is a party, excluding, in the case of the foregoing clauses (b)
and (d), violations, breaches and defaults which, either
individually or in the aggregate, would not have a material
adverse effect on the Purchaser's ability to consummate the
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents to which
it is or shall be a party.

6.4  Approvals.  No Consent of any Governmental Body is required
in connection with the execution and delivery by the Purchaser of
the Transaction Documents or its consummation of the transactions
contemplated thereby or its performance of any of the provisions
thereof on or after the Closing Date, except (a) filing by the
Purchaser with the Antitrust Division of the Department of
Justice and the Federal Trade Commission pursuant to the Hart-
Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, and the
expiration or termination of all waiting periods associated
therewith and (b) those set forth in Schedule 6.4.

6.5  Financing.

(a)  Airgas has delivered to the Seller a copy of the First
Amendment (the "Amendment") to the Tenth Amended and Restated
Credit Agreement dated as of July 30, 2001 among Airgas and
certain other parties (such Tenth Amended and Restated Credit
Agreement, as amended by the Amendment, shall be herein referred

                             (32)
<PAGE>

to as the "Credit Agreement"), a copy of which is attached hereto
as Exhibit I, which, after giving pro forma effect to the
purchase of the Purchased Assets based on the financial
information regarding the Purchased Assets contained in the
Financial Documents, will enable Airgas to obtain the financing
necessary to fulfill its obligations under Article 3 hereof.  The
Credit Agreement is in full force and effect, and is enforceable
in accordance with its terms, and the Amendment is effective
pursuant to Part III of the Amendment.  Airgas is not in default
under the Credit Agreement, nor does any condition exist that,
with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a material
default by Airgas thereunder.  To the Knowledge of Airgas, no
other party to the Credit Agreement is in material default
thereunder, nor does any condition exist that, with notice or
lapse of time or both, would constitute a material default
thereunder.  Each of the Credit Parties' (as defined in the
Credit Agreement) representations and warranties in the Credit
Agreement is true and correct in all material respects, and
Airgas is not aware of any event, occurrence or circumstance that
would make any such representation and warranty not true and
correct in all material respects as of the Closing Date.  To the
Knowledge of Airgas, assuming the Audited Financial Documents are
consistent with the Financial Documents, there is no reason why
the financing contemplated by the Amendment will not be
consummated on the Closing Date.  As of the date hereof, the
United States dollar equivalent of the maximum amount of funds
available under the Credit Agreement is $400,000,000, the amount
drawn by the Credit Parties under the Credit Agreement is
$176,565,147, and the amount of additional commitments received
by the Credit Parties under the Amendment is $100,000,000.  Upon
the satisfaction of the "Willow Acquisition Conditions" in the
Amendment, the transactions contemplated under this Agreement
will constitute a Permitted Acquisition, as defined in the Credit
Agreement.  Upon giving pro forma effect to the purchase of the
Purchased Assets and assuming the Audited Financial Documents are
consistent with the Financial Documents, the Credit Parties would
be in compliance with the financial covenants in the Credit
Agreement.

(b)  None of the individuals listed on Schedule 1.62(b) possess
any information that would reasonably be expected to result in
NWS being unable to obtain the financing necessary for NWS to
consummate the acquisition of the Carolina Assets.

6.6  Purchaser's Investigation.  In connection with the execution
of this Agreement, the Purchaser has relied solely upon its due
diligence and those representations and warranties made by the
Seller in Section 5 hereof.  The Purchaser acknowledges that
neither the Seller nor any of its officers, directors, Affiliates
or agents assumes any responsibility for the accuracy or adequacy
of any information heretofore or hereafter furnished to the
Purchaser by or on behalf of the Seller with respect to the
Packaged Gas Business or the Purchased Assets, except as
otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement (including the
Schedules to this Agreement).  Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, the Purchaser understands that any cost estimates
(other than such cost estimates as may be contained in the
Financial Documents or in Schedule 5.15(a), 5.15(b) or 5.15(c)
(with the exception of the cost estimates referred to in the
second to last sentence of Section 5.15(b)) as they relate to the
Seller's representation and warranty in Section 5.15),
projections or other predictions provided to the Purchaser by or
on behalf of the Seller are not and shall not be deemed to be
representations or warranties of the Seller.  The Purchaser
acknowledges that (a) there are uncertainties inherent in
attempting to make such estimates, projections and other
predictions, (b) the Purchaser is familiar with such
uncertainties, (c) the Purchaser is taking full responsibility
for making its own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all
estimates, projections and other predictions so furnished to it,
and (d) the Purchaser shall have no claim against the Seller or
any of its officers, directors, Affiliates or agents with respect
thereto.
                             (33)

     SECTION 7.  FURTHER COVENANTS

     The parties hereto hereby further covenant and agree as
follows:

7.1  Access to Information and Documents; Post-Closing Cooperation.

(a)  From and after the date hereof until the Closing, the Seller
shall give the officers, employees, representatives, financing
sources, accountants and other designees of each of the
Purchasers reasonable access, during reasonable business hours
following reasonable prior notice, to the offices, production
facilities, plants, properties, written Acquired Contracts and
other assets, books and records, officers, employees,
representatives and accountants of the Packaged Gas Business and
shall cause its officers, employees, representatives and
accountants to furnish to each of the Purchasers and its
aforesaid representatives such financial, technical, operating
and other information pertaining to the Packaged Gas Business and
the Purchased Assets as the Purchasers shall from time to time
reasonably request and to discuss such information with such
representatives; provided, however, that each such officer,
employee, representative, financing source, accountant or other
designee shall be subject to a duty to maintain the
confidentiality of any information so received in accordance with
the terms of the Mutual Confidential Disclosure Agreement between
Airgas and the Seller, dated as of February 15, 2001, as amended,
or the letter agreement dated August 17, 2001 between NWS and the
Seller, as applicable.  No investigation by the Purchaser shall
diminish or obviate any of the representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements of the Seller contained in this
Agreement.  Except as otherwise provided in Section 2.5(c),
nothing in this Section 7.1 shall permit the Purchasers or any of
their respective officers, employees, representatives, financing
sources, accountants or other designees to have access to any of
the Seller's Tax Returns.

(b)  From and after the Closing Date, the Seller shall provide
the officers, employees, representatives and accountants of each
Purchaser and each Purchaser shall provide the officers,
employees, representatives and accountants of the Seller,
reasonable access, during reasonable business hours following
reasonable prior notice, to any books and records relating to the
Packaged Gas Business and the Purchased Assets (including the
provision by the Seller to each Purchaser of access to any books
and records relating to the Packaged Gas Business or the
Purchased Assets that are not included in the books and records
transferred to such Purchaser pursuant to Section 2.1(i) or
Section 2.3(f), as the case may be), and to discuss the
information contained in such books and records, as the other
party may reasonably request. The Purchasers shall cause to be
preserved and kept all records relating to the Purchased Assets
that are included in the assets transferred to such Purchaser for
such period from and after the Closing as may be required by or
needed for compliance with applicable Law or, in the case of Tax
records, the Seller's Tax records retention policy.  The Seller
shall cause to be preserved and kept all records retained by it
relating to the Purchased Assets for such period from and after
the Closing as may be required by or needed for compliance with
applicable Law.  The Seller's Tax records retention policy
requires all financial and Tax records be maintained for a period
of seven (7) years following expiration of the applicable federal
tax statute of limitations (including any extensions) for such
year.  If a Purchaser wishes to destroy such records after the
time prescribed in the preceding sentence, it shall first give
sixty days' prior written notice to the Seller, and the Seller
shall have the right at its option, upon written notice given to
such Purchaser within said sixty day period, to take possession
of such records, to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

                             (34)
<PAGE>

From and after the Closing Date, each Purchaser shall provide to the
Seller and its officers, employees, representatives, accountants
and other designees reasonable access, during reasonable business
hours following reasonable prior notice, to the offices,
production facilities, plants, properties and other assets, books
and records, officers, employees, representatives and accounts of
such Purchaser, and shall cause its officers, employees,
representatives and accountants to furnish to and to discuss with
the Seller and its aforesaid representatives such information as
the Seller may reasonably request in connection with the
preparation of reports required by applicable Law and of
financial statements or filing of any Tax Returns or the
prosecution, defense or settlement of any claims, suits,
proceedings, costs, damages (including but not limited to claims
for natural resource damages, remediation, response and
investigation), losses, expenses, obligations or other
liabilities arising out of or related to the Excluded
Liabilities.

(c)  If at any time after the Closing the parties determine that
certain assets (including the Excluded Assets) were
definitionally excluded from or included within (as the case may
be) the Purchased Assets to be transferred hereunder, but were
nonetheless intended to be included in, or made available to a
Purchaser or its Affiliates in their operation of, the Purchased
Assets, or excluded from the Purchased Assets and retained by the
Seller and its Affiliates, and such assets are necessary to the
operation of the Purchased Assets by the Purchaser or its
Affiliates or the businesses or operations of the Seller or its
Affiliates, as the case may be, the Seller and such Purchaser
shall cooperate in good faith to determine a mutually acceptable
method for providing such Purchaser or the Seller, and their
respective Affiliates, as the case may be, with timely access to
such assets, taking into account the continued need by the Seller
or such Purchaser or their respective Affiliates for the use of
such assets.

(d)  Each of the parties shall use reasonable commercial efforts
to cooperate with each other party as such other party may
reasonably request in connection with any claim that such other
party may desire to make against a third party under any warranty
or other right relating to any of the Purchased Assets.

7.2  Exercise of Rights of First Refusal.  In the event that the
Seller has the right to exercise any right of first refusal
relating to the Packaged Gas Business that is not included in the
Purchased Assets, and the Seller has determined that it does not
wish to exercise such right, the Seller shall consult with the
applicable Purchaser.  If such Purchaser shall so request, the
Seller shall use reasonable commercial efforts to cooperate with
such Purchaser to exercise such right for the benefit of such
Purchaser.

7.3  Confidentiality Agreements.

(a)  Unless and until the Purchasers shall have purchased the
Purchased Assets, for a period of five (5) years from the date
hereof, each Purchaser shall not use for its own purposes or
advantages (other than in connection with such Purchaser's due
diligence review and in preparation for the orderly transition of
operational control of the Purchased Assets to such Purchaser) or
publish or disclose to any third Person (other than legal and
financial consultants of such Purchaser who are subject to a duty
to maintain the confidentiality of the Information) any
confidential or proprietary information, know-how, formulae or
trade secret obtained from the Seller, including business and

                             (35)
<PAGE>

financial information, no matter how obtained (orally, in writing
or observed) (collectively, "Information"), unless and until such
Information (i) is or becomes a matter of public knowledge
through no breach by such Purchaser, (ii) is lawfully acquired
from a third Person without restrictions of confidentiality, or
(iii) such Purchaser is required to disclose such Information by
Law or is required to disclose such Information in order to
enforce the terms of this Agreement; provided that, in case of
any potential disclosure under this subclause (iii), such
Purchaser shall provide the Seller with prompt notice of any
request or order, including copies of subpoenas or orders
requesting or requiring such Information, cooperate reasonably
with the Seller in resisting the disclosure of such Information
via a protective order or other appropriate legal action, and
shall not make disclosure pursuant thereto until the Seller has
had a reasonable opportunity to resist such disclosure, unless
such Purchaser is required to make such disclosure by Law. If the
Purchasers do not purchase the Purchased Assets, as contemplated
by this Agreement, the Purchasers shall not keep or take, and
shall promptly return or destroy, any and all Information, and
shall not keep or take, and shall promptly return or destroy, any
document or other thing embodying any such Information.  With
respect to any Information that a Purchaser destroys pursuant to
the foregoing sentence, such Purchaser shall promptly provide the
Seller with a certificate, signed by an appropriate officer of
such Purchaser, certifying the destruction of such Information.

(b)  Regardless of whether the Purchasers shall purchase the
Purchased Assets, no Purchaser shall use for its own purposes or
advantages or publish or disclose to any third Person (other than
its legal and financial consultants who are subject to a duty to
maintain the confidentiality of the Information) any Information
to the extent relating to any part of the business of the Seller
other than the Packaged Gas Business, unless and until such
Information (i) is or becomes a matter of public knowledge
through no breach by a Purchaser, (ii) is lawfully acquired from
a third Person without restrictions of confidentiality, (iii) is
reliably demonstrated by the applicable Purchaser to already have
been in its possession at the time such Information is disclosed
to the applicable Purchaser hereunder, or (iv) the applicable
Purchaser is required to disclose such Information by Law or is
required to disclose such Information in order to enforce the
terms of this Agreement; provided that, in case of any potential
disclosure under this subclause (iv), such Purchaser shall
provide the Seller with prompt notice of such request or order,
including copies of subpoenas or orders requesting or requiring
such Information, cooperate reasonably with the Seller in
resisting the disclosure of such Information via a protective
order or other appropriate legal action, and shall not make
disclosure pursuant thereto until the Seller has had a reasonable
opportunity to resist such disclosure, unless the Purchaser is
required to make such disclosure by Law.

(c)  In the event the transactions contemplated hereby are
consummated, each Purchaser's use of and right to disclose any
Information that is contained in or relates to any Intellectual
Property shall be subject to the terms and conditions set forth
in the applicable Intellectual Property License.

(d)  For a period of five (5) years from the Closing Date, in the
event the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents
are consummated, the Seller shall keep, and shall cause its
employees to keep, any and all confidential and proprietary
information to the extent relating to the Packaged Gas Business
or the Purchased Assets (including, but not limited to, customer
lists and related information) confidential and shall not
disclose such information to any Person unless and until such

                             (36)
<PAGE>

information (i) is or becomes a matter of public knowledge
through no breach by the Seller, (ii) is lawfully acquired from a
third Person without restrictions of confidentiality or (iii) the
Seller is required to disclose such Information by Law or is
required to disclose such Information in order to enforce the
terms of this Agreement; provided that, in case of any potential
disclosure under this subclause (iii), the Seller shall provide
the applicable Purchaser with prompt notice of such request or
order, including copies of subpoenas or orders requesting or
ordering such Information, cooperate reasonably with such
Purchaser in resisting the disclosure of such Information via a
protective order or other appropriate legal action, and shall not
make disclosure pursuant thereto until such Purchaser has had a
reasonable opportunity to resist such disclosure, unless the
Seller is required to make such disclosure by Law.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall
preclude the Seller or its Affiliates from using or disclosing
any proprietary or confidential information related to the
Excluded Businesses or any business of a Purchaser other than the
Packaged Gas Business.

7.4  Non-Competition.  In order that Airgas may have and enjoy
the full benefit of the Packaged Gas Business, the Seller hereby
agrees that, except as otherwise provided or contemplated in any
of the Enabling Agreements, it will not, nor will any of its
Affiliates, directly or indirectly, engage in the Packaged Gas
Business in the United States for a period of five (5) years from
the Closing Date (the "Non-Competition Period").  In order that
NWS may have and enjoy the full benefit of that portion of the
Packaged Gas Business it is purchasing, the Seller hereby agrees
that, except as otherwise provided or contemplated in any of the
Enabling Agreements, it will not, nor will any of its Affiliates,
directly or indirectly, engage in the Packaged Gas Business in
North Carolina, South Carolina or that portion of Virginia as
outlined in Schedule 7.4 (collectively, the "Carolina Territory")
for the Non-Competition Period.  Notwithstanding the foregoing
two sentences, the Seller and any of its Affiliates shall have
the right to engage in (a) any of the Excluded Businesses at any
time, (b) the Packaged Gas Business outside of the United States
at any time and (c) the Packaged Gas Business in the United
States at any time through any Person (or business thereof)
acquired by the Seller or any of its Affiliates, or if the Seller
or any of its Affiliates is acquired by any Person, in each case
by merger, acquisition or a purchase of substantially all of the
assets of the Seller, any Affiliate or such other Person, after
the date of this Agreement, if, (i) in the case of any such
acquisition in the first twelve (12) months following the
Closing, such other Person was already engaged in such business
at the time of such acquisition, and the annual revenues of such
Person attributable to such business for the most recent fiscal
year of such Person did not exceed ten million dollars
($10,000,000), or (ii) in the case of any such acquisition after
the first twelve (12) months following the Closing through the
expiration of the Non-Competition Period, such other Person was
already engaged in such business at the time of such acquisition,
and the annual revenues of such Person attributable to such
business for the most recent fiscal year of such Person did not
exceed fifty million dollars ($50,000,000) and does not
constitute more than 35% of the aggregate annual revenues of all
of the businesses or operations acquired from such Person for the
most recent fiscal year of such Person.  In the event of any
acquisition of or by the Seller or any Affiliate by or of any
Person, the Packaged Gas Business-related revenues of which
exceed the threshold set forth in clause (ii) of the preceding
sentence, it shall not be deemed to be a breach of this Section
7.4 if the surviving entity in such acquisition, within a period

                             (37)
<PAGE>

of eighteen (18) months after the closing of such acquisition,
causes such Packaged Gas Business to be sold to one or more Third
Parties or to be discontinued.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the limitations set forth in this Section 7.4 shall not apply to
(a) the surviving entity in any bona fide transaction pursuant to
which the Seller (i) is acquired by any other Person or (ii)
merges with any other Person and the shareholders of the Seller
immediately prior to such merger do not hold voting securities
representing at least a majority of the outstanding voting power
of the surviving entity immediately following such merger or (b)
in the event that, as set forth in Section 7.18(c), a Purchaser
does not acquire the Carolina Assets, the Seller's operation and
use of the Carolina Assets in the Packaged Gas Business in
accordance with Section 7.18(c)(B).

7.5  Non-Solicitation by the Seller of the Purchasers' Employees.
The Seller hereby covenants and agrees that, from and after the
date hereof until the fifth anniversary of the later of the date
hereof or the Closing Date, neither it nor any of its Affiliates
will, directly or indirectly, solicit for employment any
Transferred Employee or any employee of either Purchaser involved
in the transactions contemplated hereby with whom the Seller
first had contact in connection with the negotiation and
preparation of the transactions contemplated hereby; provided,
that this Section 7.5 shall not apply (i) if any such employee
has been terminated by the applicable Purchaser or its Affiliates
for any reason or (ii) if any such employee contacts the Seller
or its Affiliates (x) in response to a general solicitation for
employment in newspapers or other periodicals or (y) on his or
her own initiative without any encouragement by the Seller.

7.6  Enforcement of Certain Provisions.  The Seller and each
Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that if such party breaches any
provision of Section 7.3, 7.4, 7.5 or 10.5 applicable to such
party, any remedy at law would be inadequate and insufficient and
would cause the non-breaching party irreparable harm and that the
non-breaching party, in addition to seeking monetary damages in
connection with any such breach, shall be entitled to specific
performance and injunctive and other equitable relief to prevent
or restrain a breach of Section 7.3, 7.4, 7.5 or 10.5 or to
enforce the provisions thereof without the requirement of posting
bond or other security.  If any of the covenants contained in any
of Sections 7.3, 7.4, 7.5 or 10.5, or any part thereof, is
hereafter construed to be invalid or unenforceable, the same
shall not affect the remainder of the covenant or covenants,
which shall be given full force and effect, without regard to the
invalid portions.  If any of the covenants contained in any of
Sections 7.3, 7.4, 7.5 or 10.5, or any part thereof, is held by a
court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable because of
the duration of such provision or the geographic area covered
thereby or for any other reason, the parties agree that the court
making such determination shall have the power to reduce the
duration and/or geographic area of such provision or otherwise
modify the terms of any such covenant and, in its reduced form,
said provision shall then be enforceable; provided, however, that
any such reduction or modification shall apply only with respect
to the operation of such Section in the jurisdiction of such
court.

7.7  Closing Conditions. Subject to Section 7.8(b), the Seller,
on the one hand, and each Purchaser, on the other hand, agree to
use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause all of the
conditions to its obligations and the obligations of the other
parties hereto to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby
to be satisfied as soon as practicable after the date of this
Agreement.

7.8  Consents and Approvals, etc.

(a)  Subject to Section 7.8(b), the Seller and each of the
Purchasers agree to use their commercially reasonable efforts to

                             (38)
<PAGE>

obtain all necessary consents and approvals of all Governmental
Bodies and other Persons required in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, including, without limitation,
for execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and
transfer of the Purchased Assets to be acquired hereunder by the
Purchasers.  The Seller agrees to use all commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain the Consent of any other party or parties to
any Acquired Contract or Real Property Lease to the transfer or
assignment thereof to the applicable Purchaser in all cases in
which such Consent is required for assignment and has heretofore
not been obtained.  To the extent that any of the Acquired
Contracts or Real Property Leases are not assignable without the
Consent of another party, this Agreement shall not constitute an
assignment or an attempted assignment if such assignment or
attempted assignment would constitute a breach thereof.  If,
after the Seller uses its commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain any such Consent, such Consent is not obtained, the
parties agree to cooperate in any reasonable arrangements (not
including the payment by the Seller of additional sums of money
to any person) designed to provide for the applicable Purchaser
the rights and obligations under any such Acquired Contract or
Real Property Lease, including but not limited to the
subcontracting thereof to the applicable Purchaser and
enforcement at the cost and for the account of such Purchaser of
any and all rights of the Seller against the other party thereto
arising out of the breach or cancellation thereof by such other
party or otherwise.  If and to the extent such arrangements
cannot be made, the applicable Purchaser shall have no obligation
with respect to any such Acquired Contract or Real Property
Lease.  To the extent that any Permit (including any
Environmental Permit) is not transferable by the Seller to the
applicable Purchaser, the Seller agrees to use commercially
reasonable efforts to cooperate with such Purchaser, at such
Purchaser's reasonable request, to assist such Purchaser in its
efforts to obtain a substantially equivalent permit.

(b)  The Seller, Airgas and, if required, NWS, shall duly file
with the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") and Department of
Justice ("DOJ") the notification and report form (the "HSR
Filing") required under the HSR Act with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby no later than the 5th Business
Day following the date hereof.  The HSR Filing shall be in
substantial compliance with the requirements of the HSR Act. Each
party shall cooperate with the other parties to the extent
necessary to assist any other party in the preparation of its HSR
Filing, to request early termination of the waiting period
required by the HSR Act and, if requested by the FTC or Antitrust
Division, to promptly amend the HSR Filing or furnish additional
information, including without limitation any information
required by a request ("Second Request") for additional
information pursuant to 15 U.S.C.  18a(e).  Each party shall
promptly inform the other parties of any material communication
made by such party to, or received by such party from, the FTC or
DOJ and any requests for additional information from any
Governmental Body with respect to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.  Each of the Purchasers shall cooperate with
the Seller to secure the expeditious termination or expiration of
the HSR waiting period; provided, however, that if (i) the FTC or
DOJ staff indicates that it is likely to recommend a challenge to
the proposed transaction unless the parties divest assets or
agree to any other obligation, covenant or commitment, or (ii)
the FTC or DOJ imposes or attempts to impose any terms or
conditions, including without limitation any obligations,
covenants, commitments or divestitures, upon NWS, as a condition
to obtaining the termination or expiration of the HSR waiting
period or otherwise in connection with such proceedings or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, NWS may
(A) determine, in its sole discretion, not to comply with such
terms or conditions and (B) upon making such determination,
deliver a NWS Termination Notice (as defined in Section 15.3(a))

                             (39)
<PAGE>

in accordance with Section 15.3(a) (and with the effects
described in Sections 7.18 and 15.3).  Airgas agrees to make all
divestments or commitments (if any) required, and to comply with
all conditions and obligations imposed by the FTC or DOJ in
connection with such proceedings; provided, however, that Airgas
shall have no obligation to hold separate or to make any
divestments of any asset(s) that represents more than $40 million
of revenues in calendar year 2001.

(c)  In the event the FTC or DOJ serves a Second Request upon the
parties in connection with the parties' filings under the HSR
Act, and the Seller does not elect to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 15.1(e), the parties shall attempt to agree
on a mutually acceptable approach to such Second Request;
provided, however, that the Seller shall have no obligation to
continue furnishing additional information to the FTC or DOJ
required by a Second Request if Airgas does not promptly attempt
to extend (and continue to proceed toward extending) its
financing arrangement for a period of  time reasonably
anticipated to permit the parties to comply with such Second
Request.

7.9  Collections and Payments.

(a)  (i)  From and after the Closing Date, the Seller hereby
constitutes and appoints Airgas, its successors and assigns, the
true and lawful attorneys of the Seller with full power of
substitution, in the name of the Seller or otherwise, and on
behalf of and for the benefit of Airgas, to demand and receive
from time to time any and all Accounts Receivable, to give
receipts, releases or acquittances for or in respect of the same
or any part thereof; to collect, for the account of Airgas, all
Accounts Receivable transferred to Airgas as provided herein, and
to endorse with the name of the Seller any check received on
account of any Accounts Receivable transferred to Airgas; from
time to time to institute and prosecute in the name of the Seller
or otherwise any and all proceedings at law, in equity or
otherwise, which Airgas, its successors and assigns, may deem
proper to collect, assert or enforce any claim, right, title,
debt or account hereby assigned or transferred with respect to
the Accounts Receivable; and to take any action necessary to
effect the transfer to Airgas of full legal title in and
beneficial ownership of any of the Accounts Receivable. The
Seller declares that the foregoing powers are coupled with an
interest and shall not be revocable by it except as set forth in
Section 7.9(a)(ii).

(ii) Airgas shall exercise at least the level of care and
diligence with respect to the collection of the Accounts
Receivable as Airgas exercises with respect to its own
receivables.  Any amounts received by Airgas or NWS from any
customer for whom Accounts Receivable have been transferred to
Airgas in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be applied first to the oldest outstanding
invoice for such customer.  Airgas shall have the right to
require, by written notice delivered to the Seller no later than
85 days following the Closing Date, that the Seller pay to Airgas
on the 90th day following the Closing Date the amount of any
outstanding Accounts Receivable specified in such notice that
have not been collected by Airgas as of such date, minus
$300,000.  Upon payment of such amount by the Seller, Airgas
shall transfer to the Seller all of Airgas' right, title and
interest in and to any such remaining outstanding Accounts
Receivable (including any security or collateral associated
therewith) and shall thereafter use commercially reasonable
efforts to cooperate with the Seller in connection with the
collection of such Accounts Receivable.  Simultaneously with the
consummation of such transfer, the Seller shall be deemed to have

                             (40)
<PAGE>

revoked the power of attorney provided for in Section 7.9(a)(i)
in connection with such Accounts Receivable.

(b)  The Seller agrees that it shall promptly transfer or deliver
to Airgas any cash or other property that the Seller may receive
on or after the Closing Date in respect of any Acquired
Contracts, Acquired Permits, Accounts Receivable or other items
related to the Purchased Assets that are being transferred or are
intended to be transferred to the Purchasers as provided in this
Agreement.  Each Purchaser agrees upon receipt of any invoice or
demand for payment related to any payables retained by the Seller
to promptly forward such invoice or demand for payment to the
Seller or, upon consent of the Seller, to pay such amounts and to
be promptly reimbursed by the Seller upon proof of payment.

(c)  Each Purchaser shall promptly transfer or deliver to the
Seller that portion of all rebates, discounts or similar amounts
that such Purchaser may receive on or after the Closing Date that
relate to the operation of the Packaged Gas Business or the
purchase of goods and services, in each case, by the Seller prior
to the Closing Date. The Seller shall promptly transfer or
deliver to Airgas that portion of all rebates, discounts or
similar amounts that the Seller may receive on or after the
Closing Date that relate to the purchase of goods and services by
the Purchasers on or after the Closing Date.

(d)  From and after the Closing, each Purchaser shall honor any
discount certificates submitted by any customer that were issued
pursuant to the order in the case entitled Phipps, Mark, d/b/a/
Jones Portable Welding vs. APCI, et al.  The Seller shall
reimburse each Purchaser for the face value of any discount
certificates delivered to the Seller by such Purchaser.

7.10 Instruments of Transfer to the Purchasers.  On the Closing
Date, the Seller shall deliver to the Purchasers or any Airgas
Subsidiary to which Airgas assigns its rights hereunder, one or
more executed Bills of Sale, gap indemnitees and lien affidavits,
and such other good and sufficient instruments of assignment,
transfer and conveyance, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Purchasers and their counsel, as the
Purchasers shall reasonably request to vest in the applicable
Purchaser or such Airgas Subsidiary all of the Seller's title to
the Purchased Assets. With respect to the Owned Real Property,
the Seller shall convey such Owned Real Property to the
applicable Purchaser by recordable special warranty deed or its
equivalent under applicable state laws.  Simultaneously with such
delivery, the Seller shall take all actions necessary to put the
applicable Purchaser or such Airgas Subsidiary in actual
possession and operating control of the Purchased Assets.  From
and after the Closing Date, upon request of a Purchaser, the
Seller shall execute, acknowledge and deliver all such further
assignments, transfers, conveyances and other instruments as such
Purchaser shall reasonably request to assign, transfer and convey
to and vest in such Purchaser its right, title and interest in
the Purchased Assets, and as otherwise may be appropriate to
carry out the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

7.11 Assumption of Liabilities by the Purchaser. On the Closing
Date, each Purchaser shall deliver to the Seller an executed
assignment and assumption agreement and such other good and
sufficient instruments of assumption, transfer and conveyance, in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Seller and its

                             (41)
<PAGE>

counsel, as the Seller shall reasonably request to vest in the
Purchasers all of their respective Assumed Liabilities.  From and
after the Closing Date, upon request of the Seller, each
Purchaser shall execute, acknowledge and deliver all such further
instruments as the Seller shall reasonably request to vest in the
Purchasers their respective Assumed Liabilities, and as otherwise
may be appropriate to carry out the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

7.12 Conduct of Packaged Gas Business Prior to the Closing Date.
Except as contemplated by this Agreement, during the period from
the date hereof to the Closing Date, the Seller shall conduct the
Packaged Gas Business in the Ordinary Course of Business
consistent with the Seller's past practice in the previous 12
months except as described in Schedule 7.12, and shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to preserve its relationships
with customers, suppliers, distributors, employees and other
Persons in connection with the Packaged Gas Business.  Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, except as contemplated
by this Agreement, during the period from the date hereof to the
Closing Date, without the prior written consent of Airgas, with
respect to the Airgas Assets, or of NWS, with respect to the
Carolina Assets, the Seller shall not:

(a)  sell, lease, license, transfer, pledge, mortgage, encumber,
grant, allocate to any other business unit, or otherwise dispose
of any Purchased Asset, except dispositions in the Ordinary
Course of Business of Purchased Inventory and of Purchased
Equipment that is obsolete or in unusable condition and not
necessary for the operation of the Packaged Gas Business as
currently conducted by the Seller;

(b)  increase the rate of compensation of, or pay or agree to pay
any benefit or incentive to, any of the Employees, except in the
Ordinary Course of Business consistent with the Seller's past
practice in the previous 12 months;

(c)  alter the procedures of the Packaged Gas Business regarding
the collection of accounts receivable;

(d)  take any action, other than in the Ordinary Course of
Business consistent with the Seller's past practice in the
previous 12 months, with respect to the accounting policies or
procedures of the Packaged Gas Business;

(e)  terminate or materially amend or modify, assign any material
rights relating to, any Acquired Contract, or enter into any new
Contract, other than in the Ordinary Course of Business
consistent with the Seller's past practice in the previous 12
months;

(f)  make any capital expenditure or commitment pertaining to the
Packaged Gas Business in excess of $200,000 individually or
$600,000 in the aggregate; or

(g)  agree, directly or indirectly, whether in writing or
otherwise, to do any of the foregoing.

     Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no
Purchaser shall have a claim against the Seller or any of its
Affiliates, and no right to indemnification pursuant to Section
14 with respect to any claim, based upon or arising out of the
Seller's failure to take any of the actions set forth in this
Section 7.12 to the extent that the Seller has requested in

                             (42)
<PAGE>

writing the consent of Airgas, with respect to the Airgas Assets,
or NWS, with respect to the Carolina Assets, to take such action,
and such Purchaser has not granted such consent.

7.13 Maintenance of Financing.  Airgas and its Affiliates shall
take all actions required to be taken by each of them under the
terms of the Credit Agreement in order to obtain the financing
thereunder so as to permit Airgas to fulfill its obligations
under Section 3 hereof.  Neither Airgas nor any of its Affiliates
shall take any action, including but not limited to amending or
modifying the Credit Agreement, that would reasonably be expected
to impair Airgas' ability to borrow under the Credit Agreement
the amount necessary to fulfill its obligations under Section 3
hereof.  Airgas shall notify promptly the Seller of any event,
occurrence or circumstance which may reasonably be expected to
have an adverse effect on Airgas' ability to borrow under the
Credit Agreement the amount necessary to fulfill its obligations
under Section 3 hereof.

7.14 Exclusivity.  As an inducement to the Purchasers to enter
into this Agreement, and in consideration of the time and expense
which it has devoted and will devote to the transactions
contemplated hereby during such period, except as between the
Seller and any Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement, until the
earlier of (x) the Closing Date and (y) termination of this
Agreement in accordance with Section 15.1 hereof, the Seller
shall not, and the Seller shall cause its officers, directors,
employees, agents and representatives (including any investment
banker, attorney or accountant retained or acting on behalf of
the Seller or any shareholder, director, officer or employee of
the Seller) not to directly or indirectly (a) initiate, solicit,
encourage or entertain proposals, inquiries, indications of
interest, or offers (including by way of furnishing information)
with respect to a merger, consolidation, share exchange or
business combination (unless such transaction shall be structured
in a manner that is consistent with, and does not adversely
affect or delay, the Purchasers' rights under this Agreement) or
with respect to an investment in, acquisition, or purchase of all
or a portion of the Purchased Assets (an "Acquisition Proposal"),
or (b) enter into any discussions, negotiations, agreements,
arrangements or commitments with respect an Acquisition Proposal
with any Person; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not
restrict the Seller from dispositions in the Ordinary Course of
Business of Purchased Inventory and of Purchased Equipment that
is obsolete or in unusable condition and not necessary for the
operation of the Packaged Gas Business as currently conducted by
the Seller.  The Seller will immediately cease any existing
discussions with any Persons concerning any Acquisition Proposal
and will notify the Purchasers promptly after it receives any
Acquisition Proposal.

7.15 Agreements.  From the date hereof through the Closing Date,
the Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to notify
Airgas, and in the case of such Contract that is included in the
Carolina Assets, NWS, of its receipt of any written notice that a
party to any Contract listed on Schedule 5.7(a) has terminated or
declined to renew or intends to terminate or decline to renew any
such Contract or that any party has asserted or intends to assert
any claim under any such Contract.

7.16 Excluded Containers.  Prior to the Closing Date, or
immediately upon written notice from a Purchaser if any Excluded
Containers are discovered by such Purchaser within two years
after the Closing Date, the Seller, at its sole cost and expense,

                             (43)
<PAGE>

shall remove any Excluded Containers from such Purchaser's
property or otherwise and properly dispose of all such Excluded
Containers.

7.17 Removal of Excluded Assets.  Prior to the Closing, the
Seller shall segregate, remove or, with the written consent of
the applicable Purchaser, abandon any Excluded Equipment (other
than Excluded Containers, which are addressed in Section 7.16)
from those assets and operations of the Seller that are to become
Purchased Assets, except to the extent otherwise contemplated by
any of the Enabling Agreements.

7.18 Sale of the Carolina Assets.

(a)  Airgas and NWS shall be jointly and severally liable for all
obligations and liabilities of NWS to the Seller arising under
this Agreement.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
NWS shall not be liable for any representation, warranty,
covenant, obligation or liability of Airgas arising under this
Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents or otherwise
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

(b)  In the event that (i) all of the conditions in Sections 8.1
and Section 9 hereof shall have been satisfied or waived and NWS
does not consummate the acquisition of the Carolina Assets at the
Closing for any reason or (ii) the Seller determines in its sole
discretion that the participation by NWS as a party to this
Agreement is in any manner or for any reason delaying or
otherwise hindering the expeditious consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, then, in either case
(i) or (ii), at the Seller's election, exercisable by delivery of
a written notice (a "Seller Termination Notice") thereof to the
other parties hereto, NWS will, with the effects provided in
Section 15.3(b), no longer be a party to this Agreement or any
other Transaction Document.  Effective immediately upon delivery
of a Seller Termination Notice or a NWS Termination Notice,
Airgas shall, without any further action required on the part of
any party hereto, automatically be deemed to have assumed all of
the obligations and liabilities of NWS under this Agreement and
any other Transaction Document.  In such event, subject to
Section 7.18(c), Airgas shall be obligated to purchase all of the
Purchased Assets at the Closing, to pay to the Seller at the
Closing the full amount of the Closing Date Payment and to assume
all of the Assumed Liabilities. For the avoidance of doubt,
neither (i) the consummation of the sale of the Carolina Assets
to NWS nor (ii) the failure to consummate such sale shall be a
condition precedent to Airgas' obligations to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other
Transactions Documents or shall excuse the performance by Airgas
of its obligations under this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents.

(c)  Upon the delivery of a Seller Termination Notice in
accordance with Section 7.18(b) or a NWS Termination Notice in
accordance with Section 15.3(a), Airgas may elect (i) to request
that the Seller transfer the Carolina Assets to a business trust
or other independent entity or to one or more Third Party
purchasers, or (ii) to request that the Seller retain the
Carolina Assets, and the Seller shall comply with either such
request.

               (A)  In the event that Airgas elects either (i) or
(ii) above, Airgas shall pay to the Seller at the Closing the
full amount of the Closing Date Payments.

                             (44)
<PAGE>

               (B)  In the event that Airgas elects (ii) above,
from and after the Closing Date, the Seller shall hold the
Carolina Assets, all customer contracts served by the Carolina
Facilities and if instructed by Airgas, any other customer
contracts to the extent such customer contracts can reasonably be
served by the Carolina Assets, and such other Contracts to the
extent necessary to support the operation of the Carolina Assets,
and shall operate the Carolina Assets, subject to applicable
regulatory requirements, for Airgas' account, in good faith in
accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the
applicable Transition Services Agreement, and, subject to
applicable regulatory requirements, Airgas shall be entitled to
any profits or losses resulting from the operation thereof;
provided that Airgas shall pay to the Seller on a monthly basis
an amount equal to 110% of the Seller's direct costs incurred in
operating the Carolina Assets.  The Seller shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to preserve its relationships
with customers, suppliers, distributors, employees and other
Persons in connection with the operation of such Carolina Assets.
As soon as practicable following the Closing Date, but in no
event later than 120 days following the Closing Date, Airgas
shall designate a Third Party purchaser or other Third Party
entity to which the Seller shall, subject to applicable
regulatory requirements, transfer the Carolina Assets, with such
Third Party purchaser or other Third Party entity paying directly
to Airgas the purchase price for such Carolina Assets at the
closing of such transfer, which closing shall occur no later than
180 days following the Closing Date.  In the event that Airgas
does not so designate such a Third Party purchaser or other Third
Party entity prior to 120 days following the Closing Date, or if
the closing of the transfer of the Carolina Assets does not occur
prior to 180 days following the Closing Date, the Seller may
dispose of such Carolina Assets in such manner as it deems
necessary, and shall transfer to Airgas any proceeds it receives
in connection with such disposition; provided that the Seller
shall not be obligated to pay to Airgas more than $17.9 million
minus the amount of the Seller's expense incurred in connection
with such transaction.

               (C)  The Seller shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cooperate with Airgas in connection with the transfer
of the Carolina Assets to a Third Party, provided that in no
event shall the Seller have any obligation or liability to any
such Third Party.

7.19 The Seller's Trademarks on Cylinders.

(a)  The Seller and the Purchasers acknowledge that certain
cylinders, dewars and other containers that are included in the
Purchased Assets are stamped with certain trademarks owned or
used by the Seller, including those described on Schedule 7.19
(such trademarks, the "Marks" and such cylinders, dewars and
other containers, the "Imprinted Containers").  In order to
obviate the need for the Purchasers to remark such Imprinted
Containers, each of the Purchasers shall have the right to use
such Imprinted Containers in operating the Packaged Gas Business
in the Ordinary Course of Business on and after the Closing Date
and shall not be required to remove the Marks from such Imprinted
Containers.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Purchaser shall
have any right to use the Marks other than as specifically set
forth above and, among other things, no Purchaser shall (i) claim
any right, title or interest in or to any Mark by registration or
otherwise; (ii) use any Mark or the Seller's name in any
marketing activity; (iii) apply any Mark to any product, package
or container other than as provided herein; or (iv) except to the
extent that the Marks remain on the Imprinted Containers in
accordance with this Section 7.19, use any Mark as a corporate

                             (45)
<PAGE>

name or trademark in whole or in part.  Each Purchaser hereby
assigns to the Seller any rights it might acquire in or to each
Mark through use or otherwise.  Nothing in this Section 7.19(a)
shall restrict the ability of a Purchaser to transfer to a third
party or otherwise dispose of any Imprinted Container; provided,
however, that any subsequent acquirer of any Imprinted Container
shall have only such rights with respect to the Marks as granted
to such Purchaser pursuant to this Section 7.19(a) and shall be
subject to all limitations imposed hereunder on such Purchaser
with respect to the use or transfer of the Marks.

(b)  By the date that is no later than ninety (90) days following
the Closing Date, the Seller shall either remove or replace the
Marks from any of Seller's cylinders, dewars and other containers
that are not part of the Purchased Assets.

standards set forth Sections 14.4(b)(B)(i) and (iii) hereof, and
provided that the Seller gives the applicable Purchaser
reasonable advance notice of such Remediation.

(c)  The Seller shall perform all Remediation at the Subject
Property in compliance with all Laws, including without
limitation, Environmental Laws and in such a manner as to
minimize, to the extent practicable, damage to the Subject
Property (including to the improvements, fixtures and
appurtenances thereon) and the disruption of or interference with
the applicable Purchaser's use of the Subject Property (including
the improvements, fixtures and appurtenances thereon).

(d)  To the extent reasonably requested by the Seller, the
applicable Purchaser shall:  (i) reasonably cooperate with the
Seller in all Remediation; (ii) provide reasonable on-site

<PAGE>

in connection with Remediation; (vi) otherwise use its
commercially reasonable efforts to minimize Remediation costs;
provided, however, such Purchaser shall not be required to incur
any out-of-pocket expense and such cooperation will not diminish
materially such Purchaser's use of the Purchased Assets as a
result of such efforts; and (vii) sign and otherwise execute such
documents as are necessary for the Seller's performance of its
Transfer Obligations or Remediation, provided, however, such
Purchaser shall not be required as a result of the execution of
any document pursuant to this subsection to incur any cost or
expense or otherwise be bound by any affirmative or negative
covenant by which such Purchaser is not otherwise bound pursuant
to this Section 7.20.

(e)  The Seller shall be responsible for the cost of any repairs,

alterations.

Seller's ability to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or (ii) that relates to or arises out of the
Packaged Gas Business or the Purchased Assets and seeks to obtain
from the Seller any damages in excess of three million dollars

     SECTION 10.  EMPLOYEES

10.1 Transfer of Employees.  The Purchasers shall make offers of
employment to and hire the Employees pursuant to the procedures
set forth in this Section 10.1:

(a)  Aligned Employees.  One of the Purchasers shall make offers
of employment to each of the Aligned Employees; provided however,
that the Purchasers, in their sole discretion, may decline to
offer employment to up to an aggregate of 100 Aligned Employees.
The Purchasers shall use their respective best efforts to
identify in writing to the Seller within thirty (30) days after
the date of this Agreement, the Aligned Employees that the
Purchasers decline to hire.
                             (54)
<PAGE>

(b)  Management Employees.  Airgas shall make offers of
employment to each of the Management Employees that Airgas
identifies to the Seller in writing prior to the Closing Date.
NWS shall make offers of employment to each of the Management
Employees that NWS identifies to the Seller in writing prior to
the Closing Date.  The Purchasers shall use their respective best
efforts to identify in writing to the Seller within thirty (30)
days after the date of this Agreement, the Management Employees
that the Purchasers wish to hire.

(c)  Notice.  The Purchasers shall periodically notify the Seller
in writing as to which Employees have or have not accepted such
offers.

(d)  Responsibility for Certain Employees.

               (A)  If a Purchaser makes an offer of employment
on the terms described in the last sentence of Section 10.2 to
any Employee and such Employee does not accept such offer prior
to the Closing Date, such Purchaser shall have no obligation to
hire the Employee. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the
Seller shall cease to employ any Aligned Employee that does not
accept an offer of employment made to such Aligned Employee that
complies with the terms described in Section 10.2 hereof, and
shall not rehire any such Aligned Employee for a period of at
least twelve months without the prior written consent of the
applicable Purchaser.

               (B)  If a Purchaser makes an offer of employment
to any Employee that does not comply with the terms described in
Section 10.2, and such Employee does not accept such offer prior
to the Closing Date, such Purchaser shall be responsible for any
costs associated with the termination of such Employee.

               (C)  If the number of Aligned Employees to whom
the Purchasers decline to offer employment is greater than 50
(each such Aligned Employee, an "Excess Aligned Employee"), the
Purchasers shall pay to the Seller the costs associated with the
termination of each such Excess Aligned Employee in accordance
with this Section 10.1(d)(C).  If the Purchasers notify the
Seller pursuant to Section 10.1(a) that they plan to decline to
offer employment to any Excess Aligned Employee, the Seller shall
provide to the Purchasers the Seller's good faith estimate of the
Seller's costs described on Schedule 10.2 associated with the
termination of each such Excess Aligned Employee.  The Purchasers
shall either pay to the Seller on the Closing Date the amount of
the Seller's estimate of termination costs for each Excess
Aligned Employee, or the Purchasers shall hire such Aligned
Employee in accordance with this Section 10.  A Purchaser may
make, as a condition of employment of any Employee, the transfer
of such Employee to another facility of such Purchaser within a
reasonable commuting distance from the facility of the Seller at
which the Employee is currently employed.

     10.2 Terms of Employment.  Each Employee who accepts a
Purchaser's offer of employment shall become employed by such
Purchaser (i) as of the Closing Date, (ii) in the event any such
Employee is on long-term or short-term disability leave on the
Closing Date, as of the date that such Employee is no longer on
any disability leave, provided that the Employee reports to work
with such Purchaser within 30 days after the end of any
disability leave and in no event later than 180 days following
the Closing Date, (iii) in the case of any Aligned Employee
identified on Schedule 1.9(b) (unless such Aligned Employee is

                             (55)
<PAGE>

included in the 100 Aligned Employees to whom the Purchasers may
decline to make offers of employment pursuant to Section
10.1(a)), on the first Business Day of the month following the
date in which such Aligned Employee turns 55 years of age, or
(iv) with respect to Aligned Employees referenced in Section C of
Schedule A of the Transition Services Agreement between Airgas
and the Seller, in accordance with the terms and conditions of
such Transition Services Agreement.  Employees who are employed
by a Purchaser in accordance with the foregoing sentence shall be
"Transferred Employees" from and after their first date of
employment with such Purchaser.  Each Purchaser shall have the
right to administer a standard drug test (as administered to all
new employees hired by such Purchaser in the Ordinary Course of
Business) to each Employee that accepts such Purchaser's offer of
employment, and the failure of any such Employee to take or pass
such drug test shall be considered cause for termination by such
Purchaser.  Any Employee who fails to take or pass such drug test
shall not be deemed a "Transferred Employee" for purposes of this
Agreement.  Upon the Closing Date, all Transferred Employees
shall receive a base salary or hourly wage at least equal to his
or her base salary or hourly wage level in effect immediately
prior to the Closing Date.

10.3 Employee Benefits.

(a)  Each Purchaser shall extend, on the Closing Date, such
Purchaser's then-existing employee welfare benefit plans and
employee pension benefit plans, both as defined in Section 3 of
ERISA, to the Transferred Employees employed by such Purchaser on
the same terms on which similarly situated employees of such
Purchaser participate in such plans, except as provided below in
this Section 10.3.  For all purposes of such employee welfare
benefit plans and employee pension benefit plans (other than for
benefit accrual for any defined benefit pension plan), each
Purchaser shall credit Transferred Employees employed by such
Purchaser for prior service with the Seller and its Affiliates to
the extent the Seller recognized such service for the purpose of
its similar plans.  Each Purchaser shall allow Transferred
Employees employed by such Purchaser with vacation earned for
2002 but unused as of the Closing Date to use such vacation prior
to the end of the year.  Each Purchaser shall (a) cause its group
health plans to cover Transferred Employees employed by such
Purchaser and dependents of such Transferred Employees who are
covered under the Seller's Air Products Medical Plan as of the
Closing Date and to be responsible (in accordance with such
Purchaser's employee welfare benefit plans and employee pension
benefit plans) for expenses incurred by such Transferred
Employees and dependents on or after the Closing Date; (b) waive
proof of insurability requirements for initial extension of both
basic and optional benefit coverage under its group health plans
or other group insurance welfare benefit plans; (c) credit
deductible payments and co-insurance payments made in 2002 by
such Transferred Employees and their dependents under the
Seller's group health plans for expenses incurred on or prior to
the Closing Date towards deductibles and stop losses in effect
for its group health plans for 2002; (d) waive all pre-existing
condition clauses in its group health plans for such Transferred
Employees and their dependents; and (e) waive eligibility waiting
periods for such Transferred Employees and their dependents for
any employee benefit plans maintained by such Purchaser as of the
Closing Date.  For purposes of the preceding sentence, "group
health plan" shall have the meaning proscribed in Section
5000(b)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

(b)  If the employment of a Transferred Employee is terminated
within 12 months of the Closing Date (other than for cause), the

                             (56)
<PAGE>

Purchaser that hired such Transferred Employee shall pay such
Transferred Employee as severance an amount equal to one week of
such Transferred Employee's salary at the time of such
termination for each year of such Transferred Employee's service
with the Seller (to the extent the Seller recognized such service
for the purposes of severance benefits), such Purchaser or any of
their respective Affiliates, provided, however, that such
Purchaser shall have no obligation to pay any amount pursuant to
this Section 10.3(b) in excess of 26 weeks' salary of such
Transferred Employee.

10.4 COBRA.  The Seller shall be responsible for providing such
continuation coverage within the meaning of the Consolidated
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended ("COBRA")
as is required pursuant to COBRA in respect of any Employee or
dependent of an Employee who incurs a "qualifying event" prior to
the Closing Date or any Employee who does not become a
Transferred Employee in accordance with Section 10.2.  Each
Purchaser shall be responsible for providing such continuation
coverage as is required under COBRA in respect of any Transferred
Employee employed by such Purchaser or dependent who incurs a
qualifying event on or after the Closing Date.

10.5 Non-Solicitation by the Purchasers of the Seller's
Employees.  Each Purchaser hereby covenants and agrees that,
except as provided in this Section 10, from and after the date
hereof until the fifth anniversary of the later of the date
hereof or the Closing Date, neither it nor any of its Affiliates
will, directly or indirectly, solicit for employment any
employees of the Seller involved in the transactions contemplated
hereby with whom the Purchaser first had contact, or of whom such
Purchaser first learned, in connection with the negotiation and
preparation of the transactions contemplated hereby; provided,
that this Section 10.5 shall not apply (i) if any such employee
has been terminated by the Seller or its Affiliates for any
reason or (ii) if such employee contacts such Purchaser or its
Affiliates (x) in response to a general solicitation for
employment in newspapers or other periodicals or (y) on his or
her own initiative without any encouragement by such Purchaser.

10.6 Unemployment Insurance.  At the request of the applicable
Purchaser, the Seller, to the extent permitted by relevant state
unemployment insurance law, agrees to a total or partial transfer
of experience rating, and/or transfer of applicable reserve
balances, relating to Aligned Employees, whichever is applicable.
The Seller will provide to the applicable Purchaser information
reasonably requested by the applicable Purchaser to effectuate
such transfer.

10.7 NWS Obligations.  Notwithstanding anything contained herein
to the contrary, NWS' rights, responsibilities, obligations and
liabilities hereunder with respect to the Employees shall be
limited to only those Employees exclusively employed at the
Carolina Facilities, and NWS' responsibilities, obligations and
liabilities hereunder with respect to Transferred Employees shall
be limited to only those Transferred Employees hired by NWS.

     SECTION 11.  BROKERAGE

     The Seller, on the one hand, and the Purchasers, on the
other hand, shall indemnify and hold harmless the other against
and in respect of any liability, cost or expense resulting from
any agreement, arrangement or understanding made by such party
with any third party for brokerage or finders fees or other
commissions relative to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby.
                             (57)
<PAGE>
     SECTION 12.  EXPENSES

     Except as otherwise provided herein or therein, each party
hereto shall bear all expenses incurred by it in connection with
this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby,
including all compensation and expenses of their respective
counsels, actuaries and accountants.

     SECTION 13.  TRANSFER TAXES AND RECORDING EXPENSES

13.1 The parties understand and agree that there will be added to
the Purchase Price any excise, use, privilege, value added or
sales tax, or any other tax or assessment (other than those based
upon the net income or the net worth of the Seller) now or
hereafter imposed by or under the authority of any federal, state
or local law, rule or regulation with respect to the purchase of
the Purchased Assets by the Purchasers.  Each Purchaser expressly
authorizes the Seller to collect and remit such taxes as may be
required by any applicable laws.  If the purchase of any
Purchased Assets is exempt from sales or use tax, then where
required by applicable Law the applicable Purchaser shall furnish
the Seller with a valid exemption certificate in form and content
acceptable to the Seller.

13.2 The applicable Purchaser shall be responsible for and shall
pay any and all transfer, stamp, documentary, title, registration
and recording taxes or fees applicable to the transfer of its
respective Purchased Assets under this Agreement; provided,
however that the applicable Purchaser and the Seller shall each
be responsible for one-half of any real estate transfer taxes
applicable to the transfer of the Owned Real Property.

13.3 Real and personal property taxes applicable to any of the
Purchased Assets, including but not limited to any payments made
under an Industrial District Agreement or any similar agreement
under which amounts are paid to a governmental body in lieu of
property taxes, shall be prorated between the Seller, on the one
hand, and the applicable Purchaser, on the other hand, as of the
Closing Date.

     SECTION 14.  SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS; INDEMNIFICATION

14.1 Survival of Representations and Warranties.  The
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained
in this Agreement and the certificates and other documents
delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Closing,
but shall be subject to all limitations and other provisions
relating thereto contained in this Agreement.  Such
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained
herein are exclusive, and the parties hereto confirm that they
have not relied upon any other representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements as an inducement to enter into this
Agreement or otherwise.  Following the Closing (other than with
respect to the Enabling Agreements and the remedies provided
therein and claims of, or causes of action arising from, fraud),
the remedies provided in this Section 14 shall be the sole
recourse of all parties hereto for all claims, liabilities,
losses, damages, costs and expenses related to or arising, at
law, under any statute or in equity (including but not limited to
those arising under any Environmental Laws), or otherwise,
directly or indirectly, out of this Agreement or the transactions

                             (58)
<PAGE>

contemplated hereby.  In furtherance of the foregoing, each party
hereto waives, from and after the Closing, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, any and all rights, claims, actions or causes
of actions (other than with respect to the Enabling Agreements
and the remedies provided therein and claims of, or causes of
action arising from, fraud) it may have against the other parties
hereto relating to the subject matter of this Agreement other
than the remedies expressly provided in this Section 14.

the Purchasers and their respective Affiliates and the officers
and directors and the respective successors and permitted assigns
of each of the foregoing (collectively, the "Purchaser
Indemnitees") against and in respect of any costs, damages
(including but not limited to claims for natural resource
damages, remediation, response and investigation), losses,
expenses, claims, obligations or other liabilities (including
legal and other expenses incurred in investigating and defending
or enforcing any claims or deficiencies), but not including
special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages of any kind
(including without limitation business interruption, lost profits
or lost business opportunities), except to the extent special,
indirect, consequential or punitive damages are awarded to a
third party against an indemnified party in circumstances in
which such indemnified party is entitled to indemnification
hereunder (collectively, "Losses"), incurred by the Purchaser
Indemnitees to the extent resulting or arising from:

(a)  except for matters relating to Environmental Laws,
Environmental Permits, Environmental Liabilities and any other
matters related thereto, which are covered exclusively by Section
14.2(c) and Section 14.2(d) below, a breach of any of the
representations or warranties made by the Seller in Section 5 of
this Agreement or in any certificate, agreement or document or
instrument delivered pursuant hereto;

(b)  except for matters relating to Environmental Laws,
Environmental Permits, Environmental Liabilities and any other
matters related thereto, which are covered exclusively by Section

covenants or agreements (other than the Enabling Agreements) made
or to be performed by the Seller pursuant to this Agreement or in
any certificate, agreement or document or instrument delivered
pursuant hereto;

(c)  all Environmental Liabilities arising without any
Unreasonable Contact by any Purchaser Indemnitees, but only to
the extent such Environmental Liabilities are based upon:

               (A)  a breach of any of the representations or
warranties made by the Seller in Section 5.10 of this Agreement
or in any certificate, agreement or document or instrument
delivered pursuant hereto with respect to Section 5.10; or

               (B)  a breach of any of the covenants or
agreements (other than the Enabling Agreements) made or to be
performed by the Seller pursuant to this Agreement or in any
certificate, agreement, document or instrument delivered pursuant
hereto;

(d)  all Environmental Liabilities arising out of any claim,
demand, notice, suit or order asserted or brought by a Third

                             (59)
<PAGE>

Party on or after the Closing Date without any Unreasonable
Contact by any Purchaser Indemnitees (except that the requirement
that the claim, demand, notice, suit or order be without
Unreasonable Contact shall not apply with respect to the Miami,
FL matter described in paragraph (g) of Schedule 5.10 or the
first sub-paragraph in paragraph (c) of Schedule 14.4), but in
any case only to the extent such Environmental Liabilities are
based upon:

               (A)  any Condition at any Owned Real Property or
any Leased Real Property, which Condition exists at the Closing
Date; provided, however, if a responsible chemical company acting
in a commercially reasonable manner with respect to a site where
such company bears the full risks and responsibilities would
perform immediately Remediation of a Condition identified in this
subsection in the absence of a Third Party claim, demand, notice,
suit or order, then the similar performance by a Purchaser
Indemnitee of such Remediation shall be subject to the Seller's
indemnification hereunder notwithstanding the absence of any
Third Party claim, demand, notice, suit or order;

               (B)  any action or failure to act by the Seller
related to the Packaged Gas Business or to any Purchased Asset,
which action or failure to act occurs prior to the Closing Date;

               (C)  any Release or threatened Release of a
Hazardous Substance at or from any Owned Real Property or any
Leased Real Property, which Release or threatened Release occurs
prior to the Closing Date and at or after the date when the
Seller first owned or leased the particular Owned or Leased Real
Property; or

               (D)  the Management by the Seller of any Hazardous
Substance (i) in connection with the Packaged Gas Business, or
(ii) to, at or from any Owned Real Property or any Leased Real
Property, in each case which Management occurs prior to the
Closing Date.

(e)  the Excluded Liabilities, it being understood that matters
relating to Environmental Laws or Environmental Liabilities are
covered exclusively by Section 14.2(c) or 14.2(d) above and are
not to be treated as Excluded Liabilities, and that this Section
14.2(e) shall not apply to Assumed Liabilities;

(f)  any failure to comply with the "bulk sales" laws applicable
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

(g)  any Tax liability imposed or incurred with respect to the
Packaged Gas Business or the Purchased Assets for all Pre-Closing
Tax Periods (or any portion thereof), except any liability,
obligation or expense for Taxes related to this transaction which
constitute liabilities, obligations or expenses of the Purchaser
pursuant to the Transaction Documents; or

(h)  any mechanics', carriers', workers', repairer's, purchase
money security interest or other similar Liens on any of the
Purchased Assets arising or incurred prior to the Closing Date.

     The obligations of the Seller hereunder shall bind the
successors and assigns of the Seller.  The Seller's obligation to
indemnify NWS, its Affiliates and their respective officers and

                             (60)
<PAGE>

directors and their respective successors and permitted assigns
under this Section 14.2 shall only apply to the extent the
indemnification obligation is relevant to any of the Carolina
Factors; provided, however, that the Seller shall not have any
obligation to indemnify NWS with respect to any Loss if the
effect of any such obligation would be to enlarge or expand the
Seller's obligations to any extent greater than the Seller's
indemnification obligations would be if Airgas had purchased all
of the Purchased Assets, assumed all of the Assumed Liabilities
and otherwise consummated all of the transactions contemplated
hereby without the participation of NWS, and Airgas had incurred
the same Loss.

14.3 Duration of Indemnification of the Purchasers.  The Seller's
obligations to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Purchaser
Indemnitees under Section 14.2 shall apply only to any Claim
Notice (as hereinafter defined) given pursuant to Section 14.9
within the following periods:

     Sections 14.2(a)    18 months after the Closing Date,
     and 14.2(c)(A)      except that the Seller's
                         indemnification obligation with respect
                         to a breach of any representation or
                         warranty contained in Section 5.18, in
                         the first sentence of Section 5.20(a)
                         or in the third sentence of Section
                         5.5(a) shall survive until the

                         in the succeeding three paragraphs.

                         No time limit (except to the extent

                         Section) with respect to covenants and

                         any notice to the Seller with respect
                         to any indemnification claim based upon
                         or arising out of a breach of a Seller
                         Post-Closing Covenant shall be

                         90 days following the date on which any
                         employee of a Purchaser in a position
                         with managerial responsibility becomes
                         aware of such claim.

apply only after the Purchaser Indemnitees have suffered Losses
under Section 14.2 in excess of an aggregate of three million
dollars ($3,000,000), after which the Seller shall only be

however, that solely for purposes of determining whether the
amount of the Seller's indemnification obligations exceed three
million dollars ($3,000,000) in the aggregate (the "Minimum
Amount"), a breach of the Seller's representations or warranties
shall be determined without regard to any limitation or
qualification as to materiality or Business Material Adverse
Effect set forth in such representation or warranty, and provided
further that the Minimum Amount shall not apply to the Seller's
indemnification obligation under Section 14.2(f), 14.2(g) or
14.2(h), or to any matter described in Schedule 5.10 or Schedule
14.4, and (ii) in any case shall apply only after the amount of
any individual Loss or any series of related Losses indemnified
against hereunder shall exceed twenty-five thousand dollars
($25,000) and then shall apply to the entire amount of such Loss.
In any event, the Seller will be obligated only to indemnify
Losses in excess of the Minimum Amount and up to an aggregate
amount equal to sixty million dollars ($60,000,000) (the "Maximum
Amount").  Any claim which is within the description of Section
14.2(a) or 14.2(b) and which is also within the description of
any of Sections 14.2(c) through 14.2(h), shall be deemed to be
asserted and treated hereunder for all purposes as a claim
arising out of Section 14.2(c) through 14.2(h), as appropriate.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the minimum
thresholds set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) of this Section
14.4(a) shall not apply to any Losses suffered as a result of a
breach by the Seller of Section 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 7.1(b),
7.1(d), 7.2, 7.3(d), 7.4, 7.5, 7.6, 7.8(a), 7.9(a), 7.9(b),

Section 11, Section 13, Section 16 or Section 18.

(b)  Remediation of Particular Matters.  The Seller's obligation
to indemnify the Purchaser Indemnitees pursuant to Section
14.2(c) with respect to any Removal, Remedial or Response action
("Remediation")  shall be subject to and limited by the following
conditions:
               (A)  The applicable Purchaser shall perform such
Remediation in material compliance with all applicable Laws,
including without limitation, Environmental Laws;

               (B)  Such Remediation shall be only that which (i)
is necessary to resolve and discharge the Environmental Liability
that is the subject of the Seller's obligation to indemnify the
Purchaser Indemnitees, (ii) employs the most cost-effective means
available that is acceptable to the relevant Governmental Body,

                             (62)
<PAGE>

and (iii) results in Remediation of the affected environmental
media (e.g., soil, groundwater) to an extent necessary for use of
the affected Owned Real Property or Leased Real Property in the
manner that such property was used by the Seller at the Closing
Date; and

               (C)  Prior to a Purchaser's performing any
particular Remediation at a Subject Property:

                    (i)  Such Purchaser shall provide to the Seller,
for the Seller's review and comment, such Purchaser's proposed
Remediation plan, which shall include (as reasonably requested by the
Seller) the data, evaluations, reports and other information upon which
such Purchaser relied in preparing its proposed Remediation plan; and

                    (ii) The Seller shall either (I) provide comments
to the applicable Purchaser on the proposed Remediation plan within 60
days (or, in the event that submission of the Remediation plan is
required in less than 60 days under applicable Environmental Law,
then within a reasonable time prior to the submission of the
Remediation plan, provided that such Purchaser shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain an extension of time
for submission of such plan) of the receipt thereof (it being
understood that if the Seller does not provide any such comments,
such Purchaser may proceed with performance of such Remediation),
after which such Purchaser shall provide the final Remediation
plan to the Seller for the Seller's approval, which approval may
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, or (II) if the Seller
does not approve such Purchaser's final Remediation plan, assume
responsibility for such Remediation as is necessary to resolve
and discharge the Environmental Liability that is the subject of
the Seller's obligation to indemnify the Purchaser Indemnitees.

(c)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
the Seller makes no representation or warranty, and shall have no
indemnification obligation, with respect to any Environmental
Liability relating to compliance with the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency's Risk Management Plan Regulations (pursuant to
Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act) relating to the storage of
gas cylinders where an individual cylinder contains less than the
threshold quantity of a regulated substance; provided, however,
that the Seller shall reimburse the applicable Purchaser for any
fines or penalties paid by such Purchaser in connection with the
foregoing to the extent that such fines or penalties are
identified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in a
notice of violation or similar notification document as relating
to periods prior to the Closing Date.

                    notice to a Purchaser with respect to any
                    such indemnification claim based upon or
                    arising out of a breach of a Purchaser Post-

for purposes of determining whether the amount of the Purchasers'
indemnification obligations exceed the Minimum Amount, a breach
of a Purchaser's representations or warranties shall be
determined without regard to any limitation or qualification as
to materiality set forth in such representation or warranty, and
(ii) in any case shall apply only after the amount of any
individual or any series of related Losses indemnified against
hereunder shall exceed twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000) and
then shall apply to the entire amount of such Loss. In any event,
the Purchasers will be obligated only to indemnify Losses in

                             (66)
<PAGE>

indemnification obligation under Section 14.5(e).  Any claim
which is within the description of Section 14.5(a) or 14.5(b),
which is also within the description of any of Section 14.5(c)
through 14.5(g), shall be deemed to be asserted and treated
hereunder for all purposes as a claim arising out of
Sections 14.5(c) through 14.5(g), as appropriate. Any claim which
is within the description of Section 14.6(a) or 14.6(b), which is
also within the description of any of Section 14.6(c) through
14.6(f), shall be deemed to be asserted and treated hereunder for
all purposes as a claim arising out of Sections 14.6(c) through
14.6(f), as appropriate.  Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, the minimum thresholds set forth in clauses (i)
and (ii) of this Section 14.8 shall not apply to any Losses
suffered as a result of a breach by a Purchaser of Section 3.2,
3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 7.1(b), 7.1(d), 7.3(a), 7.3(b), 7.3(c), 7.6,
7.9(b), 7.9(c), 7.9(d), 7.11, 7.18, 7.19(a), 7.20, 7.24, Section
10, Section 11, Section 13, Section 16 or Section 18.

14.9 Procedure for Indemnification.

(a)  Whenever any party becomes aware that any claim is
threatened or asserted against it or the existence of any other
circumstances that would occasion the indemnification described
in this Section 14 (a "Covered Claim"), such party shall promptly
provide the party from whom it is seeking indemnification with a
notice (a "Claim Notice") of such Covered Claim pursuant to the
provisions of Section 19 hereof.  Failure to give such notice
promptly shall not relieve the Assuming Party (defined below) of
its indemnification obligations hereunder except to the extent it
actually is prejudiced by such failure.  Each Claim Notice shall
describe the Covered Claim, the party threatening or asserting it
(if applicable), the relief sought, and the basis for
indemnification hereunder with respect thereto.  In the case of a
third-party claim, the party receiving such notice may, at its
option, assume the defense of such Covered Claim (the "Assuming
Party"), provided that, within forty (40) days after the Claim
Notice is given (or sooner, if the nature of the Covered Claim so
requires), the party receiving such notice shall have given
notice to the other party (the "Notifying Party"), pursuant to
the provisions of Section 19 hereof, of its election to assume
such defense, whether or not the Assuming Party acknowledges its
obligation to indemnify the Notifying Party in connection with
such Covered Claim.  If the defense is so assumed by the Assuming
Party with counsel reasonably acceptable to the Notifying Party,
the Notifying Party shall be entitled to participate in (but not
control, which shall be solely the Assuming Party's right if the
Assuming Party assumes the defense) the defense of the Covered
Claim with its own counsel at its own expense, and the Notifying
Party shall provide such cooperation at the expense of the
Assuming Party (including but not limited to providing available
information and personnel to the Assuming Party) as the Assuming
Party shall reasonably request to facilitate such defense.  The
Assuming Party shall have the right to defend and/or settle any
such Covered Claim on such terms and conditions and in such
amounts as it deems appropriate, and the Notifying Party shall
promptly execute all documents reasonably requested of it with
respect to any such defense and/or settlement; provided, however,
any such settlement shall include an unconditional release by the
claimant of all indemnified persons with respect to such Covered
Claim and the indemnified persons shall not be required to take
any action other than the delivery of such release.  If the party
receiving the notice does not assume the defense of a given
Covered Claim pursuant hereto or fails to notify the Notifying
Party of its election hereunder, the party giving the notice
shall defend against such Covered Claim in such manner, and/or
settle such Covered Claim on such terms, as it shall, in its sole
reasonable judgment, determine to be appropriate under the
circumstances and such action shall be binding on the parties for
the purposes of this Section 14.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,

                             (67)
<PAGE>

in any action or proceeding in which the counsel chosen by the
Assuming Party determines that it cannot represent both the
Notifying Party and the Assuming Party in connection with the
defense of any Covered Claim consistent with the applicable rules
of professional conduct, the Notifying Party shall have the right
to employ separate counsel at the Notifying Party's expense and
to control its own defense in connection therewith.

(b)  The obligation to indemnify a party's officers and directors
in accordance with this Section 14, shall be enforced exclusively
by such party and nothing herein shall be construed to grant such
officers or directors any individual rights, remedies,
obligations or liabilities with respect to this Agreement.  The
parties to this Agreement may amend or modify this Agreement in
any respect without the consent of such officers or directors.

     SECTION 15.  TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT

15.1 Events of Termination.  This Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby may be terminated or abandoned at any time
prior to the Closing Date as follows:

(a)  upon the written agreement of the Seller and Airgas;

(b)  at the election of Airgas, if (i) the Seller has breached
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in
this Agreement that is qualified by materiality or a Business
Material Adverse Effect requirement, or (ii) the Seller has
breached in any material respect any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement that is not so
qualified, in the case of (i) or (ii), which breach has not been
cured on or prior to thirty (30) days following delivery of
written notice of such breach by Airgas to the Seller;

(c)  at the election of the Seller, if (i) Airgas has breached
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in
this Agreement that is qualified by materiality or material
adverse effect or (ii) if Airgas has breached in any material
respect any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
contained in this Agreement that is not so qualified, in the case
of (i) or (ii), which breach has not been cured on or prior to
thirty (30) days following delivery of written notice of such
breach by the Seller to Airgas;

(d)  upon written notice by either the Seller or Airgas, if the
Closing Date shall not have occurred before March 31, 2002 (the
"Drop Dead Date"), for any reason other than (i) the failure of
the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform its
obligations hereunder or (ii) a breach of a representation or
warranty by such party herein, in each case that would give the
other party the right to terminate the Agreement;

(e)  upon written notice by the Seller, if the FTC or DOJ serves
a Second Request upon the parties in connection with the parties'
filings under the HSR Act, the scope of which, after reasonable
attempts at negotiating limitations and exhausting the appeals
process provided for in 16 C.F.R. 2.20 or the DOJ Second Request
Internal Appeals Procedures, requires, in the opinion of the
Seller's outside antitrust counsel, an unreasonably burdensome
amount of information relating to any of the Seller's businesses
other than the Packaged Gas Business;

                             (68)
<PAGE>

(f)  upon written notice by Airgas if the FTC or DOJ shall
require as a condition to the approval of the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement, that Airgas hold separate or make
any divestments of any assets that represent more than $40
million of revenues in calendar year 2001, and Airgas elects not
to comply with such condition;

(g)  upon 10-days' written notice by either the Seller or Airgas
if the FTC or DOJ authorizes its staff to seek a preliminary
injunction against the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; or

(h)  at the election of the Seller, if a preliminary injunction
is entered by a court of competent jurisdiction which restrains
or prohibits the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
based upon or related to Airgas' ownership interest in NWS; or

(i)  at the election of the Seller, if Airgas' financing for the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not available as a
result of breach, the lapse of time or otherwise.

15.2 Consequences of Termination.  If this Agreement shall be
terminated pursuant to Section 15.1, this Agreement shall
thereafter become void and neither party shall have any further
obligation to the other hereunder, except as set forth in
Sections 7.3 and 10.5, Section 11, Section 12 and this Section
15.2; provided, however, that

(a)  (i)  if the Seller shall have the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 15.1(c) (regardless of whether the
Seller shall have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to any other provision of this Section 15.1), or (ii) if Airgas
shall have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 15.1(b) (regardless of whether Airgas shall have the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to any other provision
of this Section 15.1), it is expressly understood and agreed
that, subject to Section 15.2(b), the terminating party's right
to pursue all legal remedies for breach of contract and damages
shall survive such termination unimpaired; and

(b)  upon the termination of this Agreement, the Deposit shall be
non-refundable to the Purchaser and will be retained by the
Seller as liquidated damages (the "Liquidated Damages Amount");
provided, however that in the event of a termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 15.1(b) or 15.1(d) (due to
termination by the Seller) or 15.1(e), the Deposit shall be
returned to the Purchasers on a pro rata basis (based upon each
Purchaser's contribution to the Deposit).  The Seller and Airgas
acknowledge and agree that the provisions of this Section 15.2
are for the mutual benefit of both parties and are intended to
avoid a protracted dispute respecting damages relating to a
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 15.1, other
than Section 15.1(b) or 15.1(c).

15.3 NWS Obligations.  (a)  Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, NWS may elect, exercisable by delivering written
notice thereof (a "NWS Termination Notice") to the other parties
hereto, to no longer be a party under this Agreement or any other
Transaction Document in the event any of the following occur: (i)
the failure of any of the conditions set forth in Section 8.2 to

                             (69)
<PAGE>

be satisfied at or prior to the Closing, (ii) NWS determines, in
good faith, that one or more of the conditions set forth in
Section 8.2 will not be satisfied or waived at or prior to the
Closing, (iii) the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Section 15.1, (iv) the consummation of the acquisition of the
Airgas Assets (or any portion thereof) by Airgas without the
contemporaneous acquisition of the Carolina Assets by NWS, (v)
the FTC or DOJ staff indicates that it is likely to recommend a
challenge to the proposed transaction unless the parties divest
assets or agree to any other obligation, covenant or commitment,
or (vi) the FTC or DOJ imposes or attempts to impose any terms
any terms or conditions, including without limitation any
obligations, covenants, commitments or divestitures, upon NWS, as
a condition to obtaining the termination or expiration of the HSR
waiting period or otherwise in connection with the proceedings
contemplated by Section 7.8(b) or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

(b)  Effective immediately upon the delivery of a NWS Termination
Notice or a Seller Termination Notice, notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, (i) NWS shall no longer be a party to
this Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents, (ii)
NWS shall have no obligation or liability, and shall be deemed to
have been released by the other parties hereto from all
obligations and liabilities, arising under or relating to this
Agreement and any other Transaction Document, (iii) NWS' sole
remedy against the Seller under this Agreement and any other
Transaction Documents shall be not to consummate the purchase and
sale of the Carolina Assets, and (iv) the Seller shall have no
liability or obligation to NWS, and shall be deemed to have been
released by NWS from all liabilities and obligations arising
under or relating to this Agreement and any other Transaction
Document.

     SECTION 16.  DISPUTE RESOLUTION

16.1 General Disputes.  Except with regard to Factual
Environmental Disputes (as defined below), which are exclusively
covered by Section 16.2 below:

(a)  The Seller, on the one hand, and the Purchasers, on the
other hand, shall attempt in good faith to resolve any dispute,
controversy or claim among them arising out of or relating to
this Agreement, including without limitation any dispute over the
breach, termination, interpretation, or validity thereof (the
"Dispute").  Any party may request through written notice that
the Dispute be referred to senior executives of the parties who
have authority to resolve the Dispute.  The executives shall
attempt to resolve the Dispute by agreement within thirty (30)
days of such notice.

(b)  If the parties to the Dispute are unable to resolve the
Dispute as provided in Section 16.1(a) above, the applicable
Purchaser and the Seller shall try in good faith to resolve the
Dispute by mediation and may use any mediator upon which they
mutually agree. If such Purchaser and the Seller are unable to
mutually agree upon a mediator, the dispute shall be referred to
the Philadelphia office of Judicial Arbitration and Mediation
Services, Inc. ("JAMS") mediation or such other mediation service
as the parties to the Dispute may agree. The cost of the mediator
will be split equally between such Purchaser and the Seller
unless they agree otherwise.

(c)  If such Purchaser and the Seller are unsuccessful in their
good faith attempt to mediate the dispute, the dispute shall be
resolved by binding arbitration. The parties to the Dispute shall
select a mutually agreed upon single arbitrator and may utilize
any format and set rules for the binding arbitration upon which

                             (70)
<PAGE>

such parties may mutually agree. If such parties are unable to so
agree, the dispute shall be submitted to a single arbitrator
chosen by the parties from a list of retired judges and justices
at the Philadelphia office of JAMS or such other mediation or
arbitration service as such parties may agree. Should such
parties be unable to agree on a choice of arbitrator within
thirty (30) days from the demand for arbitration, then any party
to the Dispute may request the contract arbitration administrator
of JAMS (or other service, as the case may be) to furnish a list
of three names and the Seller may strike one name, and the
Purchasers may jointly strike one name, thereby nominating the
remaining person as replacement arbitrator. If more than one name
remains, the contract arbitration administrator of JAMS will
choose an arbitrator from the list of remaining names.  If the
parties to the Dispute are unable to agree on a format and set of
rules for the arbitration, the arbitration shall be conducted in
accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American
Arbitration Association American Arbitration Association.

(d)  The costs of the arbitration shall be borne equally among
the parties to the Dispute.  Each party shall bear its own
expenses for attorneys' fees, expert fees, witness fees, travel
costs and other arbitration-related costs.  In no event is the
arbitrator authorized or empowered to award punitive or exemplary
damages.

(e)  Judgment upon an award rendered by the arbitrator may be
entered in any court with jurisdiction. The arbitrator may issue
interim orders of protection as necessary or appropriate to
maintain the status quo, safeguard property or prevent
irreparable injury.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, any party to
the Dispute may seek injunctive relief in the courts in the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or the United States District Court
for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, which relief shall last
until the arbitrator renders its decision.

16.2 Factual Environmental Disputes.

Dispute"), and if it is necessary to resolve such factual dispute
in order to establish any rights and/or obligations pursuant to

matter in dispute ( a "Technical Expert"); or, failing such
agreement, each such party shall designate one such Technical
Expert (provided that if both Purchasers are a party to the
dispute the Purchasers shall jointly designate one such Technical
Expert), and within fifteen (15) Business Days after such
designation, those two Technical Experts shall designate a third
Technical Expert (not a current or former employee or agent of
such parties or of their respective Technical Experts);

               (B)  Within thirty (30) Business Days after
designation of the Technical Expert(s), such Technical Expert(s)

                             (71)
<PAGE>

shall independently consider all information relevant to the
determination and resolution of the factual matter(s) that is the
subject of dispute between the parties.  Each party shall have a
reasonable opportunity to provide timely input to the Technical
Expert(s).

               (C)  Within forty (40) Business Days after the
designation of the Technical Expert(s), the Technical Expert(s)
shall decide the factual matter(s) that is the subject of dispute
(with a vote of two being necessary to reach this decision if
three Technical Experts have been designated).

(b)  Decisions of the Technical Expert(s) under this Section 16.2
shall be exclusive, final and binding upon the parties as to the
factual matters thereby decided.

EXHIBIT E-1


LIQUID BULK PRODUCT SUPPLY AGREEMENT


This Liquid Bulk Product Supply Agreement (the "Agreement")  is
made  as  of  the  28th day of February, 2002  (the  "Effective
Date"),  between  Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.  ("Seller"),
with  its  headquarters at 7201 Hamilton Boulevard,  Allentown,
Pennsylvania     18105-1501,  and  Airgas,   Inc.,   with   its
headquarters at 259 N. Radnor-Chester Road, Suite 100,  Radnor,
Pennsylvania   19087 ("Buyer").


1.  Sale and Purchase

1.1   Minimum Requirements.    During the Term (as  defined  in
Section 3.1), Seller hereby agrees to sell to Buyer, and  Buyer
hereby  agrees  to purchase from Seller, 35% of Buyer's  entire
liquid requirements (excluding those requirements satisfied  by
Buyer's  own existing or acquired liquid production,  including
without limitation Buyer's production by means of membrane, PSA
or   on-site  generator  units)  including  without  limitation
amounts  arising  in the future through acquisitions,  internal
growth, additional customers or otherwise in the United  States
for  distribution in the United States, net of Seller's Minimum
Transfill  Volumes (defined in Section 1.2), for  each  of  the
products set forth in Attachments 3A, 3B and 3C (individually a
"Product" and collectively the "Products"), in liquid form  (as
to a Product, "Buyer's Minimum Requirement"); provided however,
that  from  the  Effective Date through 31 August  2002,  Buyer
shall only be obligated to purchase the volumes of Products  it
currently purchases under the Terminated Agreements (as defined
in Section 3.2) but will use commercially reasonable efforts to
increase  such  purchases  from Seller  until  it  reaches  the
Buyer's Minimum Requirement.

1.2   Minimum  Transfill  Volumes.    In  addition  to  Buyer's
obligation  to purchase and pay for Buyer's Minimum Requirement
for  each  Product, Seller hereby agrees to sell to Buyer,  and
Buyer  hereby agrees to purchase from Seller, Products of  like
kind  and equal quantities to those kinds and quantities Seller
currently delivers to the transfill locations sold to Buyer  by
Seller as of the Effective Date, all as set forth on Attachment
2  (as  to a Product, the "Minimum Transfill Volume"), it being
agreed  that such volumes need not be delivered to any specific
location.

1.3  Regions and Subregions; Reallocations.  Buyer shall, no
later  than  1  June 2002, identify in writing for  Seller  the
tanks  and  volume  requirements within and among  the  various
geographic regions (each a "Region") and subregions within such
Regions (each a "Subregion") through which it will satisfy  its
purchase  requirements hereunder commencing 1  September  2002.
Buyer  shall  have  the right to move tanks and  volumes  among
Regions   or  Subregions  at  the  start  of  each  three   (3)
consecutive  Contract Year (as defined in Section  1.4)  period
(each  a  "Reallocation Period"), commencing with the  Contract
Year beginning 1 September 2005.

1.4   Annual  Forecasts.   Buyer shall provide  Seller,  on  or
before each June 1 during the Term, with the identity of  those
tanks  within a Region and Subregion (both at Buyer's transfill
locations and at customers), the requirements of which,  during
the  immediately  following  September  1  through  August   31
contract  year (each September 1 through August 31  during  the
Term  (as defined in Section 3.1), commencing 1 September 2002,
is  referred to herein as a "Contract Year"), Buyer anticipates
satisfying  through purchases of Product under  this  Agreement
(each  an  "Annual Forecast").  Any changes to  a  forecast  or
actual volume requirement for a given Product in a given Region
or  Subregion  that exceeds an amount equal  to  fifteen  (15%)
percent of the actual average delivery of such Product to  such
Region  or  Subregion during the immediately  preceding  twelve
(12)  months  that  end 1 June. shall be  subject  to  Seller's
consent, not to be unreasonably delayed or denied.

<PAGE>

1.5  Buyer's Right to Request Product Increases.  Buyer may, by
written  notice  to Seller given concurrently with  the  Annual
Forecast   elect  to  purchase  in  the  immediately  following
Contract Year, in addition to the Minimum Transfill Volume  and
Buyer's Minimum Requirement provided for in Section 1.1, up  to
an  additional  fifteen percent (15%) of  its  entire  purchase
requirements  (the  "Additional  Product"),  net  of   Seller's
Minimum  Transfill  Volume,  for  Products   (each  a  "Product
Increase  Notice").   Buyer's  Product  Increase  Notice  shall
specify  the  type and volume amount of the Additional  Product
and  the  location at which such Additional Product  is  to  be
delivered;  the  Annual Forecast for such Contract  Year  shall
likewise  reflect such Additional Product.  Once  ordered,  the
Additional Product shall remain in effect for the remainder  of
the  Reallocation  Period in which such  Contract  Year  falls.
Pricing for Additional Product under this Section 1.5 shall  be
in  accordance with Article 7.  Buyer's purchases  of  Products
shall  first  be  applied  to Buyer's Minimum  Requirement  and
Minimum  Transfill Volumes, and then to the Additional  Product
amount   Seller  shall,  subject to  the  proviso,  supply  the
Additional Product to Buyer; provided however, that  if  Seller
does  not have such Additional Product available, Seller  shall
use  commercially  reasonable efforts to make  such  Additional
Product available and, as soon as Product becomes available  to
Seller,  from  expiring  contracts  with  other  purchasers  or
otherwise, shall deliver such Product to fulfill the Additional
Product order.

1.6   Seller's Right to Supply Additional Product. Buyer  shall
meet with Seller to negotiate in good faith the supply of up to
an  additional fifteen percent (15%) of Buyer's entire purchase
requirements,  net  of Seller's Minimum Transfill  Volume,  for
Products  at  such prices and supply term as the parties  agree
upon.  Seller may, but shall not be required, to supply Product
under  this Section 1.6.  Buyer may, but shall not be required,
to purchase Product under this Section 1.6.

1.7  Quarterly Statements.    Within thirty (30) days after the
end of each Contract Year quarter during the Term, Seller shall
deliver  to Buyer a written summary statement of the volume  of
each  Product  purchased in a Region during such Contract  Year
quarter.   Products shall be deemed to have been  purchased  in
the  Contract  Year quarter in which delivery is  made.   Buyer
shall  have  thirty (30) days from its receipt of  the  summary
statement  to either accept the statement or to object  to  the
quantities  set  forth therein.  Prior to  Buyer's  acceptance,
Seller  may correct errors in the statement; once Buyer accepts
the  statement, such volumes shall be controlling as to Buyer's
meeting/not meeting Buyer's Minimum Requirement for a Product.

1.8  Audit Rights re: Volumes.     Seller shall have the right,
at  its  expense, for purposes of determining the  accuracy  of
volumes   against  which  the  Buyer's  Minimum   Volumes   are
calculated, to audit Buyer's actual requirement for volumes  of
Product in a Contract Year.  The parties shall mutually  select
a  major public accounting firm, unaffiliated with either Buyer
or  Seller,  to  perform  such audit  under  a  confidentiality
agreement  reasonably  acceptable to both  parties.   Any  such
audit  may  cover  no  more than the three  (3)  most  recently
completed  Contract  Years prior to the  date  of  such  audit.
Buyer  shall  have the right to review the auditor's  work  and
discuss  it  with  the  auditor if it  disputes  the  auditor's
results  prior  to the results being presented to  Seller.   If
such audit determines that Buyer's actual volumes for a Product
are  greater  than the amount Buyer has been using  to  compute
Buyer's  Minimum Volume for such Product, Buyer shall  promptly
reimburse  Seller for the Price of the amount of  Product  that
should have been included in Buyer's Minimum Volume but was not
and  such  amount  for  which  Buyer  reimburses  Seller  shall
constitute "Shortfall Product" for all purposes of Article 2.

1.9   Helium and Hydrogen.     Seller shall sell to Buyer,  and
Buyer shall purchase from Seller, (i) helium in accordance with
the provisions of Attachment 8A and (ii) hydrogen in accordance
with  the provisions of Attachment 8B.  Such Attachments  shall
set forth the Sections or of this Agreement or portions thereof
that  apply  to  such  helium  or  hydrogen  transactions,   as
applicable,  and  only  those  expressly  listed  Sections   or
portions  thereof, and no other provisions of  this  Agreement,
shall be applicable to such transactions.

                             2
<PAGE>

2. Purchase of Shortfall Product

2.1   Shortfall Product.  By October 31 of each Contract  Year,
Seller   shall  notify  Buyer  of  any  shortfall  in   Buyer's
obligation  to take delivery of Buyer's Minimum Requirement  or
the  Minimum  Transfill Volume of a given  Product  (in  either
event,  the  "Shortfall Product") for the immediately  previous
Contract Year (the "Shortfall Amount") and shall invoice  Buyer
for such Shortfall Amount in accordance with the provisions  of
Section 2.2.  Buyer shall be entitled to take delivery  of  the
paid-up  Shortfall Amount, or any portion thereof,  during  the
six  (6) months following the date of the invoice setting forth
the  Shortfall  Amount.  Buyer's purchase of Shortfall  Product
shall  not reduce Buyer's Minimum Requirement in any subsequent
Contract Year.

2.2   Pricing of Shortfall Product. At the time Buyer pays  the
Shortfall Amount, Buyer shall provide Seller with the  identity
of  those  tanks  to  which  the Shortfall  Product  is  to  be
delivered (the "Shortfall Delivery Forecast") and the Price (as
defined  in  Article 7) payable at that time for the  Shortfall
Product  shall  be based on the assumption that deliveries  are
made to those tanks.  The Price for Shortfall Product shall  be
the  Price in effect under this Agreement for the Contract Year
in which the shortfall occurred.


3. Term and Termination; Termination of Prior Agreements

3.1   Agreement  Term.      The term of  this  Agreement  shall
commence  on  the  Effective  Date  and  shall  continue  until
September   1,  2017,  on  which  date  this  Agreement   shall
automatically terminate (the "Term").

Date, the following product supply agreements that are in place
between  Seller,  as  seller, and Buyer,  as  buyer,  shall  be
terminated and of no further force and effect (collectively the
"Terminated  Agreements"); provided however,  that  any  claims

6.1   Delivery  of Products.    Product shall be  delivered  by
Seller  F.O.B. Seller's delivery vehicle or Seller's production
facility if Seller's delivery vehicle is not utilized.  Risk of
loss  shall  pass  to  Buyer upon delivery.   Seller  will  use
commercially reasonable efforts to deliver Products  so  as  to
avoid  customer  run-outs and will attempt  to  deliver  liquid
oxygen  and liquid nitrogen within twenty-four (24) hours'  and
liquid  argon within forty-eight (48) hours' notice.  If Seller
fails  to  make timely delivery of Product such that a customer
experiences  interruption of supply,  Buyer  may  purchase  the
Product Seller has failed to deliver and Seller shall pay Buyer
the  difference  between the cost to Buyer of  purchasing  such
alternative  Product and the cost of such  Product  under  this
Agreement.   Such remedy shall be in addition to,  and  not  in
lieu  of, any other remedy Buyer may have under this Agreement.
Such Product shall be deemed to have been purchased from Seller
for  purposes  of determining whether Buyer has  purchased  its
Buyer's Minimum Requirement and Minimum Transfill Volume.

6.2   Notice  of Requirements.  Buyer, or Buyer's  third  party
customer,  shall  monitor its inventory  of  Product  and  give
reasonable  notice, in accordance with Paragraph  6.1,  of  the
quantity  of  Product  needed  to  permit  delivery  prior   to
exhaustion of such inventory; provided however, that  if  Buyer
or,  with  Buyer's  consent, Seller installs telemetry,  Seller
shall be solely responsible for such monitoring.

6.3   Additional [**] Charges.   Buyer shall pay Seller
additional charges for all applicable [**] as  specified in
Attachment 6; provided however, that Buyer may designate  (by
a written list delivered to Seller identifying the  [**]  or
changes to the [**]) (i)  up to [**] of its [**] as exempt from
the additional [**] charge for [**] on Attachment 6 (the [**])
through Contract Year 2005, (ii) up to [**] as [**] through
Contract Years 2006 and 2007, and (iii) up to [**] from and after
Contract Year 2007; provided however, that Buyer shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to reduce the percentage of such
[**] as soon as is commercially practicable.

[**] - Confidential treatment requested.

6.4   Equipment.     As of the Effective Date, the  parties  do
not  contemplate  that Seller will provide any  storage  units,
equipment,  piping,  controls  or  other  instrumentation   and
devices (collectively, "Equipment") for the storage and use  of
any  Product delivered for the benefit of Buyer hereunder.  If,
at  any  time, the parties agree that Seller will  provide  any
Equipment  in  connection  with the  transactions  contemplated
hereunder,  the  terms  and conditions of  Attachment  9  shall
govern  the  relationship between the parties with  respect  to
such Equipment.


7. Price and Charges for Products and Services

7.1   Prices.   The price for Product sold may include a  "Unit
Price"  (when  Product is supplied in liquid or bulk  form),  a
power  cost  (for  liquid oxygen and liquid nitrogen  only,  it
being  understood that the Unit Price for liquid argon  already
includes  a  power cost factor), and a distribution cost  (when
Product is delivered, calculated in accordance with Attachments
5 and 7), and shall be subject to adjustment as provided herein
(collectively the "Price").  The Price for a Product  shall  be
calculated in accordance with the terms of Attachments  3A,  3B
and 3C, as appropriate, applicable to such Product and shall be
subject  to  the  applicable Product sourcing requirements  set
forth  in Attachment 1.  If Seller closes an operating merchant
facility,  Seller  will  maintain such  closed  facility  as  a
pricing  source for ninety (90) days from the date if  notifies
Buyer  of  such  closing and thereafter will, at its  election,
either  (i)  continue to maintain such facility  as  a  pricing
source  (even  though Product is being delivered  from  another
facility)  for  the remainder of the then-current  Reallocation
Period  or  (ii) release Buyer from its obligation to  purchase
the  then-forecast amount of Products that were  being  sourced
from  such  facility  prior to its closing and  reduce  Buyer's
Minimum Requirement with respect to such Product for the  then-
current Reallocation Period.

7.2   Audit Rights re: Cost of Power.    Buyer shall  have  the
right, at its expense, for purposes of determining the accuracy
of  billings  by Seller, to audit Seller's actual  charged  and
paid  power rates.  The parties shall mutually select  a  major
public  accounting  firm, unaffiliated  with  either  Buyer  or
Seller, to perform such audit under a confidentiality agreement
reasonably  acceptable to both parties.   Any  such  audit  may
cover  no  more  than  the  three (3) most  recently  completed
Contract  Years prior to the date of such audit.  Seller  shall
have the right to review the auditor's work and discuss it with
the  auditor if it disputes the auditor's results prior to  the
results  being  presented to Buyer.  If such  audit  determines
that  Seller's actual power rate is less than the amount Seller
has  been  using to compute the power cost component of  Price,
Seller  shall  promptly reimburse Buyer for all excess  charges
theretofore paid by Buyer on account of such discrepancy.

7.3  Surcharges.         If during any Contract Year a location
of   Seller   providing  Products  hereunder   experiences   an
extraordinary increase in its truck fuel costs or  power  costs
and  such  extraordinary  cost  increases  are  likewise  being
experienced  by  a  majority  of the  other  producers  in  the
industry  within  three  hundred (300)  miles  of  such  Seller
location, Seller, by written notice to Buyer, may charge  Buyer
and Buyer shall pay a surcharge (a "Surcharge") in an amount no
greater  than  the amount required for Seller to  recover  such
increased  costs.  Such Surcharge shall remain in effect  until

                             5
<PAGE>

the  date  upon  which  Seller's  costs  return  to  an  amount
comparable to what it was prior to such extraordinary  increase
in its costs.  Prior to imposing a Surcharge under this Section
7.3,  Seller  shall provide Buyer with evidence supporting  the
need  for  the  Surcharge.  In addition, Buyer shall  have  the
right  to  verify  the  necessity for and  the  amount  of  any
Surcharges under this Section 7.3 in the same manner  and  with
the  same  effect  as  is provided for  in  Section  7.2.   Any
Surcharge shall be one that Seller is applying generally to its
customers  and  not one applicable to Buyer alone.   Surcharges
shall be in addition to the Price and neither the assessment of
nor  changes in such Surcharges shall be construed as  a  Price
adjustment  under  Section 8.1; provided  however,  that  there
shall  be  no  duplication of Price adjustments and  Surcharges
hereunder.

7.4    Competitive  Prices.  Buyer  shall,  at  [**],  have the
right to furnish  written evidence to Seller of its ability to
purchase Product  for a Region or Subregion from a responsible
supplier thereof, in like quantity and quality and by like
delivery for a term of not less than [**] as compared to the
quantity and quality and delivery method for such Product
Seller  is then delivering to Buyer in such Region or Subregion
under  this  Agreement, at a lower price  than  Seller's  then-
current Price.  In such event, Seller will reduce its Price for
such Product to Buyer in such Region or Subregion by the lesser
of [**].

[**] - Confidential treatment requested.


8. Adjustments in Prices.

8.1  Adjustments.   The Price of each Product shall be adjusted
as  outlined  in Attachments 4A, 4B, 4C and 4E, as appropriate,
to  this  Agreement.  Distribution Matrices shall  be  adjusted
annually commencing 1 September 2003, as outlined in Attachment
4F.

hereby  agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the  other  party

behalf  of  the  indemnifying  party's  employees,  agents   or
invitees  and  related in any way to the Products  supplied  by
Seller under this Agreement.  Each party expressly agrees  that
the obligation of indemnity under this Section 12.1 extends  to

13.Limitation of Liability

13.1  Obligation to Warn.     Buyer acknowledges that there are
hazards  associated  with  the use of  the  Products,  that  it
understands such hazards, and that it is the responsibility  of
Buyer  to warn its employees and others exposed to such hazards
through  Buyer's storage and use of the Product.  Seller  shall
provide  Buyer  with  copies  of Material  Safety  Data  Sheets
relating  to the Products for Buyer to make such warnings,  and
Buyer shall hold harmless, indemnify and defend Seller from and
against  any liability incurred by Seller because such warnings
were not made.

13.2  Limitation on Claims.   No claim of any kind with respect
to  nondelivery  of a Product shall be greater than  the  Price
payable  hereunder  for the Product in respect  to  which  such
claim is made and Buyer's sole and exclusive remedy (except for
the  remedy  of termination for material default in  accordance
with  the  terms of Section 16.3) for delivery of nonconforming
Product  to  Buyer  shall be replacement by Seller  of  a  like
quantity  of conforming Product at no additional cost to  Buyer
plus the cost of cleaning all delivery vessels, storage vessels
and  delivery  equipment  contaminated  by  such  nonconforming
Product.

13.3   Waiver of Consequentials.    Seller shall not be  liable
in contract or tort (including negligence and strict liability)

considered  in  default in the performance of  its  obligations
hereunder  (other than its obligation to make  any  payment  of

concerted act of workers or other industrial disturbance, fire,
explosion,   flood   or   other  natural   catastrophe,   civil
disturbance  or  acts  of terrorism, riot  or  armed  conflict,

circumstances described in this Article 14, is unable to supply

dissolution or similar relief with respect to such party, or if
either  party  shall  make any assignment for  the  benefit  of
creditors, or if a receiver is appointed for either party,  the
other  party  may, at its option, terminate this  Agreement  by
written  notice.   The  election  of  any  option  under   this
Section  16.1  shall  not preclude the exercise  of  any  other
option.

16.2  Damages for Buyer's Breach.    In the event of a material
breach of this Agreement by Buyer, which is not cured prior  to
that  day that is thirty (30) days after written notice thereof
from  Seller to Buyer (or, if such cure is not possible  within
such  thirty  (30)  days but has been commenced  and  is  being
diligently  pursued by Buyer, such longer period  as  shall  be
necessary) (a `"Buyer Breach"):

                             8
<PAGE>

(10th) Contract Year, Seller shall have the right to either (i)
demand payment of liquidated damages in the amount set forth in
the  following table (the "LDs"), in which case Buyer shall  be
obligated to pay such LDs or (ii) pursue its other remedies  at
law  or  in  equity.  In either case, Seller shall be  released
from  its  non-competition covenant under  the  Asset  Purchase
Agreement between Buyer and Seller dated as of January 3, 2002.
If Seller elects the LDs remedy set forth in clause (i) of this
paragraph  (a),  such  remedy shall be in  lieu  of  all  other
remedies at law or in equity.

      Date of breach:                      Liquidated Damage Amount:
      --------------                       ------------------------

      After the 5th and prior to the end
       of the 10th Contract Year              $ 5,000,000

The parties agree that the LDs are not unconscionable, will not
constitute a conversion by or unjust enrichment of Seller,  and
were bargained for and derived through mutual negotiations  and
constitute  a  material and integral part of,  this  Agreement;
provided  however, that such LDs shall in no event be  used  as
evidence  of any agreement as to the minimum amount of  damages
suffered by Seller in the event of a Buyer Breach regardless of
the time of the occurrence thereof.

;  and  (b)  if a Buyer Breach occurs from and after the  tenth
(10th)  anniversary  of  the Effective Date,  Buyer  shall  pay
Seller its actual damages for such breach.  In addition to  the
remedy  set forth in this paragraph (b), Seller may, but  shall
in no event be required to, terminate this Agreement.


16.3   Damages for Seller's Breach.  In the event of a material
breach  of this Agreement by Seller, which breach Seller  fails
to  cure within thirty (30) days of written notice thereof from
Buyer (or, if such cure is not possible within such thirty (30)
days but has been commenced and is being diligently pursued  by
such  longer period of time by Seller, then such longer  period
as  shall be necessary), Buyer may terminate this Agreement  in
addition to any other remedies it may have.
