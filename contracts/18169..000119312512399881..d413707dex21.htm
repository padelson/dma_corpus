purposes, such amount is treated as consideration for the assets of DPF). The

in obtaining or retaining business for, or with, or directing business to, any
Person; or (iii) where such payment or thing of value would constitute a
bribe, kickback or illegal or improper payment or gift to assist any Acquired
Entity in obtaining or retaining business for, or with, or directing business
to, any Person.

 

(b) Each Acquired Entity has adopted (either directly or indirectly by
adoption thereof by Dole for itself and its subsidiaries) and observes
policies prohibiting the use of underage labor, slave labor and human
trafficking in connection with the Business and requires the same of each
critical supplier to the Business. To Doles Knowledge, there is
no Proceeding pending or threatened in writing involving any Acquired Entity
or the Business alleging any use of underage labor, slave labor or human
trafficking in connection with the Business.

 

(c) Each Acquired Entity is in material compliance with applicable Legal
Requirements prohibiting false, misleading or other similar deceptive
labeling practices, and there is no pending or, to Doles Knowledge,
threatened-in-writing Proceeding involving any Acquired Entity or the Business
alleging a violation of any such applicable Legal Requirements. 

4.24 _Disclosure_. As of their respective dates, Doles Annual Report on Form
10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011, and Doles Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 16, 2012, as filed with the
SEC and in each case including financial statements, exhibits and all other
information incorporated by reference therein, (i) complied as to form in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the
Securities Act and (ii) did not contain any untrue statement of a material
fact, or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements made therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

SECTION 5

PRE-CLOSING COVENANTS

The Parties agree as follows with respect to the period between the execution
of this Agreement and the Closing:

5.1 _General_. Each of the Parties will use its commercially reasonable
efforts to take all actions and to do all things necessary, proper or
advisable in order to consummate and make effective the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including the satisfaction, but not waiver, of
the Closing conditions set forth in Section 7 below). 

5.2 _Intercompany Agreements_.

 



23 (a) Except as otherwise agreed by the Parties in writing, Dole
shall consummate, and shall cause its Affiliates to consummate, the following
transactions prior to the Closing Date, in each case subject to and in
accordance with the other provisions of this Section 5.2:

 

(i) Dole shall cause DAL to be incorporated in accordance with Section 2.1(a),
with the particulars of DAL upon establishment to be as notified by ITOCHU to
Dole in writing as soon as reasonably practicable after the date hereof, but
in no event later than seven (7) Business Days after the date hereof. Dole
shall obtain ITOCHUs written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) prior to adopting or filing with any Governmental
Authority, or making any subsequent amendments or other changes to, any
memorandum of association, articles of association, charter, by-laws or other
constitutional or organizational documents of DAL.

(ii) Dole shall, or shall cause its appropriate Affiliate to, (x) take all
such actions as are necessary to transfer, convey, assign, grant, set over and
deliver to DAL or one of the Acquired Entities (other than DPF or its
subsidiary) the equity interests of each entity as set forth on  _Schedule
5.2(a)(ii)_ (the " _Transferred Equity Interests_ "), such that DAL or such
other Acquired Entity, as set forth on _Schedule 5.2(a)(ii)_ , will acquire
all of the assigning partys legal right, title, and interest in and to such
Transferred Equity Interests (in each case free and clear of any restrictions
on transfers, Liens, claims, options, warrants, purchase rights, Contracts,
commitments or demands, except as set forth on _Schedule 4.5_ ), and (y)
sign, execute, make and do all such deeds, documents, agreements, acts and
things as are necessary to accomplish the foregoing (such deed, documents and
agreements, the " _Intercompany Equity Agreements_ "). 

(iii) Dole shall ensure that the transfers of the Transferred Equity Interests
under Section 5.2(a)(ii) are effected such that, as of the Closing, the
ownership and holding structure of the Acquired Entities shall be as set forth
in _Schedule 5.2(a)(iii)_ , provided, however, that Dole may make changes to
the structure set forth in _Schedule 5.2(a)(iii)_ , after providing notice to
ITOCHU of such changes and reasonably discussing such changes with ITOCHU,
provided that such changes do not adversely affect ITOCHU; provided, further,
that reasonably in advance of the Closing, Dole may only make any further
changes to the structure set forth in _Schedule 5.2(a)(iii)_ with the prior
written consent of ITOCHU, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.2(a)(iii)
to the contrary, no such changes to the structure set forth in _Schedule
5.2(a)(iii)_ shall intermingle any U.S. entities or assets with any non-U.S.
entities or assets.

 

(iv) Dole shall, or shall cause its appropriate Affiliate to, (x) take all
such actions as are necessary to transfer, convey, assign, grant, set over
and deliver to DAL or one of the Acquired Entities (other than DPF or its
subsidiary) the assets and Contracts set forth on _Schedule 5.2(a)(iv)_ , such
that DAL or such other Acquired Entity, as set forth on _Schedule 5.2(a)(iv)_
, will acquire all of the

 



24  assigning partys legal right, title, and interest in and to such assets and
Contracts, and (y) sign, execute, make and do all such deeds, documents,
agreements, acts and things as are reasonably necessary to accomplish the
foregoing (such deed, documents and agreements, the " _Intercompany Asset
Agreements_ ").

(v) Dole shall, or shall cause its appropriate Affiliate (other than any
Acquired Entity) to, take all such actions as are necessary to transfer,
convey, assign, grant, set over and deliver to DAL and DPF, respectively, the
DAL IP and the DPF IP identified in _Schedule 5.2(a)(v)_ hereto and in Exhibit
D to the Brand Agreement (collectively, the " _Assigned Intellectual Property
Rights_ "), such that DAL and DPF, as applicable, will acquire all of the
assigning partys right, title, and interest in and to such Assigned
Intellectual Property Rights, the same to be held by the transferee thereof,
as fully and entirely as the same would have been held and enjoyed by the
assigning party if such assignment of the Assigned Intellectual Property
Rights had not been made, and to sign, execute, make and do all such deeds,
documents, agreements, acts and things as are necessary to accomplish the
foregoing (such deeds, documents and agreements, collectively with the
Intercompany Equity Agreements and the Intercompany Asset Agreements, the "
_Intercompany Agreements_ ").

 

(vi) Dole shall enter into the Brand Agreement with DAL and DPF.

 

(vii) In effecting the transactions contemplated by this Section 5.2, and
except as may be required to consummate such transactions in compliance
herewith Dole shall not, and shall not permit any of its Affiliates to,
transfer any Liabilities to or assets from the Acquired Entities, except Cash
and Cash Equivalents.

 

(b) Dole shall ensure that the Intercompany Agreements are consistent with the
provisions of this Section 5.2. Dole shall, if requested by ITOCHU, provide
drafts of the Intercompany Agreements for ITOCHUs review.

(c) It is the Parties intent that at the Closing and as of the Closing Date,
(i) each Acquired Entity shall have no Indebtedness for Borrowed Money or Cash
and Cash Equivalents and (ii) the Acquired Entities, on the one hand, and Dole
and its Affiliates (other than the Acquired Entities), on the other hand,
shall each cancel or otherwise eliminate all intercompany payables to and
receivables from the other (whether trade, note or other intercompany payables
or receivables), in each case for no consideration, such that no such
receivables to or payables from the other exist as of the Closing Date.
Promptly following the Closing, (x) to the extent that there is excess Cash
and Cash Equivalents in any Acquired Entity as of the Closing, ITOCHU shall
pay to Dole an aggregate amount equal to such excess Cash and Cash Equivalents
for all Acquired Entities and (y) to the extent that any Acquired Entity has
any outstanding Indebtedness for Borrowed Money as of the Closing, Dole shall
pay to ITOCHU an aggregate amount equal to such outstanding Indebtedness for
Borrowed Money for all Acquired Entities.

 



25 5.3 _Notices and Consents_. Dole will cause DAL and DPF to give any notices to
third parties, and will obtain any third-party consents set forth on
_Schedule 5.3_.

5.4 _Removal of Liens_. At or prior to the Closing Dole shall obtain the Lien
Releases.

5.5 _Operation of Business_. Except as specifically contemplated herein or in
the other Transaction Documents, and except in connection with the completion
of the transactions contemplated by Section 5.2 in compliance with Section
5.2, Dole shall procure that the Acquired Entities will conduct the Business
in the Ordinary Course of Business. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, except as specifically contemplated herein or in the other
Transaction Documents, or except in connection with the completion of the
transactions contemplated by Section 5.2 in compliance with Section 5.2, Dole
will not cause or permit any Acquired Entity to, without the prior written
consent of ITOCHU in each instance, which may not be unreasonably conditioned,
withheld or delayed: (a) declare, set aside or pay any dividend or make any
distribution with respect to its capital stock or redeem, purchase or
otherwise acquire any of its capital stock; (b) transfer any material assets
to Dole or any Related Party; (c) increase or modify the compensation or
benefits granted to any employee (except for changes in compensation or
benefits in the Ordinary Course of Business or pursuant to Contracts existing
as of the date of this Agreement); (d) make any change in the accounting
methods or practices followed by any Acquired Entity other than in a manner
consistent with GAAP; (e) except in connection with the completion of the
transactions contemplated by Section 5.2 in compliance with Section 5.2, make
or change any material Tax election, file any material amended Tax Return,
enter into any material closing agreement, settle any material Tax claim or
assessment, knowingly surrender any right to claim a material Tax refund, or
consent to the extension or waiver of the limitations period applicable to any
material Tax claim or assessment, provided, however, that nothing in this
Section 5.5(e) shall limit in any way Doles ability to take such actions
with respect to the consolidated, combined or unitary Tax Returns of Dole and
its subsidiaries, unless such actions would have a material adverse effect on
any Acquired Entity or would result in material additional Tax Liabilities for
any Acquired Entity for any Post-Closing Tax Period; (f) commence or settle
any Proceeding involving payment or receipt of more than $5 million; or (g)
take any action that, if taken after the Most Recent Fiscal Quarter End, would
be required to be disclosed on _Schedule 4.7_ in order to make the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 4.7 true and correct as of
the Closing Date.

5.6 _Full Access; Cooperation_. Dole will permit, and shall cause the Acquired
Entities to permit, upon reasonable advance written notice, representatives of
ITOCHU (including legal counsel and accountants) to have access, in a manner
so as not to unreasonably interfere with the normal business operations of the
Acquired Entities, to all premises, properties, personnel, books, records
(including Tax records but only to the extent reasonably relevant to the
Business and provided that nothing herein shall grant ITOCHU access to any
income Tax Return of Dole except to the extent that such income Tax Returns
contain a pro forma income Tax Return related solely to the
Business), contracts and documents of or pertaining to the Acquired Entities
or the Business, and subject to Doles prior approval, which approval will not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed, and subject to the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement, to the directors, officers, employees, customers
and suppliers of the Acquired Entities; provided, however, that any such
access or furnishing of information shall be conducted at ITOCHUs expense,
during normal business hours and under the supervision of such Acquired
Entitys personnel; and

 



26  provided further that access to such customers and suppliers shall be
subject to such reasonable procedures as may be agreed by the Parties. Without
limiting the foregoing, Dole agrees to reasonably cooperate with ITOCHU in
connection with ITOCHUs transition efforts with respect to the Business prior
to the Closing, including permitting ITOCHU and its representatives to conduct
training sessions for the employees of the Acquired Entities at such times
and in a manner coordinated with and reasonably acceptable to Dole.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Dole shall not be
required to disclose any information or permit any access to ITOCHU or its
Representatives if such disclosure would, in Doles reasonable judgment, (i)
jeopardize any attorney-client or other legal privilege or (ii) contravene any
applicable Legal Requirements, fiduciary duty or binding agreement
entered into prior to the date hereof.

5.7 _Notice of Developments_. Each Party will give prompt written notice to
the other Party of any breach of any of its representations and warranties in
Sections 3.1, 3.2 or 4 above, as applicable and the covenants in this Section
5\. Dole shall have the right from time to time prior to the Closing to
supplement or amend the Disclosure Schedules, and ITOCHU shall have the right
from time to time prior to the Closing to supplement or amend _Schedule 3.2_ ,
in each case with respect to events or conditions arising or discovered after
the date hereof and prior to Closing which, if existing or known at the date
of this Agreement, would have been required or permitted to be set forth or
described in the Disclosure Schedules (in the case of Dole) or _Schedule 3.2_
(in the case of ITOCHU); provided, however, that a Party shall not have the
right to supplement or amend the Disclosure Schedules (in the case of Dole) or
_Schedule 3.2_ (in the case of ITOCHU) pursuant to the foregoing with respect
to events or conditions that existed prior to the date hereof but discovered
after the date hereof and prior to the Closing unless such Party could not
have discovered such events or conditions prior to the date of this Agreement
without unreasonable investigation. Any such supplemental or amended
disclosure shall be deemed to have cured any breach of any representation or
warranty made in this Agreement for purposes of the indemnification provided
for herein, but shall not be deemed to have cured any such breach of
representation or warranty for purposes of determining whether or not the
conditions set forth in Section 7 have been satisfied. If prior to the
Closing, a Party shall have Knowledge that any breach of a representation or
warranty of the other Party has occurred (other than through notice from such
breaching Party), the Party with such Knowledge shall promptly so notify the
breaching Party, in reasonable detail. Nothing in this Agreement, including
this Section 5.7, shall imply that any Party is making any representation or
warranty as of any date other than the date of this Agreement and as of the
Closing, as set forth above.

 

5.8 _Exclusivity_.

(a) Dole agrees that it shall not, and that it shall direct its
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit or
knowingly encourage any inquiries, proposals or offers with respect to, or
the making or completion of, an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) engage or
participate in any negotiations concerning, or provide or cause to be provided
any non-public information or data relating to any portion of the Business or
any Acquired Entity in connection with, an Acquisition Proposal, (iii)
approve, endorse or recommend any Acquisition Proposal or (iv) approve,
endorse or recommend, or execute or enter into any letter of intent, agreement
in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement or other similar
agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal.

 



27  Dole agrees that it will immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any Persons conducted
heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. Furthermore, neither the
Dole board of directors nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw or modify
in a manner adverse to ITOCHU, or publicly propose to withdraw or modify in a
manner adverse to ITOCHU, its recommendation of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, or (ii) approve or recommend, or publicly
propose to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal (any of such
actions, an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ "). 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 5.8(a):

 

(i) At any time prior to obtaining Stockholder Approval, Dole may, in response
to an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that did not result
from a breach of Section 5.8(a) and that the Dole board of directors
determines in good faith constitutes or may reasonably be expected to lead to
a Superior Proposal, (x) furnish information with respect to Dole and its
subsidiaries, the Business or any Acquired Entity to the Person making such
Acquisition Proposal pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement on
terms substantially similar to those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement (except for such changes specifically necessary in
order for Dole to be able to comply with its obligations under this
Agreement); provided, however, that Dole shall promptly (and in any event
within forty-eight (48) hours) provide to ITOCHU any material non-public
information concerning the Business or any Acquired Entity that is provided to
such Person to the extent not previously provided to ITOCHU, and (y)
participate in discussions or negotiations with such Person and its
Representatives regarding such Acquisition Proposal.

(ii) At any time prior to obtaining Stockholder Approval, the Dole board of
directors or any committee thereof may (x) effect an Adverse Recommendation
Change if the Dole board of directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel that the failure of it or
any committee thereof to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change would be
inconsistent with the Dole board of directors exercise of its fiduciary
duties, and the Dole board of directors or any committee thereof may only so
effect an Adverse Recommendation Change if Dole also simultaneously (y)
terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1(d)(ii); provided, however,
that prior to taking any such action:

 

a) Dole shall notify ITOCHU in writing, at least five (5) days (the " _Notice
Period_ ") before making an Adverse Recommendation Change and terminating
this Agreement, of its intention to take such action, which notice shall, (1)
expressly state that Dole has received an Acquisition Proposal that is a
Superior Proposal and that the Dole board of directors intends to make an
Adverse Recommendation Change and terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
10.1(d)(ii), (2) identify the Person making such Superior Proposal, and (3)
include a copy of the most 

 



28  current version of the proposed agreement (or other transaction document)
relating to such Superior Proposal;

 

b) Dole shall, during the Notice Period, negotiate with ITOCHU in good faith
to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement such
that such Acquisition Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal if
ITOCHU, in its sole discretion, proposes to make such adjustments; and

 

c) Doles board of directors shall determine in good faith, after consulting
with outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that such Acquisition
Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal even after taking into
account any adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement agreed
to by ITOCHU during the Notice Period,

 

provided, further, that if, as of the end of the Notice Period, ITOCHU has not
agreed in writing to the terms and conditions described above that would
cause such Acquisition Proposal to cease to constitute a Superior Proposal,
then Dole shall have no further obligations to ITOCHU under clauses (a)
through (c) of the foregoing proviso and may proceed with its right to effect
an Adverse Recommendation Change and terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 10.1(d)(ii). Notwithstanding any other provision herein to the
contrary, Dole may terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1(d)(ii)
only if it concurrently effects an Adverse Recommendation Change in
accordance with this Section 5.8(b)(ii).

(iii) Dole or the Dole board of directors may (x) take and disclose to its
stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item
1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act (or make any
similar communication to stockholders in connection with the making or
amendment of a tender offer or exchange offer) or (y) make any required
disclosure to Doles stockholders, in each case, if in the good faith judgment
of the Dole board of directors, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, failure to do so would reasonably be expected to violate its
obligations under applicable Legal Requirements.

(iv) It is understood and agreed that any determination or action by the Dole
board of directors permitted under this Section 5.8(b) or Section 10.1(d)(ii)
shall not be deemed to be a breach of Section 5.8(a).

(c) Dole promptly (and in any event within 48 hours) shall advise ITOCHU
orally and in writing of any written Acquisition Proposal that is reasonably
likely to lead to a Superior Proposal, including in each case the identity of
the Person making any such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or request and the
material terms of any such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or request. Dole
shall keep ITOCHU fully informed, on a reasonably current basis, of the status
and material terms of any such Acquisition Proposal, including any material
amendments or proposed amendments to the material terms thereof.

 



29 5.9 _Confidentiality_. The Parties shall adhere to the provisions
regarding Confidential Information set forth in the Confidentiality
Agreement.

5.10 _Competition Filings_. Subject to the terms and conditions provided in
this Agreement, each Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
take promptly, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do promptly, or cause
to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to file with the
relevant Governmental Authorities overseeing competition or merger control
issues in each relevant jurisdiction (including the U.S. Federal Trade
Commission and the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice), all
relevant documents, filings, and other materials required or requested by
those Governmental Authorities. Dole and ITOCHU each shall promptly supply the
other with any documents or information which may be reasonably required to be
exchanged in order to effectuate such filings, provided, however, that
disclosure of such documents or information may be limited to outside counsel
of the receiving Party at the discretion of the disclosing Party. Dole and
ITOCHU shall use commercially reasonable efforts to facilitate and expedite
the identification and resolution of any issues arising under the Antitrust
Laws at the earliest practicable dates. Such commercially reasonable efforts
and cooperation include each Partys agreement (i) to keep each
other appropriately informed of communications from and to personnel of the
reviewing Governmental Authorities, and (ii) to confer with each other
regarding appropriate contacts with and response to personnel of such
Governmental Authorities and the content of any such contacts or
presentations, in each case unless prohibited by applicable law. Unless
prohibited by the applicable Governmental Authority, each of ITOCHU and Dole
shall promptly inform the other of any oral communication with, and provide
copies of written communications with, any relevant Governmental Authority
regarding any such filings in advance of such communications. No Party shall
independently participate in any formal meeting with any Governmental
Authority in respect of any such filings, investigation or other inquiry
without giving the other Party prior notice of the meeting or telephone call
and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, the opportunity
to attend and/or participate. Subject to applicable Legal Requirements, the
Parties will consult and cooperate with one another in connection with any
analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions
and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any Party hereto relating
to proceedings under any federal, national, state or foreign statutes, rules,
regulations, orders, decrees, administrative or judicial doctrines or other
laws (including the HSR Act) that are designed to prohibit, restrict or
regulate actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint
of trade (collectively, the " _Antitrust Laws_ ").

5.11 _Resignations_. Dole shall cause each director and officer of each
Acquired Entity (other than those whom ITOCHU shall have specified in writing
at least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing), to resign effective as
of the Closing.

5.12 _Preparation of Proxy Statement; Stockholders  Meeting_. 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, Dole shall, with the assistance of ITOCHU, prepare the Proxy
Statement and file the Proxy Statement with the SEC. Dole and ITOCHU will
cooperate with each other in the preparation of the Proxy Statement, including
by providing drafts thereof. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, ITOCHU will furnish to Dole the

 



30  information relating to it required by the Exchange Act to be set forth in
the Proxy Statement. Dole shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
resolve all SEC comments with respect to the Proxy Statement as promptly as
practicable after receipt thereof. Each of Dole and ITOCHU agree to correct
any information provided by it for use in the Proxy Statement which shall have
become false or misleading. Dole shall, as soon as reasonably practicable,
notify ITOCHU of the receipt of any comments from the SEC with respect to the
Proxy Statement and any request by the SEC for any amendment to the Proxy
Statement or for additional information and, in each case, provide ITOCHU
with copies thereof and drafts of any amendments to the Proxy Statement to be
filed in response thereto.

(b) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the clearance of the
Proxy Statement by the SEC, Dole, acting through its board of directors, shall
(i) take all action necessary to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a
meeting of its stockholders for the purpose of obtaining the Stockholder
Approval (the " _Stockholders Meeting_ ") and (ii) include in the Proxy
Statement the recommendation of the Dole board of directors that the Dole
stockholders vote in favor of the approval of this Agreement; provided,
however, that Dole shall be permitted to delay or postpone convening the
Stockholders Meeting (but not beyond the Termination Date) if in the good
faith judgment of the Dole board of directors or any committee thereof (after
consultation with outside legal counsel) any failure to delay or postpone
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law or
necessary to obtain the Stockholder Approval.

 

5.13 _Financial Statements_. In the event that the Closing has not occurred
prior to December 1, 2012, Dole shall deliver to ITOCHU the unaudited
combined balance sheet for the Business as at October 6, 2012 and the related
unaudited statements of income, equity and cash flows for the period then
ended, and such financial statements shall be included (in addition to and
not in replacement of those referred to in Section 4.6) in the " _Most Recent
Unaudited Financial Statements_ " and the " _Financial Statements_ " for
purposes of Section 4.6 as of the Closing Date.

5.14 _Acknowledgment by ITOCHU_. ITOCHU acknowledges that it has conducted
to its satisfaction an independent investigation and verification of the
financial condition, results of operations, assets, liabilities, properties
and projected operations and prospects of the Acquired Entities, and, in
making its determination to proceed with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, ITOCHU has relied solely
on the results of its own independent investigation and verification and the
representations and warranties of Dole expressly and specifically set forth
in Section 3.1 and Section 4, each as qualified by the attached Disclosure
Schedules. The representations and warranties by Dole expressly and
specifically set forth in Section 3.1 and Section 4, constitute the sole and
exclusive representations, warranties, and statements of any kind of Dole to
ITOCHU in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, and ITOCHU
understands, acknowledges and agrees that, except as may be set forth in the
other Transaction Documents, all other representations, warranties, and
statements of any kind or nature expressed or implied (including any relating
to the future or historical financial condition, results of operations,
prospects, assets or liabilities of the Acquired Entities, or the quality,
quantity or condition of the Acquired Entities assets) are specifically
disclaimed by Dole. ITOCHU SPECIFICALLY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT, EXCEPT
FOR 

 



31  THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF DOLE SET FORTH IN SECTION 3.1 AND
SECTION 4, AND EXCEPT AS MAY BE SET FORTH IN THE OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS,
NONE OF THE ACQUIRED ENTITIES, DOLE OR ANY OTHER PERSON (INCLUDING, ANY
STOCKHOLDER, OFFICER, DIRECTOR, EMPLOYEE OR AGENT OF ANY OF THE FOREGOING,
WHETHER IN ANY INDIVIDUAL, CORPORATE OR ANY OTHER CAPACITY) IS MAKING, AND
ITOCHU IS NOT RELYING ON, ANY REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, OR
OTHER STATEMENTS OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, AS TO ANY MATTER CONCERNING ANY ACQUIRED
ENTITIES, THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, OR THE
ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF ANY INFORMATION PROVIDED TO (OR OTHERWISE
ACQUIRED BY) ITOCHU OR ANY OF ITOCHUS REPRESENTATIVES.

 

SECTION 6

POST-CLOSING COVENANTS

The Parties agree as follows with respect to the period following the
Closing:

6.1 _General_. In case at any time after the Closing any further actions are
necessary or desirable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, each of the Parties will take all such commercially reasonable
further actions (including the execution and delivery of such further
instruments and documents) as the other Party may reasonably request, all at
the sole cost and expense of the requesting Party (unless the requesting Party
is entitled to indemnification therefor under Section 8 below).
Dole acknowledges and agrees that from and after the Closing, ITOCHU shall be
entitled to possession of all documents, books, records (excluding Tax
records, the treatment of which is provided in Section 9.7), agreements and
financial data of any sort in the possession of Dole after the Closing
relating to the Acquired Entities.

6.2 _Litigation Support_. In the event and for so long as a Party actively is
contesting or defending against any Proceeding in connection with (a) any
transaction contemplated under this Agreement or (b) any fact, situation,
circumstance, status, condition, activity, practice, plan, occurrence, event,
incident, action, failure to act or transaction on or prior to the Closing
Date involving any Acquired Entity or the Business, the other Party will
reasonably cooperate with it and its counsel in the contest or defense, make
available its (including to the extent applicable, the Acquired Entities)
personnel, and provide such testimony and access to its (including to the
extent applicable, the Acquired Entities) books and records as shall
be reasonably necessary in connection with the contest or defense, all at the
sole cost and expense of the contesting or defending Party (unless the
contesting or defending Party is entitled to indemnification therefor under
Section 8 below). 

6.3 _Transition_. Dole will not (and will not cause any Related Party to) take
any action that is intended to have the effect of discouraging any lessor,
licensor, customer, supplier or other business associate of any Acquired
Entity or the Business from maintaining the same business relationships with
the Business after the Closing as it maintained with the Business

 



32  prior to the Closing. Dole will refer all customer inquiries relating to the
Business to the Acquired Entities from and after the Closing.

 

6.4 _Post-Closing Confidentiality_. Dole agrees and acknowledges that, from
and after the Closing, all of the Confidential Information solely relating to
either any Acquired Entity or the Business (the " _Post-Closing Confidential
Information_ ") will be proprietary to and owned by the Acquired Entities, and
Dole shall treat and hold all such Post-Closing Confidential Information as
confidential; provided, that " _Post-Closing Confidential Information_ " shall
not include: (i) any information that is or has become generally available to
the public (other than as a result of disclosure by Dole in breach of this
Agreement or the Transaction Documents); (ii) any information that has been
independently developed by Dole or its Representatives after the Closing
entirely from sources other than the Post-Closing Confidential Information;
and (iii) information made available after the Closing to Dole or its
Representatives on a non-confidential basis by any third party not prohibited
from disclosing such information by a legal obligation to any other Person.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Dole may disclose Post-Closing Confidential
Information to the extent such disclosure is (x) required by Legal
Requirement, or legal process, including pursuant to the rules or regulations
of any national securities regulator or any listing agreement with, or the
rules or regulations of, any national securities exchange or national
quotation system on which any securities of Dole are listed or traded
(including any periodic reports to shareholders required by SEC or NYSE rules
or regulations) or (y) legally compelled to do so under the terms of a
subpoena, order, civil investigative demand or similar process issued by a
Governmental Authority. In the event that Dole or any of its Representative
is requested or required pursuant to written or oral question or request for
information or documents in any legal proceeding, interrogatory, subpoena,
civil investigative demand or similar process to disclose any Post-
Closing Confidential Information, Dole shall notify ITOCHU promptly of the
request or requirement so that ITOCHU may seek an appropriate protective order
or waive compliance with the provisions of this Section 6.4. If, in the
absence of a protective order or the receipt of a waiver hereunder, Dole or
any Representative of Dole is, on the advice of counsel, compelled to disclose
any Post-Closing Confidential Information to any Governmental Authority, Dole
or any such Dole Representative may disclose such Post-Closing Confidential
Information to such Governmental Authority; provided, however, that Dole or
such Representative of Dole, as applicable, shall use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain, at the request of ITOCHU, an order or other assurance that
confidential treatment will be accorded to such portion of the Post-Closing
Confidential Information required to be disclosed as ITOCHU shall designate.

6.5 _Employee Matters_.

(a) Without limiting any additional rights that any actively employed
employee of the Business (each a " _Business Employee_ ") may have under any
Employee Benefit Plan, ITOCHU shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the Acquired Entities, for the period commencing on the Closing Date
and ending twelve (12) months thereafter, to provide to the Business
Employees, compensation, employee benefits, vacation, sick leave and severance
(if any) that are comparable to the compensation, employee benefits,
vacation, sick leave and severance (if any) provided to such Business
Employees immediately prior to the Closing Date. As of the Closing Date,
ITOCHU will give Business Employees full credit for purposes of eligibility
and vesting 

 



33  and benefit accruals (but, other than with respect to the Acquired Entities
Benefit Plans, not for purposes of benefit accruals under any defined benefit
pension plans or other similar tax-qualified retirement plans), under any
employee compensation, incentive, and benefit (including vacation) plans,
programs, policies and arrangements maintained for the benefit of Business
Employees on and after the date of Closing by ITOCHU or any of its Affiliates
for the Business Employees service with Dole and the Acquired Entities and
their predecessor entities to the same extent recognized by Dole and/or the
Acquired Entities immediately prior to the Closing Date. As used herein,
"actively employed" means an employee of the Business who, on the Closing
Date, is actively at work, or absent from work on account of paid time off,
vacation, sick or personal leave, authorized leave of absence, or military
leave. 

(b) All Liabilities and assets relating to or in respect of the Business
Employees and the former employees of the Business under the tax-qualified
defined benefit pension plan maintained by Dole named the Consolidated
Retirement Plan for Dole Food Company, Inc., Plan No. 029 (the " _Dole U.S.
Pension Plan_ ") and the supplemental retirement and supplemental pension
plan named the Dole Food Company Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan and
the Dole Food Company, Inc. Excess Savings Plan (the " _Dole SERPs_ ") shall
continue to be Liabilities of Dole and Liabilities and assets of the Dole
U.S. Pension Plan and the Dole SERPs, as applicable, and Dole shall continue
to sponsor and administer, and be solely responsible for all Liabilities with
respect to, the Dole U.S. Pension Plan and the Dole SERPs for the benefit of
the Business Employees and the former employees of the Business; provided,
however, that ITOCHU shall pay Dole an amount equal to the aggregate unfunded
liability of Dole with respect to the Business Employees and the
former employees of the Business as at December 31, 2011, under the Dole U.S.
Pension Plan and the Dole SERPs, which shall be the amount confirmed by ITOCHU
in writing based upon the Financial Statements (the " _Pension Amount_
"), which confirmation shall be binding on all parties for all purposes under
this Agreement, or at ITOCHUs option exercised by written notice to Dole
prior to Closing, ITOCHU may choose to assume the Dole U.S. Pension Plan and
the Dole SERPs with respect to the Business Employees and the former
employees of the Business and accept the transfer of all assets and
liabilities in connection therewith, which option may only be exercised if
Dole and ITOCHU are able to mutually agree, prior to Closing, on the terms
and conditions of any such assumption. The Pension Amount shall either be paid
to Dole on the Closing Date in a lump sum of immediately available funds or,
in ITOCHUs discretion, in periodic installments over up to five (5) years
following the Closing Date, plus, if installment payments are elected,
interest accrued at a rate of 4.5% per annum, compounded annually. For the
avoidance of doubt, Dole may exercise, after the Closing Date, any or all of
its right to amend, modify or terminate any such plans.

(c) Effective immediately prior to the Closing Date, Dole shall cause the
Acquired Entities to withdraw as participating employers under the tax-
qualified defined contribution plans maintained by Dole named the 401(k) Plan
for Salaried Employees of Dole Food Company, Inc. and Participating Divisions
and Subsidiaries and the 401(k) Plan for Hourly Employees of Dole Food
Company, Inc. and Participating Divisions and Subsidiaries (the " _Dole 401(k)
Plans_ "), fully vest the Business Employees in their accounts under the
Dole 401(k) Plans.

 



34 (d) Effective as of the Closing Date, all Acquired Entities Benefit Plans for
the benefit of the Business Employees and former employees of the Business
shall continue to be maintained by the Acquired Entities subject to their
terms and applicable Legal Requirements (including any funding
responsibilities and related administrative duties).

(e) ITOCHU shall pay and be solely responsible for, and shall indemnify and
hold harmless Dole and its Affiliates (other than the Acquired Entities) for,
all severance rights or obligations related to any employee of the Business
(including, without limitation, under any change of control agreements),
whether or not such employee is or becomes a Business Employee, or otherwise
is or becomes an employee of ITOCHU or any of its Affiliates on or after the
Closing Date, arising after the Closing with respect to or on behalf of an
Acquired Entity, unless such severance right occurs solely as a result of a
termination of employment by Dole prior to the Closing or any other action
taken by Dole prior to the Closing (including the execution of this Agreement
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, in each case
standing alone without regard to any subsequent termination of employment).
ITOCHU may, in its sole discretion, enter into new Contracts providing for
severance and/or change of control benefits with any of the
Business Employees who are parties to change of control agreements with Dole,
so long as any such Contracts provide for a complete release of Dole from any
claims for severance or other benefits under the terms of the change of
control agreement between such Business Employee and Dole.

(f) On and after the Closing Date, the Employee Benefit Plans of Dole and
its Affiliates, other than the Acquired Entities Benefit Plans, including,
without limitation, any assets and Liabilities related thereto (including any
funding responsibilities and related administrative duties) shall be retained
by Dole and its Affiliates (other than the Acquired Entities); and Dole shall
indemnify and hold ITOCHU, the Acquired Entities and ITOCHUs Affiliates
harmless with respect to all Liabilities under or relating thereto. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Parties agree that all retiree medical and life
insurance benefits and Liabilities under the Dole Food Company, Inc. Retiree
Plan Under Age 65 and the Health and Welfare Plan for U.S. Salaried Retirees Age
65 and Older of Dole Food Company, Inc. and Participating Divisions and
Subsidiaries related to the Business Employees and former employees of the
Business shall continue to be retained by Dole and neither ITOCHU nor the
Acquired Entities will have any Liabilities relating thereto. Dole shall or
shall cause its Affiliates to maintain and administer all of the Employee
Benefit Plans of Dole and its Affiliates in accordance with their terms and in
compliance with all applicable Legal Requirements with the exception of the
full vesting requirement of Business Employees accounts under the Dole
401(k) Plans as provided in Section 6.5(c). For the avoidance of doubt, Dole
may exercise, after the Closing Date, any or all of its right to amend, modify
or terminate any such plans.

(g) ITOCHU shall or shall cause its Affiliates to maintain and administer all
of the Acquired Entities Benefit Plans in accordance with their terms and in
compliance with all applicable Legal Requirements. ITOCHU shall indemnify and
hold Dole harmless for any claims arising after the Closing Date under any of
the Acquired Entities Benefit Plans. In addition, ITOCHU and Dole shall
cooperate with each other in the

 



35  transition of the Acquired Entities Benefit Plans relating to the Business
Employees from Dole to ITOCHU. From and after the Closing Date, ITOCHU and
Dole shall also cooperate with each other and provide to each other any
information reasonably requested by Dole or ITOCHU in connection with any
Proceeding or other inquiry relating to the Business Employees and/or any of
the Acquired Entities Benefit Plans.

 

(h) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
Doles obligations under this Section 6.5 shall not be subject to the
limitations set forth in Section 8.2(b), nor shall any amount paid by Dole
pursuant to this Section 6.5 be counted towards any aggregate Liability limits
provided in Section 8.2(b). Notwithstanding any other provision in this
Agreement to the contrary, ITOCHUs obligations under this Section 6.5 shall
not be subject to the limitations set forth in Section 8.3(b), nor shall any
amounts paid by ITOCHU pursuant to this Section 6.5 be counted towards any
aggregate Liability limits provided for in Section 8.3(b)

6.6 _Access to Information_

(a) Upon prior advance written notice, Dole shall afford ITOCHU and its
officers, employees, agents, accountants, counsel and other representatives
reasonable access following the Closing to (i) all of Doles records
concerning the Acquired Entities and the Business, including the relevant
books and records and (ii) other information concerning the business,
properties and personnel (subject to restrictions imposed by applicable Legal
Requirement) of the Acquired Entities and the Business, in each case as shall
not have otherwise been delivered by Dole to ITOCHU prior to or at the
Closing, as ITOCHU may reasonably request; provided, however that Dole shall
have the right to exclude from any such records or information provided to
ITOCHU any information unrelated to the Acquired Entities or the Business.
No information or knowledge obtained in any investigation pursuant to this
Section 6.6 shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty
contained herein or the conditions to the obligations of the Parties to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby in accordance with the terms
and provisions hereof.

(b) Each Party shall, to the extent the other Party may reasonably request in
connection with any filing requirements under applicable securities laws: (i)
cooperate in good faith in the preparation of any such filing and (ii) make
personnel of such Party or its Affiliates reasonably available to assist in
the preparation of such filings. Dole acknowledges that ITOCHU may be required
to disclose financial statements and information concerning the Acquired
Entities in filings with relevant authorities (including but not limited to
the Prime Minister of Japan, the Financial Services Agency ( _Kinyucho_ ) of
Japan and the Tokyo Stock Exchange).

be included in calculating the aggregate Damages for purposes of this Section
8.3(b)(i) other than Damages in excess of $100,000 resulting from any single

8.4 _Mitigation; Knowledge_. Each of the Parties agrees that in the event of
any breach giving rise to an indemnification obligation under this Section 8,
the Indemnified Party shall take, and cause its Affiliates (including, with
respect to Dole before the Closing and ITOCHU after the Closing, the Acquired
Entities) to take, all reasonable measures to mitigate the consequences of the
related breach (including taking steps to prevent any contingent liability
from becoming an actual liability). In the event (a) ITOCHU proceeds with the
Closing

 



40  notwithstanding Knowledge by ITOCHU, at or prior to the date hereof, of any
breach by Dole of any representation, warranty or covenant in this Agreement,
no ITOCHU Indemnitee shall have any claim or recourse against Dole or any of
its Affiliates or Representatives with respect to such breach, under this
Section 8 or otherwise and (b) ITOCHU proceeds with the Closing
notwithstanding Knowledge by ITOCHU, arising between the date hereof and the
Closing, of any breach by Dole of any representation, warranty or covenant in
this Agreement, no ITOCHU Indemnitee shall have any claim or recourse against
Dole or any of its Affiliates or Representatives with respect to such breach,
under this Section 8 or otherwise, unless the conditions set forth in Section
7.1(a) and (b) shall be capable of being satisfied at the Closing despite the
existence of such breach.

 

8.5 _Exclusive Remedy; No Consequential Damages_. Each Party acknowledges and
agrees that, from and after the Closing, and except in the case of fraud or
intentional misrepresentation, its sole and exclusive remedy against the other
Party with respect to any and all claims relating (directly or indirectly) to
a breach of this Agreement (other than any breach of Section 6.5 or Section
9), regardless of the law or legal theory under which such liability or
obligation may be sought to be imposed, whether sounding in contract or tort,
or whether at law or in equity, or otherwise, shall be pursuant to the
provisions set forth in this Section 8 and Section 11.9. For the avoidance of
doubt, the foregoing shall not prevent a Party from asserting its rights under
Section 11.15 to enforce specifically this Agreement and the terms and
provisions hereof. The Parties hereto agree that the provisions in this
Agreement relating to indemnification, and the limits imposed on each Partys
remedies with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby (including Sections 8.1, 8.2, 8.3 and this 8.5) were specifically
bargained for between sophisticated parties and were specifically taken into
account in the determination of the amounts to be paid hereunder.
Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary in this Agreement,
neither Party shall be liable hereunder to the other Party for special,
punitive or indirect damages, lost profits, revenues or income, diminution in
value or loss of business reputation or opportunity (except to the extent
actually paid to an unrelated third party) resulting from such first Partys
breach of this Agreement, and no "multiple of profits" or "multiple of cash
flow" or similar valuation methodology shall be used in calculating the amount
of any Damages.

8.6 _Termination of Indemnification_. The obligations to indemnify and hold
harmless a Party hereto in respect of a breach of representation or warranty
or covenant shall terminate when the applicable representation or warranty, or
covenant or agreement, expires pursuant to Section 8.1; provided, however,
that such obligations to indemnify and hold harmless shall not terminate with
respect to any item as to which the Indemnified Party shall have, prior to the
expiration of the applicable period, previously made a claim by delivering a
written notice (stating in reasonable detail the nature of, and factual and
legal basis for, any such claim for indemnification, and the provisions of
this Agreement upon which such claim for indemnification is made) to the
Indemnifying Party. In order to determine the validity and/or the amount of
any such claim, Dole and ITOCHU, as applicable, shall provide the
Indemnifying Party and their Representatives reasonable access to (a) all
books, records and other documents (including work papers, memoranda and
financial statements) relating to or containing information relevant to such
claim and (b) the Acquired Entities employees, accountants and other
professional advisors (including making their respective chief financial
officer, accountants and attorneys available to respond to reasonable written
or oral inquiries of the Indemnifying

 



41  Party and their representatives); provided that neither Party shall be
required to disclose any information or permit any access to the Indemnifying
Party or its Representatives if such disclosure would, (x) jeopardize any
attorney-client or other legal privilege or (y) contravene any applicable
Legal Requirements, fiduciary duty or binding agreement. Claims asserted
pursuant to this Section 8 shall be based on a reasonable determination that
a breach entitled to indemnification hereunder has occurred and/or based on a
cause of action or claim that has actually been asserted by a third party,
and, for the avoidance of doubt, absent such reasonable determination or
third party cause of action or claim, not otherwise in respect of potential
Damages that have not yet occurred or otherwise been suffered.

8.7 _Matters Involving Third Parties._

(a) If any third party notifies any Party (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") with
respect to any matter (a " _Third-Party Claim_ ") that may give rise to a
claim for indemnification against any other Party (the " _Indemnifying Party_
") under this Section 8, then the Indemnified Party shall as promptly as
reasonably possible after receipt of notice of the Third Party Claim (but in
no event later than ten (10) Business Days after receipt by the Indemnified
Party of notice of the Third Party Claim) notify the Indemnifying Party
thereof in writing, and in reasonable detail, of the Third-Party Claim;
provided, however, that no delay on the part of the Indemnified Party
in notifying any Indemnifying Party shall relieve the Indemnifying Party from
any obligation hereunder unless (and then solely to the extent) the
Indemnifying Party is thereby prejudiced. Thereafter, the Indemnified Party
shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party, within five (5) Business Days after
the Indemnified Partys receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents
(including court papers) received by the Indemnified Party relating to the
Third-Party Claim.

 

(b) An Indemnifying Party will have the right to assume and control the
defense of the Indemnified Party against the Third-Party Claim with counsel
of its choice reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party so long as (i)
the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party in writing within
fifteen (15) days after the Indemnified Party has given notice of the Third-
Party Claim that the Indemnifying Party will indemnify the Indemnified Party
from and against the entirety of any Damages the Indemnified Party may suffer
resulting from, arising out of, relating to, in the nature of or caused
by the Third-Party Claim and (ii) the Third-Party Claim involves only money
Damages and does not seek an injunction or other equitable relief.

(c) So long as the Indemnifying Party is conducting the defense of the Third-
Party Claim in accordance with Section 8.7(b) above, (i) the Indemnified Party
may retain separate co-counsel at its sole cost and expense and participate
in the defense of the Third-Party Claim, (ii) the Indemnified Party will not
consent to the entry of any judgment on or enter into any settlement with
respect to the Third-Party Claim without the prior written consent of the
Indemnifying Party and (iii) the Indemnifying Party will not consent to the
entry of any judgment on or enter into any settlement with respect to the
Third-Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party
(not to be unreasonably withheld).

 



42 (d) In the event any of the conditions in Section 8.7(b) above is or becomes
unsatisfied, however, (i) the Indemnified Party may defend against, and
consent to the entry of any judgment on or enter into any settlement with
respect to, the Third-Party Claim in any manner it may deem appropriate (and
the Indemnified Party shall consult with, but shall not need to obtain any
consent from, the Indemnifying Party prior to consenting to any judgment or
the entry into any settlement in connection therewith), (ii) the Indemnifying
Party will reimburse the Indemnified Party promptly and periodically for the
costs of defending against the Third-Party Claim (including reasonable
attorneys fees and expenses) and (iii) the Indemnifying Party will remain
responsible for any Damages the Indemnified Party may suffer resulting from,
arising out of, relating to, in the nature of or caused by the Third-Party
Claim to the fullest extent provided in this Section 8\.

 

8.8 _Determination of Damages_. The amount of any and all Damages under this
Section 8 (including all Tax claims) and Section 9 shall be determined net of
(a) any Tax benefits realized by any party seeking indemnification hereunder
arising from such Damages and (b) any amounts recovered by the Indemnified
Party under insurance policies, indemnities (other than pursuant to this
Agreement) or other reimbursement arrangements with respect to such Damages.
Each Party hereby waives, to the extent permitted under its applicable
insurance policies, any subrogation rights that its insurer may have with
respect to any indemnifiable Damages. All indemnification payments under this
Agreement shall be deemed adjustments to the Purchase Price.

(a) Dole shall be responsible (and shall indemnify and hold the Acquired
Entities and ITOCHU harmless) for the prompt and timely payment and
satisfaction of any and all (i) Taxes of Dole whenever arising (other than
Taxes for which ITOCHU is liable pursuant to the second sentence of this
paragraph), (ii) Taxes of the Acquired Entities, the Business, the DAL IP and
the DPF IP, in each case for all taxable periods ending on or before the
Closing Date, and Taxes of the Acquired Entities, the Business, the DAL IP and
the DPF IP, in each case for all periods that begin before and end after the
Closing Date (" _Straddle Periods_ "), to the extent attributable to the
portion of the Straddle Period ending at the close of business on the Closing
Date (such periods being referred to as, the " _Pre-Closing Tax Periods_ ");
provided that Dole shall not be required to indemnify ITOCHU for any Taxes
resulting from any transaction outside the Ordinary Course of Business
undertaken on the Closing Date after the Closing, and (iii) Taxes arising as
a result of the transactions contemplated by Section 5.2. ITOCHU shall be
responsible for all Taxes of the Acquired Entities (other than as set forth in
the preceding sentence) for all taxable periods (or, with respect to Straddle
Periods, any portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date (the " _Post-
Closing Tax Period_ ").

 

(b) Unless prohibited by applicable Legal Requirements, the Parties shall
cause the taxable period of the Acquired Entities to close as of the close of
business on

 



43  the Closing Date. In the case of any Straddle Period, the amount of any
Taxes (including income Taxes) attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period and
attributable to the Post-Closing Tax Period shall be determined based on an
interim closing of the books as of the Closing Date, except that Taxes that
are calculated on a periodic or annual basis (such as real and personal
property Taxes) shall be allocated on a daily basis; provided that, (i) any
increase in property Taxes that result from the reassessment of the property
as a result of the transactions contemplated by Section 5.2 shall be allocated
to Dole, and (ii) any increase in property Taxes that result from
the reassessment of the property as a result of the transfers contemplated by
Section 2.1(c) shall be allocated to ITOCHU.

 

9.2 _Tax Returns_. Dole will be responsible for, and will cause to be prepared
and duly filed, all Tax Returns of the Acquired Entities that are required to
be filed on or before the Closing Date, and all consolidated, combined and
unitary Tax Returns that include Dole and any Subsidiary of Dole (other than
DAL and its subsidiaries) for any period (including any Tax Returns that
relate to items of the Acquired Entities and the Business that are required to
be reported on such consolidated, combined, or unitary Tax Returns as required
by applicable Legal Requirements), and Dole shall pay any Taxes due in respect
of such Tax Returns for which it is liable under Section 9.1. ITOCHU shall
prepare or shall cause to be prepared all Tax Returns of the Acquired Entities
(other than Tax Returns that are prepared by Dole pursuant to the first
sentence of this Section 9.2) that are required to be filed after the Closing
Date (including with respect to Straddle Periods) and shall pay all Taxes
shown as due on those Tax Returns (provided that Dole shall be responsible for
the payment of any such Taxes to the extent they are attributable to the Pre-
Closing Tax Periods). All Tax Returns with respect to any period ending on or
before the Closing Date or any Straddle Period that are prepared pursuant to
this Section 9.2 shall be prepared in a manner consistent with similar Tax
Returns heretofore filed by or with respect to the Acquired Entities, except
as required by applicable Legal Requirements. ITOCHU shall provide Dole with
drafts of all Tax Returns prepared by it pursuant to this Section 9.2, to the
extent such Tax Returns reflect a Tax Liability for which Dole is responsible
under this Agreement or reflects a Tax refund to which Dole is entitled under
this Agreement, no later than thirty (30) days prior to the due date thereof.
Dole shall have the right to review and provide comments on such Tax Returns
during the fifteen (15) day period following the receipt of such Tax Returns.
Dole and ITOCHU shall consult with each other and attempt in good faith
to resolve any issues arising as a result of any such Tax Returns, and, if
they are unable to do so, the disputed items shall be resolved (within a
reasonable time, taking into account the deadline for filing such Tax Return)
by an internationally recognized independent accounting firm chosen by both
Dole and ITOCHU. Upon resolution of all such items, the relevant Tax Return
shall be timely filed on that basis. The costs, fees and expenses of such
accounting firm shall be borne equally by Dole and ITOCHU.

9.3 _Amended Tax Returns_. Neither ITOCHU nor any Affiliate of ITOCHU shall
(or shall cause or permit any of the Acquired Entities to) amend, refile or
otherwise modify any Tax Return relating in whole or in part to the Acquired
Entities or the Business with respect to any taxable year or period ending on
or before the Closing Date, or which includes the Closing Date, without the
prior written consent of Dole, not to be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or
delayed (which will be deemed unreasonable in the event that the related
amendment, re-filing or modification of a Tax Return is required by
applicable Legal Requirements).

 



44 9.4 _Tax Refunds._

 

(a) Any Taxes of the Acquired Entities or their Affiliates with respect to any
Pre-Closing Tax Periods that are (i) refunded to ITOCHU or any of its
Affiliates (including the Acquired Entities) after the Closing Date or (ii)
credited against a Tax Liability of ITOCHU or any of its Affiliates (including
the Acquired Entities), shall, net of any Taxes incurred in respect of the
receipt or accrual of such refund or credit and net of any other third party,
out-of pocket expenses attributable thereto, promptly be paid over to Dole;
provided, however, that the foregoing shall not apply to any refunds or
credits of value added Taxes (other than any refunds or credits of value
added Taxes that are paid by Dole after the Closing pursuant to the indemnity
provisions of this Agreement), which refunds and credits may be retained by
ITOCHU and its Affiliates (including the Acquired Entities) without the need
to make any payments to Dole in respect thereof, provided further that it is
understood that Dole shall not be liable to ITOCHU or any of its Affiliates
(including the Acquired Entities) if such refunds or credits of value added
Taxes are not received or obtained by ITOUCHU or its Affiliates (including the
Acquired Entities) . Dole shall have the right to determine whether any claim
for refund or credits of Taxes (other than value added Taxes) shall be made
by or on behalf of the Acquired Entities with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax
Period and to control proceedings with respect to such claims and, if Dole
elects to make such a claim and prosecute such claim, ITOCHU shall (and shall
cause the Acquired Entities to) cooperate at Doles expense in connection
therewith, including the preparation of any Tax Return that is required to be
filed by ITOCHU or the Acquired Entities in connection with such claim.
Without limiting Doles obligations under Section 5.6 and Section 6.6(a) and
without limiting Doles rights to refunds or credits under this Section 9.4:

(x) On or before the Closing Date, Dole shall provide to ITOCHU such
information (including documentation, if any, related thereto) as ITOCHU may
reasonably request as to any refunds or credits that are anticipated or
expected to be received or obtained following Closing and are required to be
paid over to Dole pursuant to this Section 9.4; and

(y) On or before the Closing Date, Dole shall provide to ITOCHU a list of (i)
each Tax asset or receivable that is expected to be carried on the books of
each Acquired Entity as of Closing on account of any such expected refund or
credit (identifying the approximate relevant amount and nature of such refund
or credit), and (ii) a list of any estimated or prepaid Tax that is expected
to be paid or incurred, or has been paid or incurred prior to Closing and is
expected to be reflected on the books of each Acquired Entity as of Closing
(identifying the approximate relevant amount and nature of such estimated or
prepaid amount), together with a good faith estimate of the portion, if
any, of such estimated or prepaid balance which Dole reasonably anticipates
or expects will be refunded or credited following the Closing (which refund or
credit will be paid over to Dole pursuant to this Section 9.4).

 

(b) For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions in 9.4(a)(x) and 9.4(a)(y)
shall have no impact on Doles entitlement to Tax refunds or credits pursuant
to this Section 9.4.

 



45 9.5 _Allocation of Transfer Tax Liabilities._ Dole shall bear and pay any and
all sales or use, transfer, stamp, documentation, customs duties, value added
and similar Taxes and charges as well as interest and penalties thereon
assessed on or related to the sale or transfer of equity interests in the
Acquired Entities by Dole to ITOCHU pursuant to this Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated herein. If the sale or transfer
of any or all of such property or assets is exempt from such Taxes or charges,
Dole shall provide ITOCHU and the Acquired Entities with appropriate
exemption documents on the Closing Date.

9.6 _Contest Provisions._ In the event (a) ITOCHU (or its Affiliates) or (b)
Dole (or its Affiliates) receives notice of any pending or threatened Tax
audits or assessments by any Tax authority or other disputes concerning Taxes
with respect to which the other Party may incur liability under
this Agreement, the Party in receipt of such notice shall promptly notify the
other Party of such matter in writing. A Party shall have the right, at its
own expense, to represent its own interests and the interests of the Acquired
Entities in any such Tax audit or administrative or court Proceeding to the
extent relating to Taxes for which such Party may be liable under this
Agreement, provided, however, that (x) the other Party shall have the right to
participate in any Proceedings relating to Straddle Period Taxes, to the
extent that it is liable for such Taxes, and (y) no Party shall resolve,
settle, compromise, or abandon any issue or claim with respect to Straddle
Period Taxes for which the other Party is liable under this Agreement,
without the prior written consent of such other Party, which consent shall not
be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed.

9.7 _Cooperation on Tax Matters._ ITOCHU, the Acquired Entities and Dole shall
cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other Party,
in connection with the filing of Tax Returns and any audit, litigation or
other Proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the
retention and (upon the other Partys reasonable request) the provision of
records and information reasonably relevant to any such return, audit,
litigation or other Proceeding and making employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder. The Acquired Entities, Dole and ITOCHU agree
to (a) retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to
the Acquired Entities relating to any taxable period beginning before the
Closing Date until expiration of the statute of limitations (and, to the
extent notified by ITOCHU or Dole, any extensions thereof) of the respective
taxable periods, and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into
with any taxing authority and (b) to give the other Party reasonable notice
prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and records
and, if the other Party so requests, the Acquired Entities, ITOCHU or Dole, as
the case may be, shall allow the other Party to take possession of such books
and records; provided that nothing in this Section 9.7 shall grant ITOCHU or
any of the Acquired Entities access to Doles income Tax Returns.

9.8  _Tax-Sharing Agreements._ Dole shall cause all Tax-sharing agreements or
similar Contracts with respect to or involving the Acquired Entities, on the
one hand, and Dole and its Affiliates (other than the Acquired Entities), on
the other hand, to be terminated as of the Closing Date and, after the
Closing Date, no Acquired Entities shall be bound thereby or have any
liability thereunder.

9.9 _Conflict with Section 8\. _In the event of any conflict between Section
8 and this Section 9 with respect to indemnification for Taxes, this Section 9
shall control. For the 

 



46  avoidance of doubt, the obligations of the Parties under this Section 9
shall not be subject to the limitations set forth in Section 8.2(b) or Section
8.3(b), nor shall any amounts paid pursuant to this Section 9 be counted
towards any aggregate Liability limits, aggregate claim threshold or
individual claim threshold provided for in Section 8\.

SECTION 10

TERMINATION 

10.1 _Termination of Agreement._ Certain of the Parties may terminate this
Agreement at any time prior to the Closing, whether before or after the
Stockholder Approval has been obtained, as provided below:

(a) ITOCHU and Dole may terminate this Agreement by mutual written consent;

(b) By either Party:

 

(i) if the Closing shall not have been consummated on or before December 31,
2012 (the " _Termination Date_ "); provided, that a Party shall not have the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.1(b)(i) if any
breach hereof by such Party shall have been the direct cause of, or resulted
directly in, the failure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
to be consummated by the Termination Date;

(ii) if any court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Authority
shall have issued a judgment, order, injunction, rule or decree, or taken any
other action restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and such judgment, order,
injunction, rule, decree or other action shall have become final and
nonappealable; provided, that the Party seeking to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 10.1(b)(ii) shall have used its commercially
reasonable efforts to contest, appeal and remove such judgment, order,
injunction, rule, decree, ruling or other action in accordance with Sections

Stockholders Meeting duly convened therefor or at any adjournment or
postponement thereof at which a vote on the adoption of this Agreement was
taken;

(c) ITOCHU may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice to Dole (i)
in the event Dole has breached any representation, warranty or covenant
contained in this Agreement in any material respect (or any representation,
warranty or covenant qualified by materiality in any respect) and such
failure to perform (A) would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth
in Section 7.1 and (B) the breach has continued without cure for a period of
thirty (30) days after the notice of breach has been given by ITOCHU to Dole
(unless ITOCHU itself is in material breach of any representation, warranty or
covenant contained in this Agreement) or (ii) the Dole board of directors
shall have 

 



47  effected an Adverse Recommendation Change but not terminated this Agreement
pursuant to Section 10.1(d)(ii); and

 

(d) Dole may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice to ITOCHU at
any time prior to the Closing (i) in the event ITOCHU has breached any
representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement in any
material respect (or any representation, warranty or covenant qualified by
materiality in any respect) and such failure to perform (A) would give rise
to the failure of a condition set forth in Section 7.2 and (B) the breach has
continued without cure for a period of thirty (30) days after the notice of
breach has been given by Dole to ITOCHU (unless Dole itself is in breach of
any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement) or (ii)
in order to enter into a transaction that is a Superior Proposal, if prior to
the receipt of the Stockholder Approval, (A) the Dole board of directors has
received a Superior Proposal and (B) prior to or concurrently with such
termination, Dole pays the Termination Fee due under Section 10.3.

The Party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1(b)
through (d) shall give notice of such termination to the other Party.

 

10.2 _Effect of Termination._ If any Party terminates this Agreement pursuant
to Section 10.1 above, all rights and obligations of the Parties hereunder

Announcements), Section 11.2 (No Third-Party Beneficiaries), Section 11.3
(Entire Agreement), Section 11.4 (Succession and Assignment), Section 11.7
(Notices), Section 11.8 (Governing Law), Section 11.9 (Arbitration), Section
11.11 (Severability), Section 11.12 (Expenses) and Section 11.13
(Construction)) shall terminate without any Liability of any Party to any
other Party (except for any Liability of any Party then in breach); provided,
however, that neither ITOCHU nor Dole shall be released from any liabilities
or damages arising out of a material breach of any covenant or agreement set
forth in this Agreement.

10.3 _Termination Fee._

(a) In the event that:

 

(i) this Agreement is terminated by either ITOCHU or Dole pursuant to Section
10.1(b)(i) (but only if the Stockholders Meeting has not been held by the
Termination Date) or Section 10.1(b)(iii) and (A) prior to the termination
under Section 10.1(b)(i) or the taking of a vote to approve this Agreement at
the Stockholders Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof (in the
case of a termination pursuant to Section 10.1(b)(iii)), an Acquisition
Proposal shall have been communicated to the senior management of Dole or the
Dole board of directors or shall have been publicly announced or publicly
made known to the stockholders of Dole, and not withdrawn prior to the
Termination Date or such vote to adopt this Agreement, as applicable and (B)
within six months after such termination Dole shall have consummated or
entered into a definitive agreement with respect to such Acquisition Proposal;

 



48 (ii) this Agreement is terminated by Dole pursuant to Section 10.1(d)(ii); or

(iii) this Agreement is terminated by ITOCHU pursuant to Section 10.1(c)(ii),

then, in any such case, Dole shall pay ITOCHU a termination fee of $50,400,000
(the " _Termination Fee_ "), it being understood that in no event shall Dole
be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

(b) Payment of the Termination Fee, if applicable, shall be made by wire
transfer of same day funds to the account or accounts designated by ITOCHU (1)
on the consummation of any transaction contemplated by an Acquisition
Proposal in the case of a Termination Fee payable pursuant to Section
10.3(a)(i) or (2) within five (5) days after the termination of this
Agreement, in the case of Sections 10.3(a)(ii) and (iii). 

(c) Dole acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 10.3 are
an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
that, without these agreements, ITOCHU would not enter into this Agreement;
accordingly, if Dole fails promptly to pay any amounts due pursuant to this
Section 10.3, and, in order to obtain such payment, ITOCHU commences a suit
that results in a judgment against Dole for the amounts set forth in this
Section 10.3, Dole shall pay to ITOCHU its costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such suit,
together with interest on the amounts due pursuant to this Section 10.3 from
the date such payment was required to be made until the date of payment at the
prime lending rate as published in _The Wall Street Journal_ in effect on the
date such payment was required to be made.

(d) The Parties agree that if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
Sections 10.1(b)(i) or 10.1(b)(iii) (in each case only as specifically
contemplated by Section 10.3(a)(i)), or Section 10.1(c)(ii) or Section
10.1(d)(ii), the delivery of the Termination Fee shall be deemed to
be liquidated damages and the sole and exclusive remedy for any and all
claims, actions, causes of action, judgments, awards, losses, damages,
liabilities, fines, penalties, expenses or costs (including reasonable
attorneys fees and other out-of-pocket costs incurred in investigating,
preparing and defending the foregoing) suffered or incurred by ITOCHU or any
of its Affiliates or any other Person in connection with or related to or
arising out of this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby, any oral
representation made or alleged to have been made in connection herewith or
therewith or any matter forming the basis for such termination, and neither
ITOCHU nor any of its Affiliates or any other Person shall be entitled to
bring or maintain any other claim, action or proceeding against Dole any
Acquired Entity or any of their respective former, current or future
Affiliates arising out of this Agreement, the transactions contemplated
hereby, any oral representation made or alleged to have been made in
connection herewith or therewith or any matter forming the basis for such
termination.

obtained, no amendment may be made that pursuant to applicable law requires
further approval or adoption by the Dole stockholders without such further
approval or adoption. No waiver by any Party of any provision of this
Agreement or any default, misrepresentation or breach of warranty or covenant
hereunder, whether intentional or not, shall be valid unless the same shall be

deemed to extend to any prior or subsequent default, misrepresentation or
breach of warranty or covenant hereunder or affect in any way any rights
arising by virtue of any prior or subsequent such default, misrepresentation
or breach of warranty or covenant, provided, however, that after the
Stockholder Approval has been obtained, no waiver may be made that pursuant
to applicable law requires further approval or adoption by the Dole
stockholders without such further approval or adoption.

11.11 _Severability._ Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid

intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if
drafted jointly by the Parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any of
the provisions of this Agreement. Any reference to any federal, state, local
or foreign statute or law shall be deemed also to refer to all rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the context requires otherwise. The

is breached, so that, notwithstanding any other provision herein to the
contrary (including Section 11.9), a Party shall be entitled to
injunctive relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically in any court of competent jurisdiction, this Agreement and the
terms and provisions hereof in addition to any other remedy to which such
Party may be entitled, at law or in equity. Each of the Parties hereby
further waives (a) any defense in any action for specific performance that a
remedy at law would be

 



53  adequate and (b) any requirement under any Legal Requirement to post
security as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.

 

11.16 _Effectiveness of Representations and Warranties._ For the avoidance of
doubt, a showing of any negligence ( _kashitsu_ ) or intent ( _koi_ ) on the

rights and obligations (collectively, the "Business"), and to enter into a
series of other agreements at the Closing (as defined in the Acquisition

other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
are acknowledged by the execution hereof, the parties agree as follows.



     | 1. | OWNERSHIP AND PROTECTION OF TRADEMARKS. 
---|---|--- 

1.1 _Ownership_. The DAL Parties acknowledge that DOLE is the exclusive owner
of the Retained Trademarks and the Overlapping Trademarks (and all other
trademarks historically owned by DOLE that cover products other than Fresh
Products in Asia Plus Australia/New Zealand and Packaged Products) the
Retained Ancillary IP Rights and all trade names and trade dress rights
historically owned by DOLE other than those included in the Assigned
Trademarks or the Assigned Ancillary IP Rights and that all of the DAL
Parties uses of the Retained Trademarks, the Overlapping Trademarks and the
Retained Ancillary IP Rights pursuant to the licenses granted hereunder shall
inure to the exclusive benefit of DOLE. The DAL Parties shall place
appropriate notices, including notice of copyright, reflecting ownership of
Retained Ancillary IP Rights by DOLE, on all packaging, sleeves, containers,
labels and advertising and promotional materials. DOLE acknowledges that DAL
or DPF, as the case may be, is the exclusive owner of the Assigned Trademarks
and the Assigned Ancillary IP Rights and that all of Doles uses of the
Assigned Trademarks and the Assigned Ancillary IP Rights pursuant to the
licenses granted hereunder shall inure to the exclusive benefit of DAL or DPF,
as applicable. DOLE shall place appropriate notices, including notice of
copyright, reflecting ownership of the Assigned Ancillary IP Rights by DAL or
DPF, as applicable, on all packaging, sleeves, containers, labels and
advertising and promotional materials.

1.2 _Registration; Supplemental Applications_.

 



-5-  (a) The DAL Parties shall cooperate fully and in good faith with DOLE for the
purpose of securing and preserving DOLEs rights in and to the Retained
Trademarks, the Overlapping Trademarks and Retained Ancillary IP Rights,
including, without limitation, in the execution, submission and prosecution of
any trademark, service mark or copyright applications and similar
applications for registration which DOLE may desire to submit at any time and
from time to time. DOLE shall cooperate fully and in good faith with the DAL
Parties for the purpose of securing and preserving the DAL Parties
respective rights in and to the Assigned Trademarks and Assigned Ancillary IP
Rights, including, without limitation, in the execution, submission and
prosecution of any trademark, service mark or copyright applications and
similar applications for registration which a DAL Party may desire to submit
at any time and from time to time. No party shall directly or indirectly
submit in any jurisdiction any application to register a trademark for any new
products or classes of products that are not covered by existing trademark
registrations in such jurisdiction that are owned by such party except in
compliance with the applicable provisions of Sections 2.4 and 2.6.

 

(b) DOLE agrees, with respect to each Overlapping Trademark and at the DAL
Parties sole cost and expense, to file in the applicable jurisdiction
promptly after the execution of this Agreement an application for a new
registration that covers only the Fresh Products in Asia Plus Australia/New
Zealand or Packaged Products that are covered by such Overlapping Trademark
(each, a "Supplemental Application"), using local counsel and with such
coverage as determined in consultation between the parties consistent with the
terms of this Agreement. Promptly upon filing each Supplemental Application,
DOLE will assign, at the DAL Parties sole cost and expense, such
Supplemental Application (and any registration issuing thereon) to DAL, in the
case of a Supplemental Application filed outside the United States, or to DPF,
in the case of a Supplemental Application filed in the United States. DOLE
will file the Supplemental Applications in such countries and in such order of
priority as the DAL Parties may request. Further, DOLE agrees that it shall
provide the DAL Parties, at the DAL Parties sole cost and expense, with any
assistance requested by a DAL Party as may be reasonably required to
successfully prosecute any and all Supplemental Applications until such time
as they mature into registrations. Such assistance shall include,
without limitation, assistance in responding to and overcoming office
actions, responding to and overcoming the citation of an Overlapping or
Retained Trademark, or other trademark registered and owned by DOLE or an
Affiliate of DOLE, including, at the option and sole discretion of a DAL
Party, by executing an appropriate consent or coexistence agreement or by
having the Supplemental Application reassigned to DOLE until such time as it
matures into a registration (at which time DOLE shall assign the registration
to the DAL Party). At the request and sole expense of a DAL Party, DOLE shall,
to the extent permitted by applicable law, amend any registration for an
Overlapping Trademark so as to delete from such registration those goods
covered by a Supplemental Application that has matured into a registration;
provided that DOLE shall have no obligation to amend any such registration
unless such DAL Party provides DOLE with a written opinion from a recognized
outside trademark counsel reasonably satisfactory to DOLE to the effect that
the amendment to such registration will not impair or derogate from any rights
of DOLE with respect to the other goods covered by such registration. For the
avoidance of doubt, DOLE agrees and acknowledges that the issuance of a
registration pursuant to any Supplemental Application shall not limit or
otherwise derogate from any license rights granted to a DAL Party pursuant to
this Agreement.

 

1.3 _Prohibited Acts_

 



-6-  No party shall, directly or indirectly:

 

(a) claim ownership of the trademarks, trade names or trade dress rights owned
by the other party or parties as provided in Section 1.1;

party or parties in such a way intentionally to give the impression that they
are owned by such party;

(c) use the trademarks, trade names or trade dress rights owned by the other
party or parties or any confusingly similar trademark or other confusingly
similar intellectual or industrial property in any manner not expressly
authorized by the other party or parties;

(d) engage in any activity that may contest, dispute, dilute or otherwise
impair the right, title, or interest of the other party or parties in the
trademarks owned by the other party or parties, including, without limitation,
any action to prevent or cancel any registration of such trademarks;

 

(e) use the trademarks or trade dress rights owned by the other party or
parties in any manner that is not necessary or beneficial for the production,
marketing, promotion, advertisement or distribution of the products with which
such party is authorized to use such trademarks or trade dress rights or use
the trade names owned by the other party or parties in any manner that is not
necessary or beneficial for the business of such party with which such party
is authorized to use such trade names; or

(f) use any Trademarks in any manner that is in conflict with or violates any
exclusive rights in such Trademarks granted to the other party or parties.

 

1.4 _Misuse; Renewal and Maintenance Costs_. The DAL Parties shall cooperate
fully and promptly with DOLE in the protection of DOLEs rights to the
Retained Trademarks, the Overlapping Trademarks and the Retained Ancillary IP
Rights, as DOLE may request from time to time. DOLE shall cooperate fully and
promptly with DAL in the protection of DALs rights to the Assigned
Trademarks and the Assigned Ancillary IP Rights, as well as the Supplemental
Applications and registrations resulting therefrom as contemplated in Section
1.2(b), as DAL may request from time to time. The applicable DAL Party shall
be responsible for monitoring any infringement or other misuse of the
Overlapping Trademarks involving Fresh Products in Asia Plus Australia/New
Zealand or Packaged Products anywhere in the world, and for reporting material
infringements or misuse to DOLE, and DOLE shall be responsible for monitoring
any infringement or other misuse of the Overlapping Trademarks involving any
other products, and for reporting material infringements or misuse to the DAL
Parties. In addition, the DAL Parties shall be responsible for all costs
associated with policing the use of the Overlapping Trademarks with respect to
Fresh Products in Asia Plus Australia/New Zealand and Packaged Products
worldwide, and 

 



-7-   DOLE shall be responsible for all costs associated with policing the use of
the Overlapping Trademarks with respect to products other than Fresh Products
in Asia Plus Australia/New Zealand and Packaged Products worldwide. Each
party will take appropriate action (including legal action), at its cost, to
abate any material infringement of the Overlapping Trademarks, the monitoring
of any infringement or misuse of which is the responsibility of such party
under this Section 1.4. In addition, DOLE, at its sole cost and expense, shall
renew and maintain the Overlapping Trademarks (and prosecute any pending
applications included therein). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary,
the parties agree that in the event a DAL Party becomes aware of any
unauthorized use by a third party of any trademark that is the subject of an
exclusive license granted to a DAL Party hereunder, the DAL Party shall have
the right, at its sole option and discretion and at its sole cost, to bring a
claim against such third party, or otherwise take any other legal action at
its disposal against such third party to stop such unauthorized use or
otherwise protect its rights hereunder, and any damages collected in such
action shall be for the account of the DAL Party. In connection with any
action commenced under this Section, to the extent that the parties do not
both agree to proceed jointly in any such action, the party not bringing the
action shall cooperate fully with the party bringing the action, at the latter
partys reasonable expense.

1.5  _Protection of Scope of DOLE Trademark, Trade Name and Trade Dress
Rights_. The DAL Parties agree and acknowledge that it is the intent of the
parties that no trademarks historically owned by DOLE other than trademarks
covering exclusively Fresh Products in Asia Plus Australia/New Zealand and/or
Packaged Products worldwide and no trade names and trade dress rights other
than those exclusively relating to Fresh Products in Asia Plus Australia/New
Zealand and/or Packaged Products worldwide are intended to have been assigned
( to, or be owned by either DAL Party and that all other such trademarks and
any new trademarks covering any other types of products are intended to be
reserved for the exclusive benefit of DOLE in all jurisdictions throughout
the world. The DAL Parties will fully cooperate, by assigning rights and
taking such other action as DOLE may request, to ensure that DOLE exclusively
owns all trademarks based on or derived from trademarks historically owned by
DOLE that cover products other than Fresh Products in Asia Plus Australia/New
Zealand and/or Packaged Products. For the avoidance of doubt, DOLE agrees and
acknowledges that the foregoing provisions are not intended to limit or
otherwise derogate from the DAL Parties rights in and to the Overlapping
Trademarks or any Supplemental Applications or resulting registrations, as set
forth in this Agreement, or to limit or restrict the right of any DAL Party to
use any trademark that is not the same as or confusingly similar to any
trademark owned by DOLE in connection with any product or service whatsoever.

 

1.6 _Associated Marks_. Notwithstanding any provision contained herein to the
contrary, any Assigned Trademark that is associated, as indicated by the
records of the trademark office or other government body where such Assigned
Trademark is registered or is the subject of a pending application (or in such
other manner as may cause trademarks to be associated under applicable law),
with any Retained Trademark or any Overlapping Trademark shall not be assigned
to the applicable DAL Party, but shall be retained by DOLE and will be deemed
to be an Overlapping Trademark that is licensed to the applicable DAL
Party exclusively for Fresh Products in Asia Plus Australia/New Zealand or
Packaged Products worldwide.

Assigned Trademark or Supplemental Application (the "Applicable DAL Party")
assumes the Duo License to the extent it applies to such Assigned Trademark or
Supplemental Application, and (ii) the Applicable DAL Party assumes the
Security Agreement to the extent it applies to such Assigned Trademark or
Supplemental Application, and (iii) the Duo License and the Security Agreement
are valid, binding and enforceable in accordance with their respective terms
against DAL to the extent the Duo License and the Security Agreement each
applies to such Assigned Trademark or Supplemental Application.

contained herein, the DAL Party that owns the relevant Assigned Trademark or

Business, it may do so only through the applicable DAL Party pursuant to a
good faith arrangement on commercially reasonable terms as may be agreed upon
by the parties.

Zealand or a Packaged Product, subject to Section 2.6.

(b) In the event either DAL Party wishes to use the Assigned Trademarks or
Overlapping Trademarks on any fresh produce product in Asia Plus Australia/New
Zealand that is not currently subsumed within the definition of Fresh Products
(in the case of DAL) or any packaged products that are not currently subsumed
within the definition of Packaged Products (in the case of DAL or DFP), such
DAL Party will request DOLE to review and provide written consent to such
request based on appropriate supporting documentation. DOLE will review such
DAL Partys request pursuant to this Section 2.4(b) and solely determine if
such DAL Party will be authorized to use the Assigned Trademarks or
Overlapping Trademarks in accordance with such DAL Partys request. 

(c) In the event DOLE wishes to use the Assigned Trademarks or Overlapping
Trademarks on any product that is currently subsumed within the definition of
Packaged Products, or, except for the exercise of DOLEs non-exclusive license
rights in the DFC Asia Business, to use the Assigned Trademarks or Overlapping
Trademarks in Asia Plus Australia/New Zealand on any product that is subsumed
within the definition of Fresh Products, DOLE will request the DAL Parties to
review and provide written consent to such request based on appropriate
supporting documentation. The DAL Parties will review DOLEs request pursuant
to this Section 2.4(c) and solely determine if DOLE will be licensed to use
the Assigned Trademarks or Overlapping Trademarks in accordance with its
request.

(d) In the event DOLE intends to use in Asia Plus Australia/New Zealand any
Retained Trademark or Overlapping Trademark on any new product (other than
Fresh Products or Packaged Products) on which DOLE is not currently using
such Retained Trademark or Overlapping Trademark in Asia Plus Australia/New
Zealand, DOLE will provide DAL with prior written notice thereof and offer to
DAL the right of first refusal to be DOLEs distributor in Asia
Plus Australia/New Zealand with respect to such new product. If DAL does not
provide written notice to DOLE that DAL desires to serve as DOLEs distributor
in Asia Plus Australia/New Zealand with respect to such new product within
thirty (30) days after DOLE provides such notice to DAL, DOLE shall be free
to proceed with the sale and distribution of such new product without any
participation by DAL as a distributor. If, within thirty (30) days after DOLE
provides such notice to DAL, DAL provides written notice to DOLE that DAL
desires to serve as DOLEs distributor in

 



-11-   Asia Plus Australia/New Zealand with respect to such new product, DOLE and
DAL shall negotiate in good faith commercially reasonable terms by which DAL
would be DOLEs distributor for such new product in Asia Plus Australia/New
Zealand. If DOLE and DAL have not reached agreement on the terms of such
distribution arrangement within forty-five (45) days after DOLEs receipt of
written notice from DAL that DAL desires to serve as DOLEs distributor in
Asia Plus Australia/New, DOLE shall be free to proceed with the sale and
distribution of such new product without any participation by DAL as a
distributor; provided that, DOLE shall not agree to terms with
another distributor in Asia Plus Australia/New Zealand with respect to such
new product without providing DAL with written notice of such terms and
offering an opportunity to DAL to accept a distributorship agreement with
DOLE with respect to such new product on such terms.

2.5  _Non-Exclusive Licensed Packaged Products and Licensed New Products_.
The DAL Parties respective rights with respect to Non-Exclusive Licensed
Packaged Products and Licensed New Products will be non-exclusive. In
addition, DOLE may not have existing trademark registrations in certain
jurisdictions for use of the Retained Trademarks with respect to Non-Exclusive
Licensed Packaged Products and/or the Licensed New Products. In that event,
the applicable DAL Party will either, (i) obtain trademark registrations (in
DOLEs name) covering the use of the Retained Trademarks with respect to the
Non-Exclusive Licensed Packaged Products and/or the Licensed New Products in
the relevant countries, or (ii) obtain an opinion from a recognized outside
trademark counsel (with a copy to DOLE) to the effect that such DAL Partys
use of the Retained Trademarks with respect to the Non-Exclusive Licensed
Packaged Products and/or the Licensed New Products will not infringe any
third party rights in the relevant countries; and, in either case, such DAL
Party, at its sole cost, shall defend DOLE and its Affiliates against any
claim of infringement or other violation of third party rights that is
asserted against DOLE or any of its Affiliates in connection with or as a
result of any such use by such DAL Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
the applicable DAL Party does not comply with the conditions set forth in
clauses (i) or (ii) above, such DAL Party shall have the right, at its sole
option and discretion, to use the Retained Trademarks as aforesaid; provided,
however, that in such case such DAL Party, at its sole cost, shall defend and
indemnify DOLE and its Affiliates against any claim of infringement or other
violation of third party rights that is asserted against DOLE or any of its
Affiliates in connection with or as a result of such use by such DAL Party and
against any damages or other losses resulting from such claim or other
violation; and further provided that such indemnification obligation (but not
such defense obligation) shall cease if and when such DAL Party complies with
the conditions set forth in clauses (i) or (ii). 

2.6. _Brand Equity Principles_. With respect to its use of the Trademarks
(including Trademarks owned by such party) in connection with any products,
each party will have the right to unilaterally undertake the following, but
only to the extent that such actions and all products conform to the Brand
Equity Principles (to the extent applicable to the products with which the
Trademarks are used): (a) develop new products that are subsumed within the
definition of Fresh Products in Asia Plus Australia/New Zealand (in the case
of DAL) and/or Packaged Products (in the case of DAL or DPF, as
applicable); (b) modify products on which Trademarks owned by or licensed to
such party are used by such party; (c) market, promote and advertise products
on which Trademarks owned by or licensed to such party are used by such party;
(d) establish and maintain inventory of products on which Trademarks owned by
or licensed to such party are used by such party; (e) approve co-packing
arrangements relating to products on which Trademarks owned by or 

 



-12-   licensed to such party are used by such party as long as the co-packer has
the appropriate skill, experience and reputation to produce the highest
quality product consistent with applicable law; and (f) maintain and protect
the registration, in DOLEs name, of the Retained Trademarks or Overlapping
Trademarks used in connection with the New Products (including the payment of
any applicable maintenance fees) and maintain and protect the registration,
in the applicable DAL Partys name, of the Assigned Trademarks used in
connection with the New Products (including the payment of any applicable
maintenance fees). DOLE will consult with ITOCHU (and, if ITOCHU requests the
participation of the DAL Parties in such consultations, the DAL Parties) prior
to DOLE modifying the Brand Equity Principles and will consider the results of
such consultation in finalizing any such modifications, with the understanding
that any expansion of the Brand Equity Principles by such modifications shall
be deemed to automatically amend Exhibit B hereto. However, DOLE shall not
have the right to amend the Brand Equity Principles in a manner that operates
to decrease the scope of the DAL Parties permitted usage as it exists on the
date of this Agreement, or that otherwise restricts or derogates from the DAL
Parties rights under this Agreement or the Assignment Agreement, without the
consent of the DAL Parties. DOLE agrees that it will not in any event use in
Asia Plus Australia/New Zealand any Retained Trademark or Overlapping
Trademark in a manner that conflicts with the Brand Equity Principles as they
exist on the date of this Agreement (except to the extent the Brand Equity
Principles have been expanded after the date of this Agreement as permitted
under this Agreement) unless the applicable DAL Party otherwise agrees
following consultation with DOLE.

 

2.7 _Business Migration_. Exhibit C hereto sets forth a list of those
countries outside Asia Plus Australia/New Zealand where Asia Fresh currently
produces, sells, distributes or purchases Fresh Products as part of the Asia
Fresh Non-Asia Business and sets forth a description of the Asia Fresh Non-
Asia Business. Exhibit E hereto sets forth a list of those countries within
Asia Plus Australia/New Zealand in which DOLEs divisions/Affiliates other
than Asia Fresh currently produce, sell, distribute or purchase Fresh Products
as part of the DFC Asia Business and sets forth a description of the DFC Asia
Business. Exhibit F hereto sets forth a list of those Packaged Products
currently produced, sold, distributed or purchased by DOLEs divisions or
Affiliates as part of the DFC Packaged Business other than Packaged Foods
anywhere in the world. Notwithstanding the non-exclusive license rights
granted under this Agreement, in order to ensure that all related business is
conducted through a single front and thereby improve efficiency and avoid
marketplace confusion, DOLE, ITOCHU and the DAL Parties shall work together
in good faith to have all DFC Asia Business and DFC Packaged Business migrated
to and conducted by the applicable DAL Party, and all Asia Fresh Non-Asia
Business (other than the production, sale, distribution, marketing and
promotion of Fresh Products in the United Arab Emirates) migrated to and
conducted by DOLE, as soon as reasonably practicable after the execution of
this Agreement, provided that the parties shall endeavor to effectuate such
migration in a manner that does not result in a reduction of revenue or
otherwise adversely affect the migrated businesses; and provided further, that
in no event shall DOLE or an Affiliate thereof or such DAL Party be required
to violate any existing contract (the foregoing activities carried out by the
parties are referred to herein as the "Business Migration"). The specific
timing of, and the specific steps to be taken by each party to effectuate, the
Business Migration shall be determined on a case by case basis in good faith
discussions and consultation between the parties. In furtherance of the
Business Migration, DOLE shall not in any event expand the volume or value of
either the DFC Asia Business or the DFC Packaged Business beyond the
levels subsisting as of the date of this Agreement, without first offering
the applicable DAL Party the

 



-13-   right of first refusal with respect to such expanded volume or value that
such DAL Party shall have the right to exercise within thirty (30) days after
receipt of written notice from DOLE with respect to such right of first
refusal. In furtherance of the Business Migration, the applicable DAL Party
shall not in any event expand the volume or value of the Asia Fresh Non-Asia
Business (other than the production, sale, distribution, marketing and
promotion of Fresh Products in the United Arab Emirates) beyond the levels
subsisting as of the date of this Agreement, without first offering DOLE the
right of first refusal with respect to such expanded volume or value that
DOLE shall have the right to exercise within thirty (30) days after receipt
of written notice from such DAL Party with respect to such right of first
refusal. In the event a party elects not to exercise the right of first
refusal granted to it hereunder, the party offering such right of shall not
offer to any third part substantially superior terms to those offered
hereunder in connection with such right.

2.8 _Recordation and Abandonment_. Each party shall have the right, at any
time and at its own cost and expense, to record, register, or otherwise notify
this Agreement, or any licenses granted or otherwise contemplated hereunder,
in appropriate governmental or regulatory offices anywhere in the world, and
each party shall provide, without demanding further consideration, reasonable
assistance to the other in effecting such recording, registering or
notifying, including, without limitation, executing (or causing its
subsidiaries to execute) all documents required to effect the same.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to recording, registering, or otherwise
notifying this Agreement or such licenses, the party desiring to so record,
register, or notify shall provide a copy of all materials to be filed for
review, comment, and approval by the other party, such approval not
unreasonably to be withheld or delayed. In the event that DOLE decides, for
any reason, to abandon the registration of any trademark licensed under this
Agreement to a DAL Party, and to cease using such trademark in the ordinary
course of DOLEs business, DOLE shall notify the applicable DAL Party
accordingly in writing and, promptly upon the written request of such DAL
Party, shall use reasonable efforts to promptly transfer to the applicable DAL
Party, at no additional cost, all right, title and interest in and to such
trademark and the good will associated therewith, following which all costs
of maintaining such trademark shall be the sole responsibility of such DAL
Party and DOLE shall retain a non-exclusive license to use such trademark to
the same extent that DOLE was entitled to use such trademark prior to such
transfer, it being understood that such license is being retained by DOLE
primarily for defensive purposes.



     | 3. | TERM OF AGREEMENT 
---|---|--- 

_Term_. This Agreement shall commence as of the date specified in the
preamble and shall continue indefinitely unless terminated by mutual agreement
of the parties.



     | 4. | USE OF COPACKERS; STANDARDS 
---|---|--- 
 

Each party, at its option, may have the products with which Trademarks
licensed to such party are used grown, manufactured and packed for such party
pursuant to contract manufacturing agreements with reputable and qualified
copackers and will require that such copackers comply with the applicable
product quality and compliance requirements set forth in this Agreement. Each
party will be responsible for supervising and controlling its copackers to
ensure that all obligations under this Agreement are met and such party shall
be liable for all acts and omissions of such copackers as though performed by
such party itself. Each party warrants and

 



-14-   represents as follows with respect to the Products with which it uses
Trademarks owned by or licensed to it, its operations and facilities, and with
respect to the operations and facilities of each of its approved copackers:

(a) That each will comply with all applicable national, federal, state, and
local laws and regulations.

(b) That no pesticide, herbicide or other chemical product will be applied to
such Products, to ingredients thereof, or to any acreage where such Products
and/or ingredients have been grown, that have been banned by the United States
or by the European Union.

(c) That such Products shall not be adulterated or misbranded within the
meaning of applicable law.

(d) That all packaging and packaging components used in connection with such
Products will comply with the requirements of applicable toxics in packaging
laws.

 

Each party further represents and warrants that the Products with which it
uses Trademarks owned by or licensed to it and any and all packaging used in
conjunction with such Products, shall comply with the Brand Equity Principles
and meet applicable quality control standards and shall be wholesome,
merchantable and fit for human consumption. In addition, each party must
have documented and reasonable food safety and food security policies and
procedures in place.



     | 5. | PRODUCT STANDARDS 
---|---|--- 

5.1 _DAL Samples_. Upon DOLEs request, a DAL Party shall submit, at its sole
expense (including without limitation, all expenses relating to freight,
applicable duties and similar costs), a reasonable number of samples of
products with which Trademarks licensed to such DAL Party are used and all
packaging materials, including containers, cases, graphics, images, and all
other items used or proposed to be used in the production, distribution and
sale of such products.

 

5.2 _DOLE Samples_. Upon a DAL Partys request, DOLE shall submit, at its sole
expense (including without limitation, all expenses relating to freight,
applicable duties and similar costs), a reasonable number of samples of
products with which Trademarks licensed to DOLE are used and all packaging
materials, including containers, cases, graphics, images, and all other items
used or proposed to be used in the production, distribution and sale of such
products.



     | 6. | QUALITY STANDARDS AND CONTROL 
---|---|--- 
 

6.1 _Quality Standards_. The parties acknowledge that the Trademarks represent
the prestige that DOLE has earned for itself and are well recognized in the
minds of the public, and that it is of great importance to each party that, in
the production and sale of Products, the high standards, reputation and image
established by DOLE be maintained at all times by the DAL Parties, 

 



-15-   with respect to its use of the Assigned Trademarks and the Overlapping
Trademarks or Retained Trademarks licensed to each of them by DOLE, and by
DOLE, with respect to the Assigned Trademarks licensed to it by the DAL
Parties. Accordingly, all Products on which Trademarks licensed from the other
party appear shall comply with the Brand Equity Principles (to the extent
applicable to such Products) and shall be of such quality as will protect and
enhance the relevant Trademarks, and in all cases the quality shall be at
least as high as the quality of samples submitted to the party that owns or
co-owns the relevant Trademarks. Each Licensed Product shall bear the
relevant Trademarks substantially in the form consistent with DOLEs
historical practices except as the parties otherwise agree in writing. If
either party reasonably determines that the other partys Products (whether
found in the marketplace, held by the other partys customers, in storage or
otherwise) are inconsistent in any material respect with the Brand Equity
Principles (to the extent applicable to such Products) or constitute a
significant health or safety risk, such party may at its option require that
the other party (i) recall such Products at the other partys sole expense; or
(ii) promptly remove the Trademarks from such Products, in which event such
Products may be sold provided they are in no way identified as a product
originating from or authorized by the other party or otherwise identified with
the other party or its Trademarks.

6.2 _Quality Control_.

(a) Each party shall cooperate fully in all ways with the other parties in
enabling the other parties to ascertain that all Products with which
Trademarks are used comply with the Brand Equity Principles (to the extent
applicable to such Products).

 

(b) If a party reasonably believes that another party is not complying with
the applicable quality standards imposed under Section 6.1, it and its agents
shall have the right to inspect, during business hours and upon reasonable
notice, such other partys facilities for the sole purpose of determining
compliance with such quality standards.

 



     | 7. | FORCE MAJEURE 
---|---|--- 

Neither DOLE nor either DAL Party shall be held responsible for any loss,
damage or delay suffered by the other parties owing to any cause that is
beyond the reasonable control of the defaulting party and cannot be attributed
to negligence or willful nonperformance of its obligation. Such causes
include, but are not limited to, wars, embargoes, riots, civil disturbances,
fires, storms, floods, typhoons, earthquakes and other severe natural
calamities, strikes and labor disputes, government acts and restrictions, and
other causes that cannot be overcome or prevented by due diligence. Any party
wishing to invoke this Section shall give written notice to the other parties,
within five (5) days of the occurrence of such event, stating the relevant
cause and the anticipated duration. The defaulting party shall promptly resume
performance of its obligations the moment such cause or causes cease to
operate.

 



     | 8. | BREACH 
---|---|--- 

The parties agree and acknowledge that no party shall have the right to
terminate this Agreement by reason of the other parties material breach or
for any other reason. In addition to any

 



-16-   other rights or remedies that any party may have, upon another partys
breach of any material provision of this Agreement and failure to cure such
breach within 30 days of notice from the non-breaching party, or if such
breach cannot be cured within 30 days, failure to take material steps to cure
the breach and complete such cure within 60 days, such non-breaching party may
immediately take any or all of the following actions, all at its sole
election:

(a) require the breaching party to cease any use of the Trademarks of such
party that are the subject of the breach ("Affected Trademarks"), which use
is not substantially in compliance with the terms of this Agreement; and

(b) terminate any exclusive rights the breaching party may have with respect
to the Affected Trademarks; provided, however, that in no event shall DOLE
have the right to terminate or otherwise rescind or cancel the assignment of
any Trademarks to either of the DAL Parties effected under the Assignment
Agreement or this Agreement.

The parties agree and acknowledge that any breach of this Agreement may give
rise to immediate and irreparable injury, loss, or damage to the non-breaching
party for which the granting of monetary damages would be an inadequate remedy
and ineffectual. Each party therefore acknowledges and agrees that,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary under the Acquisition Agreement or
this Agreement, if it breaches any provision of this Agreement, the other
party or parties will be entitled, in addition to all other available
remedies, to seek preliminary, interim and permanent injunctions, temporary
restraining orders, or other appropriate orders to restrain any continued
breach without having to prove that actual injury, loss, or damage has
been sustained by the non-breaching party or parties and without posting any
type of bond or other security as a condition for seeking such relief.



     | 9. | INDEMNIFICATION; REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES 
---|---|--- 

9.1 _Indemnification_. The DAL Parties shall indemnify, protect, hold harmless
and defend DOLE, and DOLE shall indemnify, protect, hold harmless and defend
the DAL Parties, and the indemnified partys officers, directors, Affiliates,
agents and employees from and against any and all claims, suits, losses,
liabilities, expenses and damages, including costs of suit and reasonable
attorneys fees, arising out of or in any way connected with: (i) the
growing, production, storage, handling, maintenance, sale, marketing,
distribution, labeling or advertisement of any Product by or on behalf of the
indemnifying party (including by any copacker); (ii) any alleged defect in or
adulteration of a Product and/or product liability claim; and (iii) any breach
of the warranties set forth in this Agreement.

9.2 _Matters Involving Third Parties; Determination of Amounts Subject to
Indemnification_

respect to any matter (a "Third-Party Claim") that may give rise to a claim
for indemnification against any other party (the "Indemnifying Party") under
Section 9.1, then the Indemnified Party shall as promptly as reasonably
possible after receipt of notice of the Third Party Claim (but in no event
later than ten (10) Business Days after receipt by the Indemnified Party of
notice of the Third Party

 



-17-   Claim) notify each Indemnifying Party thereof in writing, and in reasonable
detail, of the Third-Party Claim; _provided, however,_ that no delay on the
part of the Indemnified Party in notifying any Indemnifying Party shall
relieve the Indemnifying Party from any obligation hereunder unless (and then
solely to the extent) the Indemnifying Party is thereby prejudiced.
Thereafter, the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party,
within five (5) Business Days after the Indemnified Partys receipt thereof,
copies of all notices and documents (including court papers) received by the
Indemnified Party relating to the Third-Party Claim.

 

(b) Any Indemnifying Party will have the right to assume and control the
defense of the Indemnified Party against the Third-Party Claim with counsel
of his, her or its choice reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party so
long as (i) the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party in writing
within fifteen (15) days after the Indemnified Party has given notice of the
Third-Party Claim that the Indemnifying Party will indemnify the Indemnified
Party from and against the entirety of any Damages the Indemnified Party may
suffer resulting from, arising out of, relating to, in the nature of or caused
by the Third-Party Claim and (ii) the Third-Party Claim involves only money
Damages and does not seek an injunction or other equitable relief.

(c) So long as the Indemnifying Party is conducting the defense of the Third-
Party Claim in accordance with Section 9.2(b) above, (i) the Indemnified Party
may retain separate co-counsel at his, her or its sole cost and expense and
participate in the defense of the Third-Party Claim, (ii) the Indemnified
Party will not consent to the entry of any judgment on or enter into any
settlement with respect to the Third-Party Claim without the prior written
consent of the Indemnifying Party and (iii) the Indemnifying Party will not
consent to the entry of any judgment on or enter into any settlement with
respect to the Third-Party Claim without the prior written consent of
the Indemnified Party (not to be unreasonably withheld).

(d) In the event any of the conditions in Section 9.2(b) above is or becomes
unsatisfied, however, (i) the Indemnified Party may defend against, and
consent to the entry of any judgment on or enter into any settlement with
respect to, the Third-Party Claim in any manner he, she or it may deem
appropriate (and the Indemnified Party shall consult with, but shall not need
to obtain any consent from, any Indemnifying Party prior to consenting to any
judgment or the entry into any in connection therewith), (ii) the Indemnifying
Parties will reimburse the Indemnified Party promptly and periodically for
the costs of defending against the Third-Party Claim (including attorneys
fees and expenses) and (iii) the Indemnifying Parties will remain responsible
for any Damages the Indemnified Party may suffer resulting from, arising out
of, relating to, in the nature of or caused by the Third-Party Claim to the
fullest extent provided in Section 9.1.

(e) All amounts to which an Indemnified Party is entitled pursuant to Section
9.1 shall be determined net of (a) any Tax benefits realized by any party
seeking indemnification hereunder arising from such amounts and (b) any
amounts recovered by the Indemnified Party under insurance policies,
indemnities (other than pursuant to this Agreement) or other reimbursement
arrangements with respect to such amounts. Each party hereby waives, to the
extent permitted under its applicable insurance policies, any subrogation
rights that its insurer may have with respect to any indemnifiable losses it
may suffer.

 



-18-  9.3 _Warranties_. Each of the parties represents and warrants that it has the
full right, power and authority to enter into this Agreement and to perform
all of its respective obligations, that it is under no legal impediment which
would prevent its entering into and performing fully its obligations under
this Agreement, that it is financially capable of performing such obligations
and that no consent of any other person or entity is required to be obtained
by such party to grant the licenses granted by it under this Agreement. DOLE
represents and warrants to the DAL Parties as of the date of this Agreement
that: (i) the DAL Parties are entitled to use the trademarks licensed to them
hereunder as expressly permitted in this Agreement; (ii) the DAL Parties
exercise of their respective license rights under this Agreement, as
permitted and contemplated by, and in accordance with the provisions of, this
Agreement, shall not infringe in any material respect any third party
intellectual property or other proprietary rights, except as disclosed in
Exhibit J; (iii) DOLE has taken, or caused to be taken, and shall continue to
take or cause to be taken (subject to Section 2.8), all steps reasonably
required to maintain the registrations of any trademarks licensed to the DAL
Parties hereunder; (iv) Exhibit K lists all license agreements under which
DOLE has granted a license to use any of the Assigned Trademarks or
Overlapping Trademarks and that are material to either the Asia Fresh Business
or the Worldwide Packaged Food Business individually, or to the Business as a
whole (it being acknowledged that non-material agreements entered into by DOLE
in the ordinary course of business with producers, packers, suppliers,
manufacturers, distributors, customers, advertisers, brokers, business
partners and other third parties allowing such parties to use the Assigned
Trademarks or Overlapping Trademarks in connection with the production,
manufacture, distribution, sale, advertising and/or promotion of products of
DOLE or any of its subsidiaries, are not listed in Exhibit K); and (v)
excepting the licenses granted under the license agreements listed in Exhibit
K, neither the rights of any third party licensees referred to in Recital
F(8) above, nor any Third Party Rights, will, individually or in the
aggregate, have a material adverse effect on Asia Fresh, Packaged Foods, or
the Business as a whole. For the avoidance of doubt, a showing of any
negligence or intent on the part of DOLE shall not be required in order to
establish an inaccuracy or breach of any of DOLEs representations and
warranties under this Section 9.3. Furthermore, a DAL Partys awareness or
possible awareness, or ITOCHUs awareness or possible awareness, of any
inaccuracy or breach of any of DOLEs representations and warranties hereunder
shall not have any effect on the force and effect of such representations and
warranties, of DOLEs related indemnification obligations or of a DAL Partys
or ITOCHUs remedies relating thereto.

9.4 _Compliance With Laws_. Each party shall take all actions required by any
local, provincial, national, state or regional agency, government or
commission to carry out the activities contemplated by this Agreement in
compliance with all applicable laws. Neither party shall commit any acts or
engage in any transactions that would reflect adversely upon the other party,
the Trademarks or the Products of the other party.



     | 10. | ENTITLEMENT TO COSTS 
---|---|--- 

If any legal action or dispute arises under this Agreement, arises by reason
of any asserted breach of it, or arises between the parties and is related in
any way to the subject matter of the Agreement, the prevailing party shall be
entitled to recover all costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys
fees, investigative costs, reasonable accounting fees and charges for experts.
The "prevailing party" shall be the party who obtains a provisional remedy
such as a preliminary 

 



-19-   injunction or who is entitled to recover its reasonable costs of suit,
whether or not the suit proceeds to final judgment; if there is no court
action, the prevailing party shall be the party who wins any dispute. A party
need not be awarded money damages or all relief sought in order to be

     | 17. | ASSIGNABILITY AND SUBLICENSE RIGHTS 
---|---|--- 

(a) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the

Affiliate; (ii) in connection with any sale of any trademarks owned by such
party that are the subject of this Agreement; or (iii) in connection with the
sale of a subsidiary, business segment, division, business unit, or product
line or other divestment or sale or disposition of assets or any merger, stock
purchase, or other acquisition of such party; provided in each such case that
such party provides written notice of any such transaction to the other party
within thirty (30) days after the consummation of such transaction and the
assignee agrees in writing to be bound by all of the applicable provisions of
this Agreement. The rights granted to any party hereunder are unique and
personal in nature, and, except for an assignment of this Agreement permitted
pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 17(a) or any assignment,
transfer, pledge, encumbrance or hypothecation pursuant to any financing
transaction undertaken by a party (provided that the other party to such
financing transaction acknowledges in writing that such assignment, transfer,
pledge, encumbrance or hypothecation is subject to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement), neither this Agreement nor the rights granted to hereunder
(including without limitation, rights in and to the Products) may otherwise be
assigned, transferred, pledged, encumbered or hypothecated by any party
without the other parties prior written approval. Any attempt by a party to
transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement, whether by
assignment, sublicense, except as permitted herein, without having received
the prior written approval of the other parties, shall be null and void.

(b) Each DAL Party shall have the right to grant sublicenses under the
license granted to it in Section 2.1 to sublicensees and to grant licenses
under the Assigned Trademarks it owns, in each case, except to any Dole
Competitor, subject to compliance with the Brand Equity Principles. DOLE
shall have the right to grant sublicenses under the license granted under
Section 2.2 to sublicensees, subject to compliance with the Brand Equity
Principles. Each party granting a sublicense or, in the case of a DAL Party, a
license pursuant to this Section 14(b) will require that such sublicensees or
licensees, as the case may be, comply with the applicable product quality and
legal compliance requirements as set forth in this Agreement, and all laws,
including health, labor and safety standards applicable to such sublicensee
or licensee.

(c) Each party is free to assign any of the Trademarks it owns hereunder;
provided that such party shall not assign any Trademarks it owns to any person
unless that person agrees in writing to be bound by the Brand Equity
Principles and other provisions of this Agreement relating to use and
protection of such Trademarks.



     | 18. | RIGHTS IN THE EVENT OF BANKRUPTCY 
---|---|--- 



 



-24-  The parties agree that, if any party becomes a debtor in a bankruptcy case
under the United States Bankruptcy Code and such party (or its bankruptcy
trustee) rejects this Agreement under Bankruptcy Code Section 365(a), the
other parties shall nevertheless retain and be entitled to continue to
exercise all of the licenses granted by such party under this Agreement,
whether on the basis that rejection does not result in termination of such
licenses, or that such licenses should be preserved on equitable grounds by
the bankruptcy court before which such case is pending, or by virtue of the
parties agreement hereunder.



     | 19. | INTERPRETATION 
---|---|--- 

This Agreement shall be interpreted to give DOLE maximum control of the
Trademarks and Ancillary IP Rights and their usage. Any uncertainty or
ambiguity with respect to any provision of this Agreement shall not be
construed for or against any party based on attribution of drafting to either
party. The headings contained herein are for reference purposes only and shall
not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. In the
event of any inconsistency between the terms and conditions of the
Acquisition Agreement and the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
including any inconsistencies in the definitions expressly set forth in each
agreement, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall control the
subject matter of this Agreement.



     | 20. | WAIVER AND INTEGRATION 
---|---|--- 

The failure of a party to insist upon strict adherence to any term or
provision of this Agreement, or to object to any failure to comply with any
term or provision of this Agreement, shall not be a waiver of that term or
provision, estop that party from enforcing that term or provision, or
preclude that party from enforcing that term or provision by estoppel or by
laches. The receipt by a party of any benefit from this Agreement shall
neither constitute such partys waiver nor effect an estoppel on the right of
that party to enforce any provision hereof. None of the terms of this
Agreement shall be deemed to be waived or modified, except by an express
agreement in writing, signed by an authorized officer of the party against
whom enforcement of the waiver or modification is sought, supported by new
consideration.



     | 21. | NOTICES AND COMMUNICATIONS 
---|---|--- 

Any notice, communication or legal service of process required or permitted
under this Agreement shall be effective when personally delivered in writing;
or on the date when the notice, service or communication is transmitted by
electronic facsimile (with a confirmation copy to be sent by mail) or the day
after the notice, service or communication is sent by overnight air courier
service; or five (5) days after the date of mailing. All notices shall be sent
to the parties at the notice addresses listed below or to such other persons
and notice addresses as may be designated in writing by the parties to each
other. The date a notice shall be deemed to be transmitted, sent via overnight
air courier or mailed shall be the date at the notifiers place of business

Brand Equity Principles

The DOLE Corporate Identity Guidelines (attached hereto) pertain to, and
highlight, certain branding guidelines, strategy and principles of the
Trademarks including, by way of example, emphasizing the following traits
symbolizing the Trademarks:

 



     |  |  |

Prestigious Brand - known globally for rejuvenating, natural, innovative and
vital and contributing to a healthy lifestyle  

---|---|---|--- 



     |  |  |

Premium/first-tier products and a brand that is marketed and promoted in such
a way as to cause the products and brand to be perceived by the consumer as
representative of the highest quality within the respective categories and
territories in which the products and brand are competing 

---|---|---|--- 



     |  |  |

Reputation / image for highest quality ingredients, nutrition content and
profile and with product quality equal or superior to the quality
standards, nutrition content and profile (including product formulations,
ingredients and specifications), currently used by DOLE 

---|---|---|--- 



     |  |  |

No health / safety risk and compliance with Good Agricultural Practices and
Good Manufacturing Practices 

---|---|---|--- 
 



     |  |  |

Unadulterated foods and healthy lifestyles 

---|---|---|--- 



     |  |  |

Healthy and nutritious product line, at least 95% of which must be comprised
of products that are low in fat, trans fat and saturated fat, limited
in amount of sodium and cholesterol and contain a meaningful percentage of
recommended daily allowances of one or more vitamins 

---|---|---|--- 
 

The DOLE Corporate Identity Guidelines also address the specifics of the use
of the Trademarks, _e.g._ , the acceptable size, color, variation, imagery,
topographic style and unacceptable use of the Trademarks, including usage of
the Trademarks by DOLEs partners and third party packaging contractors. EXHIBIT 4

OCCUPANCY AGREEMENT

This OCCUPANCY AGREEMENT (" _Agreement_ "), dated [ ], 2012, by
and between Lindero Headquarters Company, Inc., a California corporation ("
_Lindero_ "), and Dole Packaged Foods, LLC, a California limited liability
company (" _DPF_ "), establishes a licensor-licensee arrangement regarding
DPFs continued use of certain office space identified in _Exhibit A_ (the "
_Area_ ") in the building owned by Lindero that is located at One Dole Drive,
Westlake Village, California 91362 (the " _Building_ "), on the following
terms:

 

1\. DPF will continue to use, and Lindero agrees to permit DPF to use, the
Area as used prior to the date hereof for general office purposes and in
compliance with all applicable laws, in a professional manner, and DPF and its
employees and invitees shall not violate the rules and regulations of the
Building reasonably promulgated by Lindero from time to time. DPF will
obtain any permits and other business licenses necessary for the use of the
Area. DPF will not modify the Area or hang any signage without Linderos prior
approval.

 

2\. This Agreement begins on the date hereof (the " _Commencement Date_ "),
and terminates on the second (2nd) anniversary of the Commencement Date,
unless sooner terminated by Lindero for cause by giving thirty (30) days
written notice to DPF, or, after the eighteen (18) month anniversary of the
Commencement Date, if DPF shall have given written notice of termination not
later than the first (1st) anniversary of the Commencement Date. If Lindero
has not then terminated this Agreement for cause, and DPF has not then
terminated this Agreement, DPF shall have the right at DPFs election
to extend its use of the Area for an additional six (6) month period on the
same terms as set forth in this Agreement by giving written notice to Lindero
not less than one hundred twenty (120) days prior to the second (2nd)
anniversary of the Commencement Date. If DPF desires to use and occupy the
Area for any period in addition to that permitted under this Agreement, DPF
and Lindero shall negotiate in an attempt to agree upon the Price (as defined
below) and other applicable terms for DPFs continued use and occupancy
of the Area.

3\. During the term of this Agreement, DPF shall pay Lindero the same amount
that DPF currently pays Dole and/or Lindero for occupancy of the Area, which
amount is $295,000 per month (the " _Price_ "), on the first day of each
calendar month, with such amount prorated for any partial month of occupancy.
The Price includes the occupancy of the Area, pro rata use of common
facilities, and any pro rata portion of utilities, taxes, services (including
general repairs, maintenance, janitorial and mailroom services) and all other
incidentals currently provided by Lindero to DPF. The Price also includes
DPFs use of the same number of underground parking spaces underneath the
Building as are currently occupied by employees of DPF [], and employees of
DPF who are not assigned underground parking spaces by DPF after the Closing
shall have the same right to use above-ground parking spaces next to the
Building as employees of DPF currently have to use such above-ground parking
spaces. During the term of this Agreement, Lindero shall not change, or permit
any other party to change, the Area or parking spaces (whether underground or
above-ground) used by DPF or otherwise impose any restrictions with respect to
DPFs use or occupancy of the Area or parking spaces (whether underground or
above-ground) used by DPF that adversely affect DPFs use, occupancy and  quiet enjoyment thereof, except for such changes or restrictions that occur
as a result of repair, maintenance or improvements by or on behalf of Lindero.

 

4\. Lindero makes no representations or warranties regarding the suitability
or level of safety and security in the Building, and DPF is responsible for
adequately protecting its own possessions, work product and files.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Lindero shall provide the same level of safety
and security to DPF as Lindero provides to other tenants or occupants of the
Building. 

5\. During the term of this Agreement, DPF shall maintain general liability
insurance and all risk property insurance in connection with DPFs use of the
Area. DPF (for itself and its insureds) releases and waives any right of
recovery which it might otherwise have against Lindero because of any loss or
damage to the extent that the same is covered by DPFs insurance or which
would have been covered by DPFs insurance had it complied with the first
sentence of this paragraph. DPF shall indemnify Lindero, Dole Food Company,
Inc., and their respective officers, directors, agents,
employees, contractors, and related entities (collectively, " _Lindero
Related Parties_ ") from and against all liabilities, obligations, damages,
penalties, claims, costs, charges and expenses, including reasonable
attorneys fees, which may arise in any manner due to injury, death or
property loss to any party caused by the acts of DPF or DPFs members,
officers, directors, agents, employees, contractors, and related entities
(collectively, " _DPF s Related Parties_") in connection with this
Agreement; provided, however, DPF shall have no obligation to defend or
indemnify Lindero Related Parties from claims which are caused by the gross
negligence or willful acts of any Lindero Related Parties. 

6\. This Agreement may be modified only in writing signed by each of DPF and
Lindero. DPFs right to occupy the Area is personal to DPF and may not be
transferred or assigned. This Agreement is the only agreement between the
parties regarding DPFs use and occupancy of the Area. This Agreement shall be
governed by the laws of the State of California. This Agreement shall not be
strictly construed against the party preparing it, but shall be construed as
if all parties prepared this Agreement jointly upon the advice of their
respective legal counsel. If any provision in this Agreement is held by
any court to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remaining provisions
shall nevertheless continue in full force and effect. Any waiver by either
party of any breach of any term, covenant or condition in this Agreement or
otherwise shall be made in writing and will not be deemed a waiver of any
subsequent breach of the same or any other term, covenant or condition. Time
is of the essence of this Agreement and of every term, covenant and condition
hereof. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts (including
by means of facsimile), each of which will be deemed an original but all of
which together will constitute one and the same instrument.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement on the respective
dates set forth below.

before which such case is pending, or by virtue of the parties agreement
hereunder.

Agreement, including any inconsistencies in the definitions expressly set
forth in each agreement, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall
control the subject matter of this Agreement.



     | 14. | WAIVER AND INTEGRATION 
---|---|--- 

The failure of a party to insist upon strict adherence to any term or
provision of this Agreement, or to object to any failure to comply with any
term or provision of this Agreement, shall not be a waiver of that term or
provision, estop that party from enforcing that term or provision, or
preclude that party from enforcing that term or provision by estoppel or by
laches. The receipt by a party of any benefit from this Agreement shall
neither constitute such partys waiver nor effect an estoppel on the right of
that party to enforce any provision hereof. None of the terms of this
Agreement shall be deemed to be waived or modified, except by an express
agreement in writing, signed by an authorized officer of the party against
whom enforcement of the waiver or modification is sought, supported by new
consideration.

SHIPS USAGE AGREEMENT

SHIPS USAGE AGREEMENT (this " _SUA_ ") is entered into as of , 2012
(" _Effective Date_ ") by and between Dole Food Company, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (" _Dole_ "), and [Dole Asia Holdings Pte Ltd. (together with its
affiliated entities "DAL")] [ _need to confirm party entering into this
Agreement_ ]. Dole and [DAL] are referred to herein individually as a "
_Party_ " and collectively as the " _Parties._ "

A. Dole and ITOCHU Corporation, a Japanese _kabushiki kaisha, _ are parties
to the Acquisition Agreement, dated , 2012 (the " _Acquisition Agreement_
"), which has a Closing Date of  (" _Closing Date_ ").

B. Doles subsidiary Ventura Trading Ltd., a Bermuda corporation (" _Ventura_
"), owns the ships M/V "Tropical Star," M/V "Tropical Sky," and M/V "Tropical
Mist" (collectively the " _Ships_ ").

C. The Ships are currently under bareboat charter to Venturas
subsidiary Transfrut Express Ltd., a Bermuda corporation (" _Transfrut_ "),
pursuant to agreements between Ventura and Transfrut dated January 1, 2010.

D. Ventura has also entered into an ship management agreement, dated January
1, 2011, with Dole subsidiary Reefership Marine Services Ltd., a Bermuda
corporation (" _RMS_ "), for the management of the Ships, including crew
services.

E. Pursuant to an existing practice whereby Doles Asia Fresh Division ("
_Dole Asia Fresh_ ") pays specified management fees to RMS and reimburses all
costs incurred by Dole or its subsidiaries to operate the Ships, Dole Asia
Fresh currently operates and uses the Ships to carry Dole and third party
fresh fruit (as well as sugar and nonfood items including but not limited to,
resin, kitchen cabinets, tiles, cardboard and certain back haul cargo) between
the Philippines, Japan, China, Korea, New Zealand, and the Middle East.

F. As of the Closing Date, [DAL] desires to continue and memorialize existing
practices regarding Dole Asia Freshs operation and use of the Ships (the "
_Ship Usage_ "), and Dole similarly desires to allow continuation of the
existing Ship Usage (as well as widening on the current trade under
certain circumstances), on the terms and conditions as set forth in this SUA.

AGREEMENT

 



   1. | TERMS AND CONDITIONS RELATING TO USAGE OF THE SHIPS 
---|--- 

1.1 _Continued Ship Usage Under Currently Existing Practice._ During the Term
as defined below in Section 3.1, Dole shall allow continued Ship Usage under
the currently existing practice as follows:

(a) RMS shall continue its management of the Ships under the existing
arrangement between RMS and Ventura, in exchange for payment of a Management
Fee as described below in Section 2.1.

 



1 (b) Transfrut shall continue to maintain the Ships consistent with its current
practices in order to facilitate continued Ship Usage, and all costs, whether
budgeted or unbudgeted, incurred by Dole or any of Doles subsidiaries
(Ventura, Transfrut, or RMS) relating to the operation of the Ships (including
but not limited to operational expenses, maintenance and repair expenses,
insurance premiums, and foreign exchange risks relating to the purchase of
services and/or equipment to service the Ships) shall be advanced and paid as
described below in Section 2.2. 

(c) As under current practice, Transfrut may permit the Ships to carry
acceptable third party general cargo as well as back haul cargo (excluding,
for avoidance of doubt, any automobiles not containerized) provided that
Transfrut gives its advance written consent, which consent may be withheld by
Transfrut in its reasonable discretion. No advance written approval
is required for the following cargo (or substantially similar items), which
have been carried in the past: kitchen cabinets, tile, cardboard, panels,
resin, sugar, agrochemicals (but only to the extent that such agrochemicals
are properly packaged and contained so that they pose no hazardous risks or
contamination to the Ships hulls).

(d) [DAL] may only sub-charter the Ships during the Term with Transfruts
advance written consent, which consent may be withheld by Transfrut in its
sole discretion.

(e) While the current trade of the Ships is the Philippines, Japan, China,
Korea, New Zealand, and the Middle East, Transfrut will agree to permit
worldwide trading so long as such trade is via safe, ice free
port(s)/berth(s) and excludes war/war risked countries and excludes countries
which may result in blacklisting or sanctions by other countries and/or the
United Nations. Any proposed expansion of trade shall require Transfruts
advance written consent, which shall be provided if Transfrut deems such
proposal is in accordance this paragraph (e). No advance written approval is
required for the following routes and destinations: Japan, Korea, China,
Russia, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, New Zealand, Sri
Lanka, and the Middle East; _provided_ , _however_ , that if there is a change
of circumstances such that any of the foregoing countries or geographical
regions could be reasonably classified as a "war/war risked country" or a
"countries which may result in blacklisting or sanctions by other countries
and/or the United Nations," then Transfrut must be advised of the proposed
route in advance in order to provide or withhold consent.

1.2 _Time Charter_. Effective as of the Closing Date, Transfrut and [DAL]
shall enter into a time charter agreements ("Time Charters") whereby
Transfrut shall charter the Ships to [DAL] for the Term described below in
Section 3.1, in the forms attached as _Appendix 1_ for each Ship. Such Time
Charters shall be fully consistent with the terms and conditions as provided
in this Ships Usage Agreement, including for avoidance of doubt that costs of
any kind relating to the Ships during the Term shall be borne by [DAL] and
that the availability of Ship Usage, as well as the ongoing condition of the
Ships is made without warranties or representations of any kind by Dole or its
subsidiaries except as provided herein.

1.3 _Consents._ Dole and [DAL] will use their respective reasonable commercial
efforts to obtain any consents, approvals, permits and other authorizations,
if any, that Dole or [DAL] must obtain from any party in connection with the
Ship Usage (collectively, " _Consents_ ").

 



2 ---|--- 

2.1. _Management Fee for RMS Management Services._ In reimbursement of the
management services provided to Ventura by RMS relating to the Ships, [DAL]
shall pay Ventura a fixed fee (the " _Management Fee_ ") of three hundred
thousand dollars (U.S. $300,000.00) per year, payable in twelve (12) monthly
installments of U.S. $25,000 in advance on the first business day of each
month, until the SUA is terminated. Ventura shall issue monthly invoices to
[DAL] relating to the installment of the fixed fee. Invoices shall be due and
payable by [DAL] to Ventura no later than 30 days after receipt of such
invoice. Dole will afford [DAL], upon reasonable notice, access to
information, records and documents as may be reasonably requested in order to
verify any invoiced amount under this SUA, and the Parties will work in good
faith to resolve any disagreements or disputed inaccuracies. 

2.2. _Payments for Reimbursement of All Costs of Any Nature Relating to Usage
of the Ships._ [DAL] shall be directly responsible for procurement of all
fuel necessary for the Ships and for any stevedoring labor necessary for the
loading and unloading of the Ships. Dole and its relevant subsidiaries shall
continue the existing practice of maintaining the Ships in order to
facilitate Ship Usage, but all costs of any nature relating to the
maintenance, repair, and operation of the Ships shall be fully passed on to
[DAL] and shall be fully borne by [DAL] as provided herein. Such costs shall
include Budgeted Costs and may include Unbudgeted Costs, as provided below:

(a) _Budgeted Costs_. Each year, Transfrut shall establish an annual budget
of its anticipated costs to facilitate the Ship Usage. Such costs shall
include anticipated costs necessary to facilitate the operation of the Ships,
including but not limited to maintenance and repair expenses, insurance
premiums, and foreign exchange risks relating to the purchase of services
and/or equipment to service the Ships. Such costs shall be provided in as
reasonable detail as feasible and by category, with any relevant assumptions
described, at least 120 days prior to any Automatic Renewal Date. Transfrut
also agrees to provide any additional documentation supporting the budget and
budget assumptions, as reasonably requested. Such costs shall be allocated and
charged on per cubic feet basis of each of the Ships (the "Budgeted Costs").
During the term, Transfrut shall invoice [DAL] monthly, in advance, for
payment of the Budgeted Costs relating to the Ships for the next month. The
existing 2012 Budgeted Costs and projected 2013 Budgeted Costs are attached
hereto as _Appendix 2_. Invoices shall be due and payable by [DAL] to
Transfrut no later than 30 days after receipt of such invoice. Dole shall
ensure that Transfrut provides [DAL] with a full accounting of any excess or
deficit relating to the Budgeted Costs pursuant to the quarterly accounting
costs process described in Section 2.3.

(b)  _Unbudgeted Costs._ In addition to the Budgeted Costs, [DAL] shall be
responsible to pay for any and all costs, actual or anticipated, associated
with the maintenance, repair, or continued operation of the Ships that were
unbudgeted but become necessary in Doles good faith view for the continued
operation of the Ships necessary to facilitate the Ship Usage ("Unbudgeted
Costs.") As soon as Transfrut is reasonably certain that Unbudgeted Costs in
excess of U.S. $25,000 for any one item or occurrence are likely to be
incurred, Transfrut shall provide advance notice as promptly as reasonably
feasible to [DAL] so that Transfrut and [DAL] may discuss such costs (together
with the supporting documentation for such cost assessment) and any potential
way to mitigate such costs. Notwithstanding such good faith

 



3  consultation and discussion, if such Unbudgeted Costs are necessary in
Transfruts reasonable and good faith view in order to keep the Ships in class
and operational during the Term, then [DAL] will be promptly invoiced for any
Unbudgeted Costs and shall be provided the supporting detail, together with
any relevant documentation, for such invoice. [DAL] shall pay the full amount
of each invoice relating to Unbudgeted Costs no later than 30 days after
receipt of such invoice. Dole shall ensure that Transfrut provides [DAL] with
a full accounting of any Unbudgeted Costs and any amounts advanced in excess
of the actual costs incurred shall be returned to [DAL] pursuant to
the quarterly accounting costs process described in Section 2.3.

2.3. _Quarterly Accounting of Costs._ Each calendar quarter during the Term,
Dole shall ensure Transfrut provides [DAL] with a full accounting of the
actual costs incurred in relation to the Budgeted Costs and shall also provide
[DAL] with a full accounting of any Unbudgeted Costs. Any amounts paid by
[DAL] in excess of the Budgeted Costs for the preceding calendar quarter shall
be returned to [DAL], provided no Unbudgeted Costs are foreseen in relation to
the Ship Usage. If any Unbudgeted Costs have been incurred, or are expected to
be incurred for subsequent calendar quarters during the applicable calendar
year, then [DAL] shall advance the amounts specified by Dole or Transfrut
within 30 days. Dole will ensure that [DAL] is provided with reasonable access
to review all relevant books and records of Transfrut in connection with such
accounting.

2.4. _Fees and Costs upon Termination._ [DAL] shall immediately pay all
outstanding Management Fees or Budgeted and Unbudgeted Costs due, if any, upon
termination of this SUA.

 

2.5. _Taxes_. The amounts payable by [DAL] for Ship Usage do not include
state, local, federal or foreign sales, use, service, transfer, excise,
tariffs, duties, export or import fees, personal property, business license or
other similar taxes which may be levied or assessed in connection with this
SUA and the Ship Usage (collectively, " _Taxes_ "). [DAL] will be responsible
for and will pay all Taxes (excluding any taxes on RMSs Management Fee). In
the event Dole or its subsidiaries pays any Taxes (such as tonnage tax for the
Ships), [DAL] will reimburse such payment within 15 days after [DAL]s
receipt of invoice for the amount of the Tax paid accompanied by a copy.



   3. | TERM AND TERMINATION 
---|--- 
 

3.1. _Term_. The term of this SUA begins on the Closing Date and ends on the
date that is 12 months after the Closing Date (" _Term_ "), unless terminated
earlier pursuant to Section 3.2. Subject to Section 3.2, on each one year
anniversary of the Closing Date (each, an " _Automatic Annual Renewal Date_
"), this SUA shall automatically be renewed and extended for an additional
Term consisting of a one (1) year period.

3.2. _Termination_. [DAL] may terminate this SUA by providing Dole with no
less than 90 days prior written notice prior to each Annual Automatic Renewal
Date. Upon termination of the SUA, the Time Charters shall also terminate.

 



4 ---|--- 

4.1 [DAL] agrees and acknowledges that the Ships may require a period of dry-
docking for routine maintenance and repair in order to facilitate the Ship
Usage. Currently, M/V Tropical Mist is scheduled for a 2-3 week period of dry-
docking during 2013, and M/V Tropical Star and M/V Tropical Sky are likely to
be scheduled for dry-docking during 2014. To the extent feasible, Transfrut
agrees to keep [DAL] fully apprised of any likely drydocking so that the
parties may discuss and determine the dates for such drydocking, as well as
whether other alternatives exist. Notwithstanding any such good faith
discussions, [DAL] accepts the terms and conditions of Ship Usage, which
expressly include any dry-docking periods that may be required to
maintain the Ships, and acknowledges that any Ship subject to dry-docking
will not be available during this period.

4.2 Subject to the terms in this SUA, any portion of the Management Fee and
costs (whether Budgeted Costs or Unbudgeted Costs) that accrue during a dry-
docking period shall continue to be charged to [DAL], and the costs for the
dry-docking, once incurred, shall be amortized and invoiced to [DAL] in
monthly pro-rata charges over the Term. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
[DAL] does not terminate this Ships Usage Agreement and it is therefore
renewed for an additional Term or Terms, the costs for dry docking shall be
spread over the collective Terms and the pro-rata charges re-calculated to a

injunctive relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically in any court of competent jurisdiction, this Agreement and the
terms and provisions hereof in addition to any other remedy to which such
Party may be entitled, at law or in equity. Each of the Parties hereby further

post security as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.

be valid unless the same will be in writing and signed by DAL and Dole. No
waiver by any Party of any provision of this TSA or any default hereunder,
whether intentional or not, will be valid unless the same will be in writing
and signed by the Party making such waiver nor will such waiver be deemed to
extend to any prior or subsequent default hereunder or affect in any way any
rights arising by virtue of any prior or subsequent such default.

5.8. _Severability_. Any term or provision of this TSA that is invalid or
unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction will not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the
validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other
situation or in any other jurisdiction.

Acquisition Agreement apply to this TSA as if fully set forth herein.

5.10. _Force Majeure_. Dole will not be liable for a failure or delay in its

flood, earthquake or other natural disaster, general Internet or network
outage, act of God, riot, labor dispute, unavailability of raw materials
or supplies, war, embargo, armed hostilities or acts of terrorism, any
declaration of war by Congress or any other national or international
emergency, the intervention of any Governmental Authority, or any other cause
beyond Doles reasonable control.

5.11. _Relationship of the Parties_. Dole, in performance of this TSA, is
acting as an independent contractor to DAL, and not as a partner, joint
venturer or agent. The Parties do not intend to create by this TSA an
employer-employee relationship. Each Party retains control over its personnel,
and the employees of one Party will not be considered employees of the other
Party. Neither Party will be bound by any representation, act or omission of
the other Party. Neither Party has any right, power or authority to create any
obligation, express or implied, on behalf of the other Party.

 

5.12. _Subcontracting_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this TSA, Dole
