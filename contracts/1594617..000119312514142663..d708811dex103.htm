a transferee of a U.S. real property interest must withhold tax if the transferor is a foreign person. For U.S. tax purposes (including Section&nbsp;1445), the person treated as the owner of a disregarded entity (which has legal title to a U.S. real
property interest under local law) for federal income tax purposes will be the transferor of the property and not the disregarded entity. Because BRE/Prime Mezz 2 L.L.C., a Delaware limited liability company (&#147;<U>Transferor</U>&#148;), is a

tax purposes. To inform Lodge Holdco III L.L.C., a Delaware limited liability company, a disregarded entity (as defined below) of La Quinta Holdings Inc., a Delaware corporation (&#147;<U>Transferee</U>&#148;) that withholding of tax is not required
