Unless otherwise provided below, the following are to be adjusted and
prorated between Seller and Buyer as of 11:59 P.M. on the day that is three
Business Days preceding the Closing (the " _Cut-Off Time_ "), based upon a 365
day year, with Buyer being deemed to be the owner of the Interests during the
entire day of the Closing Date and being entitled to receive all income with
respect to the Interests, and being obligated to pay all expenses related to
the Interests, with respect to the Closing Date.

SECTION 9.1. _Taxes and Assessments_. All non-delinquent real estate and
personal property taxes and assessments with respect to the Properties for
the current year shall be prorated between Seller and Buyer as of the Closing
Date (on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over the applicable
period). Seller shall be responsible for the payment of any real estate and
personal property taxes that are delinquent before Closing. In no event shall
Seller be charged with or be responsible for any increase in the taxes on the
Properties resulting from the sale of the Interests contemplated by this
Agreement, any change in use of the Properties or Land on or after the Closing
Date, or from any improvements made or leases entered into on or after the
Closing Date. If any assessments on the Properties or Land are payable
in installments, then the installment allocable to the current period shall
be prorated (with Buyer being allocated the obligation to pay any installments
due on or after the Closing Date).

 

SECTION 9.2. _Water and Sewer Charges_. Water rates, water meter charges,
sewer rents and vault charges, if any (other than any such charges, rates or
rents which are payable by tenants of the Properties pursuant to such tenants
Space Leases, for which no adjustment shall be made), shall be adjusted and
prorated on the basis of the fiscal period for which assessed. If there is a
water meter, or meters, on the Properties, Seller agrees that it shall at the
Closing furnish a reading of same to a date not more than 30 days prior to the
Closing and the unfixed meter charges and the unfixed sewer rent thereon for
the time intervening from the date of the last reading shall be apportioned
on the basis of such last reading, and shall be appropriately readjusted after
the Closing on the basis of the next subsequent bills. Unmetered water charges
shall be apportioned on the basis of the charges therefor for the same period
of the preceding calendar year, but applying the current rate thereto.

SECTION 9.3. _Utility Charges_. Seller shall be entitled to receive a credit
as of the Closing Date to recover any and all deposits held by any utility
company with respect to the Properties as of the Closing Date to the extent
not conveyed with the Designated Companies. All charges for utilities shall
be prorated outside of the escrow contemplated herein within 60 days after the
Closing Date.

SECTION 9.6. _Insurance_. All insurance premiums relating to the Designated
Companys insurance shall be adjusted and prorated between Buyer and Seller
as of the Closing.

SECTION 9.7. _Accounts Receivable_.

 

(a) _Guest Ledger_. All revenues received or to be received from transient
guests on account of room rents, facilities occupied and the use of the
Property (including without limitation parking areas, mini-bar sales, phone
and other communication charges and the like) for the period prior to but
excluding the Cut-Off Time shall belong to Seller. At Closing, Seller shall
receive a credit in an amount equal to: (i) all amounts charged to the Guest
Ledger for all room nights up to (but not including) the night during which
the Cut-Off Time occurs, and (ii) one half ( 1⁄2) of all amounts charged to
the Guest Ledger for the room night which includes the Cut-Off Time. For the
period beginning on the day immediately following the Cut-Off Time, such
revenues collected from the Guest Ledger shall belong to Buyer and Buyer
shall be entitled to retain all deposits made and amounts collected with
respect to such Guest Ledger. For the period beginning on the day immediately
following the Cut-Off Time, revenues collected from the Guest Ledger shall
belong to Buyer. In the event that an amount less than the total amount due
from a guest is collected and such guest continued in occupancy after the Cut-
Off Time, such amount shall be pro-rated over the period of such guests
stay. The provisions of this subsection 9.7(a) will survive the Closing for
180 days.

(b) _Accounts Receivable (Other than Guest Ledger)_.

(i) At Closing, all Accounts Receivable (other than in respect of the Guest
Ledger which is addressed in subsection 9.7(a) above) shall belong to Buyer
and Buyer shall have the sole right to collect and retain all amounts
collected with respect to such Accounts Receivable. At Closing, Seller shall
receive a credit in an amount equal to the sum of: (I) 100% of all Accounts
Receivable that are 30 days or less past due as of the Closing Date; (II) 90%
of all Accounts Receivable that are 31-60 days past due as of the Closing Date
and (III) 80% of all Accounts Receivable that are more than 61 days past due
as of the Closing Date.

(ii) The Accounts Receivable addressed in this subsection 9.7(b) shall
not include the Guest Ledger, which is addressed in subsection 9.7(a).

SECTION 9.8. _Accounts Payable_. Seller shall be responsible for all
Accounts Payable to the extent attributable to the period preceding the Cut-
Off Time. Buyer shall be charged with any prepaid Accounts Payable to the
extent those Accounts Payable will benefit the Assets for the period after the
Cut-Off Time. From and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall be responsible for
paying when due all other accounts payable arising out of the operation of the
Properties from and after the Cut-Off Time.

 



24 SECTION 9.9. _Bookings; Booking Deposits_. At the Closing, Buyer shall assume
all of the obligations of Seller under the Bookings as of the Cut-Off Time,
including obligations with respect to any prepaid amounts and deposits under
the Booking Deposits not earned as of the Cut-Off Time, and Buyer shall
receive a credit against the Purchase Price at the Closing in an amount equal
to all such amounts to the extent not held by the Designated Companies (and,
therefore, Seller shall have the right to retain any amounts relating to such
items on deposit in Sellers accounts). All prepaid amounts under the Booking
Deposits for which Buyer has received credit as of the Cut-Off Time shall be
the obligation of Buyer after the Closing.

 

SECTION 9.10. _Sales, General Excise, Room and Occupancy Taxes_. Seller shall
pay all sales taxes, general excise taxes and room occupancy, hotel, resort,
and use taxes due and payable with respect to the Properties for the period
prior to the Cut-Off Time, and Buyer shall pay all sales taxes, general excise
taxes, room occupancy, hotel, resort, and use taxes due and payable with
respect to the Properties for the periods on and after the Cut-Off Time
(except as provided in Section 8.1). Seller, on the one hand, and Buyer, on
the other hand, shall each pay fifty percent (50%) of all sales taxes, general
excise taxes, room occupancy and use taxes due and payable with respect to
the Properties for the night commencing prior to and ending on the day on
which the Cut-Off Time occurs (except as provided in Section 8.1). Seller
shall be entitled to receive any rebates or refunds on such taxes paid by
Seller prior to Closing.

SECTION 9.11. _Fixed Rents and Additional Rents_.

 

(a) Fixed rents (collectively, " _Fixed Rents_ ") and Additional Rents (as
hereinafter defined; Fixed Rents and Additional Rents being together referred
to herein as " _Rents_ ") paid or payable by tenants under the Space Leases in
connection with their occupancy of the Properties shall be adjusted and
prorated on an if, as and when collected basis. Any Rents collected by Buyer
or Seller after the Closing from any tenant who owes Rents for periods prior
to the Closing, shall be applied (i) first, in payment of Rents owed by such
tenant for the month in which the Closing occurs, (ii) second, in payment of
current Rents at the time of receipt, (iii) third, to delinquent Rents, if
any, which became due after the Closing and (iv) fourth, then to delinquent
Rents, if any, which became due prior to the Closing. Each such amount, less
any costs of collection (including reasonable counsel fees) reasonably
allocable thereto, shall be adjusted and prorated as provided above, and the
party who receives such amount shall promptly pay over to the other party
the portion thereof to which it is so entitled. For the purposes of this
provision, the term " _Additional Rent_ " shall mean amounts payable under any
Space Lease for (i) the payment of additional rent based upon a percentage of
the tenants business during a specified annual or other period (sometimes
referred to as " _percentage rent_ "), (ii) so-called common area maintenance
or " _CAM_ " charges, (iii) so-called " _escalation rent_ " or additional
rent based upon increases in real estate taxes or operating expenses or labor
costs or cost of living or porters wages or otherwise and (iv) any general
excise taxes collected from the tenants.

(b) Buyer shall bill tenants who owe Rents for periods prior to the Closing
on a monthly basis following the Closing, but shall not be obligated to take
any other action to collect such Rents or to engage a collection agency or
take legal action to collect such amount. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
if Buyer shall be unable to collect such past due

 



25  Rents and any such tenant is no longer at the Properties, Seller shall have
the right to pursue such tenant to collect such delinquencies (including,
without limitation, the prosecution of one or more lawsuits, but Seller shall
not take any action to evict any such tenant or terminate any such Space
Lease). Seller shall furnish to Buyer all information relating to the period
prior to the Closing that is reasonably necessary for the billing of such
Rent and Buyer will deliver to Seller, concurrently with the delivery to
tenants, copies of all statements relating to Rent for a period prior to the
Closing. Buyer shall bill tenants for Rents for accounting periods prior to
the Closing in accordance with and on the basis of such information furnished
by Seller. The obligations of Buyer under this paragraph (b) shall survive for
three months after Closing.

 

(c) To the extent that any portion of Additional Rent is required to be paid
monthly by tenants on account of estimated amounts for any calendar year (or,
if applicable, any lease year or tax year or any other applicable accounting
period), and at the end of such calendar year (or lease year, tax year or
other applicable accounting period, as the case may be), such
estimated amounts are to be recalculated based upon the actual expenses,
taxes and other relevant factors for that calendar (lease or tax) year or
other applicable accounting period, with the appropriate adjustments being
made with such tenants, then such portion of the Additional Rent shall be
prorated between Seller and Buyer at the Closing based on such estimated
payments actually paid by tenants (i.e., with Seller entitled to provisionally
retain all monthly or other periodic installments of such amounts paid by
tenants with respect to periods prior to the calendar month or other
applicable installment period in which the Closing occurs (on a pro-rata basis
for any partial months), Seller to pay to Buyer at the Closing all monthly or
other periodic installments of such amounts theretofore received by Seller
with respect to periods following the calendar month or other applicable
installment period in which the Closing occurs and Seller and Buyer to
apportion as of the Closing all monthly or other periodic installments of
such amounts paid by tenants with respect to the calendar month or other
applicable installment period in which the Closing occurs). At the time(s) of
final calculation and collection from (or refund to) each tenant of the
amounts in reconciliation of actual Additional Rent for a period for which
estimated amounts paid by such tenant have been prorated, there shall be a re-
proration between Seller and Buyer in accordance with paragraph (a), (b) and
(c) of this Section 9.11.

(d) Until the sooner of (x) three months after Closing and (y) such time as
all amounts required to be paid to Seller by Buyer pursuant to this Section
9.11 shall have been paid in full, Buyer shall furnish to Seller, upon
Sellers reasonable request, a reporting of rents which have been collected
by Buyer after the Closing with respect to Space Leases with delinquent Rents
as of the Closing.

SECTION 9.12. _Contracts_. Charges and payments under all Contracts shall be
adjusted and prorated between Buyer and Seller as of the Closing. There shall
be no proration as of the Closing for any management agreements for the
Properties with LQ Management L.L.C.; _provided_ , _however_ , any accrued
and unpaid amounts under such management agreements from January 1, 2014
through the Closing shall be subject to the reproration provisions of _Section
9.15_.

 

SECTION 9.13. _Ground Rent_. All rent and other payments and charges due
under the Ground Leases with respect to the year in which the Closing occurs
shall be adjusted and prorated between Buyer and Seller as of the Closing.

 



26 SECTION 9.14. _Other_. If applicable, the Purchase Price shall be adjusted at
Closing to reflect the adjustment of any other item which, under the explicit
terms of this Agreement, is to be apportioned at Closing. Any other items of
operating income or operating expense that are customarily apportioned between
the parties in real estate closings of comparable commercial properties in
the metropolitan area where such Property is located, shall be prorated as
applicable.

 

SECTION 9.15. _Re-Adjustment_. In the event any prorations or apportionments
made under this Article IX shall prove to be incorrect for any reason, then
any party shall be entitled to an adjustment to correct the same. Any item
that cannot be finally prorated because of the unavailability of information,
shall be tentatively prorated on the basis of the best data then
available and reprorated when the information is available. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth herein, all reprorations contemplated by
this Agreement shall be completed within one year after Closing (subject to
extension solely as necessary due to the unavailability of final information
but in no event to exceed two years after Closing). The obligations of Seller
and Buyer under this Article IX shall survive the Closing for two years.

tenant) shall, at Sellers election, either (a) be paid to the Company and the

ARTICLE II

 

 _REGISTRATION RIGHTS_

 

SECTION 2.1 Piggyback Rights.

 

(a) If at any time following expiration of the Lockup Period (or, if earlier,
such time as any Holder exercises a demand right pursuant to Section 2.2(a))
the Company proposes to register Securities for public sale (whether proposed
to be offered for sale by the Company or by any other Person) under the
Securities Act (other than a registration on Form S-4 or S-8, or any successor
or other forms promulgated for similar purposes) in a manner which would
permit registration of Registrable Securities for sale to the public under
the Securities Act, it will, at each such time following expiration of the
Lockup Period (or if earlier, such time as any Holder exercises a demand right
pursuant to Section 2.2(a)), give prompt written notice (which notice shall
specify the intended method or methods of disposition) to the Holders of its
intention to do so and of such Holders rights under this Section 2.1. Upon
the written request of any Holder made within fifteen (15) days after the
receipt of any such notice (which request shall specify the number of
Registrable Securities intended to be disposed of by such Holder), the Company
will use its reasonable best efforts to effect the registration under the
Securities Act of all Registrable Securities which the Holders have so
requested to be registered; _provided_ that: (i) if, at any time after giving
written notice of its intention to register any Securities and prior to the
effective date of the registration statement filed in connection with such
registration, the Company shall determine for any reason not to proceed with
the proposed registration of the Securities to be sold by it, the Company may,
at its election, give written notice of such determination to the Holders
and, thereupon, the Company shall be relieved of its obligation to register
any Registrable Securities in connection with such registration (but not from
its obligation to pay the Registration Expenses incurred in connection
therewith) without prejudice to the rights of any Holder to request that such
registration be effected as a registration under Section 2.2(a); and (ii) if
such registration involves an underwritten offering, the Holders of
Registrable Securities requesting to be included in the registration must,
upon the written request of the Company, sell their Registrable Securities to
the underwriters on the same terms and conditions as apply to the other
Securities being sold through underwriters under such registration, with, in
the case of a combined primary and secondary offering, only such differences,
including any with respect to representations and warranties, indemnification
and liability insurance, as may be customary or appropriate in combined
primary and secondary offerings.

(b) _Expenses_. The Company will pay all Registration Expenses in connection
with each registration of Registrable Securities requested pursuant to this
Section 2.1.

 



-5- (c) _Priority in Piggyback Registrations_. If a registration pursuant to this
Section 2.1 involves an underwritten offering and the managing underwriter
advises the Company in writing (a copy of which shall be provided to the
Holders) that, in its opinion, the number of Registrable Securities and other
Securities requested to be included in such registration exceeds the number
which can be sold in such offering, so as to be likely to have a material and
adverse effect on the price, timing or distribution of the Securities offered
in such offering, then the Company will include in such registration: (i)
first, the Securities the Company proposes to sell for its own account; and
(ii) second, such number of Registrable Securities requested to be included in
such registration which, in the opinion of such managing underwriter, can be
sold without having the material and adverse effect referred to above, which
number of Registrable Securities shall be allocated _pro rata_ among all such
requesting Holders of Registrable Securities on the basis of the relative
number of securities requested to be included in such registration by each
such Holder. Any other selling holders of the Companys Securities (other than
transferees to whom a Holder has assigned its rights under this Agreement)
will be included in an underwritten offering only with the consent of Holders
holding a majority of the shares being sold in such offering.

 

(d) _Excluded Transactions_. The Company shall not be obligated to effect any
registration of Registrable Securities under this Section 2.1 incidental to
the registration of any of its Securities in connection with:

(i) the IPO;

 

(ii) a registration statement filed to cover issuances under employee benefits
plans or dividend reinvestment plans; or

 

(iii) any registration statement relating solely to the acquisition or merger
after the date hereof by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of or with
any other businesses.

(e) _Plan of Distribution, Underwriters and Counsel_. If a registration
pursuant to this Section 2.1 involves an underwritten offering, the Holders of
a majority of the Registrable Securities included in such underwritten
offering shall have the right to (i) determine the plan of distribution, (ii)
select the investment banker or bankers and managers to administer the
offering, including the lead managing underwriter (provided that such
investment banker or bankers and managers shall be reasonably satisfactory to
the Company) and (iii) select counsel for the selling Holders.

(f) _Shelf Takedowns_. In connection with any shelf takedown (whether
pursuant to Section 2.2(f) or at the initiative of the Company), the Holders
may exercise "piggyback" rights in the manner described in this Agreement to
have included in such takedown Registrable Securities held by them that are
registered on such shelf registration statement.

 



-6- SECTION 2.2 Demand Registration.

 

(a) _General_. At any time, upon the written request of any Holder (the "
_Demand Party_ ") requesting that the Company effect the registration under
the Securities Act of Registrable Securities and specifying the amount and
intended method of disposition thereof (including, but not limited to, an
underwritten public offering), the Company will (i) promptly give written
notice of such requested registration to the other Holders and other holders
of Securities entitled to notice of such registration, if any, and (ii) as
expeditiously as possible, use its reasonable best efforts to file a
registration statement to effect the registration under the Securities Act of:

(i) such Registrable Securities which the Company has been so requested to
register by the Demand Party in accordance with the intended method of
disposition thereof; and

 

(ii) the Registrable Securities of other Holders which the Company has been
requested to register by written request given to the Company within fifteen
(15) days after the giving of such written notice by the Company.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be obligated to file a
registration statement relating to any registration request under this Section
2.2(a):

(x) within a period of one hundred eighty (180) days (or such lesser period
as the managing underwriters in an underwritten offering may permit) after the
date of the final prospectus relating to any registration request under this
Section 2.2(a) or relating to any registration referred to in Section 2.1; or

(y) if, in the good faith judgment of a majority of the disinterested members
of the Board, the Company is in possession of material non-public information
the disclosure of which would be materially adverse to the Company and would
not otherwise be required under Law, in which case the filing of
the registration statement may be delayed until the earlier of the second
Business Day after such conditions shall have ceased to exist and the 60th day
after receipt by the Company of the written request from a Demand Party to
register Registrable Securities under this Section 2.2(a); _provided_ that
the Company shall not effect such a delay more than two times in any twelve
(12) month period.

 

(b) _Form_. Each registration statement prepared at the request of a Demand
Party shall be effected on such form as reasonably requested by the Demand
Party, including by a shelf registration pursuant to Rule 415 under the
Securities Act on a Form S-3 (or any successor rule or form thereto) if so
requested by the Demand Party and if the Company is then eligible to effect a
shelf registration and use such form for such disposition.

(c) _Expenses_. The Company will pay all Registration Expenses in connection
with each registration of Registrable Securities requested pursuant to this
Section 2.2.

 

(d) _Plan of Distribution, Underwriters and Counsel_. If a requested
registration pursuant to this Section 2.2 involves an underwritten offering,
the Holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities included in such
underwritten offering shall have

 



-7-  the right to (i) determine the plan of distribution, (ii) select the
investment banker or bankers and managers to administer the offering,
including the lead managing underwriter (provided that such investment banker
or bankers and managers shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Company) and
(iii) select counsel for the selling Holders.

 

(e) _Priority in Demand Registrations_. If a requested registration pursuant
to this Section 2.2 involves an underwritten offering and the managing
underwriter advises the Company in writing (a copy of which shall be provided
to the Holders) that, in its opinion, the number of Registrable Securities
requested to be included in such registration (including Securities of the
Company which are not Registrable Securities) exceeds the number which can be
sold in such offering, so as to be likely to have a material and adverse
effect on the price, timing or distribution of the Securities offered in
such offering, then the number of such Registrable Securities to be included
in such registration shall be allocated _pro rata_ among the Demand Party and
all other parties that have requested that their Registrable Securities be
sold pursuant to Section 2.1(a), if any, on the basis of the relative number
of securities requested to be included in such registration by each such
Holder. Any other selling holders of the Companys Securities (other than
transferees to whom a Holder has assigned its rights under this Agreement)
will be included in an underwritten offering only with the consent of Holders
holding a majority of the shares being sold in such offering.

 

(f) _Shelf Takedowns_. Upon the written request of the Demand Party at any
time and from time to time, the Company will facilitate in the manner
described in this Agreement a "takedown" of the Demand Partys Registrable
Securities off of an effective shelf registration statement. Upon the written
request of the Demand Party, the Company will file and seek the effectiveness
of a post-effective amendment to an existing shelf registration statement or a
prospectus supplement in order to register up to the number of the Demand
Partys Registrable Securities previously taken down off of such shelf by the
Demand Party and not yet "reloaded" onto such shelf registration statement.

(g) _Additional Rights_. Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, the
Company shall not grant to any Person the right to request or require the
Company to register any equity Securities of the Company, or any Securities
convertible, exchangeable or exercisable for or into such Securities, or
amend any grant of such a right, without the prior written consent of the
Holders holding a majority of the Registrable Securities subject to this
Agreement. In the event the Company engages in a merger or consolidation in
which the shares of Common Stock are converted into Securities of another
company, appropriate arrangements will be made so that the registration rights
provided under this Agreement continue to be provided to Holders by the
issuer of such Securities. To the extent such new issuer, or any other
company acquired by the Company in a merger or consolidation, was bound by
registration rights that would conflict with the provisions of this Agreement,
the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to modify any such
"inherited" registration rights so as not to interfere in any material
respects with the rights provided under this Agreement, unless otherwise
agreed by Holders then holding a majority of Registrable Securities.

 



-8- SECTION 2.3 Registration Procedures. If and whenever the Company is required
to file a registration statement with respect to, or to use its reasonable
best efforts to effect or cause the registration of, any Registrable
Securities under the Securities Act as provided in this Agreement, the Company
will as expeditiously as possible: 

(a) promptly prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on an
appropriate form with respect to such Registrable Securities and use its
reasonable best efforts to cause such registration statement to become
effective; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company may discontinue any
registration of Securities which it has initiated for its own account at any
time prior to the effective date of the registration statement relating
thereto (and, in such event, the Company shall pay the Registration Expenses
incurred in connection therewith); and _provided_ , _further_ , that
before filing a registration statement or prospectus, or any amendments or
supplements thereto, the Company will (i) furnish to counsel for the sellers
of Registrable Securities covered by such registration statement copies of all
documents proposed to be filed, which documents will be subject to the review
of such counsel, (ii) fairly consider such reasonable changes in any such
documents prior to or after the filing thereof as the counsel to the sellers

representatives of the Company as shall be reasonably requested by the sellers
of the Registrable Securities being sold available for discussion of such
documents;

 

(b) prepare and file with the SEC such amendments and supplements to such
registration statement and the prospectus used in connection therewith as may
be necessary to keep such registration statement effective for a period not in
excess of two (2) years (which period shall not be applicable in the case of a
shelf registration effected pursuant to a request under Section 2.2(b)) and
to comply with the provisions of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act with
respect to the disposition of all Securities covered by such registration
statement during such period in accordance with the intended methods
of disposition by the seller or sellers thereof set forth in such
registration statement; _provided_ that before filing a registration statement
or prospectus, or any amendments or supplements thereto, the Company will (i)
furnish to counsel for the sellers of Registrable Securities covered by such
registration statement copies of all documents proposed to be filed, which
documents will be subject to the review of such counsel, (ii) fairly consider
such reasonable changes in any such documents prior to or after the filing

and summary prospectus), in conformity with the requirements of the Securities

-9- (d) use its reasonable best efforts to register or qualify such

Securities owned by such seller;

material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances then
existing, and at the request of any such seller, prepare and furnish to such
seller a reasonable number of copies of an amended or supplemental prospectus
as may be necessary so that, as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of such
Registrable Securities, such prospectus shall not include an untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in the
light of the circumstances then existing;

reasonable best efforts to provide a transfer agent and registrar for such
Registrable Securities covered by such registration statement not later than
the effective date of such registration statement;

 

(i) enter into such customary agreements (including an underwriting agreement
in customary form), which may include indemnification provisions in favor of
underwriters and other Persons in addition to, or in substitution for the

reasonably request in order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of such
Registrable Securities;

reasonably requested by any such seller, underwriter, attorney, accountant or

information as the managing underwriter or agent or such Holder reasonably
requests to be included therein, including, with respect to the number of
Registrable Securities being sold by such Holder to such underwriter or agent,
the purchase price being paid therefor by such underwriter or agent and with
respect to any other terms of the underwritten offering of the Registrable

denominations and registered in such names as the managing underwriter or
agent, if any, or the Holders may request;

of the Company to participate with the Holders of Registrable Securities and
any underwriters in any "road shows" that may be reasonably requested by the
Holders in connection with distribution of Registrable Securities;

 

(r) obtain for delivery to the Holders of Registrable Securities being

SECTION 2.4 Other Registration-Related Matters.

(a) The Company may require any Person that is Transferring Securities in a
Public Offering pursuant to Sections 2.1 or 2.2 to furnish to the Company in
writing such information regarding such Person and pertinent to the disclosure
requirements relating to the registration and the distribution of the
Registrable Securities which are included in such Public Offering as the
Company may from time to time reasonably request in writing.

(b) Each Holder agrees that, upon receipt of any notice from the Company of
the happening of any event of the kind described in Section 2.3(f), it will
forthwith discontinue disposition of Registrable Securities pursuant to the
registration statement covering such Registrable Securities until its receipt
of the copies of the amended or supplemented prospectus contemplated by

the Company or destroy (at the Companys expense) all copies, other than
permanent file copies then in their possession, of the prospectus covering
such Registrable Securities current at the time of receipt of such notice. In
the event the Company gives any such notice, the period for which the Company
will be required to keep the registration statement effective will be extended
by the number of days during the period from and including the date of the
giving of such notice pursuant to Section 2.3(f) to and including the date
when each seller of Registrable Securities covered by such registration
statement has received the copies of the supplemented or amended prospectus
contemplated by Section 2.3(f).

 

(c) Each Holder agrees that, upon receipt of any notice from the Company of
the happening of any event of the kind described in Section 2.3(l)(iv), it
will forthwith discontinue disposition of Registrable Securities pursuant to
the registration

 



-12-  statement covering such Registrable Securities until the lifting of such
stop order, other order or suspension or the termination of such proceedings
and, if so directed by the Company, each Holder will deliver to the Company
or destroy (at the Companys expense) all copies, other than permanent file
copies then in its possession, of the prospectus covering such Registrable
Securities current at the time of receipt of such notice. In the event the
Company gives any such notice, the period for which the Company will be
required to keep the registration statement effective will be extended by the
number of days during the period from and including the date of the giving of
such notice pursuant to Section 2.3(l)(iv) to and including the date when
such stop order, other order or suspension is lifted or such proceedings are
terminated.

 

(d) (i) Each Holder (x) hereby agrees, with respect to the Registrable
Securities owned by such Holder, to be bound by any and all restrictions on
the sale, disposition, distribution, hedging or other Transfer of any interest
in Registrable Securities imposed on Blackstone and/or its Affiliates in
connection with the IPO by the underwriters managing such offering for the
duration of the term of such restriction (the period in which such sale,
disposition, distribution, hedging or other Transfer of any interest is
restricted, the " _Lockup Period_ ") and (y) will, in connection with a
Public Offering of the Companys equity Securities (whether for the Companys
account or for the account of any Holder or Holders, or both), upon the
request of the Company or of the underwriters managing any underwritten
offering of the Companys Securities, agree in writing not to effect any
sale, disposition or distribution of Registrable Securities (other than those
included in the Public Offering) without the prior written consent of the
managing underwriter for such period of time commencing seven (7) days before
and ending one hundred eighty (180) days (or such earlier date as the managing
underwriter shall agree) after the date of the final prospectus relating to
such offering; _provided_ that the Company shall cause all directors and
executive officers of the Company, Holders of more than 5% of the Registrable
Securities and all other Persons with registration rights with respect to the
Companys Securities (whether or not pursuant to this Agreement) to enter
into agreements similar to those contained in this Section 2.4(d)(i) (without
regard to this proviso); and (ii) the Company and its Subsidiaries will, in
connection with an underwritten Public Offering of the Companys Securities
in respect of which Registrable Securities are included, upon the request of
the underwriters managing such offering, agree in writing not to effect any
sale, disposition or distribution of equity Securities of the Company (other
than those included in such Public Offering, offered pursuant to Section
2.2(f), offered on Form S-8, issuable upon conversion of Securities or upon
the exercise of options, or the grant of options in the ordinary course of
business pursuant to then-existing management equity plans or equity-based
employee benefit plans, in each case outstanding on the date a notice is given
by the Company pursuant to Section 2.1(a) or a request is made pursuant to
Section 2.2(a), as the case may be), without the prior written consent of the
managing underwriter, for such period of time commencing seven (7) days before
and ending one hundred eighty (180) days (or such earlier date as the managing
underwriter shall agree) after the date of the final prospectus relating to
such sale.

 



-13- (e) With a view to making available the benefits of certain rules and
regulations of the SEC which may at any time permit the sale of Securities of
the Company to the public without registration after such time as a public
market exists for Registrable Securities, the Company agrees:

 

(i) to make and keep public information available, as those terms are
understood and defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act, at all times
after the effective date of the first registration under the Securities Act
filed by the Company for an offering of its Securities to the public;

 

(ii) to use its commercially reasonable efforts to then file with the SEC in a
timely manner all reports and other documents required of the Company under
the Securities Act and the Exchange Act (at any time after it has become
subject to such reporting requirements); and

 

(iii) so long as a Holder owns any Registrable Securities, to furnish to such
Holder promptly upon request: (A) a written statement by the Company as to
its compliance with the reporting requirements of Rule 144 (at any time after
ninety (90) days after the effective date of the first registration statement
filed by the Company for an offering of its Securities to the public), and of
the Securities Act and the Exchange Act (at any time after it has become
subject to such reporting requirements); (B) a copy of the most recent annual
or quarterly report of the Company; and (C) such other reports and documents
of the Company as such Holder may reasonably request in availing itself or
himself of any rule or regulation of the SEC allowing such Holder to sell any
such Securities without registration.

 

(f) Counsel to represent Holders of Registrable Securities shall be selected
by the Holders of at least a majority of the Registrable Securities included
in the relevant registration.

(g) Each of the parties hereto agrees that the registration rights provided
to the Holders herein are not intended to, and shall not be deemed to,
override or limit any other restrictions on Transfer to which any such Holder
may otherwise be subject.

 

ARTICLE III

 

 _INDEMNIFICATION_

SECTION 3.1 Indemnification by the Company. In the event of any registration
of any Securities of the Company under the Securities Act pursuant to Section
2.1 or 2.2, the Company hereby indemnifies and agrees to hold harmless, to the
fullest extent permitted by Law, each Holder who sells Registrable Securities
covered by such registration statement, each Affiliate of such Holder and
their respective directors and officers or general and limited partners (and
the directors, officers, employees, Affiliates and controlling Persons of any
of the foregoing), each other Person who participates as an underwriter in the
offering or sale of such Securities and each other Person, if any, who
controls such Holder or any such underwriter within the meaning of the
Securities Act (each, and " _Indemnified Party_ " and collectively, the "
_Indemnified Parties_ "), against any and all losses, claims, damages or
liabilities, joint or several, and reasonable and documented expenses to
which such Indemnified Party may become subject

 



-14-  under the Securities Act, common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses,
claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof,
whether or not such Indemnified Party is a party thereto) arise out of or are
based upon: (a) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any
material fact contained in any registration statement under which such
Securities were registered under the Securities Act, any preliminary, final
or summary prospectus contained therein, any "written communication" (as
defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act) that constitutes an offer to
sell or solicitation of an offer to buy the shares of Common Stock (each such
communication by the Company or its agents and representatives (other than any
document not constituting a prospectus pursuant to Section 2(a)(10)(a) of the
Securities Act or Rule 134 under the Securities Act) an " _Issuer
Free Writing Prospectus_ ") or any "issuer information" filed or required to
be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act, or any amendment or
supplement thereto, or any document incorporated by reference therein, or
any other such disclosure document (including reports and other documents
filed under the Exchange Act and any document incorporated by reference
therein) or related document or report; (b) any omission or alleged omission
to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
to make the statements therein not misleading, in the case of a prospectus, in
the light of the circumstances when they were made; or (c) any violation or
alleged violation by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of any federal,
state, foreign or common law rule or regulation applicable to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries and relating to action or inaction in connection with
any such registration, disclosure document or related document or report, and
the Company will reimburse such Indemnified Party for any legal or other
expenses reasonably incurred by it in connection with investigating or
defending any such loss, claim, liability, action or proceeding;  _provided_
that the Company will not be liable to any Indemnified Party in any such case
to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage, liability (or action or
proceeding in respect thereof) or expense arises out of or is based upon
any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged
omission made in such registration statement, in any such preliminary, final
or summary prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto in reliance upon
and in conformity with written information with respect to such Indemnified
Party furnished to the Company by such Indemnified Party expressly for use in
the preparation thereof. Such indemnity will remain in full force and effect
regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of such Holder or any
Indemnified Party and will survive the Transfer of such Securities by such
Holder or any termination of this Agreement.

 

SECTION 3.2 Indemnification by the Holders and Underwriters. The Company may
require, as a condition to including any Registrable Securities in any
registration statement filed in accordance with Section 2.1 or 2.2, that the
Company shall have received an undertaking reasonably satisfactory to it from
the Holder of such Registrable Securities or any prospective underwriter
to indemnify and hold harmless (in the same manner and to the same extent as
set forth in Section 3.1) the Company, all other Holders or any prospective
underwriter, as the case may be, and any of their respective Affiliates,
directors, officers and controlling Persons, with respect to any untrue
statement in or omission from such registration statement, any preliminary,
final or summary prospectus contained therein, any Issuer Free Writing
Prospectus or any "issuer information" filed or required to be filed pursuant
to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act, or any amendment or supplement, if
such untrue statement or omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity
with written information with respect to such Holder or underwriter furnished
to the Company by such Holder or underwriter expressly for use in the
preparation of such registration statement, preliminary, final or summary
prospectus or amendment or supplement, or 

 



-15-  a document incorporated by reference into any of the foregoing. Such
indemnity will remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation
made by or on behalf of the Company or any of the Holders, or any of their
respective Affiliates, directors, officers or controlling Persons and will
survive the Transfer of such Securities by such Holder. In no event shall the
liability of any selling Holder of Registrable Securities hereunder be
greater in amount than the dollar amount of the proceeds actually received by
such Holder upon the sale of the Registrable Securities giving rise to such
indemnification obligation.

 

SECTION 3.3 Notices of Claims, Etc. Promptly after receipt by an Indemnified
Party hereunder of written notice of the commencement of any action or
proceeding with respect to which a claim for indemnification may be made
pursuant to this Article III, such Indemnified Party will, if a claim in
respect thereof is to be made against an indemnifying party, give written
notice to the latter of the commencement of such action; _provided_ that the
failure of the Indemnified Party to give notice as provided herein will not
relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations under Section 3.1 or 3.2,
except to the extent that the indemnifying party is actually prejudiced by
such failure to give notice. In case any such action is brought against an
Indemnified Party, unless in such Indemnified Partys reasonable judgment a
conflict of interest between such indemnified and indemnifying parties may
exist in respect of such claim, the indemnifying party will be entitled to
participate in and to assume the defense thereof, jointly with any other
indemnifying party similarly notified to the extent that it may wish, with
counsel selected by the Holders of at least a majority of the Registrable
Securities included in the relevant registration, and after notice from the
indemnifying party to such Indemnified Party of its election so to assume
the defense thereof, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such
Indemnified Party for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the
latter in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of
investigation. If, in such Indemnified Partys reasonable judgment, having
common counsel would result in a conflict of interest between the interests of
such indemnified and indemnifying parties, then such Indemnified Party may
employ separate counsel reasonably acceptable to the indemnifying party to
represent or defend such Indemnified Party in such action, it being
understood, however, that the indemnifying party will not be liable for the
reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys at
any time for all such Indemnified Parties (and not more than one separate firm
of local counsel at any time for all such Indemnified Parties) in such action.
No indemnifying party will consent to entry of any judgment or enter into
any settlement which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the
giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such Indemnified Party of a release
from all liability in respect of such claim or litigation.

 

SECTION 3.4 Contribution. If the indemnification provided for hereunder from
the indemnifying party is unavailable to an Indemnified Party hereunder in
respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to
herein for reasons other than those described in the proviso in the first
sentence of Section 3.1, then the indemnifying party, in lieu of
indemnifying such Indemnified Party, shall contribute to the amount paid or
payable by such Indemnified Party as a result of such losses, claims, damages,
liabilities or expenses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the
relative fault of the indemnifying party and Indemnified Parties in
connection with the actions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages,
liabilities or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable
considerations. The relative fault of such indemnifying party and Indemnified
Parties shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any
action in question, including any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a

 



-16-  material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact, has
been made by, or relates to information supplied by, such indemnifying party
or Indemnified Parties, and the parties relative intent, knowledge, access
to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such action. The amount
paid or payable by a party under this Section 3.4 as a result of the losses,
claims, damages, liabilities and expenses referred to above shall be deemed
to include any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such
party in connection with any investigation or proceeding. In no event shall
the liability of any selling Holder of Registrable Securities hereunder be
greater in amount than the dollar amount of the proceeds actually received by
such Holder upon the sale of the Registrable Securities giving rise to such
contribution obligation.

 

The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if
contribution pursuant to this Section 3.4 were determined by _pro rata_
allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of
the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding
paragraph. No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the
meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to
contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent
misrepresentation.

 

SECTION 3.5 Other Indemnification. Indemnification similar to that specified
in this Article III (with appropriate modifications) shall be given by the
Company and each seller of Registrable Securities with respect to any required
registration or other qualification of Securities under any Law or with any
Governmental Authority other than as required by the Securities Act.

 

SECTION 3.6 Non-Exclusivity. The obligations of the parties under this Article
III will be in addition to any liability which any party may otherwise have
to any other party.

ARTICLE IV

 

 _OTHER_

SECTION 4.1 Notices. Any notice, request, instruction or other document to be

prepaid, return receipt requested, (c) one (1) Business Day after being sent

hereunder disproportionately to other Holders without the written consent of
such Holder. No waiver by any party of any of the provisions hereof will be
effective unless explicitly set forth in writing and executed by the party so
waiving. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, no action taken
pursuant to this Agreement, including without limitation, any investigation
by or on behalf of any party, will be deemed to constitute a waiver by the
party taking such action of compliance with any covenants or agreements
contained herein. The waiver by any party hereto of a breach of any provision
of this Agreement will not operate or be construed as a waiver of any
subsequent breach.

SECTION 4.4 Third Parties. This Agreement does not create any rights, claims
or benefits inuring to any person that is not a party hereto nor create or
establish any third party beneficiary hereto.

 

SECTION 4.5 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed

jurisdiction and any similar grounds, consents to service of process by mail

rendered thereby in connection with this Agreement.

ANY RIGHTS OR REMEDIES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.

SECTION 4.8 Specific Performance. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges and
agrees that in the event of any breach of this Agreement by any of them, the
non-breaching party would be irreparably harmed and could not be made whole by
monetary damages. Each party accordingly agrees to waive the defense in any
action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate and
that the parties, in addition to any other remedy to which they may be
entitled at law or in equity, shall be entitled to compel specific
performance of this Agreement.

SECTION 4.9 Entire Agreement. This Agreement sets forth the entire
understanding of the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter
hereof. There are no agreements, representations, warranties, covenants or
undertakings with respect to the subject matter hereof other than those

 _FIRPTA Affidavit_

_FORM OF FIRPTA CERTIFICATE_

Section 1445 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_
"), provides that a transferee of a U.S. real property interest must withhold
tax if the transferor is a foreign person. For U.S. tax purposes (including
Section 1445), the person treated as the owner of a disregarded entity (which
has legal title to a U.S. real property interest under local law) for federal
income tax purposes will be the transferor of the property and not the
disregarded entity. Because BRE/Prime Mezz 2 L.L.C., a Delaware limited
liability company (" _Transferor_ "), is a disregarded entity the assets of
which are treated for federal income tax purposes as indirectly owned by WIH
Hotels L.L.C., a Delaware limited liability company (" _Tax Owner_ "), Tax
Owner is the transferor of the property for U.S. tax purposes. To inform
Lodge Holdco III L.L.C., a Delaware limited liability company, a disregarded
entity (as defined below) of La Quinta Holdings Inc., a Delaware corporation
(" _Transferee_ ") that withholding of tax is not required upon disposition
of a U.S. real property interest by Transferor, which is a disregarded entity
for U.S. federal income tax purposes) the undersigned hereby certifies the
following on behalf of the Tax Owner:

 

(a) Tax Owner is not a foreign corporation, foreign partnership, foreign trust
or foreign estate (as those terms are defined in the Code and Treasury
Regulations);

(b) Transferor is a disregarded entity as defined in Treasury Regulations
Section 1.1445-2(b)(2)(iii), the assets of which are, for such purposes,
treated as owned by Tax Owner.

(c) The U.S. employer identification number of Tax Owner is  .

(d) Tax Owner has an address at  .

 

This certification is given to Transferee with respect to the transfer of the
Assets as such term is defined in that certain Agreement of Purchase and Sale
dated as of , 2014, among Transferor and Transferee, for the
purpose of establishing and documenting the nonforeign affidavit exemption to
the withholding requirement of Section 1445 of the Code.

Transferor understands that this certification may be disclosed to the
Internal Revenue Service by Transferee and that any false statement contained
herein could be punished by fine, imprisonment or both.

[Signature Page Follows] Under penalty of perjury, I declare that I have examined this certification
and to the best of my knowledge and belief it is true, correct and complete,
and I further declare that I have the authority to sign this document on
