the best interests of their respective corporations and shareholders to consummate the strategic
business combination transaction provided for herein in which CVBG will, subject to the terms and
conditions set forth herein, merge with and into GCBS (the &#147;Merger&#148;), so that GCBS is the surviving

the Merger;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of GCBS and CVBG have each determined that the Merger and the

exchange for each common share, par value $0.50 per share, of CVBG (the &#147;CVBG Common Stock&#148;), (a)
$10.25 in cash, or (b)&nbsp;0.2674 common shares, $2.00 par value, of GCBS (&#147;GCBS Common Stock&#148;),

and
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, for Federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger will qualify as a

change shall (i)&nbsp;alter or change the amount of Merger Consideration (as defined below) to be
provided to holders of CVBG Common Stock (as defined below) as provided for in this Agreement, (ii)
adversely affect the tax treatment of holders of CVBG Common Stock as a result of receiving the
Merger Consideration or (iii)&nbsp;materially impede or delay consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.2 <I>Effective Time</I>. The Merger shall become effective as set forth in the articles of merger
that shall be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Tennessee (the &#147;Tennessee
Secretary&#148;), or such time thereafter as is agreed to in writing by GCBS and CVBG and so provided in
the certificate of merger filed with the Tennessee Secretary. The term &#147;Effective Time&#148; shall be
