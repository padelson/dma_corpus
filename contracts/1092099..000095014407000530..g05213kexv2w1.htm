AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

   

 AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of January 25, 2007 (this "Agreement"), by and between Greene County Bancshares, Inc., a Tennessee corporation ("GCBS") and CIVITAS BankGroup, Inc., a Tennessee corporation ("CVBG"), and. 

  

RECITALS: 

   

 WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of GCBS and CVBG have approved, and deem it advisable and in the best interests of their respective corporations and shareholders to consummate the strategic business combination transaction provided for herein in which CVBG will, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, merge with and into GCBS (the "Merger"), so that GCBS is the surviving corporation (hereinafter sometimes referred to in such capacity as the "Surviving Corporation") in the Merger; 

  

 WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of GCBS and CVBG have each determined that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby are consistent with, and in furtherance of, their respective business strategies and goals; 

  

 WHEREAS, as a result of the Merger, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, CVBG will cease to have a separate corporate existence, and shareholders of CVBG will receive from GCBS in exchange for each common share, par value $0.50 per share, of CVBG (the "CVBG Common Stock"), (a) $10.25 in cash, or (b) 0.2674 common shares, $2.00 par value, of GCBS ("GCBS Common Stock"), subject, in each case, to any adjustments pursuant to this Agreement; 

  

 WHEREAS, in connection with the Merger, each shareholder of CVBG will be entitled to elect to receive, in exchange for such shareholders shares of CVBG Common Stock, either (a) cash, (b) shares of GCBS Common Stock or (c) a combination of cash and shares of GCBS Common Stock, as determined in accordance with the terms of this Agreement; 

  

 WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe certain conditions to the Merger; and 

  

 WHEREAS, for Federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger will qualify as a reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and the parties intend, by executing this Agreement, to adopt a plan of reorganization within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a). 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual covenants, representations, warranties, agreements, and conditions contained herein, and intending to be legally bound hereby, GCBS and CVBG agree as follows: 

   ##### 

  

  

ARTICLE I. 
 THE MERGER 

   

 1.1 _The Merger_. 

  

 (a) Upon the terms and subject to conditions set forth in this Agreement, in accordance with the Tennessee Business Corporation Act (the "TBCA"), at the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.2), CVBG shall merge with and into GCBS. GCBS shall be the Surviving Corporation in the Merger, and shall continue its corporate existence under the laws of the State of Tennessee. Upon consummation of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of CVBG shall terminate. As a result of the Merger, the outstanding shares of CVBG Common Stock and any shares of CVBG Common Stock held in treasury by CVBG shall be cancelled or converted in the manner provided in this Article. 

  

 (b) The parties may by mutual agreement at any time change the method of effecting the combination of GCBS and CVBG including without limitation the provisions of this Article I, if and to the extent they deem such change to be desirable, including without limitation to provide for a merger of CVBG with and into a wholly-owned subsidiary of GCBS; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such change shall (i) alter or change the amount of Merger Consideration (as defined below) to be provided to holders of CVBG Common Stock (as defined below) as provided for in this Agreement, (ii) adversely affect the tax treatment of holders of CVBG Common Stock as a result of receiving the Merger Consideration or (iii) materially impede or delay consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 1.2 _Effective Time_. The Merger shall become effective as set forth in the articles of merger that shall be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Tennessee (the "Tennessee Secretary"), or such time thereafter as is agreed to in writing by GCBS and CVBG and so provided in the certificate of merger filed with the Tennessee Secretary. The term "Effective Time" shall be the date and time when the Merger becomes effective, as set forth in the Articles of Merger. 

  

 1.3 _Effects of the Merger_. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall have the effects set forth in Section 48-21-108 of the TBCA and further as set forth in this Article below. 

  

 1.4 _Conversion of CVBG Common Stock._ At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof: 

  

 (a) Subject to this Section 1.4 and Sections 1.5 and 1.6, each share of CVBG Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of CVBG Common Stock to be cancelled or converted to treasury shares of the Surviving Corporation in accordance with Section 1.4(d)) shall be converted into the right to receive, at the election of the holder thereof: 

  

 (i) the number of shares of GCBS Common Stock that is equal to the Exchange Ratio, as defined in Section 1.4(b) (the "Per Share Stock Consideration"); or 

  

 (ii) a cash amount equal to $10.25 (the Per Share Cash Consideration); 

   ##### 

  

 

 _provided however,_ that any shares of CVBG Common Stock with respect to
which the holder owns two hundred (200) or fewer shares of record as of the
Election Deadline, as defined in Section 1.5(a)(ii), shall be converted into
the right to receive Per Share Cash Consideration, and no such shares of CVBG
Common Stock shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share
Stock Consideration. Any such shares of CVBG Common Stock are hereinafter
referred to as "Mandatory Cash Shares." The foregoing consideration,
collectively and in the aggregate, along with the Per Option Consideration
defined below, shall be referred to herein as the "Merger Consideration." All
of the shares of CVBG Common Stock converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically
be canceled and shall cease to exist as of the Effective Time, and each
certificate previously representing any such shares of CVBG Common
Stock (each, a "Certificate") shall thereafter represent only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration. 

   

 (b) Unless adjusted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the "Exchange Ratio" shall be 0.2674. The Exchange Ratio shall be subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 1.4(e) or Section 1.4(f). 

  

 (c) Subject to the allocation provisions of Section 1.5 below, each holder of a share of CVBG Common Stock may elect to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration or the Per Share Cash Consideration for each such share of CVBG Common Stock; provided, however, that the aggregate amount of cash consideration with respect to which the Per Share Cash Consideration shall be paid as the Merger Consideration, including payments to holders of fractional shares under Section 1.6, option holders under Section 1.7, and holders of Mandatory Cash Shares, shall be: 

  

30% times ((the number of shares of CVBG Common Stock outstanding at the
Effective Time times the Per Share Cash Consideration) plus (the Total Option
Consideration defined in Section 1.7))

  

Such amount of cash paid as Merger Consideration shall be referred to as the
"Total Cash Merger Consideration." The remaining Merger Consideration paid in
the form of shares of GCBS Common Stock shall be referred to in this
Agreement as the "Total Stock Merger Consideration." 

   

 (d) All shares of CVBG Common Stock held by CVBG as treasury shares shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no shares of GCBS Common Stock or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange thereof. All shares of CVBG Common Stock, if any, that are beneficially owned by GCBS (excluding shares in trust accounts, managed accounts and the like or shares held in satisfaction of a debt previously contracted), upon conversion into shares of GCBS Common Stock, shall become treasury shares of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 (e) Revision of Exchange Ratio. 

  

 (i) For the purposes of this Section 1.4(e), the following terms shall have the meanings indicated: 

   ##### 

  

  

 1. "Average Closing Price" shall mean average closing price of the GCBS Common Stock as reported on the NASDAQ Global Select Market for the 20 Business Days immediately preceding, and inclusive of, the Measurement Date. 

  

 2. "Relative Change Percentage" shall mean the GCBS Price Change Percentage less the Index Change Percentage. 

  

 3. "GCBS Price Change Percentage" shall mean the percentage change between the Starting Share Price and the Average Closing Price. 

  

 4. "Index" shall mean the NASDAQ Bank Index. 

  

 5. "Index Change Percentage" shall mean the percentage change in the Index from November 14, 2006, to the Measurement Date. 

  

 6. "Measurement Date" shall mean the date that is ten trading days prior to the Closing. 

  

 7. "Starting Share Price" shall mean $38.33 

  

 (ii) If the Average Closing Price is more than $41.778 and the Relative Change Percentage is greater than +10%, then the Exchange Ratio will be recalculated as follows: 

  

10.25/(Starting Share Price times (1 plus (Relative Change Percentage minus
10%))) 
 However, in no event shall the Exchange Ratio be less than .2380.

   

      |   |   
---|---|--- 
   Example:  |   | Average Closing Price is $45.42 (+18.5% GCBS
Price Change Percentage) 
 Index Change Percentage is +3% (resulting in Relative Change Percentage of
15.5%) 
 New Exchange Ratio = 10.25/(38.33 times (1 plus .05)) = 0.2547  
  

  

 (iii) If the Average Closing Price is less than $34.182 and the Relative Change Percentage is less than -10%, then the Exchange Ratio will be recalculated as follows: 

  

10.25/(Starting Share Price times (1 plus (Relative Change Percentage plus
10%))) 
 However, in no event shall the Exchange Ratio be greater than .2968.

   

      |   |   
---|---|--- 
   Example:   |   | Average Closing Price is $30.28 (-21% GCBS Price
Change Percentage) 
 Index Change Percentage is -5% (resulting in Relative Change Percentage of
-16%) 
 New Exchange Ratio = 10.25/(38.33 times (1 minus .06)) = 0.2845  
  

  

 (f) The Exchange Ratio set forth above shall be subject to appropriate adjustments in the event that, subsequent to the date of this Agreement but prior to the Effective Time, the outstanding GCBS Common Stock shall have been increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or securities through reorganization, 

   ##### 

  

 

recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock
split or other like changes in GCBSs capitalization. 

   

 1.5 _Election and Allocation Procedures._  

  

 (a) Election Procedures. 

  

 (i) An election form ("Election Form"), together with the other transmittal materials described in Section 2.2(a), shall be mailed as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (provided that it need not be sent until the Requisite Regulatory Approvals (as defined in Section 7.1(c)) have been obtained) to each holder of CVBG Common Stock of record at the Effective Time. Such date of mailing shall be referred to hereinafter as the "Mailing Date." Illinois Stock Transfer Company will act as agent (the "Exchange Agent") for purposes of conducting the election procedure and the exchange and payment procedures as described in this Section 1.5. Each Election Form shall permit a holder (or the beneficial owner through appropriate and customary documentation and instruction) of CVBG Common Stock to elect to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration with respect to all or any of such holders CVBG Common Stock (shares as to which the election is made, "Cash Election Shares"). The "Cash Election Amount" shall be equal to the Per Share Cash Consideration multiplied by the total number of Cash Election Shares. All shares of CVBG Common Stock other than the Cash Election Shares and the No Election Shares (as defined below) shall be referred to herein as the "Stock Election Shares." 

  

 (ii) Any share of CVBG Common Stock with respect to which the holder (or the beneficial owner, as the case may be) shall not have submitted to the Exchange Agent an effective, properly completed Election Form on or before a date after the Closing Date to be agreed upon by the parties hereto (which date will be set forth on the Election Form), but in any event not earlier than 15 days after the Mailing Date (such deadline, the "Election Deadline"), shall be converted either into the Per Share Stock Consideration or the Per Share Cash Consideration as set forth in Section 1.5(b). 

  

 (iii) Any such election shall have been properly made only if the Exchange Agent shall have actually received a properly completed Election Form by the Election Deadline. An Election Form shall be deemed properly completed only if accompanied by one or more certificates (or customary affidavits and indemnification regarding the loss or destruction of such certificates or the guaranteed delivery of such certificates) representing all CVBG Common Stock covered by such Election Form, together with duly executed transmittal materials included with the Election Form. Any Election Form may be revoked or changed by the person submitting such Election Form (or the beneficial owner of the shares covered by such Election Form through appropriate and customary documentation and instruction) at or prior to the Election Deadline. In the event an Election Form is revoked prior to the Election Deadline and no other valid election is made, the shares of CVBG Common Stock represented by such Election Form shall be No Election Shares. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and of the Election Form, the Exchange Agent shall have reasonable discretion to determine whether any election, revocation or change has been properly or timely made and to disregard immaterial defects in the Election Forms, and any good faith decisions of the Exchange Agent regarding 

   ##### 

  

 

such matters shall be binding and conclusive. Neither GCBS nor the Exchange
Agent shall be under any obligation to notify any person of any defect in an
Election Form. 

   

 (b) Allocation Procedures. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, GCBS shall cause the Exchange Agent to allocate the Total Cash Merger Consideration and Total Stock Merger Consideration among the holders of CVBG Common Stock and CVBG Stock Options, which shall be effected by the Exchange Agent as follows: 

  

 (i) Mandatory Cash Shares and CVBG Stock Options shall be paid their appropriate portion of the Total Cash Merger Consideration. 

  

 (ii) If the remaining Total Cash Merger Consideration is greater than the Cash Election Amount, then: 

  

 1. each Cash Election Share shall be converted into the right to receive an amount of cash equal to the Per Share Cash Consideration; 

  

 2. the Exchange Agent will select, on a pro rata basis, first from among the holders of No Election Shares and then, if necessary, from among the holders of Stock Election Shares, a sufficient number of such shares ("Cash Designee Shares") such that the sum of Cash Designee Shares and Cash Election Shares multiplied by the Per Share Cash Consideration equals as closely as practicable the Total Cash Merger Consideration. Each Cash Designee Share shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration; and 

  

 3. each remaining unconverted share of CVBG Common Stock (after application of subsections (1) and (2) above) shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration. 

  

 (iii) If the remaining Total Cash Merger Consideration is less than the Cash Election Amount then: 

  

 1. each Stock Election Share and each No Election Share shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration; 

  

 2. the Exchange Agent will select, on a pro rata basis from among the holders of Cash Election Shares, a sufficient number of such shares ("Stock Designee Shares") such that the number of such Stock Designee Shares multiplied by the Per Share Cash Consideration equals as closely as practicable the difference between the Cash Election Amount and the Total Cash Merger Consideration. The Stock Designee Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration; and 

  

 3. each remaining unconverted share of CVBG Common Stock (after application of subsections (1) and (2) above) shall be converted into the right to receive an amount of cash equal to the Per Share Cash Consideration. 

  

 (iv) In the event the Exchange Agent is required pursuant to this Section 1.5 to designate from among all holders of Cash Election Shares the Stock Designee Shares to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration, each holder of Cash Election Shares shall 

   ##### 

  

 

be allocated a pro rata portion of the total Stock Designee Shares. Such pro
ration shall reflect the proportion that the number of Cash Election Shares
of each holder of Cash Election Shares bears to the total number of Cash
Election Shares. Adjustments may be made for rounding purposes. 

   

 1.6 _No Fractional Shares._ Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, neither certificates nor scrip for fractional shares of GCBS Common Stock shall be issued in the Merger. Each holder who otherwise would have been entitled to a fraction of a share of GCBS Common Stock shall receive in lieu thereof cash (without interest) in an amount determined by multiplying the fractional share interest to which such holder would otherwise be entitled (after taking into account all shares of CVBG Common Stock owned by such holder at the Effective Time) by $10.25. No such holder shall be entitled to dividends, voting rights or any other rights in respect of any fractional share. 

  

 1.7 _Conversion of Stock Options._  

  

 (a) At the Effective Time, each stock option granted or heretofore assumed by CVBG to purchase shares of CVBG Common Stock (each a "CVBG Stock Option") as disclosed in Schedule 4.2(a) of the CVBG Disclosure Schedule, which is outstanding, unexercised, and vested as of the Effective Time (even to the extent such vesting is caused by change of control provisions triggered by the consummation of the Merger) shall cease to represent a right to acquire shares of CVBG Common Stock and shall be exchanged for an amount of cash consideration equal to the "in the money" amount of such CVBG Stock Option; provided that, the "in the money" amount of an CVBG Stock Option shall be the excess of the Per Share Cash Consideration over the exercise price of such option (referred to per CVBG Stock Option as the "Per Option Consideration" or in the aggregate as the "Total Option Consideration," which for purposes of this Agreement shall be included in the definition of "Merger Consideration"). 

  

 (b) Except as provided herein or as otherwise agreed to by the parties, the 1998 Stock Option Plan and any other plan, program or arrangement providing for the issuance or grant of any other interest in respect of the capital stock of CVBG or any Subsidiary thereof shall have been suspended as of December 12, 2006, and CVBG shall ensure that following the aforementioned Date that no additional CVBG Stock Options have been granted and that other than the options disclosed in Schedule 4.2(a) of the CVBG Disclosure Schedule no other options have been granted and that no other persons shall have any right to acquire equity securities of CVBG or the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 1.8 _GCBS Capital Stock_. At and after the Effective Time, each share of GCBS Capital Stock (as defined below) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Closing Date shall remain issued and outstanding and shall not be affected by the Merger.

 1.12 _Certain Post-Closing Matters_. 

  

 (a) Board Composition. The current members of the Board of Directors of GCBS shall continue as the directors of the Surviving Corporation at the Effective Time. After the Effective Time, the GCBS Nominating Committee of its Board of Directors will review individuals from the Middle Tennessee area as director candidates for GCBS. 

  

 (b) Officers of Surviving Corporation. The current officers of GCBS shall continue as the officers of the Surviving Corporation.

Retention bonuses will be negotiated on a facts and circumstances basis with certain key employees to assure an effective transition and assimilation. 

  

 (c) Operations. The regulations and policies of GCBS in effect immediately prior to the effective time shall be the regulations and policies of the Surviving Corporation. Management of both parties would work to achieve appropriate operating efficiencies and to conform CVBGs accounting policies with GCBSs accounting policies and to make appropriate accruals for loan loss reserves and expenses and, when indicated, charge-offs prior to consummation of the Acquisition.

   ##### 

  

  

 2.2 _Delivery of Merger Consideration_. 

  

 (a) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of one or more Certificates a letter of transmittal in customary form as reasonably agreed by the parties (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for certificates representing the shares of GCBS Common Stock and any cash into which the shares of CVBG Common Stock represented by such Certificate or Certificates shall have been converted pursuant to this Agreement. Upon proper surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate or Certificates for exchange and cancellation, together with such properly completed and duly executed letter of transmittal as the Exchange Agent may reasonable require, the holder of such Certificate or Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefore, as applicable, (i) a certificate representing that number of whole shares of GCBS Common Stock to which such holder of CVBG Common Stock shall have become entitled pursuant to the provisions of Article I and (ii) a check representing the amount of any cash which such holder has the right to receive in respect of the Certificate or Certificates surrendered pursuant to the provisions of Article I, and the Certificate or Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any cash or on any unpaid dividends and distributions payable to holders of Certificates. 

  

 (b) No dividends or other distributions declared with respect to GCBS Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate until the holder thereof shall surrender such Certificate in accordance with this Article II. After the surrender of a Certificate in accordance with this Article II, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or other distributions, without any interest thereon, which theretofore had become payable with respect to shares of GCBS Common Stock represented by such Certificate. 

  

 (c) If any certificate representing shares of GCBS Common Stock is to be issued in a name other than that in which the Certificate or Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor is or are registered, it shall be a condition of the issuance thereof that the Certificate or Certificates so surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that the person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the issuance of a certificate representing shares of GCBS Common Stock in any name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificate or Certificates surrendered, or required for any other reason, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not payable. 

  

 (d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of CVBG of the shares of CVBG Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, certificates representing such shares are presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be canceled and exchanged for certificates representing shares of GCBS Common Stock and cash as provided in Article I. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the shareholders of CVBG as of the first anniversary of the Effective Time shall be paid to GCBS. Any former shareholders of CVBG who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to GCBS for payment of the shares of GCBS Common Stock and cash and any unpaid dividends and distributions on the GCBS Common Stock deliverable in respect of each share of CVBG Common Stock such shareholder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of CVBG, GCBS, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of CVBG Common Stock for any amount delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. 

  

 (f) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by GCBS, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as GCBS may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the shares of GCBS Common Stock, and any cash deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement. 

  

ARTICLE III. 
 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF GCBS 

   

 Except as disclosed in (a) the GCBS Reports (defined below) filed prior to the date hereof or (b) the disclosure schedule (the "GCBS Disclosure Schedule") delivered by GCBS to CVBG prior to the execution of this Agreement (which schedule sets forth, among other things, items the disclosure of which is necessary or appropriate either in response to an express disclosure requirement contained in a provision hereof or as an exception to one or more representations or warranties contained in this Article III or to one or more of GCBSs covenants contained in Article V, provided, however, that, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (i) no such item is required to be set forth in such schedule as an exception to a representation or warranty if its absence would not result in the related representation or warranty being deemed untrue or incorrect under the standard established by Section 9.2, and (ii) the mere inclusion of an item in such schedule as an exception to a representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission that such item represents a material exception or material fact, event or circumstance or that such item has had or would be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect (as defined below) on GCBS), GCBS hereby represents and warrants to CVBG as follows: 

  

 3.1 _Corporate Organization_. 

  

 (a) GCBS is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Tennessee. GCBS has the corporate power and authority to own or lease all of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, and is duly licensed or qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to 

   ##### 

  

 

be so licensed or qualified would not, either individually or in the
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on GCBS. As used in this Agreement,
the term "Material Adverse Effect" means, with respect to CVBG, GCBS or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, a material adverse impact on (i)
the business, operations, results of operations or financial condition
of such party and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, or (ii) the ability of
such party to timely consummate the transactions contemplated hereby;
_provided, however,_ that with respect to clause (i), the following shall not
be deemed to have a Material Adverse Effect: any change or event caused by or
resulting from (A) changes in prevailing interest rates, currency exchange
rates or other economic or monetary conditions in the United States or
elsewhere, (B) changes in United States or foreign securities markets,
including changes in price levels or trading volumes, (C) changes or events,
after the date hereof, affecting the financial services industry generally
and not specifically relating to GCBS or CVBG or their respective
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, (D) changes, after the date hereof, in
generally accepted accounting principles or regulatory accounting
requirements applicable to banks or savings associations and their holding
companies generally, (E) changes, after the date hereof, in laws, rules or
regulations of general applicability or interpretations thereof by any

CVBG taken with the prior written consent of the other or required hereunder,

transactions contemplated hereby or the announcement thereof, (H) any
outbreak of major hostilities in which the United States is involved or any
act of terrorism within the United States or directed against its facilities
or citizens wherever located, or (I) the termination of employment of key
employees of CVBG or failure of key employees of CVBG to execute employment
agreements with GCBS to become effective after the Effective Time; and
provided, further, that in no event shall a change in the trading prices of a
partys capital stock, by itself, be considered material or constitute
a Material Adverse Effect. 

   

 (b) GCBS is a bank holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the "BHC Act"). True and complete copies of the GCBS Charter and Bylaws, as in effect as of the date of this Agreement, have previously been made available by GCBS to CVBG. 

  

 (c) Each GCBS Subsidiary (i) is duly organized and validly existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization, (ii) is duly qualified to do business and in good standing in all jurisdictions (whether federal, state, local or foreign) where its ownership or leasing of property or the conduct of its business requires it to be so qualified and in which the failure to be so qualified would have a Material Adverse Effect on GCBS and (iii) has all requisite corporate or other power and authority to own or lease its properties and assets and to carry on its business as now conducted, except to the extent that the failure to have such power or authority will not result in a Material Adverse Effect on GCBS. As used in this Agreement, the word "Subsidiary" when used with respect to any party means any bank, savings bank, corporation, partnership, limited liability company, or other organization, whether incorporated or unincorporated, which is consolidated with such party for financial reporting purposes under GAAP.

Organizational Common Stock, $10.00 par value per share (together with the

 (d) GCBS owns, directly or indirectly, all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity ownership interests of each of its Subsidiaries, free and clear of any liens, pledges, charges, encumbrances and security interests whatsoever ("Liens"), and all of such shares or equity ownership interests are duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid, nonassessable (subject to 12 U.S.C. § 55) and free of preemptive rights, with no personal liability attaching to the ownership thereof. No Subsidiary of GCBS has or is bound by any outstanding subscription, option, warrant, call, commitment or agreement of any character calling for the purchase or issuance of any shares of capital stock or any other equity security of such Subsidiary or any securities representing the right to purchase or otherwise receive any shares of capital stock or any other equity security of such Subsidiary. Section 3.2(d) of the GCBS Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list of the material investments of GCBS in Non-Subsidiary Affiliates. As used in this Agreement, the term "Non-Subsidiary Affiliate" when used with respect to any party means any corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture or other entity other than such partys Subsidiaries.

There is no unresolved violation, criticism, or exception by any Regulatory Agency with respect to any report or statement relating to any examinations of GCBS or any of its Subsidiaries which, in the reasonable judgment of GCBS, will, either individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on GCBS.

the quarterly period ended September 30, 2006. The financial statements
referred to in this Section 3.6 (including the related notes, where
applicable) fairly present in all material respects the consolidated results
of operations, changes in shareholders equity, cash flows and financial
position of GCBS and its Subsidiaries for the respective fiscal periods or as

adjustments in the case of unaudited statements; each of such statements

(including the related notes, where applicable) has been prepared in all
material respects in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States ("GAAP") consistently applied during the periods
involved, except, in each case, as indicated in such statements or in the

 (b) There is no injunction, order, judgment, decree, or regulatory restriction (other than those that apply to similarly situated bank holding companies or banks) imposed 

   ##### 

  

 

upon GCBS, any of its Subsidiaries or the assets of GCBS or any of its
Subsidiaries that has had, or will have, either individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on GCBS. 

   

 3.10 _Taxes and Tax Returns_. 

  

 (a) Each of GCBS and its Subsidiaries has duly filed all federal, state, foreign and local information returns and Tax returns required to be filed by it on or prior to the date of this Agreement (all such returns being accurate and complete in all material respects) and has duly paid or made provision for the payment of all Taxes that have been incurred or are due or claimed to be due from it by federal, state, foreign or local taxing authorities other than (i) Taxes or other governmental charges that are not yet delinquent or are being contested in good faith or have not been finally determined and have been adequately reserved against under GAAP, or (ii) information returns, Tax returns or Taxes as to which the failure to file, pay or make provision for is not reasonably likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on GCBS. The federal income Tax returns of GCBS and its Subsidiaries to the knowledge of GCBS have not been examined by the IRS. There are no material disputes pending, or to the knowledge of GCBS, claims asserted, for Taxes or assessments upon GCBS or any of its Subsidiaries for which GCBS does not have reserves that are adequate under GAAP.

 3.14 _Certain Contracts_. 

  

 (a) Except as disclosed in Section 3.11(a) or 3.14(a) of the GCBS Disclosure Schedule, neither GCBS nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by any contract, arrangement, commitment or understanding (whether written or oral) (i) with respect to the employment of any directors, officers or employees other than in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, (ii) which, upon the consummation or shareholder approval of the 

   ##### 

  

 

transactions contemplated by this Agreement will (either alone or upon the
occurrence of any additional acts or events) result in any payment (whether
of severance pay or otherwise) becoming due from GCBS, the Surviving
Corporation, or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any officer
or employee thereof, (iii) which is a "material contract" (as such term is
defined in Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K of the SEC) to be performed
after the date of this Agreement that has not been filed or incorporated by
reference in the GCBS Reports, (iv) which materially restricts the conduct of
any line of business by GCBS or upon consummation of the Merger will
materially restrict the ability of the Surviving Corporation to engage in any

accelerated, by the occurrence of any shareholder approval or the
consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or

any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each contract,
arrangement, commitment or understanding of the type described in this
Section 3.14(a), whether or not set forth in the GCBS Disclosure Schedule,
is referred to herein as a "GCBS Contract", and neither GCBS nor any of its
Subsidiaries knows of, or has received notice of, any violation of the above
by any of the other parties thereto which will have, individually or in the

 3.15 _Agreements with Regulatory Agencies_. Neither GCBS nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any cease-and-desist or other order issued by, or is a party to any written agreement, consent agreement or memorandum of understanding with, or is a party to any commitment letter or similar undertaking to, or is subject to any order or directive by, or has been since January 1, 2003, a recipient of any supervisory letter from, or since January 1, 2003, has adopted any board resolutions at the request of, any Regulatory Agency or other Governmental Entity that currently restricts in any material respect the conduct of its business, would restrict the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or that in any material manner relates to its capital adequacy, its credit policies, its management or its business (each, whether or not set forth in the GCBS Disclosure Schedule, a "GCBS Regulatory Agreement"), nor to the knowledge of GCBS has GCBS or any of its Subsidiaries been advised since January 1, 2003, by any Regulatory Agency or other Governmental Entity that it is considering issuing or requesting any such GCBS Regulatory Agreement.

 3.17 _Undisclosed Liabilities_. Except for those liabilities that are fully reflected or reserved against on the consolidated balance sheet of GCBS included in the GCBS Form 10-Q and for liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice since September 30, 2006, neither GCBS nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred any liability of any nature whatsoever (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether due or to become due) that, either individually or in the aggregate, has had or will have, a Material Adverse Effect on GCBS. 

  

 3.18 _Insurance_. GCBS and its Subsidiaries have in effect insurance coverage with reputable insurers or are self-insured, which in respect of amounts, premiums, types and risks insured, constitutes reasonably adequate coverage against all risks insured against by bank holding companies comparable in size and operations to GCBS and its Subsidiaries. 

  

 3.19 _Environmental Liability_. There are no legal, administrative, arbitral or other proceedings, claims, actions, causes of action, private environmental investigations or remediation activities or governmental investigations of any nature seeking to impose, or that could reasonably result in the imposition, on GCBS of any liability or obligation arising under common law or under any local, state or federal environmental statute, regulation or ordinance including, without limitation, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended ("CERCLA"), pending or, to the knowledge of GCBS, threatened against GCBS, which liability or obligation will, either individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on GCBS. To the knowledge of GCBS, there is no reasonable basis for any such proceeding, claim, action or governmental investigation that would impose any liability or obligation that will, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on GCBS. GCBS is not subject to any agreement, order, judgment, decree, letter or memorandum by or with any court, governmental authority, regulatory agency or third party imposing any liability or obligation with respect to the foregoing that will have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on GCBS.

 3.22 _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied or to be supplied by GCBS for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i) the Form S-4 will, at the time the Form S-4 is filed with the SEC and at the time it becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and (ii) the Joint Proxy 

   ##### 

  

 

Statement will, at the date of mailing to shareholders and at the times of the
meetings of shareholders to be held in connection with the Merger, contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. The Joint Proxy Statement will comply as to form in all material
respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations of the SEC thereunder, except that no representation or warranty
is made by GCBS with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference
therein based on information supplied by CVBG for inclusion or incorporation
by reference in the Joint Proxy Statement.

As and to the extent described in the GCBS Reports filed with the SEC prior to the date hereof, GCBS and its Subsidiaries have devised and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. GCBS (i) has designed disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that material information relating to GCBS, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, is made known to the management of GCBS by others within those entities, and (ii) has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to GCBSs independent registered public accounting firm and the audit committee of GCBSs Board of Directors (x) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect GCBSs ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information and (y) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in GCBSs internal control over financial reporting. GCBS has made available to CVBG a summary of any such disclosure made by management to GCBSs auditors and audit committee since January 1, 2002. GCBS is in full compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. 

  

 3.24 _Opinion of GCBS Financial Advisor_. GCBS has received the opinion of its financial advisor, Scott and Stringfellow, Inc., dated the date of this Agreement, to the effect that the Merger Consideration is fair, from a financial point of view, to GCBS and the holders of GCBS Common Stock.

CVBG has filed all required reports, schedules, registration statements and other documents with the SEC since January 1, 2003 (the "CVBG Reports").

 4.18 _Insurance._ CVBG and its Subsidiaries have in effect insurance coverage with reputable insurers or are self-insured, which in respect of amounts, premiums, types and risks insured, constitutes reasonably adequate coverage against all risks customarily insured against by bank holding companies and their subsidiaries comparable in size and operations to CVBG and its Subsidiaries. 

  

 4.19 _Environmental Liability_. There are no legal, administrative, arbitral or other proceedings, claims, actions, causes of action, private environmental investigations or remediation activities or governmental investigations of any nature seeking to impose, or that could reasonably result in the imposition, on CVBG of any liability or obligation arising under common law or under any local, state or federal environmental statute, regulation or ordinance including, without limitation, CERCLA, pending or, to the knowledge of CVBG, threatened against CVBG, which liability or obligation will, either individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on CVBG. To the knowledge of CVBG, there is no reasonable basis for any such proceeding, claim, action or governmental investigation that would impose any liability or obligation that will, either individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on 

   ##### 

  

 

CVBG. CVBG is not subject to any agreement, order, judgment, decree, letter or
memorandum by or with any court, governmental authority, regulatory agency or
third party imposing any liability or obligation with respect to the

 4.21 _Reorganization._ As of the date of this Agreement, CVBG is not aware of any fact or circumstance that would reasonably be expected to prevent the Merger from qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

None of the information supplied or to be supplied by CVBG for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i) the Form S-4 will, at the time the Form S-4 is filed with the SEC and at the time it becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and (ii) the Joint Proxy Statement will, at the date of mailing to shareholders and at the times of the meetings of shareholders to be held in connection with the Merger, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The Joint Proxy Statement will comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder, except that no representation or warranty is made by CVBG with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference therein based on information supplied by GCBS for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Joint Proxy Statement.

As and to the extent described in the CVBG Reports filed with the SEC prior to the date hereof, CVBG and its Subsidiaries have devised and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. CVBG (i) has designed disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that material information relating to CVBG, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, is made known to the management of CVBG by others within those entities, and (ii) has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to CVBGs independent registered public accounting firm and the audit committee of CVBGs Board of Directors (x) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect CVBGs 

   ##### 

  

 

ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information and (y)

employees who have a significant role in CVBGs internal control over
financial reporting.. CVBG has made available to GCBS a summary of any such
disclosure made by management to GCBSs auditors and audit committee since
January 1, 2002. CVBG has initiated its process of compliance with Section
404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and expects to be in full compliance
therewith by the mandated compliance date.

Neither CVBG nor GCBS nor any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure would violate or prejudice the rights of CVBGs or GCBSs, as the case may be, customers, jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the institution in possession or control of such information or contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. The parties hereto will make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply. 

  

 (b) Each of GCBS and CVBG agrees that it will not, and will cause its representatives not to, use any information obtained pursuant to this Section 6.2 (as well as any other information obtained prior to the date hereof in connection with entering into this Agreement) for any purpose unrelated to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Subject to the requirements of law, each party will keep confidential, and will cause its representative to keep confidential, all information and documents obtained pursuant to this Section 6.2 (as well as any other information obtained prior to the date hereof in connection with the entering into of this Agreement) unless such information (i) was already known to such party, (ii) becomes available to such party from other sources not known by such party to be bound by a confidentiality obligation, (iii) is disclosed with the prior written approval of the providing party or (iv) is or becomes readily ascertainable from publicly available sources.

The Board of Directors of each of GCBS and CVBG shall use its reasonable best efforts (and subject to its fiduciary duty) to obtain from the shareholders of GCBS and CVBG, as the case may be, the vote in favor of the adoption of this Agreement required by the TBCA and GCBSs and CVBGs charter and bylaws, as the case may be to consummate the transactions 

   ##### 

  

 

contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, unless
this Agreement has been terminated, this Agreement shall be submitted to the
shareholders of GCBS and CVBG at such meeting for the purpose of obtaining
the CVBG Shareholder Approval or GCBS Shareholder Approval, as the case may
be, and voting on the approval and adoption of this Agreement and nothing
contained herein shall be deemed to relieve GCBS and CVBG of such
obligations. 

   

 6.4 _Legal Conditions to Merger._ Each of GCBS and CVBG shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts (a) to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to comply promptly with all legal requirements that may be imposed on such party or its Subsidiaries with respect to the Merger and, subject to the conditions set forth in Article VII hereof, to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (b) to obtain (and to cooperate with the other party to obtain) any material consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any exemption by, any Governmental Entity and any other third party that is required to be obtained by GCBS or CVBG or any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 6.5 _Affiliates._ CVBG shall cause each director, executive officer and other person who is an "affiliate" (for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act) of CVBG to deliver to GCBS, as soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement, and prior to the date of the shareholders meetings called by CVBG to be held pursuant to Section 6.3, a written agreement, in the form of Exhibit 6.5.

 6.7 Employee Benefit Plans; Existing Agreements. 

  

 (a) As of the Effective Time, to the extent permissible under the terms of the GCBS employee benefit Plans, the employees of CVBG and its Subsidiaries (the "CVBG Employees") shall be eligible to participate in GCBSs employee benefit plans, including but not limited to bonus and option plans, in which similarly situated employees of GCBS or its Subsidiaries participate, to the same extent as similarly situated employees of GCBS or its Subsidiaries (it being understood that inclusion of CVBG Employees in GCBSs employee benefit plans may occur at different times with respect to different plans) except as provided below. 

  

 (b) With respect to each GCBS Plan that is an "employee benefit plan," as defined in section 3(3) of ERISA, for purposes of determining eligibility to participate, and entitlement to benefits, including for severance benefits and vacation entitlement, service with 

   ##### 

  

 

CVBG shall be treated as service with GCBS; provided, however, that such
service shall not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would
result in a duplication or increase of benefits. Such service also shall
apply for purposes of satisfying any waiting periods, evidence
of insurability requirements, or the application of any preexisting condition
limitations. Each GCBS employee benefit plan shall waive pre-existing
condition limitations to the same extent waived under the applicable CVBG
employee benefit plan. CVBG Employees shall be given credit for amounts paid
under a corresponding benefit plan during the same period for purposes of
applying deductibles, copayments and out-of-pocket maximums as though such
amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of the GCBS
employee benefit plans. 

   

 (c) From and after the Effective Time, GCBS or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, will assume and honor and shall cause the appropriate Subsidiaries of GCBS to assume and to honor in accordance with their terms all employment, severance, change of control and other compensation agreements and arrangements between CVBG or its Subsidiaries and any employee thereof, and all accrued and vested benefit obligations, existing prior to the execution of this Agreement which are between CVBG or any of its Subsidiaries and any current or former director, officer, employee or consultant thereof. In addition, any employee of CVBG or its Subsidiaries whose position is eliminated as a direct result of the Merger shall be eligible to receive the Standard Severance Package of CVBG as described by CVBG to GCBS previously, rather than any standard severance package of GCBS, unless specifically negotiated between the employee and GCBS or CVBG. 

  

 (d) From and after the Effective Time, GCBS or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, will, and will cause any applicable Subsidiary thereof or Employee Benefit Plan, to provide or pay when due to CVBGs employees as of the Effective Time all benefits and compensation pursuant to CVBGs Employee Plans, programs and arrangements in effect on the date hereof earned and accrued through, and to which such individuals are entitled as of the Effective Time (or such later time as such Employee Benefit Plans as in effect at the Effective Time are terminated or canceled by GCBS or the Surviving Corporation) subject to compliance with the terms of this Agreement. 

  

 6.8 _Directors  and Officers Insurance._ 

  

 (a) GCBS shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the individuals serving as officers and directors of CVBG, its Subsidiaries or any entity specified in the CVBG Disclosure Schedule immediately prior to the Effective Time to be covered for a period of three (3) years from the Effective Time (or the period of the applicable statute of limitations, if longer) by the directors and officers liability insurance policy maintained by CVBG (provided that GCBS may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are not less advantageous than such policy) with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time which were committed by such officers and directors in their capacity as such. 

  

 (b) The provisions of this Section 6.8 shall survive the Effective Time and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives. 

   ##### 

  

  

 6.9 _Advice of Changes._ GCBS and CVBG shall each promptly advise the other party of any change or event (i) having a Material Adverse Effect on it or (ii) which it believes would or would be reasonably likely to cause or constitute a material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained herein; provided, however, that no such notification shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties (or remedies with respect thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement; provided further that a failure to comply with this Section 6.9 shall not constitute the failure of any condition set forth in Article VII to be satisfied unless the underlying Material Adverse Effect or material breach would independently result in the failure of a condition set forth in Article VII to be satisfied. 

  

 6.10 _Acquisition Proposals._  

  

 (a) CVBG and its Subsidiaries and each of their respective affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives (including any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other representative retained by CVBG or any of its Subsidiaries) shall immediately cease any discussions or negotiations with any other parties that may be ongoing with respect to the possibility or consideration of any Acquisition Proposal, as defined below, and they will not release any third party from, or waive any provisions of, any confidentiality or standstill agreement to which they are a party with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. From the acceptance of the offer letter dated December 20, 2006, through the Effective Time, CVBG shall not, nor shall it permit any of its Subsidiaries to, nor shall it authorize or permit any of its or its Subsidiaries directors, officers or employees or any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other representative retained by it or any of its Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly through another person, (i) solicit, initiate or encourage (including by way of furnishing information or assistance), or take any other action designed to facilitate or encourage any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes, or is reasonably likely to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding any Acquisition Proposal or (iii) make or authorize any statement, recommendation or solicitation in support of any Acquisition Proposal.

 (ii) CVBG shall notify GCBS promptly (but in no event later than 24 hours) after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal, or any request for nonpublic information relating to CVBG or any of its Subsidiaries by any person that informs CVBG or any of its Subsidiaries that it is considering making, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry 

   ##### 

  

 

from any person seeking to have discussions or negotiations with such party
relating to a possible Acquisition Proposal. Such notice shall be made orally
and confirmed in writing, and shall indicate the identity of the person
making the Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or request and the material terms
and conditions of any inquiries, proposals or offers (including a copy thereof
if in writing and any related documentation or correspondence). CVBG shall
also promptly, and in any event within 24 hours, notify GCBS, orally and in
writing, if it enters into discussions or negotiations concerning any
Acquisition Proposal or provides nonpublic information or data to any person
in accordance with this Section 6.10(b) and keep GCBS informed of the status
and terms of any such proposals, offers, discussions or negotiations on a
current basis, including by providing a copy of all material documentation or
correspondence relating thereto. 

   

 (iii) Nothing contained in this Section 6.10 shall prohibit CVBG or its Subsidiaries from taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position required by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act; provided, however, that compliance with such rules shall not in any way limit or modify the effect that any action taken pursuant to such rules has under any other provision of this Agreement. 

  

 (c) Nothing in this Section 6.10 shall (x) permit CVBG to terminate this Agreement or (y) affect any other obligation of CVBG under this Agreement. CVBG shall not submit to the vote of its shareholders any Acquisition Proposal other than the Merger. 

  

 (d) For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Acquisition Proposal" means any inquiry, proposal or offer, filing of any regulatory application or notice (whether in draft or final form) or disclosure of an intention to do any of the foregoing from any person relating to any (w) direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of a business that constitutes a substantial portion of the net revenues, net income or assets of CVBG or any of its significant subsidiaries (as defined under Regulation S-X of the SEC), (x) direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of any class of equity securities representing 10% or more of the voting power of CVBG or its significant subsidiaries, (y) tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any person beneficially owning 10% or more of the voting power of CVBG, or (z) merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving CVBG or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 (e) For purposes of this Agreement, "Superior Proposal" means a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal which the Board of Directors of CVBG concludes in good faith, upon the written advice of its financial advisors and legal advisors, taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal and the person making the proposal (including any break-up fees, expense reimbursement provisions and conditions to consummation), (i) is more favorable to the shareholders of CVBG from a financial point of view, than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) is fully financed or reasonably capable of being fully financed, reasonably likely to receive all required governmental approvals on a timely basis and otherwise reasonably capable of being completed on the terms proposed; provided that, for purposes of this definition of "Superior Proposal," the term Acquisition Proposal shall have the meaning assigned to such term in Section 6.10(d) except that the reference to "10% or more" in the definition of "Acquisition Proposal" shall be 

   #####
