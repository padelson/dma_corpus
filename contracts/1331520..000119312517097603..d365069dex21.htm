Stonegate Common Stock shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
corresponding certificates (the " _Certificates_ ") representing such shares
to the Exchange Agent or receipt by the Exchange Agent of an "agents message"

requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any
transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the delivery of the Merger

the Parent Common Stock that such holder would be entitled to receive upon
surrender of such Certificate or Book Entry Share and no cash payment in lieu
of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be paid to any such holder
until such holder shall surrender such Certificate or Book Entry Share
in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 2.8_. Subject to applicable Law,
following surrender of any such

 



-16-  Certificate or Book Entry Share, there shall be paid to such holder of
Parent Common Stock issuable in exchange therefor, without interest, (i)
promptly after the time of such surrender, the amount of any cash payable in
lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to _Section 2.8(d)_ and the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time and paid prior to
such surrender with respect to such holders whole shares of Parent Common
Stock, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior
to such surrender and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable
with respect to such holders whole shares of Parent Common Stock.

representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock or book entry credit of
the same shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or
Book Entry Shares, no dividend or other distribution, stock split or interest
shall relate to any such fractional share and such fractional share shall not
entitle the owner thereof to vote or to have any rights as a holder of any
Parent Common Stock. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
each holder of shares of Stonegate Common Stock exchanged in the Merger who
would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent
Common Stock (after taking into account all Certificates and Book Entry Shares
delivered by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without
interest) in an amount, rounded to the nearest whole cent, equal to the
product of (i) the Parent Share Average Closing Price, and (ii) the fraction
of a share of Parent Common Stock that such holder would otherwise be entitled
to receive pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.7_ hereof (rounded to the nearest
ten-thousandth when expressed in decimal form).

 

(e) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Stonegate Common Stock after one
hundred eighty (180) days following the Effective Time shall be delivered to
Parent upon demand and, from and after such delivery to Parent, any former
holders of Stonegate Common Stock (other than Appraisal Shares) who have not
theretofore complied with this _ARTICLE II_ shall thereafter look only to
Parent for the Merger Consideration payable in respect of such shares of
Stonegate Common Stock, in each case, without any interest thereon.
Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Stonegate Common
Stock immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat
to or become the property of any Governmental Authority shall, to the extent
permitted by Applicable Law, thereupon become the property of Parent free and
clear of any Liens, claims or interest of any Person previously entitled
thereto.

 

(f) _No Liability_. Neither Exchange Agent, Parent nor any of Parents
Subsidiaries shall be liable to any holder of shares of Stonegate Common
Stock for any shares of Parent Common Stock (or dividends or distributions
with respect thereto) or cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public
official or Governmental Authority in the reasonable belief that
such delivery was required pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or
similar law.

 



-17- (g) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed in form and
substance acceptable to Parent and, if required by Parent, the posting by such
Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the
shares of Stonegate Common Stock represented by such Certificate.

(h) _Withholding_. Each of Parent and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder of Stonegate Common Stock such amounts as Parent or
the Exchange Agent is required to deduct and withhold under the Code or any
provision of state, local, or foreign Tax law, with respect to the making of
such payment. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent or the
Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Stonegate Common Stock in
respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made by Parent or the
Exchange Agent, as the case may be.

 

(i) _Book Entry_. All shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger
shall be issued in book entry form, without physical certificates.

2.9 _Certain Adjustments_. If, after the date of this Agreement and at or
prior to the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock or
Stonegate Common Stock are changed into a different number of shares or type
of securities by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, split-up,
stock split, subdivision, combination or exchange of shares, or any dividend
payable in stock or other securities is declared thereon or rights issued in
respect thereof with a record date within such period, or any similar event
occurs, the Exchange Ratio will be adjusted accordingly to provide to the
holders thereof the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement
prior to such adjustment event.

 

2.10 _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Stonegate Common Stock_.
At the Closing Date, the stock transfer books of Stonegate shall be closed
and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares
of Stonegate Common Stock on the records of Stonegate, except for the
cancellation of such shares in connection with the Merger. From and after
the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates or Book Entry Shares that
evidenced ownership of shares of Stonegate Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with
respect to such shares, except as otherwise provided for herein or by
applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time, bona fide Certificates or Book
Entry Shares are presented to Parent for any reason, they shall be cancelled
and exchanged as provided in this _ARTICLE II_.

 

2.11 _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement
to the contrary, shares of Stonegate Common Stock that are outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and with respect to which the
shareholders thereof who are entitled to demand and have properly demanded the
fair value of such shares in accordance with Sections 607.1301 to 607.1333 of
the FBCA and which shareholders have not voted in favor of the Merger and

 



-18-  otherwise complied with the applicable provisions of the FBCA in all
respects (collectively, the " _Appraisal Shares_ ") shall not be converted
into or represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration. Such
shareholders instead shall be entitled to receive payment of the fair value of
such shares held by them in accordance with the provisions of Sections
607.1301 to 607.1333 of the FBCA, except that all Appraisal Shares held by
shareholders who shall have failed to perfect or who effectively shall have
withdrawn or otherwise lost their rights as dissenting shareholders under the
FBCA shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into and to have
become exchangeable, as of the Effective Time, for the right to receive,
without any interest thereon, the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 2.7_. Stonegate shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written
demands for payment of fair value of any shares of Stonegate Common Stock,
attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served
pursuant to the FBCA and received by Stonegate relating to shareholders
appraisal rights and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations
and proceedings with respect to demands under the FBCA consistent with the
obligations of Stonegate thereunder. Stonegate shall not, except with the
prior written consent of Parent, (x) make any payment with respect to such
demand, (y) offer to settle or settle any demand for payment of fair value or
(z) waive any failure to timely deliver a written demand for payment of fair
value or timely take any other action to perfect payment of fair value rights
in accordance with the FBCA.

2.12 _Proxy and Registration Statement_. Parent and Stonegate shall prepare
the Registration Statement on Form S-4 or other applicable form, which Parent
shall file with the SEC as promptly as reasonably practicable, but in no event
more than thirty (30) calendar days, following the date of this Agreement and
will include the Proxy Statement/Prospectus. Each of Parent and Stonegate
shall use reasonable best efforts to have the Registration Statement declared
effective under the Securities Act as promptly as reasonably practicable
after such filing and to keep the Registration Statement effective as long as
necessary to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby. Each of Stonegate and Parent will cause the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be filed with the SEC and the FDIC, as
applicable, and mailed to Stonegate Shareholders and shareholders of Parent as
soon as reasonably practicable after the Registration Statement is declared
effective under the Securities Act. Parent shall also take any action
required to be taken under any applicable state securities laws in connection
with the issuance of Parent Common Stock in the Merger, and Stonegate shall
furnish all information concerning Stonegate and the holders of Stonegate
Common Stock, or holders of a beneficial interest therein, as may be
reasonably requested in connection with any such action. Parent will advise
Stonegate promptly after it receives oral or written notice of the time when
the Registration Statement has become effective or any supplement or
amendment has been filed, the issuance of any stop order, the suspension of
the qualification of Parent Common Stock issuable in connection with the
Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any oral or written
request by the SEC for amendment of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the
Registration Statement or comments thereon and responses thereto or requests
by the SEC for additional information, and will promptly provide Stonegate
with copies of any written communication from the SEC or any state securities
commission. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information
relating to Parent or Stonegate, or any of their respective affiliates,
officers or directors, is discovered by Parent or Stonegate which should be
set forth in an amendment or supplement to any of the Registration Statement
or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, so that any of such documents would not
include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, the

 



-19-  party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other
parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such
information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required
by law, disseminated to Stonegate Shareholders and shareholders of Parent.

2.13 _Stonegate Shareholders_ __ _Meeting_.

(a) Stonegate shall take all action necessary in accordance with
applicable laws and Stonegates current articles of incorporation and bylaws
to duly give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its shareholders (the "
_Stonegate Shareholders  Meeting_"), to be held as promptly as practicable
after the Registration Statement is declared effective under the Securities
Act, for the purpose of obtaining the approval by Stonegate Shareholders of
this Agreement. The Board of Directors of Stonegate has resolved to recommend
to Stonegate Shareholders that they approve this Agreement and Stonegate
shall, acting through its Board of Directors, (x) recommend that Stonegate
Shareholders approve this Agreement (the " _Stonegate Recommendation_ "), (y)
include _the Stonegate_  Recommendation in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus,
and (z) use all reasonable best efforts to solicit from Stonegate Shareholders
proxies in favor of the approval of this Agreement and any other matters to be
voted on at the Stonegate Shareholders Meeting related to this Agreement,
including by communicating to Stonegate Shareholders the recommendation of the
Board of Directors of Stonegate that they approve this Agreement, and to take
all other action necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent of
Stonegate Shareholders required by Applicable Law to obtain such approvals,
except to the extent Stonegates Board of Directors has withdrawn the
Stonegate Recommendation in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
Stonegate agrees that it has an unqualified obligation to submit this
Agreement to Stonegate Shareholders at the Stonegate Shareholders Meeting,
including after any withdrawal of the Stonegate Recommendation.

 

(b) If on the date of the Stonegate Shareholders Meeting, Stonegate has not
received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares of Stonegate
Common Stock to obtain the Stonegate Shareholder Approval (as defined below),
Stonegate shall adjourn the Stonegate Shareholders Meeting until such date as
shall be mutually agreed upon by Stonegate and Parent, which date shall not
be less than five (5) calendar days nor more than ten (10) calendar days after
the date of adjournment, and subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement shall continue to use all reasonable best efforts, together with
its proxy solicitor, to assist in the solicitation of proxies from
shareholders relating to the Stonegate Shareholder Approval; provided,
however, Stonegate shall only be required to adjourn, delay or postpone the
Stonegate Shareholders Meeting as described above once. For purposes of this
Agreement, " _Stonegate Shareholder Approval_ " shall mean the affirmative
vote of a majority of the votes entitled to vote and represented in person or
by proxy at the Stonegate Shareholders Meeting or such other number of
affirmative votes as may be required by Stonegates governing documents and
Applicable Law.

 

(c) Neither Stonegates Board of Directors nor any committee thereof shall (x)
except as expressly permitted by this  _Section_ __ _ 2.13_, withdraw,
qualify or modify, or propose to withdraw, qualify or modify, in a manner
adverse to Parent or any of Parents Subsidiaries, the Stonegate
Recommendation (an " _Adverse Stonegate Recommendation_

 



-20-   _Change_ ") or (y) approve or recommend, or propose to approve or
recommend, any Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Stonegates Board of Directors may submit this Agreement to its shareholders
without recommendation (although the resolutions adopting this Agreement as of
the date hereof may not be rescinded or amended), in which event the Board of
Directors of Stonegate may communicate the basis for its lack of a
recommendation to the shareholders in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or an
appropriate amendment or supplement thereto to the extent required by law, if
and only if:

 

(i) Stonegates Board of Directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and independent financial
advisor, in both cases, from firms of national stature, that it has received
an unsolicited bona fide Acquisition Proposal (that did not result from a
breach of _Section_ __ _ 5.9_) that is a Superior Proposal and such Superior
Proposal has not been withdrawn;

(ii) Stonegates Board of Directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with such outside legal counsel, that a failure to accept such
Superior Proposal would result in Stonegates Board of Directors breaching its
fiduciary duties to Stonegate and its Shareholders under Applicable Law;

 

(iii) Stonegates Board of Directors provides written notice (a " _Notice of
Stonegate Recommendation Change_ ") to Parent of its receipt of the Superior
Proposal and its intent to withdraw the Stonegate Recommendation on the fifth
Business Day following delivery of such notice, which notice shall specify in
reasonable detail the material terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal
(it being understood that any amendment (and each successive amendment) to any
term of such Acquisition Proposal shall require a new Notice of Recommendation
Change, except that, in each such case, the five Business Day period referred
to in this clause (iii) and in clauses (iv) and (v) shall be reduced to three
Business Days following the giving of each such new Notice of Recommendation
Change);

 

(iv) after providing such Notice of Recommendation Change, Stonegate shall
negotiate in good faith with Parent (if requested by Parent) and provide
Parent reasonable opportunity during the subsequent five (or three, as
applicable) Business Day period(s) to make such adjustments in the terms and
conditions of this Agreement as would enable Stonegates Board of
Directors to proceed withdrawing the Stonegate Recommendation; and

(v) Stonegates Board of Directors, following the final such five (or three,
as applicable) Business Day period, again determines in good faith, after
consultation with such outside legal counsel and such independent financial
advisor, that such Acquisition Proposal nonetheless continues to constitute
a Superior Proposal and that failure to take such action would violate their
fiduciary duties to Stonegate and the Stonegate Shareholders under Applicable
Law.

 



-21- 2.14 _Stonegate Stock Options_. Prior to the Effective Time, Stonegate shall
take actions necessary to provide that, immediately prior to the Effective
Time, (a) each Stonegate Stock Option, whether or not then exercisable, shall
fully vest and immediately be cancelled and only entitle the holder thereof,
to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (i)
the total number of Stonegate Common Shares subject to such Stonegate Stock
Option multiplied by (ii) the excess, if any, of (A) the Per Share Merger
Consideration over (B) the per share exercise price for the applicable
Stonegate Stock Option, less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with
respect to such payment (such calculation, the " _Per Share Equity Award
Consideration_ "). The payment of the Per Share Equity Award Consideration
shall be made by Stonegate immediately prior to the Effective Time on the
Closing Date provided Stonegate has received an executed stock
option cancellation agreement from the respective stock option holder prior
to the Effective Time. Stonegate shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain
such stock option cancellation agreements prior to the Effective Time. Any
Stonegate Stock Option that has a per share exercise price that is greater
than or equal to the Per Share Merger Consideration shall be cancelled for no
consideration. Nothing herein shall prevent any holder from exercising, before
the Effective Time, any Stonegate Stock Option that is exercisable according
to its terms, and any common stock issued upon such exercise shall be
converted at the Effective Time into a right to receive the Merger
Consideration, subject to appraisal rights under Applicable Law. Any
shares of Stonegate Common Stock issued upon such exercise between the date
of the Agreement and the Effective Time shall be converted at the Effective
Time into a right to receive the Merger Consideration, subject to appraisal
rights under Applicable Law. 

2.15 _Parent Shareholders  Meeting_.

 

(a) Parent shall take all action necessary in accordance with applicable laws
and Parents current articles of incorporation and bylaws to duly give notice
of, convene and hold a meeting of its shareholders (the " _Parent Shareholders
 Meeting_"), to be held as promptly as practicable after the Registration
Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act, for the purpose of
obtaining the approval by Parent shareholders of this Agreement, approval of
the issuance of Parent Common Stock in connection with the Merger for purposes
of Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635 and any other matters required to be approved by
Parents shareholders in order to carry out the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (the " _Requisite Parent Vote_ "). Parent shall, acting through
its board of directors, (i) recommend that the Parent shareholders approve
this Agreement and approve the issuance of Parent Common Stock in connection
with the Merger for purposes of Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635 (the " _Parent Board
Recommendation_ "), (ii) include in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus the Parent
Board Recommendation and (iii) use all reasonable best efforts to obtain from
its shareholders the Parent Shareholder Approval with respect to the approval
of the matters to be voted on at the Parent Shareholders Meeting. For
purposes of this Agreement, " _Parent Shareholder Approval_ " shall mean the
affirmative vote of a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast by holders
of outstanding Parent Common Stock. 

(b) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to relieve Parent of
its obligation to submit this Agreement to its shareholders to a vote.
Neither Parents Board of Directors nor any committee thereof shall except as
expressly permitted by this _Section_ __ _ 2.15_, withdraw, qualify or
modify, or propose to withdraw, qualify or modify, in a manner adverse to
Stonegate or any of Stonegates Subsidiaries, the Parent Board Recommendation
(an " _Adverse Parent Recommendation Change_ "). Notwithstanding the

 



-22-  foregoing, prior to receipt of the Requisite Parent Vote, the Board of
Directors of Parent, after consultation with its outside counsel and, with
respect to financial matters, its financial advisor, determines in good faith
that it would more likely than not result in a violation of its fiduciary
duties under applicable law to continue to make the Parent Board
Recommendation to its shareholders, Parent and its Board of Directors
may submit this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby to its
shareholders without recommendation or otherwise make an Adverse Parent
Recommendation Change (although the resolutions adopting this Agreement as of
the date hereof may not be rescinded or amended), in which event the Parent
and its Board of Directors, may communicate the basis for its Adverse Parent
Recommendation Change to its shareholders in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or
an appropriate amendment or supplement thereto to the extent required by law;
_provided_ , that neither Parent nor its Board of Directors may take any
actions under this sentence unless (i) it gives the Stonegate at least five
(5) Business Days prior written notice of its intention to take such action
and a reasonable description of the event or circumstances giving rise to its
determination to take such action, (ii) during such notice period the Parent
and its Board of Directors and its representatives negotiate in good faith
with Stonegate and its representatives any amendment or modification to this
Agreement proposed by such other party and (iii) at the end of such notice
period, the Board of Directors takes into account any amendment
or modification to this Agreement proposed in writing by the other party
prior to the expiration of such notice period, and after receiving the advice
of its outside counsel and, with respect to financial matters, its financial
advisors, determines in good faith that it would nevertheless continue to be
more likely than not to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under
applicable law to continue to make the Parent Board Recommendation.

 

(c) If on the date of the Parent Shareholders Meeting, Parent has not
received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common
Stock to obtain the Parent Shareholder Approval, Parent shall adjourn the
Parent Shareholders Meeting until such date as shall be mutually agreed upon
by Stonegate and Parent, which date shall not be less than five (5) calendar
days nor more than ten (10) calendar days after the date of adjournment, and
subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall continue to use
all reasonable best efforts, together with its proxy solicitor, to assist in
the solicitation of proxies from shareholders relating to the Parent
Shareholder Approval; provided, however, Parent shall only be required to
adjourn, delay or postpone the Parent Shareholders Meeting as described above
once.

 

2.16 _Closing Deliveries by Stonegate_. At the Closing, Stonegate shall
deliver or cause to be delivered to Parent:

 

(a) a certificate of the Secretary of Stonegate, dated as of the Closing Date,
certifying to: (i) the Charter Documents of Stonegate; (ii) resolutions of

(d) such other documents as Parent reasonably deems necessary or appropriate
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

cause to be delivered to Stonegate: 

(a) evidence reasonably satisfactory to Stonegate of the payment of the Merger
Consideration to the Exchange Agent;

 

(b) a certificate of the Secretary of each of Parent and Subsidiary Bank,

Except as disclosed in the disclosure schedule delivered by Stonegate to
Parent concurrently herewith (the " _Stonegate Disclosure Schedule_ ");
provided, that (a) no such item is required to be set forth as an exception to
a representation or warranty if its absence would not result in the related
representation or warranty being deemed untrue or incorrect, (b) the mere
inclusion of an item in the Stonegate Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a
representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission by Stonegate that
such item represents a material exception or fact, event or circumstance or
that such item is reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect on
Stonegate and (c) any disclosures made with respect to a section of _Article
III_

 



-24-  shall be deemed to qualify (1) any other section of _Article III_
specifically referenced or cross-referenced and (2) other sections of _Article
III_ to the extent it is reasonably apparent on its face (notwithstanding the
absence of a specific cross reference) from a reading of the disclosure that
such disclosure applies to such other sections, Stonegate hereby represents
and warrants to Parent as follows:

(ii) with all requisite power and authority to own and operate its properties
and to carry on its business as presently conducted, and (iii) duly qualified
and in good standing as a foreign corporation authorized to do business in
each jurisdiction in which the nature of its activities or the character of
the properties it owns or leases make such qualification necessary, except in
such cases where the lack of said authorization or qualification has not had

Stonegate. True, complete and correct copies of the Charter Documents of
Stonegate, as in effect as of the date of this Agreement, have previously been
made available to the Parent.

(b) Each Subsidiary of Stonegate that is set forth on _Section 3.1(c)_ of the

in which the nature of its activities or the character of the properties it

depository institutions as set forth in 12 U.S.C. §1818(b), the
appointment of a conservator or receiver, bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
transfer, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors

required to be taken by it in order to make this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby comply with, and the transactions
contemplated hereby do comply with, the requirements of any provisions of its
Charter Documents concerning "business combination," "fair price," "voting

3.3 _No Conflicts_. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement
by Stonegate and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby by
Stonegate and its Subsidiaries, including the Merger, do not and will not (a)
conflict with, or result in a breach or violation of or default under, any
terms or conditions of the Charter Documents of Stonegate or any of its
Subsidiaries, or (b) assuming that the consents and approvals referred to in
_Section_ __ _ 3.4_ hereof are duly obtained, (x) conflict with or violate
in any material respect any Applicable Law as to Stonegate or any of its
Subsidiaries, (y) result in any material breach of, or constitute a material
default (or event which with the giving of notice or lapse of time, or both,
would become a material default) under, or give to others any rights of
termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation pursuant to, any
Stonegate Material Contract, or (z) result in the creation or imposition of
any Lien on any of the assets of Stonegate or its Subsidiaries.

3.4 _Consents and Approvals_. Other than (i) the Regulatory Approvals, (ii)
the approval by Stonegate Shareholders of the Merger and the execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement, and (iii) such other filings,
authorizations, consents, notices or approvals as may be set forth on
_Section_ __ _ 3.4_ of the Stonegate Disclosure Schedule, no consents,
approvals, authorizations or other actions by, or filings with or
notifications to, any Person or any Governmental Authority on the part of
Stonegate or any of its Subsidiaries are required in connection with the
execution, delivery and performance by Stonegate of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

3.5 _Regulatory Matters_. Stonegate and each of its Subsidiaries has timely
filed all material reports, registrations and statements, together with any
amendments required to be made with respect thereto, that it was required to
file since January 1, 2014 with, as applicable, (i)

 



-26-  the Federal Reserve Board; (ii) the FDIC; (iii) the OFR and any predecessor
agency; (iv) any other applicable bank regulatory agencies (collectively, "
_Stonegate Regulatory Agencies_ ") and (v) any other applicable Governmental
Authority and have paid all applicable fees, premiums and assessments due and
payable thereto. Each such report, registration and statement, including

material respects, with Applicable Law. Since January 1, 2014, neither
Stonegate nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any cease-and-desist or
other formal or informal order or enforcement action issued by, or is a party
to any written agreement, consent agreement, operating agreement
or memorandum of understanding with, or is a party to any commitment letter,
regulatory directive or similar undertaking with, or is subject to any capital
directive by, or has been ordered to pay any civil money penalty by or at the
request of, any Stonegate Regulatory Agency or other Governmental Authority
of any kind or has adopted any board resolutions at the request or suggestion
of any Stonegate Regulatory Agency or other Governmental Authority that
currently restricts in any material respect the conduct of its business,
imposes any material requirements or procedures, relates to its credit or risk

policies, including Anti-money Laundering and Bank Secrecy Act requirements
or in any material manner relates to its capital adequacy, its ability to pay
dividends or its management (each, a " _Stonegate Regulatory Agreement_ "),
nor has Stonegate or any of its Subsidiaries been advised since January 1,
2014 by any Stonegate Regulatory Agency or other Governmental Authority that
it is considering issuing, initiating, ordering or requesting any such
Stonegate Regulatory Agreement. Except as set forth on  _Section_ __ _ 3.5_
of the Stonegate Disclosure Schedule, there is no material unresolved written
violation, criticism, comment or exception by any Stonegate Regulatory Agency
or other Governmental Authority relating to Stonegate or any of its
Subsidiaries, and Stonegate is not aware of any reason why all required
Regulatory Approvals would not be received on a timely basis without undue
delay and without the imposition of any Materially Burdensome Regulatory
Condition as described in the proviso to _Section 5.3(a)(i)_. Except for
normal examinations conducted by Governmental Authorities in the regular
course of business, no Governmental Authority has initiated any investigation
or proceeding into the business or operations of Stonegate since January 1,
2014.

in accordance with GAAP and any other applicable legal and accounting
requirements and reflect only actual transactions. As of the date hereof,
Crowe Horwath LLP has not resigned (or informed Stonegate that it intends to
resign) or been dismissed as independent public accountants of Stonegate as a
result of or in connection with any disagreements with Stonegate on a matter
of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or
auditing scope or procedure.

 

(b) Except as would not reasonably be expected to be, individually or in the
aggregate, material to Stonegate and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,

obligation of any nature whatsoever (whether absolute, accrued, contingent,
determined, determinable or otherwise and whether due or to become due),
except for (i) those liabilities or obligations that are reflected or reserved
against on the consolidated balance sheet of Stonegate included in its Annual

all means of access thereto and therefrom). Stonegate (x) has implemented and
maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of
the Exchange Act) to ensure that material information relating to Stonegate,
including its Subsidiaries, is made known to the chief executive officer and
the chief financial officer of Stonegate by others within those entities as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures and to
make the certifications required by the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "), and (y) has

to adversely affect Stonegates ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial information, and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material,
that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in
Stonegates internal controls over financial reporting. There is no reason to
believe that Stonegates outside auditors and its chief executive officer and
chief financial officer will not be able to give the certifications and
attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant
to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without qualification, when next
due.

effect, event, change occurrence or circumstance that would reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Change in Stonegate or (iii) action taken

Parents consent if Stonegate had been subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.1_ hereof
at such time.

 

3.11 _Reorganization_. Neither Stonegate nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken
any action, nor are they aware of any fact or circumstance, that would

been amended, modified, waived, subordinated or otherwise altered by
Stonegate, except as evidenced by a written instrument which is a part of the
file with respect to such Loans made available to Parent and was entered into
by Stonegate in good faith and in its ordinary course of business. For
purposes of this _Section 3.16(a)_ , the phrase "enforceable in accordance
with its terms" as it relates to a Loan does not mean that the borrower has
the financial ability to repay a Loan or that any collateral is sufficient to
result in payment of the Loan secured thereby.

 

(b) Stonegate has previously disclosed a complete and correct list of all
Loans that, as of the Balance Sheet Date (i) are contractually past due 90
days or more in the payment of principal and/or interest, (ii) are on
nonaccrual status or (iii) are classified as "Watch List," "Special Mention,"
"Substandard," "Doubtful" or "Loss," (or words of similar import) together
with the principal amount on each such Loan and the identity of the obligor
thereunder. _Section 3.16(b)_ of the Stonegate Disclosure Schedule sets forth
a complete list of other real estate owned, acquired by foreclosure or by
deed in-lieu thereof and owned by Stonegate or its Subsidiaries as of the

respects, Stonegates underwriting and servicing standards (and, in the case
of Loans held for resale or previously sold to investors, the underwriting
standards, if any, of the applicable investors) in all material respects and
with Applicable Laws and applicable requirements of any government-
sponsored enterprise program in all material respects, and (ii) Stonegate and

with their duties as required under applicable regulatory requirements.

of Stonegate or any of its Subsidiaries. There are no Loans to any employee,
officer, director or other Affiliate of Stonegate on which the borrower is
paying a rate other than that reflected in the note or the relevant credit
agreement. All such Loans are and were made in compliance in all material
respects with all Applicable Laws. Each Loan disclosed on _Section 3.16(f)_ of
the Stonegate Disclosure Schedule has been made in the ordinary course of
business, and on the same terms, including interest rate and collateral, as
those prevailing at the time for comparable arms-length transactions, did not
involve more than the normal risk of collectability or present other
unfavorable features.

 

3.17 _CRA Compliance_. Stonegate is Well-Capitalized and most recent
examination rating under the Federal Community Reinvestment Act, as amended,
and the regulations promulgated thereunder (" _CRA_ "), was "satisfactory" or
better. To Stonegates Knowledge, there is no fact or circumstance or set of
facts or circumstances which would be reasonably likely to cause Stonegate to
receive any notice of non-compliance with such provisions of the CRA or cause
Stonegates CRA rating to decrease below the "satisfactory" level.

 

3.18 _Investment Portfolio_. All investment securities held by Stonegate or
its Subsidiaries, as reflected in the financial statements included in the
Stonegate FDIC Filings, are in all material respects carried in accordance

has good, valid and marketable title to all securities held by it, except
securities sold under repurchase agreements or held in any fiduciary or agency
capacity, free and clear of any Lien, except as set forth in the financial
statements included in the Stonegate FDIC Filings and except to the extent
any such securities are pledged in the ordinary course of business consistent
with prudent banking practices to secure obligations of Stonegate or its
Subsidiaries.

 

3.19 _Interest Rate Risk Management Instruments_. All interest rate swaps,
caps, floors, option agreements, futures and forward contracts and other
similar derivative transactions and risk management arrangements, whether
entered into for the account of Stonegate, any of its Subsidiaries or for the
account of a customer of Stonegate or one of its Subsidiaries, were entered
into in the ordinary course of business and in accordance with applicable
rules, regulations and policies of any Regulatory Agency and with
counterparties believed to be financially responsible at the time and are
legal, valid and binding obligations of Stonegate or one of its Subsidiaries
enforceable in accordance with their terms except as may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar laws affecting
the rights of creditors generally and the availability of equitable remedies,
and are in full force and effect. Stonegate and each of its Subsidiaries have
duly performed in all material respects all of their material obligations
thereunder to the extent that such obligations to perform have accrued,
and, to Stonegates knowledge, there are no material breaches, violations or
defaults or allegations or assertions of such by any party thereunder.

 



-37- 3.20 _Intellectual Property_. Stonegate and each of its Subsidiaries owns, or
is licensed to use (in each case, free and clear of any material Liens), all
Intellectual Property necessary for the conduct of its business as currently
conducted. To Stonegates Knowledge, the use of any Intellectual Property by
Stonegate and its Subsidiaries does not infringe, misappropriate or otherwise
violate the rights of any person in any material respect and is in accordance
in all material respects with any applicable license pursuant to which
Stonegate or any Stonegate Subsidiary acquired the right to use any
Intellectual Property, and no person has asserted in writing to Stonegate that

thereto, complied in all material respects with the requirements of the
Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and (B) did not, at
the time it was filed (or became effective in the case of registration
statements), or, if amended or supplemented, as of the date of the most recent
amendment or supplement thereto, contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

4.9  _Financial Statements_.

(a) The financial statements of Parent and its Subsidiaries included (or
incorporated by reference) in the Parent SEC Filings (including the related
notes, where applicable) (i) have been prepared from, and are in accordance
with, the books and records of Parent and its Subsidiaries; (ii) fairly
present in all material respects the consolidated results of operations, cash
flows, changes in shareholders equity and consolidated financial position of

statements to recurring year-end audit adjustments normal in nature and
amount); (iii) complied as to form, as of their respective dates of filing
with the SEC, in all material respects with applicable accounting
requirements and with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with
respect thereto; and (iv) have been prepared in accordance with GAAP
consistently applied during the periods involved, except, in each case, as
indicated in such statements or in the notes thereto (the " _Parent s
Financial Statements_"). As of the date hereof, the books and records of
Parent and its Subsidiaries have been maintained in all material respects in
accordance with GAAP and any other applicable legal and accounting
requirements and reflect only actual transactions. As of the date hereof, BKD,
LLP has not resigned (or informed Parent that indicated it intends to resign)
or been dismissed as independent public accountants of Parent as a result of
or in connection with any disagreements with Parent on a matter of accounting
principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or
procedure.

 

(b) Except as would not reasonably be expected to be, individually or in the
aggregate, material to Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, neither
Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred any material liability or
obligation of any nature whatsoever (whether absolute, accrued, contingent,
determined, determinable or otherwise and whether due or to become due),
except for (i) those liabilities that are reflected or reserved against on the
consolidated balance sheet of Parent included in its Annual Report on Form

 



-48-  10-K for the fiscal year ended the Balance Sheet Date (including any notes
thereto), (ii) liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of
business consistent in nature and amount with past practice since the Balance
Sheet Date or (iii) liabilities incurred in connection with this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(c) The records, systems, controls, data and information of Parent and its
Subsidiaries are in all material respects recorded, stored, maintained and
operated under means (including any electronic, mechanical or photographic
process, whether computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership
and direct control of Parent or its Subsidiaries or accountants
(including all means of access thereto and therefrom). Parent (x) has
implemented and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that material information
relating to Parent, including its Subsidiaries, is made known to the chief
executive officer and the chief financial officer of Parent by others within
those entities as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosures and to make the certifications required by the Exchange
Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and (y) has disclosed,
based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to Parents
outside auditors and the audit committee of Parents Board of Directors (i)
any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
operation of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in
Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to adversely
affect Parents ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information, and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in Parents internal
controls over financial reporting. There is no reason to believe that Parents
outside auditors and its chief executive officer and chief financial officer
will not be able to give the certifications and attestations required pursuant
to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act, without qualification, when next due.

4.10_ of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, or as contemplated by this Agreement,
there has not been (i) any Material Adverse Change in Parent, (ii) any fact,
effect, event, change occurrence or circumstance that would reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Change in Parent or (iii) any action taken
by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries during the period from the Balance Sheet
Date through the date of this Agreement that would have required Stonegates
consent if Parent had been subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.2_ at such time.

4.11  _Reorganization_. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken
any action, nor are they aware of any fact or circumstance, that would

5.3 _Approvals and Filings_.

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of Stonegate and Parent agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, and to
assist and cooperate with the other party in doing, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to fulfill all conditions applicable to such party and

make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) obtaining all Regulatory
Approvals and all other approvals necessary, proper or advisable actions or
non-actions, waivers, consents, qualifications and approvals from Governmental
Authorities and making all necessary, proper or advisable registrations,
filings and notices and taking all steps as may be necessary to obtain an
approval, waiver or exemption from any Governmental Authority; _provided_ that
nothing contained herein shall be deemed to require Parent, or require
or permit Stonegate, to take any action, or commit to take any action, or
agree to any condition or restriction, in connection with obtaining the
permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of any Governmental Authority
that would (A) reasonably be expected to result in Parent or Subsidiary Bank
becoming subject to any cease-and-desist order or other order, formal or
informal enforcement action issued by, or written agreement, consent
agreement, operating agreement, memorandum of understanding, commitment letter
or similar undertaking with, or any request to adopt any board resolutions by,
any Governmental Authority, in each case solely resulting from or arising out
of the conduct of Stonegates business, or (B) reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect on the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, after giving effect to the Merger, (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, any determination by any Regulatory Agency or other
Governmental Authority that the Merger may not be consummated as contemplated
herein or in a substantially similar manner immediately following
the Effective Time or that any Stonegate Regulatory Agreement will not
terminate and be of no further force and as of and following the consummation
of the Merger) (any of the

 



-61-  foregoing matters in clauses (A) and (B), a " _Materially Burdensome
Regulatory Condition_ "); (ii) obtaining all necessary, proper or advisable
consents, qualifications, approvals, waivers or exemptions from
nongovernmental Persons; and (iii) executing and delivering any additional
documents or instruments necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the

Agreement.

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, as soon as practicable
and in no event later than thirty (30) calendar days after the date of this
Agreement, Parent and Stonegate shall, and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to, each prepare and file any applications, notices and filings
required in order to obtain the Regulatory Approvals. Parent and Stonegate
shall each use, and shall each cause their applicable Subsidiaries to use,
reasonable best efforts to obtain each such approval as promptly as reasonably
practicable. The parties shall cooperate with each other in connection
therewith (including the furnishing of any information and any reasonable
undertaking or commitments that may be required to obtain the Regulatory
Approvals). Each party will provide the other with copies of any applications
and all correspondence relating thereto prior to filing, other than material
filed in connection therewith under a claim of confidentiality.

 

(c) Subject to Applicable Law (including Applicable Law relating to the
exchange of information), the parties shall advise each other within twenty-
four (24) hours of receiving any communication from any Governmental Authority

other consent or approval required hereunder will not be obtained or that the
receipt of any such approval will be materially delayed.

 

(d) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
Stonegate agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain (i) estoppel
certificates dated as of the Closing Date executed by each landlord of

Schedule) in forms as may be reasonably acceptable to Parent and (ii) the
written authorizations, consents, notices and approvals identified on

hereby and the integration of the business and operations of Stonegate and
its Subsidiaries, subject to _Section 5.4(c)_ and Applicable Laws relating to
confidentiality and the exchange of information, Stonegate shall permit Parent
and its Subsidiaries and their respective officers, employees, counsel,
accountants and other authorized representatives, access, throughout the
period before the Closing Date, upon reasonable notice and at Parents sole
expense:

 



-62- (i) during customary business hours, to all books, papers and records relating
to the assets, properties, operations, obligations and liabilities of
Stonegate and its Subsidiaries in which Parent may have a reasonable interest;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Stonegate shall not be required to take any
action that would provide access to or to disclose information where such
access or disclosure would result in the waiver by it of the privilege
protecting communications between it and any of its counsel or where such
access or disclosure would contravene any Applicable Law or Order or binding
agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the parties shall attempt to make appropriate substitute
disclosure arrangements; and

 

(ii) during and, as reasonably required, outside of customary business hours,
to telecommunications and electronic data processing systems, facilities and
personnel of Stonegate and its Subsidiaries for the purpose of performing
conversion activities related to data processing integration.

 

Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize any interference
with Stonegates regular business operations of Stonegate and its
Subsidiaries during any such access.

(b) At the request of Parent, during the period from the date of
this Agreement to the Closing, Stonegate shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and its and their respective officers and employees to, and shall
make all reasonable efforts to cause their respective telecommunications and
data processing service providers to (including by entering into customary
confidentiality, non-disclosure and similar agreements with such service
providers and/or Parent), cooperate and assist Parent in connection with
preparation for an electronic and systematic conversion of all applicable
data regarding Stonegate and its Subsidiaries to Parent and its Subsidiaries
systems of telecommunications and electronic data processing; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no such conversion shall occur until the Closing. Parent
shall be responsible for reasonable and agreed upon costs incurred by
Stonegate and its Subsidiaries, including all fees to third parties, in
connection with any such efforts.

 

(c) Each of Parent and Stonegate acknowledges and agrees that the
Confidentiality Agreement remains in full force and effect and, in addition,
covenants and agrees to keep confidential, in accordance with the provisions
of the Confidentiality Agreement, information provided to them pursuant to
this Agreement. If this Agreement is, for any reason, terminated prior to
the Closing Date, the Confidentiality Agreement and the provisions of this
_Section 5.4(c)_ shall nonetheless continue in full force and effect.

 

5.5 _Notification_. Stonegate, on the one side, and Parent, on the other side,
shall promptly (and in any event within three Business Days after becoming
aware of any such breach) notify the other party or parties in writing (a) if
it believes that such party or parties have breached any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement or (b) if it
believes that any event shall have occurred that might reasonably be expected
to result, individually or in the aggregate, in a failure of a condition set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.2_ or  _Section_ __ _ 6.3_ if continuing on the
Closing Date.

5.6 _Public Announcements_. Stonegate and Parent shall consult with each
other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public
statements or filings with respect to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue, and shall not 

 



-63-  permit any of their Subsidiaries to issue, any such press release or make
any such public statement without the prior written consent of the other
party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed;
_provided_ , _however_ , that a party may, without the prior written consent
of the other party, issue such press release or make such public statement or
filing as may be required by Applicable Law or Order, or any listing
agreement with a national stock exchange or automated quotation system;
_provided_ , _further_ , however that such party shall have first used
reasonable best efforts to consult with the other party with respect to such
release, statement or filing.

5.7 _No Control of Stonegate._ Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give
Parent or its Subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, the right to control or
direct the operations of Stonegate prior to the Closing Date.

 

5.8 _Employee Benefit Matters_.

 

(a) As of the Closing Date, Parent shall, or shall cause its applicable
Subsidiary to, provide to each employee of Stonegate or its Subsidiaries who,
as decided by Parent in its sole discretion, shall continue employment with
the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries following the Closing
Date (a " _Continuing Employee_ ") (i) base hourly wages or salaries, as
applicable, and (ii) employee benefit plans, programs, policies and
arrangements that, are substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to the
Stonegate Employee Benefit Plans provided to each such Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Closing Date (but in no event greater than the base
wages, salaries or employee benefits provided to Parents similarly situated
employees within the same geographic market as such employees of Stonegate).
To the extent annual bonuses for employees of Stonegate and its Subsidiaries
accrued under Stonegates 2017 bonus pool as disclosed in _Section 5.8(a)_ of
the Stonegate Disclosure Schedule are not paid by Stonegate prior to the
Closing Date, Parent shall, or shall cause its applicable Subsidiary to, pay
such accrued bonuses promptly following the Closing Date.

(b) At the Effective Time and as a condition to making each Employment
Payment, the parties to the Terminated Employment Agreements shall execute and
deliver an acknowledgment of the termination thereof which shall provide for
the survival of any provision under such Terminated Employment Agreements
related to any excise tax or tax gross-up payment, as contemplated by Section
3.12(q) of the Stonegate Disclosure Schedules, not paid prior to the Effective
Time. From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall honor and make all
payments provided for, as required by the terms of, all Continuing Employment
Agreements with employees of Stonegate or any of its Subsidiaries in effect
immediately prior to the Closing Date, subject to any limitations imposed
under Applicable Law or by any regulatory authority. In addition, during the
period commencing at the Effective Time and ending six (6) months after
conversion, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide
each Continuing Employee who is not a party to a Continuing Employment
Agreement at the time of his or her termination of employment whose employment
is involuntarily terminated (other than under circumstances that constitute a
termination for "cause" under Stonegates current form of employment
agreement) with the severance payments, if any, to which the Continuing
Employee is entitled under the severance policy identified on
_Section 3.23(a)_ of the Stonegate Disclosure Schedule; _provided_ that such
severance benefit payments shall be conditioned on execution of a release of
claims in a form satisfactory to Parent.

 



-64- (c) Prior to or at the Effective Time, Parent shall enter into agreements with
or offer employment to the employees listed on _Section 5.8(c)_ of the
Stonegate Disclosure Schedule, under the terms and conditions to be mutually
agreed upon by Parent and Stonegate.

 

(d) Parent shall provide, or cause its applicable Subsidiary to provide, each
employee of Stonegate or its Subsidiaries who, as decided by Parent in its
sole discretion, does not continue employment with the Surviving Corporation
or its Subsidiaries following the Closing Date (a " _Discontinued Employee_ ")
with severance benefits under the existing severance policies and practices
of Stonegate Bank as identified in _Section 3.23(a)_ of the Stonegate
Disclosure Schedule or pursuant to the terms of any Terminated Employment
Agreement in existence as of the date of such termination;  _provided_ that
such severance benefit payments shall be conditioned on execution of a
termination of agreement and release of claims in a form satisfactory to
Parent. Parent shall identify all Discontinued Employees within 30 calendar
days of the date of this Agreement and shall cooperate with Stonegate to
promptly communicate such anticipated employment status to each such
Discontinued Employee. Parent and Stonegate shall discuss and mutually agree
upon certain retention payments to be made to certain employees following the
date of this Agreement.

(e) With respect to any Parent Employee Benefit Plan in which any Continuing
Employee becomes eligible to participate on or after the Closing Date, Parent
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) waive all preexisting
conditions, actively at work requirements, exclusion and waiting periods with
respect to participation and coverage requirements under any such Parent
Employee Benefit Plan to the extent they were inapplicable to, or were
satisfied under, any Stonegate Employee Benefit Plan in which such Continuing
Employee participated prior to the Closing Date; and (ii) ensure that each
Continuing Employee receives full credit (including eligibility to
participate, vesting, vacation entitlement and severance benefits, but
excluding benefit accrual under any defined benefit Parent Employee Benefit
Plan or any such credit that would result in a duplication of benefits) under
each Parent Employee Benefit Plan in which such Continuing Employee becomes or
may become a participant for service with the Surviving Corporation (or any
predecessor to the Surviving Corporation and its Affiliates), solely to the
extent such service was credited under the Stonegate Employee Benefit Plans.
As of the Closing Date, Parent shall, and shall cause its applicable
Subsidiaries to, credit to Continuing Employees the amount of vacation time
that such employees had accrued under any vacation policy or arrangement
listed on _Section 3.23(a)_ of the Stonegate Disclosure Schedule as of the
Closing Date. With respect to each Parent Employee Benefit Plan that is a
health plan in which Continuing Employees participate after Closing, Parent
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (A) cause to be waived any
eligibility waiting period, any evidence of insurability requirement and the
application of any pre-existing condition limitation under such plan to the
extent such requirements or limitations were inapplicable to, or were
satisfied under, any Stonegate Employee Benefit Plan in which such Continuing
Employee participated prior to the Closing Date; and (B) cause each

 



-65-  Continuing Employee to be given credit under such health plan with respect
to the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs (" _Closing Date Plan Year_
") for amounts (such as deductibles and co-payments) paid under any similar
Stonegate Employee Benefit Plan by such Continuing Employee, with respect to
the Closing Date Plan Year and for which verification is provided by the
insurer or third party administrator of such Stonegate Employee Benefit Plan,
as though such amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms and
conditions of any applicable Parent Employee Benefit Plan.

 

(f) Parent and Stonegate acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained
in this _Section_ __ _ 5.8_ are included for the sole benefit of Parent and
Stonegate and nothing contained herein shall (i) be construed as an amendment
to any Stonegate Employee Benefit Plan or Parent Employee Benefit Plan or the
creation of any new employee benefit plan, (ii) create any third-party
beneficiary or other rights in any other person, including any employee or
former employee of any of Parent or Stonegate or their respective
Subsidiaries, or any dependent or beneficiary thereof or (iii) otherwise
obligate Parent or any of its Affiliates to maintain any particular Stonegate
Employee Benefit Plan, Parent Employee Benefit Plan or other employee benefit
plan or retain the employment of any particular employee following
the Closing Date. Parent and Stonegate further acknowledge and agree that
Stonegate and its Subsidiaries shall provide to Parent all employee books and
records relating to Continuing Employees no later than the Closing Date.

 

(g) Stonegate shall terminate the 401(k) Plan immediately prior to the Closing
by resolution adopted by the board of directors of Stonegate, on terms
acceptable to Parent, and simultaneously amend the 401(k) Plan to the extent
necessary to comply with all Applicable Laws to the extent not previously
amended. Said termination shall provide that all participants in the
401(k) Plan shall be fully vested in their account balances thereunder; and
Stonegate shall notify the 401(k) Plan participants and beneficiaries of such
termination prior to the Closing Date pursuant to Applicable Law requirements.
Parent will permit rollover of 401(k) plan assets by Continuing Employees in
cash and with respect to loans, in kind, to a defined contribution retirement
plan with a 401(k) feature of Parent or its Subsidiaries.

 

5.9 _No Solicitation of Transaction_ _by Stonegate_.

 

(a) From the date hereof until the Closing Date, or, if earlier, the date on
which this Agreement is terminated in accordance with _ARTICLE VIII_ ,
Stonegate shall not, and shall cause all of its Subsidiaries and its and their
respective Representatives to not, directly or indirectly, (i) take any action
to solicit, initiate, seek, knowingly facilitate or encourage any inquiries
or expressions of interest or the making of any proposal or offer that
constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition
Proposal, (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding
any Acquisition Proposal or furnish, or otherwise afford access, to any
Person (other than Parent and its Subsidiaries) any nonpublic information or
data with respect to Stonegate or any of its Subsidiaries or otherwise
relating to an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) approve, endorse or recommend any
Acquisition Proposal (other than the Merger), (iv) enter into any agreement in
principle, arrangement, understanding, contract or agreement relating to an
Acquisition Proposal 

 



-66-  (other than a confidentiality agreement which expressly permits Stonegate to
comply with its obligations pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.9_) (an "
_Acquisition Agreement_ "), or (v) propose or agree to do any of the
foregoing. Upon execution of this Agreement, Stonegate shall, and shall cause
each of its Subsidiaries and all of its and their respective Representatives
to, immediately cease any discussions, negotiations or communications with
any party or parties with respect to any Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 5.9_ shall preclude Stonegate
or its representatives from contacting any such party or parties solely for
the purpose of complying with the provisions of the first clause of this
sentence or to enforce the provisions of any confidentiality agreement entered
into with any Person with respect to a potential Acquisition Proposal.

(b) Notwithstanding _Section 5.9(a)_ , Stonegate may take any of the actions
described in clause (ii) of _Section 5.9(a)_ if, but only if, (i) Stonegate
has received a bona fide unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal, prior to
Stonegate Shareholders Meeting, that did not result from a breach of this
_Section_ __ _ 5.9_; (ii) Stonegates Board of Directors determines (in
accordance with this Agreement and after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and independent financial advisor, in both cases, from firms
of national stature) that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or is
reasonably likely to lead to, a Superior Proposal; (iii) Stonegate has
provided Parent with at least three (3) calendar days prior notice of such
determination; (iv) prior to furnishing or affording access to any
information or data with respect to Stonegate or any of its Subsidiaries or
otherwise relating to an Acquisition Proposal, Stonegate receives from such
Person a confidentiality agreement with terms no less favorable to Stonegate
than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement; and (v) the failure of
Stonegates Board of Directors to furnish such information or access or enter
into discussions or negotiations would violate its fiduciary duties to
Stonegate Shareholders. Stonegate shall promptly provide to Parent any non-
public information regarding Stonegate or its Subsidiaries provided to any
other Person that was not previously provided to Parent, such additional
information to be provided no later than the date of provision of such
information to such other party.

 

(c) Stonegate shall promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours)
notify Parent in writing if any proposals or offers (or modified offers or
proposals) are received by, any information is requested from, or any
negotiations or discussions are sought to be initiated or continued with,
Stonegate or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective Representatives, in each case constituting or in connection with
any Acquisition Proposal, and such notice shall indicate (a) the name of the
Person initiating such discussions or negotiations or making such proposal,
(b) offer or information request and the material terms and conditions of any
such proposals, offers or information requests (including the identity of the
Person making or intending to make such any such proposals, offers or
information requests, and (c) a copy of any proposal, offer or information
request, if in writing, and any related documentation or correspondence.
Stonegate shall keep Parent fully informed, on a current basis, of any
material changes in the status and any material changes or modifications in
the terms of any such discussion, proposal, offer or information request.

 



-67- (d) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent Stonegate or its Board
of Directors from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange
Act with respect to an Acquisition Proposal in a manner consistent with
Stonegates other obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 5.9_, it being
agreed that such Rules will in no way eliminate or modify the effect that any
action pursuant to such Rules would otherwise have under this Agreement.

 

5.10 _Indemnification; Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __ _Insurance_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall (i) indemnify and hold
harmless each individual who at the Effective Time is, or any time prior to
the Effective Time was, a director, officer or employee of Stonegate or any of
its Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnitees_ ") in respect of all claims,
liabilities, losses, damages, judgments, fines, penalties costs and expenses
(including legal expenses) in connection with any claim, suit, action,
proceeding or investigation, whenever asserted, based on or arising out the
fact that Indemnitee was an officer, director or employee of Stonegate or
any Subsidiary for acts or omissions by Indemnitee in such capacity or taken
at the request of Stonegate or any Subsidiary, at or any time prior to the
Effective Time (including any claim, suit, action, proceeding or investigation
relating to the Transactions), to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable
Law and (ii) assume all obligations of Stonegate and its Subsidiaries to
Indemnitees in respect of indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for
acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time as provided in
Stonegates Charter Documents and the organizational documents of Stonegates
Subsidiaries. In addition, Parent, from and after the Effective Time, shall
advance any expenses (including legal expenses) of any Indemnitee under this
_Section_ __ _ 5.10_ as incurred to the fullest extent permitted by
Applicable Law, provided that the Indemnitee to whom expenses are advanced
provides an undertaking to repay advances if it shall be determined that such
Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
5.10_.

 

(b) Parent shall maintain in effect for six years after the Effective Time,
the current directors and officers liability insurance policies maintained
by Stonegate (provided that Parent may substitute therefor policies of at
least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are
no less advantageous to such officers and directors so long as substitution
does not result in gaps or lapses in coverage) with respect to matters
occurring prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that in no event shall
Parent be required to expend annually in the aggregate an amount in excess
of $1,266,000 of the annual premium payment on Stonegates current policy in

-69-  the time the Registration Statement is filed with the SEC and the Effective
Time, in connection with each firms delivery of its tax opinion pursuant to
_Section 6.2(e)_ and _Section 6.3(e)_. Each of Parent and Stonegate shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause such opinions to be delivered and not to
take or cause to be taken any action that would cause to be untrue (or fail to

to result in a Material Adverse Change in Parent. Parent shall
promptly notify Stonegate in writing of any Proceeding, pending or, to
Parents Knowledge, threatened against Parent or its Subsidiaries that (A)

likely to result in a Material Adverse Change in Stonegate. Stonegate shall
promptly notify Parent in writing of any Proceeding, pending or, to
Stonegates Knowledge, threatened against Stonegate or any of its Subsidiaries
that (A) questions or would reasonably be expected to question the validity of
this Agreement or the other agreements contemplated hereby or thereby or any
actions taken or to be taken by Parent or its Subsidiaries with respect hereto
or thereto, or (B) seeks to enjoin or otherwise restrain the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby. Stonegate shall give Parent the opportunity
to participate at its own expense in the defense or settlement of any
shareholder litigation against Stonegate and/or its directors or Affiliates
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and no such
settlement shall be agreed without Parents prior written consent (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

by any Governmental Authority, Parent shall continue, for a period of at least

8.6 _Governing Law_ _; Jurisdiction_. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware applicable to
contracts made and performed entirely within such state, without giving effect
to its principles of conflicts of laws; provided that the FBCA and the ABC,

corporations and Arkansas banks, respectively. The parties hereto agree that
any suit, action or proceeding brought by either party to enforce any
provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with,
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought
exclusively in any federal or state court of competent jurisdiction located

this Agreement or otherwise afforded by Applicable Law to any party, shall be
cumulative and not alternative. Without limiting the rights of a party hereto
to pursue all other legal and equitable rights available to such party for
another partys failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement, the

perform their respective obligations hereunder would be inadequate and that

 _FORM OF VOTING AGREEMENT_

 

THIS VOTING AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ ") is dated as of  ,
2017, by and between the undersigned holder ("Shareholder") of Common Stock,
$5.00 par value per share, of Stonegate Bank, a Florida-chartered commercial
bank ("Stonegate"), and Home BancShares, Inc., an Arkansas corporation
("HBI") and Centennial Bank, an Arkansas state bank ("Centennial") (HBI and
Centennial are collectively referred to herein as "Purchaser").
All capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings
assigned to them in the Merger Agreement (defined below).

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, HBI, Centennial
and Stonegate are entering into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (as such
agreement may be subsequently amended or modified, the "Merger Agreement"),
pursuant to which Stonegate will merge with and into Centennial, with
Centennial as the surviving entity (the "Merger"), and in connection with the
Merger, each outstanding share of Stonegate Common Stock will be converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration;

WHEREAS, Shareholder has voting power over the number of shares of Stonegate
Common Stock as indicated on the signature page of this Agreement under the
heading "Total Number of Shares of Stonegate Common Stock Subject to this
Agreement" (such shares, together with any additional shares of Stonegate
Common Stock subsequently acquired by Shareholder during the term of this
Agreement, including through the exercise of any stock option or other equity
award, warrant or similar instrument, being referred to collectively as the
"Shares");

 

WHEREAS, obtaining Stonegate Shareholder Approval of the Merger is a condition
to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement;
and

WHEREAS, it is a material inducement to the willingness of Purchaser to enter
into the Merger Agreement that Shareholder execute and deliver this
Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of, and as a material inducement to,
Purchaser entering into the Merger Agreement and proceeding with the
transactions contemplated thereby, and in consideration of the expenses
incurred and to be incurred by Purchaser in connection therewith, Shareholder
and Purchaser agree as follows:

 

Section 1\. _Agreement to Vote Shares_. Shareholder agrees that, while this
Agreement is in effect, at any meeting of shareholders of Stonegate, however
called, or at any adjournment thereof, or in any other circumstances in which
Shareholder is entitled to vote, consent or give any other approval, except as
otherwise agreed to in writing in advance by Purchaser, Shareholder shall:



     | a) | appear at each such meeting in person or by proxy; and 
---|---|--- b) vote (or cause to be voted), in person or by proxy, all the Shares that are
beneficially owned by Shareholder (other than those Shares held indirectly by
a spouse) or as to which Shareholder has, directly or indirectly, the sole
right to vote or direct the voting, (i) in favor of adoption and approval of
the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby (including any
amendments or modifications of the terms thereof which are approved by the
board of directors of Stonegate and adopted in accordance with the terms
thereof unless the effect of such amendment or modification is to reduce the
Purchase Price); (ii) against any action or agreement that would result in a
breach of any covenant, representation or warranty or any other obligation or
agreement of Stonegate contained in the Merger Agreement or of Shareholder
contained in this Agreement; (iii) against any Acquisition Proposal; and (iv)
against any other action, agreement or transaction that is intended, or could
reasonably be expected, to impede, interfere or be inconsistent with, delay,
postpone, discourage or materially and adversely affect consummation of the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

 

The Shares do not include shares over which the Shareholder exercises control
in a fiduciary capacity for any other person or entity that is not an
Affiliate of the Shareholder, and no representation by Shareholder is made
with respect thereto.

Section 2\. _No Transfers_. While this Agreement is in effect, Shareholder
agrees not to, directly or indirectly, sell, transfer, pledge, assign or
otherwise dispose of, or enter into any contract option, commitment or other
arrangement or understanding with respect to the sale, transfer, pledge,
assignment or other disposition of, any of the Shares, except with respect to
the following permitted transfers: (a) transfers by will or operation of law,
in which case this Agreement shall bind the transferee, (b) transfers
pursuant to any pledge agreement, subject to the pledgee agreeing in writing,
prior to such transfer, to be bound by the terms of this Agreement, (c)
transfers in connection with estate and tax planning purposes, including
transfers to relatives, trusts and charitable organizations, _provided_ that
as a condition to such transfer, such transferee, shall be required to execute
an agreement that is identical in form and substance to this Agreement, (d)
the exercise of outstanding stock options in order to pay the exercise price
of such stock options or satisfy any withholding taxes triggered by such
exercise, and (e) such transfers as Purchaser may otherwise permit in its
sole discretion, and further provided that notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, Shares that are pledged to secure a credit
facility as of the date of this Agreement may continue to be pledged to secure
a credit facility. Any transfer or other disposition in violation of the
terms of this Section 2 shall be null and void.

Section 3\. _Representations and Warranties of Shareholder_. Shareholder
represents and warrants to and agrees with Purchaser as follows:

a) Shareholder has all requisite capacity and authority to enter into and
perform his, her or its obligations under this Agreement.

b) This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Shareholder, and
assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by Purchaser,
constitutes the valid and legally binding obligation of Shareholder
enforceable against Shareholder in accordance with its terms, subject to
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and
similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors
rights and to general equity principles. c) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Shareholder does not, and
the performance by Shareholder of his, her or its obligations hereunder and
the consummation by Shareholder of the transactions contemplated hereby will
not, violate or conflict with, or constitute a default under, any agreement,
instrument, contract or other obligation or any order, arbitration award,
judgment or decree to which Shareholder is a party or by which Shareholder is
bound, or any statute, rule or regulation to which Shareholder is subject or,
in the event that Shareholder is a corporation, partnership, trust or other
entity, any charter, bylaw or other organizational document of Shareholder.

d) Shareholder has the authority to exercise voting power over the Shares
(other than those Shares held indirectly by a spouse). The Shares do not
include shares over which Shareholder exercises control in a fiduciary
capacity for any other person or entity that is not an Affiliate of
Shareholder, and no representation by Shareholder is made with respect
thereto. Shareholder has the right to vote the Shares (other than those Shares
held indirectly by a spouse), and none of the Shares is subject to any voting
trust or other agreement, arrangement or restriction with respect to the
voting of the Shares, except as contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 4.  _Specific Performance; Remedies; Attorneys  Fees_. The parties
hereto acknowledge that money damages are not an adequate remedy for breaches
of this Agreement, that any breach of this Agreement would cause irreparable
harm to the non-breaching party and that any party, in addition to any other
rights and remedies which the parties may have hereunder or at law or in
equity, may, in its sole discretion, apply to a court of
competent jurisdiction for specific performance or injunction or such other
relief as such court may deem just and proper in order to enforce this
Agreement or prevent any violation hereof and, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, each party waives any objection to the imposition of such
relief. Each party further agrees that it will not seek, and agrees to waive
any requirement for, the securing or posting of a bond in connection with the
other partys seeking or obtaining such equitable relief. All rights, powers
and remedies provided under this Agreement or otherwise available in respect
hereof at law or in equity shall be cumulative and not alternative, and the
exercise or beginning of the exercise of any such right, power or remedy by
any party shall not preclude the simultaneous or later exercise of any other
such rights, powers or remedies by such party. If any legal action or other
proceeding relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
or the enforcement of any provision of this Agreement is brought by any party
against the other party, the prevailing party in such action or proceeding
shall be entitled to recover all reasonable expenses relating thereto
(including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses, court costs and expenses
incident to arbitration, appellate and post-judgment proceedings) from the
other party, in addition to any other relief to which such prevailing party
may be entitled.

 

Section 5\. _Term of Agreement; Termination_. The term of this Agreement shall
commence on the date hereof and will terminate upon the earliest of (a) the
Effective Time, (b) the date of termination of the Merger Agreement in
accordance with its terms, or (c) upon the written agreement of the parties
hereto. Upon such termination, no party shall have any further obligations or
liabilities hereunder; provided, however, that such termination shall not
relieve any party from liability for any breach of this Agreement that
occurred prior to such termination. Section 6\. _Entire Agreement; Amendments_. This Agreement supersedes all
prior agreements, written or oral, among the parties hereto with respect to
the subject matter hereof and contains the entire agreement among the parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may not be amended,
supplemented or modified, and no provisions hereof may be modified or waived,
except by an instrument in writing signed by each party hereto. No waiver of
any provisions hereof by either party shall be deemed a waiver of any other
provision hereof by any such party, nor shall any such waiver be deemed a
continuing waiver of any provision hereof by such party.

Section 7.  _Severability_. In the event that any one or more provisions of
this Agreement shall for any reason be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable
in any respect, by any court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity,
illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions of this
Agreement and the parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to
substitute a valid, legal and enforceable provision which, insofar as
practical, implements the purposes and intents of this Agreement.

Section 8\. _Capacity as Shareholder_. This Agreement shall apply to
Shareholder solely in his or her capacity as a shareholder of Stonegate and
it shall not apply in any manner to Shareholder in his or her capacity as a
director, officer or employee of Stonegate. Nothing contained in this
Agreement shall be deemed to apply to, or limit in any manner, the
obligations of Shareholder to comply with his or her fiduciary duties as a
director or officer of Stonegate, if applicable.

 

Section 9\. _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
interpreted in accordance with, the internal, substantive laws of the State
of Arkansas, without regard for the law or principles of conflict of laws.

Section 10\. _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ALL RIGHT
TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON
CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE
ACTIONS OF THE PARTIES IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND
ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT
NO REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE
THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HAVE
BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 11.

 

Section 11\. _Waiver of Appraisal Rights; Further Assurances_. Provided that
the Merger is consummated in compliance with the terms of the Merger
Agreement, that the consideration offered pursuant to the Merger is not less
than that specified in the Merger Agreement executed on or about the date
hereof, and that this Agreement has not been terminated in accordance with
its terms, to the extent permitted by applicable law, Shareholder hereby
waives any rights of appraisal or rights to dissent from the Merger or demand
fair value for his or her Shares in connection with  the Merger, in each case, that Shareholder may have under applicable law.
From time to time prior to the termination of this Agreement, at Purchasers
request and without further consideration, Shareholder shall execute and
deliver such additional documents and take all such further action as may be
reasonably necessary or desirable to effect the actions and consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Shareholder further agrees not
to commence or participate in, and to take all actions necessary to opt out of
any class in any class action with respect to, any claim, derivative or
otherwise, against HBI, Centennial, Stonegate, or any of their respective
successors relating to the negotiation, execution or delivery of this
Agreement or the Merger Agreement or the consummation of the Merger.

 

Section 12\. _Disclosure_. Shareholder hereby authorizes Stonegate and
Purchaser to publish and disclose in any announcement or disclosure required
by the SEC and in the Proxy Statement-Prospectus such Shareholders identity
and ownership of the Shares and the nature of Shareholders obligations under
this Agreement.

 

Section 13\. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which
together shall constitute one instrument.

Section 14\. _Superior Proposal_. Notwithstanding any of the provisions of
this Agreement, the obligations of the Shareholder under this Agreement shall
not be applicable in connection with an Acquisition Proposal that is a
Superior Proposal, _provided_ that Stonegate has complied with the terms
and conditions of Section 5.9 of the Merger Agreement.

_[Signature Page Follows.]_ IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed and delivered this
Agreement as of the date first written above.
