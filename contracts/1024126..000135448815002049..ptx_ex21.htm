RECITALS

  

  

A. WHEREAS, Seller and certain of its Affiliates are engaged in business
operations and activities involving or related to the sourcing, research,
development, registration, transportation, use, promotion, marketing,
distribution, sale and other commercialization of Seller Products

B. WHEREAS, Seller wishes to sell to Purchaser, and Purchaser desires to
purchase from Seller, certain assets and rights comprising or associated with
the Product Business, upon the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth;

  

  

C. WHEREAS, Seller's board of directors ("Seller's Board") has (a) determined
that it is in the best interests of Seller and its stockholders to enter into
this Agreement; and (b) unanimously approved the execution, delivery and

Transactions contemplated hereby; and

  

  

D. WHEREAS, at the Closing, Seller and Purchaser shall enter into the
Ancillary Agreements.

  

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual benefits to be derived from
this Agreement and of the representations, warranties, conditions, agreements
and promises contained herein and other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties,
intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as follows:

1.1 Certain Defined Terms. As used herein, the following terms shall have the
following meanings:

  

  

1.1.1 "Accountants" means an accounting firm of national reputation (excluding
each of Seller's and Purchaser's respective regular outside accounting firms)
as may be mutually acceptable to Seller and Purchaser; provided, however, if
Seller and Purchaser are unable to agree on such accounting firm within ten
(10) days or any such mutually selected accounting firm is unwilling or unable
to serve, then Seller shall deliver to Purchaser a list of three other
accounting firms of national reputation that have not performed services for
Seller or Purchaser in the preceding three-year period, and Purchaser shall
select one of such three accounting firms.

1.1.2 "Accounts Receivable" means all accounts receivable, notes receivable
and other indebtedness due and owed by any Third Party to Seller or any of its
Affiliates arising from sales of the Product by or on behalf of Seller or its
Affiliates prior to the Closing Date.

1.1.4 "Adverse Event" means, with respect to a Seller Product, any
undesirable, untoward or noxious event or experience associated with the use,
or occurring during or following the administration, of such product in
humans, occurring at any dose, whether expected and whether considered related
to or caused by such Seller Product, including such an event or experience as
occurs in the course of the use of such Seller Product in professional
practice, in a clinical trial, from overdose, whether accidental or

pharmacological or biological therapeutic action of such Seller Product, and
including those events or experiences that are required to be reported to the
FDA under 21 C.F.R. sections 312.32, 314.80 or 600.80, as applicable, or to
foreign Governmental Authorities under corresponding applicable Law outside
the United States.

  

  

1.1.5 "Affiliate" means, with respect to a Person, any other Person that,
directly or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, controls, is
controlled by or is under common control with such first Person. For purposes
of this definition, "control" and, with correlative meanings, the terms
"controlled by" and "under common control with" means (a) the possession,
directly or indirectly, of the power to direct the management or policies of a
business entity, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by
contract relating to voting rights or corporate governance, or otherwise; or
(b) the ownership, directly or indirectly, of more than fifty percent (50%) of

2.3.1 Purchase Price.

  

  

(a) In consideration of the conveyances contemplated under Section 2.1,
Purchaser shall (a) pay to Seller (i) on the Closing Date an amount equal to
the sum of (A) $27,000,000; (B) the Stock Consideration; (C) the Promissory
Note; and (D) the Purchased Product Inventory Value (collectively, the

account designated by Seller by notice to Purchaser at least three (3)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date; (ii) the Milestone Payment(s), as and
to the extent provided in Section 2.3.2; and (iii) the Difference as set forth
in Section 2.3.1(b) below and (b) deliver to the Escrow Agent, at the Closing,

distributed in accordance with Section 2.4 and the terms of the Escrow
Agreement.

  

  

(b) In addition to the Purchased Product Inventory Value and subject to the
last sentence of this Section 2.3.1(b), Purchaser shall pay Seller the
difference (the "Difference") between the Purchased Product Inventory Value
and the Final Product Inventory Value determined in accordance with Section
2.3.3 in installments (the "Installments") within five (5) Business Days of
each payment by Purchaser to Daravita Limited for quantities of Second
Generation Replacement Product (as defined in the Second Generation Supply
Agreement). Each Installment shall be equal to the difference between [***]4
of Notional NSP (as set forth on Section 2.3.1 of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule) for such Second Generation Replacement Product and the corresponding
amounts due and payable to Daravita Limited under the Second Generation Supply
Agreement with respect to such Second Generation Replacement Product until
either (i) the Difference, if any, has been paid in full to Seller; or (ii)
Daravita Limited's obligation to supply Second Generation Replacement Product
at the Discounted Supply Price (as defined in the Second Generation Supply
Agreement) pursuant to Section 16.2.1 of the Second Generation Supply
Agreement terminates.

  

  

2.3.2 Milestone Payments.

  

  

(a) In addition to the Closing Payment, subject to this Section 2.3.2,
Purchaser shall pay or cause to be paid to Seller the following additional
amounts (each, a "Milestone Payment") upon the achievement by or on behalf of
Purchaser or its Affiliates, licensees, sublicensees or transferees, if any,
of the following events with respect to the Product and the Third Generation
Product (each, a "Milestone Event"):

  

  

(i) $12,500,000 upon the FDA's granting of Regulatory Approval of an NDA for a
Third Generation Product that practices a patent listable in the Orange Book
that has an expiration date which is January 1, 2025 or later;

  

  

(ii) [***];

  

  

  

  

   

  

***Certain information on this page has been omitted and filed separately with
the Commission. Confidential treatment has been requested with respect to the

25  

  

 

 

 

  

(iii) [***]5;

  

  

(iv) [***];

  

  

(v) [***];

  

  

(vi) [***]; and

  

  

(vii) [***].

  

  

(b) For the avoidance of doubt, (i) notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, each Milestone Payment shall be due and payable only once; and, (ii)
with respect to the Milestone Events set forth in Sections 2.3.2(a)(ii)
through 2.3.2(a)(vii) above, in the event that more than one Milestone Event
is achieved in [***], Purchaser shall pay Seller Milestone Payments for each
Milestone Event that is achieved unless, with respect to any such Milestone
Event, Seller has previously been paid for achieving such Milestone Event. By
way of example only, (A) if aggregate Net Sales reach [***], Purchaser shall
pay Seller the Milestone Payments associated with Sections 2.3.2(a)(ii)
([***]) and 2.3.2(a)(iii) ([***]); and (ii) if aggregate Net Sales reach [***]
during the following [***], Purchaser shall pay Seller the Milestone Payment
associated with Section 2.3.2(a)(iv) ([***]), but would not pay Seller the
Milestone Payments associated with Sections 2.3.2(a)(ii) or 2.3.2(a)(iii)
since Seller had previously received Milestone Payments with respect to those
Milestone Events.

  

  

(c) The Milestone Payment due and payable under Section 2.3.2(a)(i) shall be
paid by Purchaser to Seller promptly (but no more than thirty (30) days)
following the occurrence of the Milestone Event and all Milestone Payments due
and payable under Sections 2.3.2(a)(ii) through 2.3.2(a)(vii) shall be paid by
Purchaser to Seller promptly (but no more than seventy-five (75) days)
following the end of the Calendar Year in which the applicable Milestone Event
occurred (but subject to the limitation in Section 2.3.2(b) that each
Milestone shall be due and payable only once), in each case, by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to the account designated by Seller by notice
to Purchaser.

  

  

(d) Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates, licensees and
sublicensees engaged in the Exploitation of any Seller Product to keep copies
of the case study reports related to the in vitro and in vivo abuse liability
studies in the development plan set forth in Section 2.3.2(d) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule (the "Development Plan") and keep reasonable, correct and
complete books and records substantiating the Net Sales amounts recognized in
each Calendar Year, in each case, as related to achieving the Milestone Events
(the "Milestone Information") and shall maintain such Milestone Information
until the third (3rd) year following the end of the Calendar Year to which
such Milestone Information relates. Until the first Calendar Year following
the Calendar Year in which the Reporting Period terminates, Purchaser shall
provide Seller, (i) on a quarterly basis, not later than forty-five (45) days
after the end of each Calendar Quarter other than the Calendar Quarter ended
December 31, the quarterly Net Sales Reports; and (ii) on an annual basis, not
later than sixty (60) days after the end of each Calendar Year, the annual Net
Sales Reports, in each case as provided in Section 6.13. Seller's inspection
and audit rights with respect to the Milestone Information and Net Sales
Reports are set forth in Section 6.13.

  

 

   

  

***Certain information on this page has been omitted and filed separately with
the Commission. Confidential treatment has been requested with respect to the
omitted portions.

 

  

 

 

 

  

 

26  

  

 

 

 

  

(e) Prior to the expiration of the Reporting Period, if Purchaser and its
Affiliates transfer, sell, license, convey or otherwise dispose of all or
substantially all of Seller's and its Affiliates' rights in the Product
Business or, with respect to Section 2.3.2(a)(i), the rights to the Third
Generation Product, Purchaser shall (i) remain responsible for all of its
obligations with respect to the Milestone Payments set forth in this Section
2.3.2; and (ii) cause the transferee, licensee or assignee of such transferred
material rights to comply with this Section 2.3.2.

  

  

2.3.3 Product Inventory Value.

  

  

(a) Not more than five (5) Business Days before the Closing Date, Seller shall
provide to Purchaser a schedule (the "Product Inventory Schedule") listing the
total inventory of finished Product, that constitutes the Product Inventory in
accordance with the principles and worked example set forth on Section 2.3.3
of the Seller Disclosure Schedule (the aggregate value of the Product
Inventory calculated in this manner, the "Product Inventory Value") and
listing the Purchased Product Inventory in accordance with the principles and
worked example set forth on Section 2.3.3 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule
(the "Purchased Product Inventory Value").

  

  

(b) Seller shall deliver to and Purchaser shall accept all Purchased Product
Inventory tendered to Purchaser's common carrier (FCA from the facility at
which such Product Inventory is located as of the Closing Date) within no more
than five (5) Business Days following the Closing (the "Product Inventory
Delivery Date").

  

  

(c) Purchaser shall have fifteen (15) days from the Product Inventory Delivery
Date to review the Product Inventory Schedule and perform a physical
inspection of the Purchased Product Inventory to confirm that the Purchased
Product Inventory meets the applicable Specifications and shelf life
requirements (the "Product Criteria") and validate the information set forth
on the Product Inventory Schedule. Seller shall cooperate with Purchaser and
its Representatives to provide them with all access and information needed to
perform such review and inspection. The Product Inventory Schedule shall
become final and binding on the fifteenth (15th) day following the Product
Inventory Delivery Date, unless prior to the end of such period, Purchaser
delivers to Seller a written notice of its disagreement ("Notice of
Disagreement") specifying the number of Units which it believes do not satisfy
the Product Criteria (each, a "Disputed Item") and the basis for that belief.
Purchaser shall be deemed to have agreed with all items and amounts in the
Product Inventory Schedule not specifically identified as a Disputed Item in
the Notice of Disagreement, and such undisputed items shall be deemed final
and binding and shall not be subject to review in accordance with Section
2.3.3(d).

  

  

(d) During the ten (10) Business Day period following delivery of a Notice of
Disagreement by Purchaser to Seller, Purchaser and Seller in good faith shall
seek to resolve in writing any differences that they may have with respect to
the Disputed Items specified therein. During such ten (10) Business Day
period, Purchaser shall cooperate with Seller and its Representatives to
provide them with any information used in preparing the Notice of Disagreement
reasonably requested by Seller or its Representatives. Any Disputed Items
resolved in writing between Purchaser and Seller within such ten (10) Business
Day period shall be final and binding with respect to such items, and if
Seller and Purchaser agree in writing on the resolution of each Disputed Item,
the resulting Product Inventory Value, as adjusted to reflect the resolution
of the Disputed Items, shall be deemed to be the "Final Product Inventory
Value". If Seller and Purchaser have not resolved all such differences by the
end of such ten (10) Business Day period, Seller and Purchaser shall jointly
appoint an independent testing laboratory (the "Testing Laboratory") to review
records and test data and to perform comparative tests and/or analyses on the
Disputed Items. The Parties shall act in good faith and co-operate with the
Testing Laboratory in its investigation. The Testing Laboratory's
determination as to whether any Disputed Item satisfies the Product Criteria
shall be final and binding, and the resulting Product Inventory Value, as
adjusted to reflect the Testing Laboratory's resolution of the Disputed Items,
shall be deemed to be the "Final Product Inventory Value". The Final Product
Inventory Value, whether agreed to by the Parties or determined by the Testing
Laboratory, shall be final and binding on the Parties. The costs of any
dispute resolution pursuant to this Section 2.3.3(d), including the fees and
expenses of the Testing Lab and of any enforcement of the determination
thereof, shall be borne by the Parties in inverse proportion as they may
prevail on the matters resolved by the Testing Lab, which proportionate
allocation shall be calculated on an aggregate basis based on the relative
values of the amounts in dispute and shall be determined by the Testing Lab at
the time the determination of such firm is rendered on the merits of the
matters submitted.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

27  

  

 

 

 

  

(e) If Purchaser timely submits a Notice of Disagreement and the Product
Inventory Value exceeds the Final Product Inventory Value, as determined in
accordance with Section 2.3.3(d), Seller shall pay Purchaser the amount by
which the Product Inventory Value exceeds the Final Product Inventory Value
within ten (10) days after the Final Product Inventory Value is determined in
accordance with Section 2.3.3(d). Any such payment hereunder shall be made by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in
writing by Purchaser and shall be treated as an adjustment to the Closing
Payment.

  

  

2.3.4 Transitional License. In connection with the purchase of the Purchased
Product Inventory, Seller hereby grants Purchaser a non-exclusive, fully paid
up, transferable, royalty-free license, with the right to sublicense, (a) the
Transitional Trademarks; and (b) product identification numbers (including NDC
numbers) or consumer information telephone numbers, in each case, solely to
the extent necessary to sell the Purchased Product Inventory after the
Closing. Such license shall become effective on the Closing Date and expire
six (6) months after the last expiration date on Seller labeled Purchased
Product Inventory.

  

  

2.3.5 Allocation of Consideration. Purchaser shall allocate the Purchase Price
(including the Assumed Liabilities, to the extent properly taken into account
under Section 1060 of the Code) among the Purchased Assets, the transitional
license provided in Section 2.3.4 and the covenant provided in Section 6.14 in
accordance with Section 1060 of the Code (and any similar provision of state,
local or foreign law, as appropriate) (the "Allocation") prior to or within
ninety (90) days following the Closing and shall deliver to Seller a copy of
such Allocation (IRS Form 8594) promptly after such determination. Seller
shall have the right to review and raise any objections in writing to the
Allocation during the ten (10)-day period after its receipt thereof. If Seller
disagrees with respect to any item in the Allocation, the Parties shall
negotiate in good faith to resolve the dispute. If the Parties are unable to
agree on the Allocation within thirty (30) days after the commencement of such
good faith negotiations (or such longer period as Seller and Purchaser may
mutually agree in writing), then the Accountants shall be engaged at that time
to review the Allocation, and shall make a determination as to the resolution
of such Allocation. The determination of the Accountants regarding the
Allocation shall be delivered as soon as practicable following engagement of
the Accountants, but in no event more than sixty (60) days thereafter, and
shall be final, conclusive and binding upon Seller and Purchaser, and
Purchaser shall revise the Allocation accordingly. Seller, on the one hand,
and Purchaser on the other hand, shall each pay one-half of the cost of the
Accountants. The Parties agree to file all Tax Returns (including IRS Form
8594 and, if required, supplemental Forms 8594, in accordance with the
instructions to Form 8594) and any other forms, reports or information
statements required to be filed pursuant to Section 1060 of the Code and the
applicable regulations thereunder, and any similar or corresponding provision
of U.S. state, local or non-U.S. Tax Law, in a manner that is consistent with
the finalized Allocation and to refrain from taking any position inconsistent
therewith unless required by applicable Law or a final determination of a
taxing authority.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

28  

  

 

 

 

  

2.4 Escrow.

  

  

2.4.1 Escrow Amount. During the Escrow Period, upon the payment of the
Promissory Note, Purchaser shall promptly deliver to the Escrow Agent
$7,000,000 in cash from such payment (the "Promissory Note Escrow Amount" and,
together with the Initial Escrow Amount, the "Escrow Amount"), by wire
transfer of immediately available funds.

  

  

2.4.2 Escrow Agreement. Subject to the terms and conditions of a mutually
acceptable escrow agreement to be entered into at the Closing by each of
Seller and Purchaser (the "Escrow Agreement") and this Section 2.4, the Escrow
Agent shall hold the Escrow Amount and all other amounts deposited into the
Escrow Fund for a period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the date
that is twelve (12) months after the Closing Date (the "Escrow Period") as
security to pay, or be applied against, any Losses incurred by any Purchaser
Indemnitee that are subject to the indemnification obligations of Seller
pursuant to ARTICLE 8. Purchaser shall be treated for Tax purposes as the
owner of all amounts held in the Escrow Fund unless and until such amounts are
released therefrom, at which time the Party to whom such amounts are released
shall be treated for Tax purposes as the owner of such released amounts.

  

  

2.4.3 Payment of Claims. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Escrow
Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall disburse to Purchaser Indemnitees such
portion of the Escrow Fund as may be necessary to satisfy claims for which
Purchaser Indemnitees are entitled to indemnification pursuant to ARTICLE 8
hereof.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

29  

  

 

 

 

  

2.4.4 Release of Escrow Amounts. Following the expiration of the Escrow
Period, the Escrow Agent shall pay to Seller the balance of the funds in the
Escrow Fund at such time, if any, minus an amount equal to the aggregate
dollar amount of claims for Losses made by all Purchaser Indemnitees pursuant
to ARTICLE 8 hereof (the "Aggregate Outstanding Claims") which are then
outstanding and unresolved (such amount retained in the Escrow Fund, as it may
be further reduced after expiration of the Escrow Period by distributions to
Seller as set forth below and recoveries by Purchaser Indemnitees pursuant to
ARTICLE 8 hereof, the "Retained Escrow Funds"); provided, however, that in the
event that the amount of the Aggregate Outstanding Claims exceeds the balance
remaining in the Escrow Fund, all amounts remaining in the Escrow Fund shall
be retained in the Escrow Fund as the Retained Escrow Funds. In the event and
to the extent that after the expiration of the Escrow Period any outstanding
claim made by any Purchaser Indemnitee pursuant to ARTICLE 8 hereof is
resolved against such Purchaser Indemnitee, the Escrow Agent shall distribute
to Seller an aggregate amount of the Retained Escrow Funds equal to the amount
of the outstanding claim resolved against such Purchaser Indemnitee; provided,
however, that such distribution shall only be made to the extent that the
Retained Escrow Funds remaining after such distribution would be sufficient to
cover the amount of the Aggregate Outstanding Claims that are still unresolved
at such time. In the event and to the extent that after expiration of the
Escrow Period any outstanding claim made by any Purchaser Indemnitee pursuant
to ARTICLE 8 hereof is resolved in favor of such Purchaser Indemnitee, such
Purchaser Indemnitee shall be entitled to recover pursuant to ARTICLE 8 hereof
an amount equal to the amount of the outstanding claim resolved in favor of
such Purchaser Indemnitee.

  

  

2.4.5 Escrow Agent Fees and Expenses. Seller, on the one hand, and Purchaser,
on the other hand, shall pay to the Escrow Agent fifty percent (50%) of any
fees and expenses of the Escrow Agent by wire transfer of immediately
available funds. During the period in which the Escrow Funds (including any
Retained Escrow Funds) are retained in the Escrow Account, all interest or
other income earned from the investment of the Escrow Funds (the "Escrow
Earnings") shall be retained as additional amounts in the Escrow Account.

  

  

2.5 Closing.

  

  

2.5.1 Closing. Pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, the closing of the Transactions contemplated hereby (the "Closing")
shall take place at the offices of Lowenstein Sandler LLP, 1251 Avenue of the
Americas, New York, New York 10020, at 10:00 a.m., local time, on a Business
Day on a date not later than three (3) Business Days following satisfaction of
all conditions (other than those that by their terms are to be satisfied or
taken at the Closing (but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such
conditions) and those that are waived by the Party entitled to do so under
applicable Law and the terms of this Agreement) set forth in ARTICLE 7, or
such other time and place as Purchaser and Seller may agree to in writing;
provided, however, that if the waiting period under the HSR Act is terminated
before the thirty (30) day statutory period expires (an "Early Termination"),
Purchaser may, but shall not be obligated to, defer the Closing until a date
no later than ten (10) days after the Early Termination by providing Seller
written notice of such deferral within two (2) Business Days of the Parties'
receipt of notice of Early Termination. The Closing shall be deemed to have
occurred at 12:00 a.m., eastern time, on the Closing Date, such that Purchaser
shall be deemed the owner of the Purchased Assets on and after the Closing
Date.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

30  

  

 

 

 

  

2.5.2 Closing Deliveries.

  

  

(a) Except as otherwise indicated below, at the Closing, Seller shall deliver

executed by a duly authorized officer of Seller.

  

  

(ii) a certificate, executed by an officer of Seller and dated the Closing

(iii) copies of all Seller Third Party Consents;

  

  

(iv) copies of all Seller FDA Letters;

  

  

(v) the Purchased Contracts;

Purchased Assets, delivery shall, unless the Parties otherwise mutually agree,
be in accordance with the Transition Services Agreement and to a place within
the continental United States specified by Purchaser by notice to Seller at a
time prior to or after the Closing as the Parties mutually agree; and (B)
Seller may retain one copy of the Product Records included within the
Purchased Assets and the Purchased Contracts (and, for clarity, prior to
delivering or making available any files, documents, instruments, papers,
books and records containing Product Records to Purchaser, Seller shall be
entitled to redact from such files, documents, instruments, papers, books and
records any information to the extent that it does not relate to the Product
Business); and

  

  

(vii) a non-foreign affidavit of Seller dated as of the Closing Date, sworn
under penalty of perjury and in the form and substance required under Treasury
Regulations issued pursuant to Section 1445 of the Code certifying that Seller
is not a "foreign person" as defined in Section 1445 of the Code.

  

  

(b) At the Closing, Purchaser shall deliver the following to Seller:

  

  

(i) each of the Ancillary Agreements to which Purchaser is a party, validly
executed by a duly authorized officer of Purchaser;

  

  

(ii) the Stock Consideration;

  

  

(iii) a certificate, executed by an officer of Purchaser and dated the Closing
Date, confirming on behalf of Purchaser that the conditions set forth in
Sections 7.3.1 and 7.3.2 have been satisfied;

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

31  

  

 

 

 

  

(iv) an agent for services of process letter from Purchaser, in form and

Promissory Note, the Security Agreement, the Guaranty and the Ancillary

2.5.3 Withholding. If applicable Laws require withholding of Taxes imposed
upon any payments made by Purchaser to Seller pursuant to this Agreement,
Purchaser shall make such withholding payments as may be required and shall
subtract such withholding payments from such payments. To the extent such
amounts are so deducted or withheld, such amounts will be treated for all
purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to Seller; provided,
however, that Purchaser may deduct such amounts only if Purchaser shall (i)
give Seller reasonable advance notice of the intention to make such deduction
or withholding; (ii) upon Seller's reasonable request, explain the basis for
such deduction or withholding; (iii) cooperate with Seller to the extent
reasonably requested to obtain any applicable reduction of or relief from such
deduction or withholding; and (iv) timely file all Tax Returns related to such
withholding and provide to Seller such information statements and other
documents required to be provided to Seller.

  

  

ARTICLE 3

  

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER

  

  

Seller represents and warrants to Purchaser that, except as set forth in the
Seller Disclosure Schedule (but subject to the immediately following
sentence), the statements contained in this ARTICLE 3 are true and correct (a)
as of the date hereof; and (b) as of the Closing (unless in each case the
particular statement speaks expressly as of a particular date, in which case
it is true and correct only as of such date). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
it is expressly understood and acknowledged that any information disclosed in
the Disclosure Schedule under any numbered or lettered section or subsection
shall be deemed to relate to and qualify such section or subsection, as well
as any other sections or subsections of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, but
only where the relevance of such disclosure to such other section or
subsection is reasonably apparent from the text of such disclosure; provided,
that the mere listing of an agreement shall not provide reasonably apparent
disclosure, except to the extent that only a listing is required by the
representation and warranty.

  

  

3.1 Entity Status. Seller is a corporation duly organized, validly existing
and in good standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware. Seller has all
requisite corporate power and authority to own, use and operate the Purchased
Assets and to carry on the Product Business as now being conducted. Seller is
duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which such qualification or licensing is necessary under
applicable Law, except where the failure to be so qualified or licensed and to
be in good standing would not have a Material Adverse Effect.

and the Ancillary Agreements and the consummation of the Transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly authorized and approved by
Seller's Board, and no other corporate action on the part of Seller is
necessary to authorize and approve the execution, delivery and performance by
Seller of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and the consummation by

3.3 Non-Contravention. The execution, delivery, consummation and performance
by Seller of this Agreement and each Ancillary Agreement to which it is a
party do not and will not (a) contravene, conflict with or violate the

compliance with the HSR Act, contravene, conflict with or violate any Law
applicable to Seller or such Affiliates of Seller, the Product Business, or

creation of any Encumbrance other than a Permitted Encumbrance upon or with

Business or the Purchased Assets.

  

  

3.4 No Broker. Seller shall be solely responsible for the fees and expenses of
any broker, finder, investment banker or financial advisor entitled to any
brokerage, finder's or other fee or commission in connection with the

Governmental Authority or private dispute resolution body, that (i) involves
or otherwise relates to the Product Business, the Purchased Assets, or the
Assumed Liabilities; or (ii) challenges or, if resolved against Seller, would

reasonably be expected to impose any Liability on Purchaser or the Product
Business, or imposes any limitation on the ability of Seller to sell the
Purchased Product Inventory or operate the Product Business or the Purchased
Assets as currently conducted or planned to be conducted as of the date hereof
by Seller and, to Seller's Knowledge, there are no facts which would form a
basis for such order or judgment.

  

  

3.5.3 Since May 1, 2012, Seller has not received any written notice, claim or
complaint from any other Person alleging (a) a violation of, or failure to

registrations that have become applicable solely as a result of the specific
regulatory status of Purchaser or its Affiliates; and (iv) Seller Third Party
Consents, no notice to, filing with or Authorization of, any Governmental
Authority or other Person is required for Seller or any of its Affiliates to

notice of investigation from a Governmental or Regulatory Authority have been
received by Seller or any of its Affiliates and, to Seller's Knowledge, no
such product liability claims or investigations have been threatened against
Seller or any of its Affiliates relating to marketing and sale of the Product,
and to Seller's Knowledge, there are no facts or circumstances that would

order outstanding against Seller relating to Product liability claims or
Governmental or Regulatory Authority investigations relating to the marketing

3.7 Contracts.

  

  

3.7.1 Section 3.7.1 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule sets forth a complete
and correct list of each Contract to which Seller or any of its Affiliates is
a party that relates to the Product Business or is necessary for the
Exploitation or Manufacture of the Product with a value in excess of One
Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000) and any other Contract if a default
thereunder would reasonably be expected to materially adversely affect the
Product Business or Purchased Assets.

  

  

3.7.2 Except as set forth on Section 3.7.2 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule,

Seller, enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium or similar Laws of
general application affecting or relating to the enforcement of creditors'
rights generally, and subject to equitable principles of general
applicability, whether considered in a proceeding at law or in equity. Neither
Seller nor any of its Affiliates, nor, to Seller's Knowledge, any other party
thereto is (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) in breach or
default in the performance, observance or fulfillment of any material
obligation or material covenant contained in any Purchased Contract, nor does
there exist any condition which upon the passage of time or the giving of
notice or both, would reasonably be expected to cause such material violation
of or material default under or permit the termination or modification of any
Purchased Contract. Neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates has given or

Approvals, which are the subject of Section 3.9.1) necessary for the conduct
of the Product Business as it is currently conducted and the ownership of or
use of the Purchased Assets (collectively, the "Seller Authorizations"). All
such material Seller Authorizations are set forth in Section 3.8.2 of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule, and all of such Seller Authorizations are in full
force and effect, except as would not reasonably be expected to materially and
adversely affect the Product Business. Neither Seller nor any of its
Affiliates have received any communication with respect to the Product
Business from any Governmental Authority regarding, and, to Seller's
Knowledge, there are no facts or circumstances that are likely to give rise
to, (i) any material adverse change in any Seller Authorization, or any
failure to materially comply with any applicable Law or any term or
requirement of any Seller Authorization; or (ii) any revocation, withdrawal,
suspension, cancellation or termination of any Seller Authorization.

  

  

3.8.3 Since May 1, 2012, Seller has complied with all applicable Data
Protection Laws, as well as with its own rules, policies, and procedures
relating to privacy, data protection, and the collection and use of personal
information collected, used, or held for use by Seller, except for such

affect the Product Business or Purchased Assets. No claims have been asserted
or threatened against Seller alleging a violation of any Person's privacy or
personal information or data rights and, to Seller's Knowledge, nothing has
been done or omitted to be done and no circumstances exist which could give
rise to any proceeding, action or claim in connection with the applicable Data
Protection Laws. To Seller's Knowledge, the consummation of the Transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will not breach or otherwise cause any
violation of any Data Protection Law or rule, policy or procedure relating to
privacy, data protection, and the collection and use of personal information
collected, used, or held for use by Seller in the conduct of the Product
Business.

possessed, or has a right of reference to all material Regulatory Approvals
necessary to conduct the Product Business as currently or then conducted or
develop the Third Generation Product as currently being developed. All such
material Regulatory Approvals are in full force and effect, and no
Governmental Authority has imposed any material obligation or other
Encumbrance upon any such Regulatory Approval that remains unsatisfied or
undischarged, except as set forth in Section 3.9.1 of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule. Since May 1, 2012, neither Seller nor its Affiliates, and to
Seller's Knowledge, no Partners have received any written communication from

terminate any such Regulatory Approvals, and there is no proceeding pending
or, to Seller's Knowledge, threatened regarding the suspension or revocation
of any such Regulatory Approval. Since May 1, 2012, Seller has not received,
and to Seller's Knowledge, no Partners have received (i) any written notice
that the FDA or any other Governmental Authority has commenced, or threatened
to initiate, any action to request a recall of the Product, or commenced, or
threatened to initiate, any action to enjoin production at any facility at
which the Product is Manufactured; or (ii) any FDA Form 483, notice, warning
letter, untitled letters, or any other similar correspondence or notice
related to the Seller Products stating that Seller and/or the applicable
Partner was or is in material violation of any Law, clearance, approval, or
exemption. Seller has not voluntarily or involuntarily surrendered, terminated
or permitted to lapse or expire any Regulatory Approval used or maintained by
Seller in the conduct of the Product Business or the development of the Third
Generation Product except where the surrender, termination, or lapse would not
reasonably be expected to materially adversely affect the Product Business or
Purchased Assets. Since May 1, 2012, Seller or its Affiliates and, to Seller's
Knowledge, any Partner that Manufactures or distributes any Seller Product,
have timely filed with the applicable Governmental Authority all required
filings, declarations, listings, registrations, reports or submissions that

alleged defect in the Product. Seller has made available to Purchaser true and
correct summary reports regarding material complaints and notices of alleged
defect or adverse reaction with respect to the Product that have been received
in writing by Seller and its Affiliates since May 1, 2012. To Seller's
Knowledge, except as set forth on Section 3.9.2 of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule, there are no facts which are reasonably likely to cause (i) the
recall, market withdrawal or replacement of any Product sold or intended to be
sold by Seller; (ii) a material change in the labeling of the Product; or
(iii) a termination or suspension of the marketing of the Product.

  

  

3.9.3 Since May 1, 2012, the Product has been Manufactured in compliance with

approvals and consents for the conduct of clinical trials from the necessary
Governmental Authorities and, to Seller's Knowledge, there is no Litigation
pending or threatened by such Governmental Authorities to suspend or terminate
any ongoing clinical trials for any Seller Product. Seller has not received
any written notice, charge, subpoena or other request for information, which
has not been complied with or withdrawn, by a Governmental Authority asserting
any material breach of the conditions for approval of any ongoing clinical
trials for the Product or Third Generation Product. Seller and its Affiliates
have conducted all clinical trials for the Seller Products pursuant to valid
protocols.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

38

of time with respect to a Tax assessment or deficiency regarding the
aforementioned Taxes.

3.12.4 Seller or one of its Affiliates owns or otherwise has the right to use
all Intellectual Property Rights necessary to conduct the Product Business as
presently conducted (provided the same is not to be interpreted as a
representation as to non-infringement). To Seller's Knowledge, other than

or opposition proceeding threatened in a writing received by Seller.

  

  

3.12.7 To Seller's Knowledge, except as set forth in Section 3.12.7 of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule, the conduct of the Product Business as conducted,
and as contemplated to be Exploited by Purchaser with respect to the Product
and the Third Generation Product as of the Closing Date, does not infringe or
misappropriate any Third Party's Intellectual Property Rights or constitute
unfair competition or an unfair trade practice under applicable Law. To
Seller's Knowledge, the Manufacturing of the Product as Manufactured on the
Execution Date does not infringe or misappropriate any Third Party's
Intellectual Property Rights or in the location(s) where Product is
Manufactured or constitute unfair competition or an unfair trade practice
under applicable Law. As of the Execution Date, no letter or other written or
electronic communication or correspondence has been received by Seller or any
of its Affiliates or any of their Representatives at any time within the six
(6) years prior to the Execution Date, regarding any actual, alleged, or
suspected infringement or misappropriation of any Third Party's Intellectual
Property Rights or unfair competition or unfair trade practice under any
applicable Law in connection with the conduct of the Product Business. To
Seller's Knowledge, except as set forth in Section 3.12.7 of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule, no Litigation (A) is pending or threatened against Seller
(i) based upon, challenging or seeking to deny or restrict the use of any of
Seller Intellectual Property; (ii) alleging that Seller's conduct of the
Product Business infringes or misappropriates the Intellectual Property Rights
of any Third Party; or (iii) alleging that Seller's conduct of the Product
Business constitutes unfair competition or an unfair trade practice under any
applicable Law; or (B) is pending or threatened against Seller as of the
Execution Date asserting a paragraph IV certification filed pursuant to
Section 505(j)(2)(A)(vii)(IV) or 505(b)(2)(A)(iv) of the Act advising Seller
or any of its Affiliates of the filing of an ANDA or Section 505(b)(2) NDA
relative to any Patent Rights listed in any Regulatory Approval held by
Seller.

3.12.8 To Seller's Knowledge, no Person is currently infringing or
misappropriating in any material respect any Seller Patents or Seller
Trademarks in a manner that would reasonably be expected to materially
adversely affect the Product Business or Purchased Assets. Section 3.12.8 of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule accurately identifies (and Seller has provided
to Purchaser a complete and accurate copy of) each letter or other written or
electronic communication or correspondence that has been sent by Seller or any
of its Affiliates or any of their Representatives regarding any actual,
alleged, or suspected infringement or misappropriation of any Seller
Intellectual Property or unfair competition or unfair trade practice under any
applicable Law in connection with the conduct of the Product Business.

  

  

3.12.9 Seller and, as applicable, Seller's Affiliates, have taken reasonable
measures to maintain in confidence all Trade Secrets and other material
confidential information included in Seller Know-How except to the extent such

Product Business or Purchased Assets. To Seller's Knowledge, none of such
Trade Secrets or material confidential information have been disclosed to any
Person by Seller or its Affiliates except pursuant to reasonable non-
disclosure or license agreements. To Seller's Knowledge, no current or former
employee, consultant or independent contractor of Seller or any of its
Affiliates has any claim of ownership in or to any Seller Intellectual
Property owned by Seller or any of its Affiliates.

  

  

3.12.10 To Seller's Knowledge (i) all registrations of Seller Intellectual
Property included in Seller Licensed Registered Product IP or Seller Owned
Registered Product IP which are material to the Product Business, are presumed
valid, subsisting, and have not been held unenforceable; and (ii) all
applications for registration of licensed Intellectual Property Rights
included in Seller Licensed Registered Product IP or in Seller Owned
Registered Product IP which are material to the Product Business are
subsisting. To Seller's Knowledge, Seller and its Affiliates have complied in
all material respects with applicable Law regarding the duty to disclose and
duties of candor in the filing, maintaining and prosecution of the patents and
patent applications included in Seller Intellectual Property.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

42  

  

 

 

 

  

3.12.11 All material fees, annuities and royalties that are due and properly
payable to a licensor of Seller Licensed Registered Product IP by Seller have
been paid or will be paid prior to such payment being deemed late under the
applicable Seller License Agreement.

  

  

3.12.12 For the avoidance of doubt, the representations and warranties in
Section 3.12 shall be true and correct only as of the Execution Date with
respect to any paragraph IV certification filed pursuant to Section
505(j)(2)(A)(vii)(IV) or 505(b)(2)(A)(iv) of the Act advising Seller or any of
its Affiliates of the filing of an ANDA or Section 505(b)(2) NDA relative to

3.13 Inventory.

  

  

3.13.1 Section 3.13.1 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and
accurate description of all Product Inventory as of the date of this Agreement
and lists (i) the lot numbers associated with the Product Inventory; and (ii)
the manufacturing, warehousing, distribution and consignee locations where the
Product Inventory is located.

  

  

3.13.2 The Product Inventory will represent all Product finished goods owned
and on hand or in the control of Seller at any of its warehouses,
manufacturers, suppliers or other Third Parties on Seller's behalf on the
Closing Date.

  

  

3.13.3 In the 12 months prior to the Execution Date, other than in the
ordinary course of business or in the transition to the formulation of the
Second Generation Project, Seller has not (a) materially altered its
activities and practices with respect to inventory levels of the Product
maintained at the wholesale, chain, institutional or retail levels; or (b)
engaged in any activity or practice that would reasonably be expected to
result, directly or indirectly, in a trade buy-in that is significantly in
excess of normal customer purchasing patterns consistent with past practice of
the Product Business.

  

  

3.14 Product Financial Information. Section 3.14 of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule sets forth the net sales as recognized by Seller upon the earlier to
occur of prescription units dispensed or expiration of the right of return
(the gross amount invoiced by Seller for sale or other commercial disposition
of the Product (in final, finished presentation for use by an end-user) to an
unrelated Third Party in an arms-length transaction, minus the deductions
(other than for Product returns), if any, described in the definition of "Net
Sales"), deferred revenue, Product Cost-of-Goods, Units Produced and Units
Sold for the Product for the twelve-months ended December 31, 2014 and the
Units of inventory of finished Product owned by Seller or any Affiliate at

detailed supporting documentation. The Financial Information has been prepared

Seller and fairly presents in all material respects such net sales, Product
Cost-of-Goods, inventory of finished Product, Units Produced, and Units Sold
for the Product for the periods indicated.

  

  

3.15 Sufficiency of Purchased Assets. Except as set forth on Section 3.15 of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule, the Purchased Assets comprise all of the
assets and rights necessary for Seller and its Affiliates in the conduct of
the Product Business, and are sufficient for the continued conduct of the
Product Business after the Closing Date in substantially the same manner as
conducted prior to the Closing Date (provided the foregoing is not to be
interpreted as a representation of non-infringement). None of the Excluded
Assets are material to the Product Business. No Trademarks other than the
Seller Trademarks and the Transitional Trademarks will be required to Exploit
the Purchased Product Inventory on or following the Closing Date.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

43  

  

 

 

 

  

3.16 Products. Except as set forth on Section 3.16 of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule, each Product sold by or on behalf of Seller or its Affiliates prior
to the Closing Date was Manufactured in accordance with applicable
Specifications and applicable Law, except where any noncompliance would not
reasonably be expected to materially adversely affect the Product Business or
Purchased Assets.

  

  

3.17 Labor Matters.

  

  

3.17.1 There are no pending or, to Seller's Knowledge, threatened strikes,
lockouts, work stoppages or slowdowns involving Product Business Employees,

not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

3.17.2 There is no unfair labor practice proceeding involving any Product
Business Employee before the National Labor Relations Board pending or, to
Seller's Knowledge, threatened against Seller.

  

  

3.17.3 Neither Seller nor any Subsidiary is a party to any labor or collective
bargaining agreement which represents Product Business Employees and there are
no labor or collective bargaining agreements which pertain to Product Business
Employees. No Product Business Employees are represented by any labor
organization with respect to their employment with Seller or any Subsidiary;
no labor organization or group of Product Business Employees has made a
pending demand for recognition or certification to Seller and there are no
representation or certification proceedings or petitions seeking a
representation proceeding presently pending or, to Seller's Knowledge,
threatened to be brought or filed with the National Labor Relations Board or
any other labor relations tribunal or authority relating to Seller with
respect to Product Business Employees. There are no organizing activities
involving Seller with respect to the Product Business pending with any labor
organization or group of Product Business Employees.

  

  

3.17.4 There are no material complaints, charges, or claims against Seller
pending, or to Seller's Knowledge, threatened in writing to be brought or
filed, by or with any Governmental Authority or arbitrator based on, arising
out of, in connection with, or otherwise relating to the employment or
termination of employment of any individual by Seller with respect to the
Product Business.

  

  

3.17.5 The Product Business is not under investigation or audit with respect
to its treatment of independent contractors as independent contractors rather
than employees.

  

  

3.17.6 With respect to the Product Business and Product Business Employees,
Seller is in compliance in all material respects with all laws governing the
employment of labor, including, but not limited to, all such laws relating to
wages, hours, collective bargaining, discrimination, civil rights, safety and
health, workers' compensation.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

44  

  

 

 

 

  

3.18 Suppliers and Customers. Section 3.18 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule
sets forth: (a) active pharmaceutical ingredient suppliers of the Product
Business; (b) the most significant supplier of the Product Business taken as a
whole, based on amounts invoiced during the 12-month period ended December 31,
2014; and (c) the ten most significant customers and distributors of Seller
and its Affiliates pertaining to the Product Business, taken as a whole, based
on dollar sales volumes during the 12-month period ended December 31, 2014;
(the suppliers customers and distributors set forth on Section 3.18 of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule, the "Key Suppliers, Customers and Distributors").
Except as set forth in Section 3.18 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, no such
supplier, customer or distributor has canceled, otherwise terminated or, to
Seller's Knowledge, threatened in writing to cancel, otherwise terminate or
otherwise materially and adversely modify its relationship with the Product
Business. Seller has made available to Purchasers complete and correct copies
of all Contracts with the Third Parties listed on Section 3.18 of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule, except where such disclosure would violate any term or
confidentiality obligations owed to Third Parties listed on Section 3.18 of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule.

  

  

3.19 Solvency. Assuming satisfaction of the conditions to this Agreement, and
after giving effect to the Transactions contemplated hereby, the assumption or
retention (as applicable) of the Excluded Liabilities by Seller and its
Affiliates, payment of all amounts required to be paid in connection with the
consummation of the Transactions contemplated hereby, and payment of all
related fees and expenses, Seller and its Affiliates (on a consolidated basis)
will be Solvent as of the Closing Date and immediately after the consummation
of the Transactions contemplated hereby. Seller has no current plans to file
and prosecute a petition for relief under Chapter 11 or 7 of the United States
Bankruptcy Code.

  

  

3.20 Affiliate Transactions; Intercompany Arrangements. There are no
agreements or arrangements, written or unwritten, of any kind (other than any
Ancillary Agreements), between Seller or any of its Affiliates, on the one
hand, and the Product Business, on the other hand.

  

  

3.21 Accredited Investor. Seller understands that the securities comprising
the Stock Consideration and the Promissory Note will be "restricted
securities" under the Securities Act and have not been registered under the
Securities Act, nor qualified under any state securities laws, and that they
are being offered and sold pursuant to an exemption from such registration and
qualification based in part upon the representations of Seller contained
herein. Seller is familiar with the business and operations of Guarantor, is
an "accredited investor" as such term is defined in Rule 501(a) of the
Securities Act, and is able to bear the economic risk of its investment in
Guarantor indefinitely. Seller is acquiring the Stock Consideration and
Promissory Note solely for its own account for investment and not with a view
toward the resale, transfer, or distribution thereof, nor with any present
intention of distributing the Stock Consideration or Promissory Note. No other
Person has any right with respect to or interest in the Stock Consideration or
Promissory Note to be purchased by Seller, nor has Seller agreed to give any
Person any such interest or right in the future. Seller is not purchasing the
Stock Consideration or Promissory Note as a result of any (a) registration
statement filed by Purchaser with the Securities and Exchange Commission with
respect to any of its securities; or (b) advertisement, article, notice or
other communication regarding the Stock Consideration or Promissory Note
published in any newspaper, magazine or similar media or broadcast over
television or radio or presented at any seminar or any other general
advertisement that would be deemed a "general solicitation" under the
provisions of Regulation D of the Securities Act.

discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with respect
to an Alternative Transaction Proposal. Seller and its Affiliates shall not,
and shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause their Representatives not
to, directly or indirectly (a) initiate, solicit or encourage (including by
way of furnishing non-public information), or take any other action to
facilitate, any inquiries regarding, or the making of any proposal or offer

Purchaser, its Representatives and potential financing sources reasonable
access to the properties and the Product Records Controlled by Seller to the
extent related to the Product Business, the Purchased Assets, the Assumed
Liabilities or the Product Inventory; and (ii) furnish to Purchaser, its

financing sources may from time to time reasonably request, in each case (A)
to facilitate the Financing; or (B) as may be agreed by Purchaser and Seller
as useful and allowable for post-Closing integration planning; provided,
however, that such access shall not unreasonably disrupt Seller's ordinary

acceptable to Seller, to keep all such information acquired from Seller
confidential. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, Seller shall not be required to disclose any information or provide
any such access if such disclosure or access would reasonably be expected, in
the reasonable judgment of Seller's outside counsel, to (i) violate applicable
Law, including applicable antitrust Laws; (ii) jeopardize any attorney/client
privilege or other established legal privilege; (iii) violate any term or
confidentiality obligations owed to Third Parties; or (iv) disclose any Trade
Secrets not included in Seller Intellectual Property; provided, however, that
to the extent any such information is withheld pursuant to any the reasons set
forth in clauses (i) through (iii) of this sentence, Seller shall provide to

personnel files of those Product Business Employees who provide such written
consent. To the extent reasonably requested by Purchaser, Seller shall arrange
to permit Purchaser to conduct interviews of any of the Product Business
Employees as soon as reasonably practicable after the Execution Date and
during the Pre-Closing Period; provided, however, that such access to Product
Business Employees shall not unreasonably disrupt Seller's ordinary course
operations and such access will be at the Purchaser's cost and expense.

  

  

5.3 Ordinary Course of Business. Except (a) as set forth in Section 5.3 of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule or as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement or
any Ancillary Agreement; (b) as required by applicable Law; (c) for any

otherwise consent in writing, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed, from and after the Execution Date and during
the Pre-Closing Period (clauses (a) - (d), the "Ordinary Course of Business
Exceptions"), Seller shall (i) conduct the Product Business in substantially
the same manner as heretofore conducted and in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice; and (ii) use all commercially reasonable

orders entered into prior to the date of this Agreement;

  

  

5.3.2 (i) settle or commence any Litigation or material claim; or (ii) waive
any material claims or rights of material value, in either case in a manner
that would constitute an Assumed Liability or otherwise be materially adverse
to the Product Business or Purchased Assets from and after the Closing;

ordinary course of business consistent with past practice for Purchased
Contracts requiring payment of less than One Hundred Thousand Dollars
($100,000) on an annual basis); (b) grant a license under or assign any of the
Purchased Contracts or any Contract granting rights in, to, or under Seller
Intellectual Property; or (c) enter into any material Contract relating to the
Product Business, other than in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice; provided, that notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, no Contract subject to this Section 5.3.4 entered into by Seller
during the Pre-Closing Period (other than the binding purchase orders for
Product entered into in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice and set forth on Section 5.3.4 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule,
which such schedule shall be delivered to Purchaser at least five (5) Business
Days prior to Closing) shall be added to Section 2.1.1(a) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule as a "Purchased Contract" without the prior written
consent of Purchaser;

  

  

5.3.5 other than in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice or in the transition to the formulation of the Second Generation

to have a Material Adverse Effect; or (b) take or omit to take any action
which is intended, or known to, or reasonably likely to render any of Seller's
representations or warranties untrue or misleading, or which would be likely
to result in a material breach of any of Seller's covenants;

  

  

5.3.8 grant to any Product Business Employee any increase in compensation or
benefits, except in the ordinary course of business and consistent with past
practice or as may be required under existing Contracts;

  

  

5.3.9 (a) adopt or amend in any material respect any Seller Benefit Plan (or
any plan that would be a Seller Benefit Plan if adopted) to the extent such
adoption or amendment would result in any of the actions described in Section

Contract with any labor organization, union or association relating to or
affecting the Product Business Employees; or

actions described in Sections 5.3.1 through 5.3.9.

  

  

5.4 Obligation to Consummate the Transaction. Each of the Parties agrees that,
subject to this Section 5.4 and Section 5.5, it shall use its reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action, and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to the extent permissible
under applicable Law, to consummate and make effective the Transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and to ensure that the conditions set forth in
ARTICLE 7 are satisfied, insofar as such matters are within the control of
either of them. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, as soon as
reasonably practicable after the Execution Date, Seller shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain Seller Third Party Consents.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

50  

  

 

 

 

  

5.5 Competition Filings.

  

  

5.5.1 If required pursuant to applicable Law, each of Purchaser and Seller
shall file or cause to be filed as soon as practicable, and in any event no
later than five (5) Business Days following the Execution Date, any
notifications required under the HSR Act and any comparable filing required by
applicable foreign Law. Thereafter, each of Purchaser and Seller shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any
inquiries or requests received from any Governmental Authority for additional
information or documentation and to cause the waiting periods or approvals
under the HSR Act and any applicable foreign Law to terminate or expire or to
be approved at the earliest possible date after the date of filing; provided,
however, that Purchaser shall have the right to withdraw and re-file its HSR
notification if Purchaser reasonably determines that doing so is likely to
cause the waiting period under the HSR Act to terminate or expire sooner.

  

  

5.5.2 Purchaser and Seller shall cooperate with each other and shall (a)
promptly prepare and file all necessary documentation; and (b) effect all
necessary applications, notices, petitions and filings and execute all

5.5.3 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.5, except as
otherwise may be mutually agreed to by the Parties, nothing in this Agreement
shall require or obligate Purchaser or any of its Affiliates to, and Seller
shall not and shall not permit its Representatives to, without the prior
written consent of Purchaser, agree or otherwise be required to sell, divest,
dispose of, license, hold separate, or take or commit to take any action that
limits in any respect its freedom of action after the Closing with respect to,
or its ability to retain after the Closing, any businesses, products, rights,
services, licenses, or assets of Purchaser, Seller or any of their respective
Affiliates, as applicable.

  

  

5.5.4 Each Party shall promptly notify the other Party of any communication it
or any of its Affiliates receives from any Governmental Authority relating to
the matters that are the subject of this Agreement and permit the other Party
to review in advance any proposed communication by such Party to any
Governmental Authority relating to the matters that are the subject of this
Agreement. Neither Party shall agree to participate in any meeting with any

ADDITIONAL COVENANTS

  

  

6.1 Cooperation in Litigation and Investigations. Subject to Section 6.4 and
except as set forth in any Ancillary Agreement, from and after the Closing
Date, Purchaser and Seller shall fully cooperate with each other in the
defense or prosecution of any Litigation, examination or audit instituted
prior to the Closing or which may be instituted thereafter against or by
either Party relating to or arising out of the conduct of the Product Business
or the Exploitation or Manufacture of the Product prior to the Closing (other
than Litigation between Purchaser and Seller or their respective Affiliates
arising out of the Transactions contemplated hereby or by the Ancillary
Agreements). In connection therewith, and except as set forth in any Ancillary
Agreement, from and after the Closing Date, each of Seller and Purchaser shall
make available to the other during normal business hours and upon reasonable
prior written notice, but without unreasonably disrupting its business, all
records relating exclusively to the Purchased Assets, the Assumed Liabilities
and the Excluded Liabilities to the extent maintained by or under the Control
of the requested Party and reasonably necessary to permit the defense or
investigation of any such Litigation, examination or audit (other than
Litigation between Purchaser and Seller or their respective Affiliates arising
out of the Transactions contemplated hereby or by the Ancillary Agreements,
with respect to which applicable rules of discovery shall apply), and shall
preserve and retain all such records for eighteen (18) months; provided,
however, that either Party may restrict the foregoing access to the extent
that such access (i) violates applicable Law, including applicable antitrust
Laws; (ii) jeopardizes any attorney/client privilege or other established
legal privilege; or (iii) violates any confidentiality obligations owed to
Third Parties. The Party requesting such cooperation shall pay the reasonable
out-of-pocket costs and expenses of providing such cooperation (including
legal fees and disbursements) incurred by the Party providing such cooperation
and by its Representatives, and any applicable Taxes in connection therewith.

6.2 Further Assurances

  

  

6.2.1 Each of Seller and Purchaser shall, at any time or from time to time
after the Closing, at the request and expense of the other, execute and
deliver to the other all such instruments and documents or further assurances
as the other may reasonably request in order to (a) vest in Purchaser all of
the rights, title and interests of Seller and its Affiliates in and to the
Purchased Assets as contemplated hereby; (b) effectuate Purchaser's assumption
of the Assumed Liabilities; and (c) grant to each Party all rights
contemplated herein to be granted to such Party under the Ancillary
Agreements. Without limitation of the foregoing, except as expressly set forth
in the Ancillary Agreements, neither Seller nor Purchaser shall have any
obligation to assist or otherwise participate in the amendment or
supplementation of the Purchased Regulatory Approvals or otherwise to
participate in any filings or other activities relating to the Purchased
Regulatory Approvals other than as necessary to effect the assignment thereof
to Purchaser in connection with the Closing pursuant to this Agreement.

  

  

6.2.2 To the extent that Seller's rights under any Purchased Asset may not be
assigned without the approval, consent or waiver of another Person and such
approval, consent or waiver has not been obtained prior to the Closing, the
Closing shall proceed without the assignment of such Purchased Asset and this
Agreement shall not constitute an agreement for the sale, assignment,
transfer, conveyance or delivery of such Purchased Asset; provided, however,
that nothing in this Section 6.2.2 shall be deemed to waive Purchaser's rights
not to consummate the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement if the
conditions to its obligations set forth in ARTICLE 7 have not been satisfied.
In the event that the Closing proceeds without the sale, assignment, transfer,
conveyance or delivery of any Purchased Asset (regardless of whether such
Closing occurs as a result of Purchaser waiving its obligations set forth in
ARTICLE 7 or otherwise), then following the Closing, Seller shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all necessary approvals, consents
and waivers to the assignment and transfer thereof, and Purchaser shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to assist and cooperate with Seller in
connection therewith; provided, that until any such approval, consent or
waiver is obtained and the related Purchased Asset is transferred and assigned
to Purchaser or Purchaser's designee, Seller shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to provide to Purchaser substantially comparable benefits
thereof and enforce, at the request of and for the account of Purchaser, any
rights of Seller arising under any such Purchased Asset against any Person;
and provided further, to the extent that Purchaser is provided with benefits
of any such Purchased Asset, Purchaser shall perform the obligations of Seller
thereunder. It is understood and agreed that, in the event of Seller's or an
Affiliate's inability to assign or transfer a Purchased Contract identified on
Section 2.1.1(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, Seller or the applicable
Affiliate shall remain responsible for completion of the applicable Purchased
Contract as Purchaser's agent, and at Purchaser's sole expense as described in
the Transition Services Agreement. Once authorization, approval, consent or
waiver for the sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery of any such
Purchased Asset not sold, assigned, transferred, conveyed or delivered at the
Closing is obtained, Seller shall assign, transfer, convey and deliver such
Purchased Asset to Purchaser at no additional cost to Purchaser.

6.3 Publicity No public announcement related to this Agreement or the
Transactions contemplated herein will be issued without the joint approval of
Seller and Purchaser, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed, except in any public disclosure which either Seller or
Purchaser, in its good faith judgment, believes is required by applicable Law
or by any stock exchange on which its securities or those of its Affiliates
are listed. If either Party, in its good faith judgment, believes such
disclosure is required, such Party will use its commercially reasonable
efforts to consult with the other Party and its Representatives, and to
consider in good faith any revisions proposed by the other Party or its
Representatives, as applicable, prior to making (or prior to any of its
Affiliates making) such disclosure, and shall limit such disclosure to only
that information which is legally required to be disclosed. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Parties shall be permitted to issue a press release
announcing the execution of this Agreement and the Transactions contemplated
hereby, substantially in the form of Exhibit K attached hereto, following the
execution of this Agreement and, to the extent required pursuant to U.S.
securities laws and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, shall be
permitted to include descriptions and copies of this Agreement in their
respective filings with the SEC. Nothing herein shall prohibit a Party to
issue a press release that includes information that was previously made
public without such Party's violation of this Section 6.3.

the "Receiving Party" with respect to such information) shall be subject to
and treated in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement. As

domain at the time of its disclosure to the Receiving Party;

  

  

(c) became generally available to the public or otherwise part of the public

or omission of the Receiving Party in breach of this Agreement or the
Confidentiality Agreement or through any act or omission of a Third Party

(d) is subsequently disclosed to the Receiving Party by a Third Party without

to be Confidential Information disclosed by Purchaser to Seller for purposes
of this Section 6.4 and shall be used by Seller solely as required to (i)
perform its obligations or exercise or enforce its rights under this Agreement
or any Ancillary Agreement; or (ii) comply with applicable Law (each of (i)
and (ii), a "Seller Permitted Purpose"), and for no other purpose. For a
period of ten (10) years after the Closing Date, Seller shall not disclose, or
permit the disclosure of, any of Purchaser Confidential Information to any
Person except those Persons to whom such disclosure is necessary in connection
with any Seller Permitted Purpose and Seller shall not use Purchaser
Confidential Information except in connection with Seller Permitted Purpose.
Seller shall treat, and will cause its Affiliates and the Representatives of
Seller or any of its Affiliates to treat, Purchaser Confidential Information
as confidential, using the same degree of care as Seller normally employs to
safeguard its own confidential information from unauthorized use or
disclosure, but in no event less than a reasonable degree of care.

  

  

6.4.3 All Confidential Information obtained by Purchaser (or its
Representatives) from Seller (or its Representatives) other than Purchaser
Confidential Information (the "Seller Confidential Information") shall be used
by Purchaser solely as required to (a) perform its obligations or exercise or
enforce its rights under this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement; or (b)
comply with applicable Law (each of (a) and (b), a "Purchaser Permitted
Purpose"), and for no other purpose. For a period of ten (10) years after the
Closing Date, Purchaser shall not disclose, or permit the disclosure of, any
of Seller Confidential Information to any Person except to its employees and
consultants under a duty of confidentiality or to Persons to whom such
disclosure is necessary in connection with a Purchaser Permitted Purpose and
Purchaser shall not use, or permit the use of, Seller Confidential
Information, except in connection with a Purchaser Permitted Purpose or other
internal business purpose. Purchaser shall treat, and will cause its
Affiliates and the Representatives of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates to
treat, Seller Confidential Information as confidential, using the same degree
of care as Purchaser normally employs to safeguard its own confidential
information from unauthorized use or disclosure, but in no event less than a
reasonable degree of care.

6.4.4 In the event either Party is requested pursuant to, or required by,
applicable Law to disclose any of the other Party's Confidential Information
(i.e., Seller Confidential Information or Purchaser Confidential Information,
as applicable), it will notify the other Party in a timely manner so that such
Party may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy or, in such
Party's sole discretion, waive compliance with the confidentiality provisions
of this Agreement. Each Party will cooperate in all reasonable respects in
connection with any reasonable actions to be taken for the foregoing purpose.
In any event, the Party requested or required to disclose such Confidential
Information may furnish it as requested or required pursuant to applicable Law
(subject to any such protective order or other appropriate remedy) without
liability hereunder, provided, that such Party furnishes only that portion of
the Confidential Information which such Party is advised by an opinion of its
counsel is legally required, and if confidential treatment is available such
Party exercises reasonable efforts to obtain reliable assurances that
confidential treatment will be accorded such Confidential Information.

  

  

6.4.5 Nothing in this Section 6.4 shall be construed as preventing or in any
way inhibiting either Party from complying with applicable Law governing
activities and obligations undertaken pursuant to this Agreement or any
Ancillary Agreement in any manner which it reasonably deems appropriate.
Either Party may disclose information relating to this Agreement to the SEC or
any securities exchange or any Governmental Authority if required by
applicable Law, provided, that the Disclosing Party shall: (a) unless
prohibited by applicable Law, provide the other Party with reasonable advance
notice of and an opportunity to comment on any such required disclosure; (b)
if requested by such other Party, seek, or cooperate with such Party's efforts
to obtain, confidential treatment or a protective order with respect to any
such disclosure to the extent available at the Disclosing Party's expense; and
(c) take into consideration the comments of such other Party in any such
disclosure or request for confidential treatment or protective order;
provided, however, that a Party shall not be required to provide any notice to
the other Party with respect to any disclosure in any securities filings
(including 10-K filings and 10-Q filings) that discloses information that has
been previously disclosed in an earlier filing or press release or that
reports aggregate financial results related to this Agreement.

subsequent to the Closing. In the event that, subsequent to the Closing,

with respect to an Account Receivable, then Purchaser shall, within thirty
(30) days of receipt of such payment, remit the full amount of such payment to
Seller. In the case of the receipt by Purchaser of any payment from any
obligor of both Seller and Purchaser then, unless otherwise specified by such
obligor, such payment shall be applied first to amounts owed to Purchaser with
the excess, if any, remitted to Seller. In the event that, subsequent to the
Closing, Seller or any of its Affiliates receives any payments from any
obligor with respect to an account receivable of Purchaser for any period
after the Closing Date, then Seller shall, within thirty (30) days of receipt
of such payment, remit the full amount of such payment to Purchaser. In the
case of the receipt by Seller of any payment from any obligor of both Seller
and Purchaser then, unless otherwise specified by such obligor, such payment

Purchaser or an Affiliate of Purchaser receives any invoices from any Third
Party with respect to any account payable or other Liability of the Product
Business that constitutes an Excluded Liability, then Purchaser shall, within
thirty (30) days of receipt of such invoice, provide such invoice to Seller.
In the event that, subsequent to the Closing, Seller or any of its Affiliates
receives any invoices from any Third Party with respect to any account payable

6.13 Net Sales Reports; Audit Rights. Until Purchaser has satisfied its
reporting obligations set forth in this Section 6.13 with respect to the

quarterly and annual reports, not later than [***]8 after the end of each
Calendar Quarter and not later than [***] after the end of each Calendar Year,
of the aggregate gross sales of Seller Products and Net Sales for such
Calendar Quarter or Calendar Year, as applicable (collectively, the "Net Sales
Reports"). All Net Sales Reports shall include separate line items for gross
sales and Net Sales of each SKU of the Product or Third Generation Product, in
each case, as applicable. Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates,
licensees and sublicensees engaged in the Exploitation of any Seller Product
to keep and maintain Milestone Information until the third (3rd) year
following the end of the Calendar Year to which such Milestone Information
relates. Purchaser shall, at the request of Seller, permit a nationally
recognized registered independent auditor in the United States selected by
Seller and reasonably acceptable to Purchaser (the "Independent Auditor") to
review during ordinary business hours and upon no less than [***] prior
written notice, but on no more than [***] per calendar year, such books and
records as may be necessary to determine the accuracy of any Net Sales Report.
The Independent Auditor shall be bound by a confidentiality agreement, in a
form reasonably acceptable to Purchaser, to keep all information acquired from
Purchaser confidential, and shall be permitted to disclose to Seller only
whether any Net Sales Report was accurate and the amount, if any, owed to or
by Seller under Section 2.3.2. The Independent Auditor shall send a copy of
its written reports to Purchaser at the same time such reports are sent to
Seller, and the findings of the Independent Auditor in such report shall be
binding on the Parties for all purposes. Seller shall be responsible for the
fees and expenses of the Independent Auditor; provided, however, that
Purchaser shall reimburse Seller in full for all such costs and expenses of
the Independent Auditor if the Independent Auditor determines that a Milestone
Payment was not paid pursuant to Section 2.3.2. Purchase shall promptly make
any payments necessary to Seller to correct any failure to make a Milestone
Payment when due and payable, which payments shall include interest on any
unpaid amounts calculated at a rate per annum equal to the lesser of the prime
rate of interest plus five percent (5%), as reported by New York edition of
The Wall Street Journal on the last Business Day of the applicable Calendar
Quarter, or the highest rate permitted by applicable Law, calculated on the
number of days such payments are paid after the date such payments are due.

6.14 Exclusivity. During the sixty (60) months following the Closing Date,
Seller covenants and agrees that it shall not, and it shall cause its
Affiliates not to develop, market or sell single entity, extended release
hydrocodone (a "Competitive Activity"); provided, however, that it shall not
be deemed to be a violation of this Section 6.14 for Seller to, directly or
indirectly: (a) invest in or own any non-voting or non-convertible debt
securities or other debt obligations of any Person; (b) make any equity
investments in publicly-traded companies that may compete with the Product
Business, (provided, that such investments are passive in nature and do not
exceed five percent (5%) of the outstanding voting power of such public
companies); (c) own any interests in any Person through any means "employee
benefit plan" (within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA), including
multiemployer plans within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA; or (d)
acquire (by purchase of stock or assets, merger or otherwise) any Person;
provided, however, that Seller or its Affiliates, as applicable, promptly
divest that portion of such Person that engages in the Competitive Activity
within twelve (12) months after the acquisition of such Person or Seller or
its Affiliates, as applicable, cease to engage in the Competitive Activity
within twelve (12) months. In addition, if Seller or any of its Affiliates are
acquired by or merged with a Third Party that engages in the Competitive
Activity at the time of such acquisition or merger, such Third Party and its
other Affiliates will not have any obligations under this Section 6.14. The
Parties recognize that the Laws and public policies of the various states of
the United States and other jurisdictions may differ as to the validity and
enforceability of covenants similar to those set forth in this Section 6.14.
It is the intention of the Parties that a determination by a jurisdiction that
one or more provisions of this Section 6.14 is invalid or unenforceable shall
not render unenforceable, or impair, the remainder of the provisions of this
Section 6.14. Accordingly, if any provision of this Section 6.14 shall be
determined to be invalid or unenforceable, such invalidity or unenforceability
shall be deemed to apply only with respect to the operation of such provision
in the particular jurisdiction in which such determination is made and not
with respect to any other provision or jurisdiction, and Section 10.8 shall
apply to substitute a valid and enforceable provision thereof.

  

  

6.15 Exchange Act Filings. Seller shall, at its sole cost and expense, deliver
to Purchaser, as soon as practicable after the Closing but no later than
forty-five (45) days thereafter, such financial information requested by
Purchaser to enable it to satisfy its SEC disclosure obligations under
Regulation S-X and the Exchange Act including, but not limited to,
"abbreviated carve-out financial statements" (as provided for in Staff
Accounting Bulletin Topic 1.B and Sections 7200, 7400 and 2065.4-6 of the SEC
Financial and Reporting Manual) relating to the Product for each of the three
(3) years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 and for any additional
interim period as required, with a report thereon (with no exception or
qualification) of Ernst and Young LLP or other reputable independent certified
accountants selected by Seller (the "Auditors"), including in each case the
notes thereto (the "Audited Financial Statements"). Seller also hereby agrees
to consent to the inclusion of such financial statements or information
obtained by Purchaser pursuant to this Section 6.15, by or at the request of
Purchaser, in any filings by Purchaser with the SEC or any other securities
regulatory authority or exchange. Seller further agrees that it will use, as
applicable, commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Auditors to provide
to Purchaser (or Purchaser's successor) (a) the Auditors' consent to the
inclusion of any such financial statements or the information contained
therein in any filings by or on behalf of Purchaser (or Purchaser's
successor); and (b) comfort letters, consents for use of their reports and any
other pertinent financial or other information or documents as reasonably
requested by Purchaser, in each case in connection with Purchaser's SEC
filings and at the sole expense of Purchaser.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

63  

  

 

 

 

  

6.16 Release of Encumbrances. On or prior to the Closing, Seller shall (a)
take all actions necessary to extinguish or cause to be extinguished, as the
case may be, all Encumbrances on the Purchased Assets and the Purchased
Product Inventory, excluding Permitted Encumbrances, but including all
Encumbrances on the Purchased Assets and the Purchased Product Inventory
arising in connection with any debt financing, in each case on terms
reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser; and (b) file in the appropriate
jurisdictions termination statements of Uniform Commercial Code financing
statements (or equivalent filings in jurisdictions outside the United States)
that have been filed by the holders of such Encumbrances with respect to
Seller or any of the Purchased Assets or the Purchased Product Inventory, to
Purchaser's reasonable satisfaction. In the event that, after the Closing, any
such lienholder asserts any Encumbrance or security interest in the Purchased
Assets or the Purchased Product Inventory, Seller shall, upon written request
from Purchasers, take all actions necessary to obtain a release from such
lienholder of all such Encumbrances or security interests.

  

  

6.17 Diligent Efforts .

  

  

6.17.1 Purchaser agrees and covenants, for itself and its Affiliates, that
Purchaser shall use, and shall cause its Affiliates to use, Commercially
Reasonable Efforts to (i) conduct the Development Plan; (ii) file an NDA for
the Third Generation Product; and (iii) Exploit the Seller Products. Without
limiting the foregoing, Purchaser shall have the right to amend the
Development Plan from time to time based on the results of studies conducted
with the Third Generation Product and commercial, scientific and regulatory
considerations.

  

  

6.17.2 Seller acknowledges and agrees that except to the extent set forth in
Section 6.17.1 (i) Purchaser and its Affiliates shall have the right to
operate their respective businesses, including the Product Business and the
sale of the Seller Products, in their sole discretion; (ii) the achievement of
the Milestone Payments contemplated herein is speculative and is subject to
numerous factors outside the control of Purchaser and its Affiliates; (iii) as
a result, there is no assurance that Seller will receive any Milestone Payment
and neither Purchaser nor its Affiliates has promised or projected payment of
any Milestone Payment; (iv) neither Purchaser nor its Affiliates owe a
fiduciary duty or express or implied duty to Seller other than to pay
Milestone Payments in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement; and
(v) the contingent right of Seller to receive any Milestone Payment is not an
investment in Purchaser or its Affiliates. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
neither Purchaser nor any Affiliate thereof will take or omit to take any
action if the primary purpose of such action or omission is to reduce or
eliminate any payment obligation of Purchaser pursuant to Section 2.3.2.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

64  

  

 

 

 

  

6.18 Financing Cooperation. Prior to the Closing, Seller shall use
commercially reasonable efforts, and shall cause its Affiliates and its and
their Representatives to use commercially reasonable efforts, to provide
Purchaser with all cooperation reasonably requested by Purchaser in connection
obtaining the Financing, including but not limited to (a) participation by
Seller's officers in a reasonable number of meetings (including one-on-one),
due diligence sessions and similar activities, in each case at such times as
coordinated reasonably in advance thereof; and (b) obtaining reasonable access
to Seller's accountants; provided, however, that nothing herein shall require
(i) such cooperation to the extent that it would interfere materially and
unreasonably with the business and operations of Seller; or (ii) the taking of
any action that would conflict with or violate the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of Seller or any applicable Law. Nothing in this
Section 6.18 shall require Seller to (a) bear any out-of-pocket cost or
expense that is not reimbursed pursuant to this Section 6.18 or pay any fee in
connection with Financing; (b) incur any liability (or cause their respective
directors, officers or employees to incur any liability) under the Financing;
or (c) enter into any definitive agreement or commitment. Furthermore,
Purchaser shall, promptly upon request by Seller, reimburse Seller for all
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by Seller
and its representatives in connection with their respective obligations
pursuant to this Section 6.18. Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless
Seller, its Affiliates and its representatives (collectively, the "Financing
Indemnitees") from and against any and all losses, damages, claims, costs or
expenses suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with the Financing
and any information utilized in connection therewith (other than any
information provided in writing specifically for use by or on behalf of
Seller), in each case other than to the extent any of the foregoing arises
from the bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of, or breach of
this Agreement by a Financing Indemnitee (the obligations in this sentence,
the "Financing Cooperation Indemnity"). The obligations of Purchaser in the
foregoing sentence shall survive the Closing and any termination of this
Agreement.

qualification limiting the scope of such representation or warranty, but

its covenants, agreements or obligations contained in this Agreement;

  

  

(c) any Assumed Liability;

provided, however, that Purchaser shall not be required to indemnify any

(i) the gross negligence, recklessness or willful misconduct of any Seller
Indemnitee; or (ii) any claim for Losses that is indemnifiable by Seller under
Section 8.3.1.

  

  

8.4 Claim Procedure.

  

  

8.4.1 Indemnification Claim Procedure. Except as provided in Section 8.4.2
with respect to Third Party claims, in the event of a claim made by a
Purchaser Indemnitee or a Seller Indemnitee (the "Indemnified Party"), the
Indemnified Party shall give reasonably prompt written notice to the other
Party (the "Indemnifying Party"), which notice (an "Indemnification
Certificate") shall: (a) state that the Indemnified Party has paid or properly
accrued or in good faith anticipates that it will have to pay or accrue Losses
that are subject to indemnification by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to
Section 8.3.1 or Section 8.3.2, as applicable; and (b) specify in reasonable
detail the facts and circumstances supporting the Indemnified Party's claim
for indemnification (to the extent known) and contain a non-binding
preliminary, good faith estimate of the amount to which the Indemnified Party
claims to be entitled (to the extent known); provided, however, that the
failure to give reasonably prompt notice shall not relieve the applicable
Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations under this Agreement
except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by
any delay in receiving such notice. In the event that the Indemnifying Party
agrees to or is determined to have an obligation to indemnify or reimburse the
Indemnified Party for Losses as provided in this ARTICLE 8, the Indemnifying
Party shall, subject to the provisions of this Section 8.4.1, promptly (but in
any event, within thirty (30) days of receipt of the Indemnification
Certificate) pay such amount to the Indemnified Party by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account specified in writing by the
Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party objects to all or a portion of
the Indemnified Party's claim made in the Indemnification Certificate, the
Indemnifying Party will notify the Indemnified Party of such objection by
delivering a written statement (the "Objection Notice") to the Indemnifying
Party within sixty (60) days following receipt of the Indemnification
Certificate (the "Response Period"). The Objection Notice shall indicate
whether the Indemnifying Party objects to all or only a portion of the claim
specified in the Indemnification Certificate and shall specify in reasonable
detail the facts and circumstances supporting the Indemnifying Party's basis
and reasons for such objection. An Indemnifying Party's failure to deliver an
Objection Notice in accordance with the provisions of this Section 8.4.1
within the Response Period to any claim set forth in an Indemnification
Certificate shall be deemed to be the Indemnifying Party's acceptance of, and
waiver of any objections to, such claim and the Indemnifying Party shall be
deemed to have agreed that an amount equal to the full claimed amount
specified in the Indemnification Certificate is owed to the Indemnified Party.
If the Indemnifying Party in its Objection Notice objects only to a portion of
the claim set forth in the Indemnification Certificate (the amount of Losses
claimed in the Indemnification Certificate to which the Indemnifying Party
does not object shall be referred to herein as the "Agreed Amount"), then such
Indemnifying Party shall, within ten (10) Business Days following the delivery
of such Objection Notice pay the Agreed Amount to the Indemnified Party. If an
Indemnifying Party shall provide Objection Notice in accordance with the
provisions of this Section 8.4.1, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified
Party shall attempt in good faith for a period of twenty (20) days following
the Indemnified Party's receipt of the Objection Notice to agree upon the
rights of the respective parties with respect to each of such claims. If no
such agreement can be reached after such twenty (20)-day period of good faith
negotiation, either the Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party may
initiate Litigation for purposes of having the matter settled in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement.

8.4.2 Third Party Claim Procedure. In the event an Indemnified Party becomes
aware of a claim made by a Third Party (including any action or proceeding
commenced or threatened to be commenced by any Third Party) that such
Indemnified Party in good faith believes may result in an indemnification
claim pursuant to Section 8.3, such Indemnified Party shall promptly (and in
any event within ten (10) Business Days after receiving written notice of such
claim) notify the Indemnifying Party in writing of such claim (such notice,
the "Claim Notice"). The Claim Notice shall be accompanied by reasonable
supporting documentation submitted by the Third Party making such claim and
shall describe in reasonable detail (to the extent known by the Indemnified
Party) the facts constituting the basis for such claim and the amount of the
claimed damages; provided, however, that no delay or failure on the part the
Indemnified Party in delivering a Claim Notice shall relieve the applicable
Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations under this Agreement
except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by
any delay in receiving such notice. Within thirty (30) days after receipt of
any Claim Notice, the Indemnifying Party may, upon written notice thereof to
the Indemnified Party, assume control of the defense of the claim referred to
therein at the Indemnifying Party's sole cost and expense (which shall be
subject to Section 8.5) with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Party; provided, however, that (A) the Indemnifying Party shall
not be entitled to assume control of such defense if (i) such claim is subject
to the Cap and could, when aggregated with all other potential claims subject
to the Cap, reasonably be expected to give rise to Losses which exceed the
Cap; (ii) the claim for indemnification relates to or arises in connection
with any criminal proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or investigation;
exists of a conflict of interest between Seller, on the one hand, and
Purchaser, on the other; (iii) the claim seeks an injunction or equitable
relief against the Indemnified Party; or (iv) the claim does not seek only
monetary damages and the Indemnified Party's counsel reasonably believes an
adverse determination with respect to the Litigation giving rise to such claim
for indemnification would be detrimental to or materially injure the
reputation or future business prospects of Indemnified Party; and (B) Seller
shall not be entitled to assume control of such defense of claims related to a
Designated Action. The assumption of the defense of a Third Party claim by the
Indemnifying Party shall not be construed as an acknowledgment that the
Indemnifying Party is liable to indemnify any Indemnified Party in respect of
the Third Party claim, nor shall it constitute a waiver by the Indemnifying
Party of any defenses it may assert against any Indemnified Party's claim for
indemnification. In the event that it is ultimately determined that the
Indemnifying Party is not obligated to indemnify, defend or hold harmless an
Indemnified Party from and against the Third Party claim, the Indemnified
Party shall reimburse the Indemnifying Party for any and all Losses incurred
by the Indemnifying Party in its defense of the Third Party claim with respect
to such Indemnified Party. For the avoidance of doubt, reasonable fees
(including costs and expenses in connection with investigations, suits and
proceedings, expert fees, accounting fees, advisory fees and legal fees)
incurred by an Indemnified Party in defending a Third Party claim shall
constitute Losses for purposes of this this ARTICLE 8; provided, however, in
the event the Indemnifying Party actually assumes the conduct and control of
such claim, only the reasonable fees incurred prior to the Indemnifying
Party's assumption of such defense shall constitute Losses unless otherwise
provided for herein.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

71  

  

 

 

 

  

8.4.3 If the Indemnifying Party does not so assume control of the defense of
such claim, the Indemnified Party shall control the defense of such claim. The
Party not controlling the defense of such claim (the "Non-Controlling Party")
may participate therein at its own expense; provided, however, that if the
Indemnifying Party assumes control of the defense of such claim and the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party have materially conflicting
interests or different defenses available with respect to such claim that
cause the Indemnified Party to hire its own separate counsel with respect to
such proceeding, the reasonable fees and expenses of a single counsel to the
Indemnified Party shall be considered "Losses" for purposes of this Agreement.
The Party controlling the defense of such claim (the "Controlling Party")
shall keep the Non-Controlling Party advised of the status of such claim and
the defense thereof and shall consider in good faith recommendations made by
the Non-Controlling Party with respect thereto. The Non-Controlling Party
shall furnish the Controlling Party with such information as it may have with
respect to such claim (including copies of any summons, complaint or other
pleading that may have been served on such Party and any written claim,
demand, invoice, billing or other document evidencing or asserting the same)
and shall otherwise cooperate with and assist the Controlling Party in the
defense of such claim. Neither the Indemnified Party nor the Indemnifying
Party shall agree to any settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising
from, any such claim without the prior written consent of the other Party,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed;
provided, however, that the consent of the Indemnified Party shall not be
required with respect to any such settlement or judgment if the Indemnifying
Party agrees in writing to pay or cause to be paid any amounts payable
pursuant to such settlement or judgment and such settlement or judgment
includes no admission of liability by or other obligation on the part of the
Indemnified Party and includes a complete release of the Indemnified Party
from further Liability.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

72  

  

 

 

 

  

8.5 Limitations on Indemnification.

  

  

8.5.1 Threshold and Deductible. The provisions for indemnity under Section
8.3.1(a) or Section 8.3.2(a) shall be effective only (a) for any individual
claim where the Loss exceeds [***]9; and (b) when the aggregate amount of all
Losses for claims in excess of [***] for which indemnification is sought from
any Indemnifying Party exceeds [***], in which case the Indemnified Party
shall be entitled to indemnification of all the Indemnified Party's Losses in
excess of [***]; provided, however, that the foregoing limitation shall not be
applicable for breaches of any of Seller Fundamental Representations or
Purchaser Fundamental Representations or in the case of claims based on Fraud,
intentional misrepresentation or willful misconduct.

  

  

8.5.2 Liability Caps.

  

  

(a) Subject to the limitations set forth in Section 8.5, from and after the
Closing, neither Party shall have any indemnification obligations for Losses
under Section 8.3.1(a) or 8.3.2(a), as applicable, that exceed, in the
aggregate, [***] (the "Cap"); provided, however, the Cap shall not apply to
claims for indemnification in respect of either the Seller Fundamental
Representations or Purchaser Fundamental Representations; and provided,
further, that Losses in respect of breaches of the Seller Fundamental
Representations or Purchaser Fundamental Representations shall not be
considered for purposes of determining when the Cap has been met. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Cap shall not apply to claims to indemnify an
Indemnified Party pursuant to Sections 8.1.3(b), 8.3.1(c), 8.3.1(d), 8.3.1(e),
8.3.1(f), 8.3.2(b), 8.3.2(c), 8.3.2(d), or 8.3.2(e).

  

 

    

  

***Certain information on this page has been omitted and filed separately with
the Commission. Confidential treatment has been requested with respect to the
omitted portions.

 

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

73  

  

 

 

 

  

(b) The Parties' respective aggregate liability for Losses in respect of
breaches of Seller Fundamental Representations or Purchaser Fundamental
Representations, shall not, in the aggregate, exceed [***]10 (the "Fundamental
Representations Cap"); provided, however, that the Fundamental Representations
Cap shall be increased by the amount of any Milestone Payments that are paid
by Purchaser to Seller pursuant to Section 2.3.2 (or that have been deemed to
have been paid to Seller pursuant to Section 8.9); and provided, further, a
Party's obligation to pay the other Party in respect of such breaches of
Seller Fundamental Representations or Purchaser Fundamental Representations
any amount in excess of [***] shall be deferred until such time as the
Promissory Note has been paid in full (or deemed to have been paid in full,
after giving effect to the provisions of Section 8.9).

  

  

8.5.3 Off-Sets. The amount of Losses recovered by an Indemnified Party under
Section 8.3.1 or Section 8.3.2, as applicable, shall be reduced by (a) any
amounts actually recovered by the Indemnified Party from a Third Party in
connection with such claim; and (b) the amount of any insurance proceeds paid
to the Indemnified Party relating to such claim, in each case of clauses "(a)"
and "(b)" net of any amounts spent in obtaining such amounts (including the
cost of the insurance policy) and any increase in future premiums reasonably
attributable to such claim; provided, however, that for the avoidance of
doubt, no Indemnified Party shall have any obligation to seek recovery from
any Third Party or insurer with respect to such Losses. If any amounts
referenced in the preceding clauses (a) and (b) are received after payment by
the Indemnifying Party of the full amount otherwise required to be paid to an
Indemnified Party pursuant to this ARTICLE 8, the Indemnified Party shall
repay to the Indemnifying Party, promptly after such receipt, any amount that
the Indemnifying Party would not have had to pay pursuant to this ARTICLE 8
had such amounts been received prior to such payment.

  

  

8.5.4 TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW AND EXCEPT AS A RESULT
OF THIRD PARTY INDEMNIFICATION CLAIMS OR FRAUD, INTENTIONAL MISREPRESENTATION
OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT, NEITHER PURCHASER NOR SELLER SHALL BE LIABLE TO THE
OTHER, OR THEIR AFFILIATES, FOR ANY CLAIMS, DEMANDS OR SUITS FOR
CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, INDIRECT OR MULTIPLE
DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE OR INCOME, DIMINUTION IN VALUE OR
LOSS OF BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY (WHETHER OR NOT FORESEEABLE AT THE EXECUTION
DATE) CONNECTED WITH OR RESULTING FROM ANY BREACH, OR ANY ACTIONS UNDERTAKEN
IN CONNECTION WITH, OR RELATED HERETO, INCLUDING ANY SUCH DAMAGES THAT ARE
BASED UPON BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE AND
MISREPRESENTATION), BREACH OF WARRANTY, STRICT LIABILITY, STATUTE, OPERATION
OF LAW OR ANY OTHER THEORY OF RECOVERY.

74  

  

 

 

 

  

8.6 Designated Action . Notwithstanding anything in ARTICLE 8 of the Agreement
to the contrary, the provision for indemnity for the Designated Action
pursuant to Section 8.3.1(e) shall be subject to the following terms and
conditions:

  

  

8.6.1 Deductible. The provisions for indemnity under Section 8.3.1(e) shall be
effective only when claims exceed [***]11, in which case the Purchaser
Indemnitees shall be entitled to indemnification of the Purchaser Indemnitees'
Losses in excess of [***].

  

  

8.6.2 Cost-Sharing and Cap. The Seller shall indemnify the Purchaser
Indemnitees for [***] of any Losses under Section 8.3.1(e) up to an aggregate
of $5,000,000, subject to reduction pursuant to Section 8.6.4 below. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Purchaser Indemnitees shall only be entitled to
recover for any Losses arising out of the Designated Action under Section
8.3.1(e).

  

  

8.6.3 Recourse. The Parties agree that for any claims for which the Purchaser
Indemnitees are entitled to indemnification under Section 8.3.1(e), payment
for such Losses shall be paid solely from the Escrow Fund, in accordance with
Section 2.4 and the Escrow Agreement; provided, that, following the final
distribution of any amounts in the Escrow Fund pursuant to Section 2.4, the
Escrow Fund shall cease to be the sole recourse for claims under Section
8.3.1(e) and such indemnifiable Losses may then be withheld solely from the
Milestone Payments. For the avoidance of doubt, such withholding from the
Milestone Payments shall be on a dollar-for-dollar basis up to the limitation
set forth in Section 8.6.2 above.

  

  

8.6.4 Reduction of Losses. The Purchaser Indemnitees' Losses otherwise
recoverable under Section 8.3.1(e) shall be reduced by (i) any amounts paid to
or otherwise actually recovered by (including in the form of royalty
reductions or payment offsets) any Purchaser Indemnitee in connection with the
Designated Action pursuant to the Daravita License Agreement or from Altus
Formulations pursuant to the Development and Option Agreement between Altus
Formulations Inc. and Seller, dated November 1, 2013, as amended and any
license agreement therefrom; (ii) any amounts actually recovered by any
Purchaser Indemnitee from a Third Party in connection with the Designated
Action; and (iii) the amount of any insurance proceeds paid to any Purchaser
Indemnitee relating to the Designated Action, in each case of clauses "(ii)"
and "(iii)" net of any amounts spent in obtaining such amounts (including the
cost of the insurance policy) and any increase in future premiums reasonably
attributable to such claim. If any amounts referenced in the preceding clauses
(i), (ii) and (iii) are received or recovered after payment by Seller of the
full amount otherwise required to be paid to a Purchaser Indemnitee pursuant
to Section 8.3.1(e) and this Section 8.6, the Purchaser Indemnitee shall repay
to Seller, promptly after such receipt, any amount that Seller would not have
had to pay pursuant to Section 8.3.1(e) and this Section 8.6 had such amounts
been received prior to such payment.

75  

  

 

 

 

  

8.6.5 Definition of Losses. For purposes of the indemnity under Section
8.3.1(e) and this Section 8.6, the term "Loss" or "Losses" shall mean any
Liabilities, losses, damages, judgments, fines, penalties, awards, Taxes,
amounts paid in settlement, reasonable fees (including costs and expenses in
connection with investigations, suits and proceedings, expert fees, accounting
fees, advisory fees and legal fees), charges and costs incurred in connection
with or arising out of the Designated Action, including any ancillary
Litigation such as actions in the nature of counterclaims and declaratory
judgment actions where Purchaser Indemnitees or their licensors are the
plaintiffs.

  

  

8.7 Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments. All payments made pursuant to
this ARTICLE 8 shall be treated as adjustments to the Purchase Price for all
Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by applicable Law or a final
determination of a taxing authority.

  

  

8.8 Exclusive Remedy. Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement
or any Ancillary Agreement and subject to Section 10.9, each Party
acknowledges and agrees that, following the Closing, the remedies provided for
in this ARTICLE 8 shall be the sole and exclusive remedies for claims and
damages available to the Parties and their respective Affiliates arising out
of or relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.
Nothing herein shall limit the Liability of either Party for Fraud.

  

  

8.9 Setoff Rights. Neither Party shall have any right of setoff of any amounts
due and payable, or any Liabilities arising, under against any amounts due and
payable under this Agreement against any other amounts due and payable under
this Agreement or any amounts due and payable, or any Liabilities arising,
under any Ancillary Agreement; provided, however, that Purchaser may set-off
against and deduct from any amounts due and payable to Seller pursuant to (a)
Section 2.3.2; or (b) the Promissory Note any amounts due and payable by
Seller pursuant to Section 8.3.1(a) for breaches of Seller Fundamental
Representations ("Right of Setoff"); and provided further, any amounts that
are set-off pursuant to Purchaser's Right of Setoff shall be deemed to have
been paid to Seller for purposes of Section 8.5. Except as expressly set forth
in this Section 8.9, the payment obligations under each of this Agreement and
the Ancillary Agreements remain independent obligations of each Party,
irrespective of any amounts owed to any other Party under this Agreement or
the respective Ancillary Agreements.

  

  

ARTICLE 9

prior to such date;

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

76  

  

 

 

 

  

9.1.3 by either Seller or Purchaser in the event (a) there shall be any Law

provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this

shall have resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur on or prior to
such date;

  

  

9.1.4 by either Seller or Purchaser, by giving written notice of such
termination to the other Party, if such other Party shall have breached any of
its material obligations or agreements under this Agreement and such breach
shall be incapable of cure or has not been cured within thirty (30) days

Party of such breach (or, if the End Date is fewer than thirty (30) days from
provision of such notice, cured by the End Date);

  

  

9.1.5 by Seller, by giving written notice of such termination to Purchaser, if

pursuant to this Section 9.1.5 if Seller is in material breach of its
agreements or covenants contained in this Agreement;

  

  

9.1.6 by Purchaser, by giving written notice of such termination to Seller, if
there has been a breach of the representations and warranties of Seller
contained in this Agreement which (i) would result in the failure of the
condition set forth in Section 7.2.1; and (ii) cannot be or is not cured prior
to the End Date; provided, that Purchaser may not terminate this Agreement

be effective upon and as of the date of delivery of such written notice as
determined pursuant to Section 10.2.

9.2.2 (Effect of Termination), 9.2.3 (Withdrawal of Certain Filings), and
ARTICLE 10 (Miscellaneous) shall survive any termination of this Agreement.
For clarity, in the event of termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section

any obligations thereunder. Nothing in this Section 9.2.2 shall relieve any
Party to this Agreement of liability for Fraud or willful misconduct, or
intentional misrepresentation prior to the termination hereof.

  

  

9.2.3 Withdrawal of Certain Filings. As soon as practicable following a
termination of this Agreement for any reason, but in no event less than thirty
(30) days after such termination, Purchaser or Seller shall, to the extent
practicable, withdraw all filings, applications and other submissions relating
to the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement filed or submitted by or on
behalf of such Party, any Governmental Authority or other Person. Each Party,
if requested, will redeliver all documents, work papers and other material to
the other Party and its Affiliates relating to the Transactions contemplated
hereby, whether so obtained before or after the execution date hereof, to the
Party furnishing the same.

10.3 No Benefit to Third Parties. The covenants and agreements set forth in
this Agreement are for the sole benefit of the Parties and their successors
and permitted assigns, and, except for the rights of (a) the Financing
Indemnitees under Section 6.18; and (b) Purchaser Indemnitees and Seller
Indemnitees under ARTICLE 8, they shall not be construed as conferring any
rights on any other Persons.

  

  

10.4 Waiver and Non-Exclusion of Remedies. Any term or condition of this
Agreement may be waived at any time by the Party that is entitled to the
benefit thereof, but no such waiver shall be effective unless set forth in a
written instrument duly executed by or on behalf of the Party waiving such
term or condition. The waiver by any Party of any right hereunder or of the
failure to perform or of a breach by the other Party shall not be deemed a
waiver of any other right hereunder or of any other breach or failure by said
other Party whether of a similar nature or otherwise. The rights and remedies
provided herein are cumulative and do not exclude any other right or remedy
provided by applicable Law or otherwise available except as expressly set
forth herein.

  

  

10.5 Expenses. Except as otherwise specified herein, and whether or not the
Closing takes place, each Party shall bear any costs and expenses incurred by
it with respect to the Transactions contemplated herein.

  

  

10.6 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor either Party's rights or
obligations hereunder may be assigned or delegated by such Party without the
prior written consent of the other Party, and any attempted assignment or
delegation of this Agreement or any of such rights or obligations by either
Party without the prior written consent of the other Party shall be void and
of no effect; provided, however, that either Party may assign or delegate any
or all of its rights or obligations hereunder to an Affiliate without the
prior written consent of the other Party but only if such assignment or
delegation would not adversely affect such other Party under this Agreement or
any of the Ancillary Agreements (including, but not limited to, resulting in a
new or increased obligation to withhold or deduct Taxes from any payment
thereunder). Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding
upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Parties and their
respective successors and permitted assigns.

10.7 Amendment. This Agreement may not be modified, amended, altered or
supplemented except upon the execution and delivery of a written agreement
executed by both Parties.

  

  

10.8 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be illegal,
invalid or unenforceable under any present or future Law, and if the rights or
obligations of either Party under this Agreement will not be materially and
adversely affected thereby, (a) such provision shall be fully severable; (b)
this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if such illegal, invalid or
unenforceable provision had never comprised a part hereof; (c) the remaining
provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall
not be affected by the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision or by its
severance herefrom; and (d) in lieu of such illegal, invalid or unenforceable
provision, there shall be added automatically as a part of this Agreement a
legal, valid and enforceable provision as similar in terms to such illegal,
invalid or unenforceable provision as may be possible and reasonably
acceptable to the Parties.

  

  

10.9 Equitable Relief. The Parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would
occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
the specific terms hereof or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed
that the Parties shall be entitled, without posting a bond or similar
indemnity, to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and
provisions hereof in any court of the United States or any state having
jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity. Each Party agrees that it will not oppose the
granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief
when expressly available pursuant to the terms of this Agreement on the basis
that such Party has an adequate remedy at law or an award of specific
performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity.

  

  

10.10 Use of Affiliates. Seller shall have the right to exercise its rights
and perform its obligations under this Agreement either itself or through any
of its Affiliates. In addition, in each case where an Affiliate of Seller has
an obligation pursuant to this Agreement or performs an obligation pursuant to
this Agreement, Seller shall cause and compel such Affiliate to perform such
obligation and comply with the terms of this Agreement.

  

  

10.11 Bulk Sales Statutes. Purchaser hereby waives compliance by Seller with
any applicable bulk sales statutes in any jurisdiction in connection with the
Transactions under this Agreement.

  

  

10.12 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, and each such counterpart hereof shall be deemed to be an
original instrument, but all such counterparts together shall constitute but
one agreement. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this
Agreement by facsimile or other electronic transmission shall be effective as
delivery of a manually executed original counterpart of this Agreement.

10.13 Fair Market Value. In the event that, according to this Agreement, a
"fair market value" has to be determined, the Party obliged to suggest such
fair market value shall provide the other Party in due time with a good faith
determination of the fair market value, together with any information
necessary or useful to support such determination. Each Party shall have the
right to dispute any determination of fair market value by providing written
notice of the Party's good faith estimate of the fair market value to the
other Party within fifteen (15) calendar days of its receipt of such Party's
notice of its determination. In such event, the Parties shall negotiate in
good faith the determination of fair market value for a period of not less
than thirty (30) days. If the Parties do not agree in writing upon the fair
market value within such thirty (30)-day period, then the fair market value
shall be determined by an independent appraiser mutually selected by the
Parties within fifteen (15) business days of the written notice. If the
Parties are unable to agree on a single appraiser, each Party shall each
select an appraiser and the two appraisers so selected shall thereupon
determine fair market value. If one Party fails to select an appraiser within
fifteen (15) business days of the aforesaid notice, the sole appraiser
selected shall determine the fair market value. If the two appraisers cannot
agree on fair market value within thirty (30) calendar days after their
selection, they shall, within ten (10) business days, mutually select a third
appraiser. The mutually selected appraiser (or, if applicable, the third
appraiser) shall determine the fair market value within thirty (30) calendar
days of selection, and such determination shall be conclusive and binding upon
the Parties. Each selected appraiser shall be experienced in valuing assets
similar in nature to the assets that are the subject of the dispute. The fees
and expenses of the appraisers shall be borne by the disputing Party unless
the deciding appraiser determines that the fair market value was less than
[***]14 of the final fair market value determined by the deciding appraiser,
in which event the Party providing the original determination of fair market
value shall bear the fees and expenses of the appraisers.

  

  

10.14 Guarantee.

  

  

10.14.1 Guarantor absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably (a) guarantees
to Seller, as the primary obligor and not merely as surety, the due and
punctual observance, payment, performance and discharge of the obligations of
Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement including, but not limited to, the
payment of the Promissory Note (the "Obligations"); and (b) agrees to pay any
and all reasonable expenses (including reasonable legal expenses and
reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by Seller in successfully enforcing any
rights under this Section 10.14. If Purchaser fails to pay or perform the
Obligations when due, then all of Guarantors' liabilities to Seller hereunder
in respect of such Obligations shall, at Seller's option, become immediately
due and payable and Seller may at any time and from time to time take any and
all actions available hereunder or under applicable Law to enforce and collect
the Obligations from Guarantor. In furtherance of the foregoing, Guarantor
acknowledges that Seller may, in its sole discretion, bring and prosecute a
separate action or actions against Guarantor for the full amount of the
Obligations, regardless of whether any action is brought against Purchaser. To
the fullest extent permitted by Law, Guarantor hereby expressly and
unconditionally waives (i) any and all rights or defenses arising by reason of
any Law, promptness, diligence, notice of the acceptance of this guarantee and
of the Obligations, presentment, demand for payment, notice of non-
performance, default, dishonor and protest, marshalling of assets, notice of
the Obligations incurred and all other notices of any kind; and (ii) all
suretyship defenses including all defenses based upon any statute or rule of
law that provides that the obligation of a surety must be neither larger in
amount nor in other respects more burdensome than that of the principal (other
than payment in full of the Obligations). The Guarantor acknowledges that it
will receive substantial direct and indirect benefits from the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and that the waivers set forth in this
Guarantee are knowingly made in contemplation of such benefits. This Section
10.14 contains the entire agreement between Seller and Guarantor with respect
to Guarantor's obligations to Seller in connection with this Agreement, and
supersedes all prior agreements, understandings, promises and representations,
whether written or oral, between Seller and Guarantor with respect to the
subject matter hereof.

83  

  

 

 

 

  

10.14.2 Guarantor represents and warrants to Seller that:

  

  

(a) Guarantor is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of Maryland; and

  

  

(b) Guarantor has the requisite corporate power and authority to enter into
this Agreement and to perform its obligations contemplated by Section 10.14.1.
The execution and delivery of this Agreement and performance of the
transactions contemplated by Section 10.14.1 have been duly authorized by the
necessary corporate actions of Guarantor. This Agreement constitutes the valid
and legally binding obligation of Guarantor, enforceable against Guarantor in
accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
transfer, reorganization, moratorium or similar Laws of general application
affecting or relating to the enforcement of creditors' rights generally, and
subject to equitable principles of general applicability, whether considered
in a proceeding at law or in equity.

  

  

10.14.3 If at any time any payment of any of the Obligations is rescinded or
is otherwise required by applicable Law to be returned by Seller upon the
insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization, dissolution, liquidation, arrangement,
assignment for the benefit of creditors or other similar proceeding of
Purchaser or Guarantor, or otherwise, then Guarantor's obligations under
Section 10.14.1 with respect to such payment shall be reinstated as though
such payment had been due but not been made.

  

  

10.15 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, together with the Schedules and
Exhibits expressly contemplated hereby and attached hereto, Seller Disclosure
Schedule, the Ancillary Agreements, the Confidentiality Agreement and the
other agreements, certificates and documents delivered in connection herewith
or therewith or otherwise in connection with the Transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby, contain the entire agreement between the Parties with
respect to the Transactions contemplated hereby or thereby and supersede all
prior agreements, understandings, promises and representations, whether
written or oral, between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof
and thereof. In the event of any inconsistency between any such Schedules and
Exhibits and this Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall govern.
