(b) _Reports and Payments_. Within sixty (60) days after the end of
each Reporting Period commencing in the Reporting Period immediately
following the Reporting Period in which there was the First Commercial Sale,
Purchaser shall deliver to the Stockholder Representative and CHOP a report
setting forth for the most recently completed Reporting Period the
following information on a Product-by-Product, Improved Product-by-Improved
Product, NCE-by-NCE and country-by-country basis (the "Product Reports"): (i)
the gross sales and Net Sales of each Product, Improved Product or NCE; (ii)
the number of units sold by Purchaser and all of its Affiliates, licensees
and sublicensees; (iii) the Milestone Payment or Earnout Payment due
hereunder, if any; (iv) the applicable exchange rate as determined pursuant to
_Section 2.5(e)_ ; and (v) the calculation of any true-up required with

*** Confidential Information has been omitted and filed separately with the

with respect to this omitted information.

  



    

 | -5-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) _Setoff_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, if the Legacy Stockholders or the Equityholders breach
this Agreement (including with respect to indemnification obligations set
forth in _Article VIII_ ), Purchaser may offset the Milestone Payments and
Earnout Payments payable under this Agreement to the breaching party pursuant
to _Section 8.4(c)_  against such Losses until such time as Purchaser has
been paid such Losses in full (net of offset).

  



  

(d) _Taxes and Withholding_. If Purchaser is required to make a
payment to the Equityholders subject to a deduction of tax or withholding
tax, the sum payable by Purchaser (in respect of which such deduction or
withholding is required to be made) shall be made to the Equityholders after
deduction of the amount required to be so deducted or withheld, which deducted
or withheld amount shall be remitted in accordance with applicable Laws. Any
such withholding taxes required under applicable Laws to be paid or withheld
shall be an expense of, and borne solely by the Equityholders. To the extent
Purchaser is required to deduct and withhold taxes on any payments to the
Equityholders, Purchaser shall pay the amounts of such taxes to the proper
governmental authority in a timely manner and promptly transmit to the
Stockholder Representative and CHOP an official tax certificate or other
evidence of such withholding sufficient to enable the Equityholders to claim
such payments of taxes. The Equityholders shall provide to Purchaser any tax
forms that may be reasonably necessary in order for Purchaser not to withhold
tax or to withhold tax at a reduced rate under an applicable bilateral income
tax treaty. The Equityholders shall use reasonable efforts to provide any
such tax forms to Purchaser at least thirty (30) days prior to the due date
for any payments for which the Equityholders desire that Purchaser apply a
reduced withholding rate. Each Party will reasonably assist the other Party
in claiming tax refunds, deductions, or credits at the other Party's request
and will reasonably cooperate to minimize the withholding tax, if available,
under various treaties applicable to any payment made under this Agreement.

  



  

(e) _Payment and Currency Exchange_. All amounts payable and
calculations hereunder shall be in U.S. Dollars and shall be paid by
bank wire transfer in immediately available funds to such bank account as may
be designated in writing by the Stockholder Representative and CHOP from time
to time. In the event that Net Sales are generated in a currency other than
United States Dollars, the Net Sales shall be converted into United States
Dollars in accordance with the accounting practices, principles, judgments
and methodologies (which shall be in accordance with GAAP or IFRS) with
respect to the conversion of transactions conducted in a foreign currency to
United States Dollars used by Purchaser for the preparation of its
financial statements.

  



    

 | -6-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(f) _Record-Keeping_. Purchaser shall keep, and shall cause its
Affiliates and sublicensees to keep, books and accounts of record in
connection with the sale of Products, Improved Products and NCEs and in
sufficient detail to permit accurate determination of all figures necessary
for verification of Milestone Payments and Earnout Payments to be paid
hereunder. Purchaser shall maintain, and shall cause its Affiliates,
licensees and sublicensees to maintain, such records for a period of at least
three (3) years after the end of the Reporting Period for which they were
generated. At the conclusion of each Reporting Period, Purchaser shall
promptly deliver Product Reports to the Stockholder Representative and CHOP
with respect to each such Reporting Period on Purchaser's Net Sales,
Milestone Payments status and Earnout Payments status.

  



  

(g) _Disagreements_.

  



  

(i) If the Stockholder Representative and/or CHOP disagrees with
Purchaser's calculation of Net Sales, Milestone Payments or Earnout Payments
in a Product Report, then, within sixty (60) calendar days after receipt
thereof, the Stockholder Representative and/or CHOP (as applicable, the
"Disagreeing Party") shall provide Purchaser with notice in writing of such
disagreement (the "M/E Notice of Disagreement"), setting forth in reasonable
detail the particulars of such disagreement, including a copy of the Product
Report marked to indicate those specific items that are in dispute (the "M/E
Disputed Items") and the Disagreeing Party's calculation of each of the
M/E Disputed Items. To the extent the Disagreeing Party provides an M/E
Notice of Disagreement within such sixty (60) calendar day period, only those
items that are not M/E Disputed Items shall be non-appealable, final, binding
and conclusive for all purposes hereunder. If neither the Stockholder
Representative nor CHOP provides a M/E Notice of Disagreement within
such sixty (60) calendar day period, the Parties shall be deemed to have
accepted in full the Product Report as prepared by Purchaser, which shall be
non-appealable, final, binding and conclusive for all purposes hereunder. If
any M/E Notice of Disagreement is timely provided, Purchaser and the
Disagreeing Party shall, for a period of twenty (20) calendar days (or such
longer period as they may mutually agree), in good faith try to resolve any
M/E Disputed Items. During the twenty (20) calendar day period following the
delivery by the Disagreeing Party of the M/E Notice of Disagreement, Purchaser
and the Disagreeing Party, along with their respective Representatives, shall

(ii) If, at the end of the aforesaid twenty (20) calendar day period,
Purchaser and the Disagreeing Party shall have failed to reach written
agreement with respect to all M/E Disputed Items covered by a M/E Notice of
Disagreement, then those M/E Disputed Items that remain in dispute at the end
of such period (the "M/E Unresolved Changes") shall be submitted to BDO USA,
LLP (the "Settlement Arbitrator") to examine, at the Equityholders' sole
expense, the relevant books and records of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates,
licensees and sublicensees (the "Audited Party") as may be reasonably
necessary to verify the amounts reported in accordance with _Section 2.5(f)_
and the payment of Milestone Payments or Earnout Payments; _provided, however_
, that if BDO USA, LLP shall be unable or unwilling to do so, Purchaser and
the Disagreeing Party shall select another independent firm of
nationally recognized financial experts to serve as the Settlement
Arbitrator. The Settlement Arbitrator shall consider only the M/E Unresolved
Changes. An examination by the Disagreeing Party under this _Section 2.5(g)_

Reporting Period. The Settlement Arbitrator shall be provided access to
such books and records at the Audited Party's facility(ies) where such books
and records are normally kept and such examination shall be conducted during
the Audited Party's normal business hours; no other information pertaining to
the Audited Party's books and records shall be provided to the Disagreeing
Party. The Audited Party may require the Settlement Arbitrator to sign a
standard non-disclosure agreement before providing the Settlement Arbitrator
access to the Audited Party's facilities or records. Upon completion of the
audit, the Settlement Arbitrator shall provide Purchaser, the Disagreeing
Party and the Audited Party a written report disclosing any discrepancies in
the reports submitted by the Audited Party and in each case, the specific
details concerning any discrepancies. The determination of the
Settlement Arbitrator shall be non-appealable, final, binding and conclusive
for all purposes hereunder. The Parties shall request that the Settlement
Arbitrator use its commercially reasonable efforts to reach a resolution of
the M/E Unresolved Changes within ninety (90) calendar days after the
submission of the M/E Unresolved Changes to the Settlement Arbitrator.

Party that is subject to review under this _Section 2.5_ shall be deemed to

of _Section 10.1_ , and the Legacy Stockholders and the Equityholders shall
not disclose such confidential information to any Third Party or use such
confidential information for any purpose other than verifying payments to be
made by Purchaser to the Equityholders hereunder.

2.6. _Provisions Related to the Issuance of Purchaser Shares_.

  



  

(a) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement, Purchaser
shall not, without the prior approval of its stockholders as
required pursuant to the rules and regulations of the NYSE MKT, be required
to pay any of the Consideration in Purchaser Common Stock under this
Agreement: (i) if the aggregate number of Purchaser Common Shares to be issued
hereunder would exceed 19.99% of the outstanding Purchaser Common Shares as
of the date hereof (as such ownership is calculated pursuant to the rules of
the NYSE MKT); or (ii) to any Equityholder that, together with such
Equityholder's Affiliates and any other persons acting as a group together
with such Equityholder and any of such Equityholder's Affiliates, (x)
immediately prior to the applicable payment date, does not beneficially own
more than 19.99% of the outstanding Purchaser Common Shares (as
such ownership is calculated pursuant to the rules of the NYSE MKT), if as a
result of such issuance of Purchaser Common Shares, such Equityholder
(together with such Equityholder's Affiliates and any other persons acting as
a group together with such Equityholder's and any of such Equityholder's
Affiliates) would beneficially own more than 19.99% of the outstanding
Purchaser Common Shares (as such ownership is calculated pursuant to the rules
of the NYSE MKT) immediately after giving effect to the issuance of such
Purchaser Common Shares; or (y) immediately prior to the applicable payment
date beneficially owns more than 19.99% of the outstanding Purchaser Common
Shares (as such ownership is calculated pursuant to the rules of the NYSE
MKT), if such Equityholder (together with such Equityholder's Affiliates and
any other persons acting as a group together with such Equityholder and any
of such Equityholder's Affiliates) is not the largest beneficial owner of the
Purchaser Common Shares (as such ownership is calculated pursuant to the rules
of the NYSE MKT) immediately prior to the applicable payment date, but, as a
result of such issuance of Purchaser Common Shares to such Equityholder, such
Equityholder (together with such Equityholder's Affiliates and any other
persons acting as a group together with such Equityholder's and any of such
Equityholder's Affiliates) would (X) become the largest beneficial owner of
the Purchaser Common Shares (as such ownership is calculated pursuant to the
rules of the NYSE MKT) immediately after giving effect to the issuance of
such Purchaser Common Shares or (Y) become the beneficial owner of a number
of Purchaser Common Shares (as such ownership is calculated pursuant to the
rules of the NYSE MKT) immediately after giving effect to the issuance of
such Purchaser Common Shares which, had such Purchaser Common Shares been
received by such Equityholder as of the date such Equityholder entered into
this Agreement, would have caused such Equityholder to become the largest
beneficial owner of Purchaser Common Shares (as such ownership is calculated
pursuant to the rules of the NYSE MKT) as of such earlier date. Immediately
following the date (if ever) that Purchaser obtains the requisite stockholder
approval required pursuant to the rules and regulations of the NYSE MKT, the
restrictions in this _Section 2.6(a)_ shall terminate and be of no further
force or effect.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement, in no
event shall the number of Purchaser Common Shares issuable hereunder exceed

issued in connection with this Agreement to either the Legacy Stockholders or
the Legacy Corporation, as applicable, may be either (i) registered securities
pursuant to the Securities Act, or (ii) issued in a transaction exempt from
registration under the Securities Act, by reason of Section 4(a)(2)
thereof and/or Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act and may not
be re-offered or resold other than in conformity with the registration
requirements of the Securities Act and such other laws or pursuant to an
exemption therefrom (with the certificates issued by Purchaser with respect
to such Purchaser Common Stock legended to the effect described above and
shall include such additional legends as necessary to comply with applicable
U.S. federal securities laws and Blue Sky laws).

  



  

(d) The Legacy Stockholders and the Equityholders shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Legacy Stockholders and
the Equityholders to provide such information, take such further actions and
execute such documents as Purchaser may determine to be necessary to ensure
that the Purchaser Common Shares to be issued in connection with this
Agreement are issued in a transaction exempt from registration under the
Securities Act, by reason of Section 4(a)(2) thereof and/or Regulation
D promulgated under the Securities Act, including requiring that the Legacy
Stockholders and the Equityholders make the representations to Purchaser set
forth in _Section 3.7_ hereof as of the date(s) of issuance of the Purchaser
Common Shares to be issued in connection with this Agreement.

  



    

 | -9-|

(e) To the extent that any Consideration otherwise payable in
Purchaser Common Stock would exceed the limitations set forth in
_Sections 2.6(a)_ or _2.6(b)_ as of the time such Consideration is due and
payable, the portion of such Consideration that exceeds the limitations set
forth in _Sections 2.6(a)_ or _2.6(b)_ shall be paid in cash, in lieu of

Affiliate of Purchaser to the Equityholders by wire transfer of immediately
available funds and in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Share and the
Equityholder Instructions, in an amount equal to the product of the Purchaser
Stock Price and the applicable number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock.

disclosure with respect to the substance of this Agreement prior to the
consultation with and written approval of, in the case of such disclosure by

case of such disclosure by any Equityholders or the Legacy Stockholders, the
approval of Purchaser, except as may be required by Law or the rules of any

by the Legacy Corporation to the Company without the consent of another
Person which has not been obtained, the Legacy Corporation, at its expense,
shall use its best efforts to obtain any such required consent(s) as promptly
as possible. If any such consent shall not be obtained or if any attempted
assignment would be ineffective or would impair Purchaser's or the Company's
rights under such asset(s) in question so that neither the Purchaser nor the
Company would in effect acquire the benefit of all such rights, the Legacy
Corporation, to the maximum extent permitted by law and such asset(s) and
Purchaser desires to do so, shall act after the Closing as the Company's
agent in order to obtain for it and the Purchaser the benefits thereunder and

and provide assistance to the other Parties in transferring possession of the
assets to Purchaser and (c) do, execute, acknowledge and deliver or cause to
be done, executed, acknowledged and delivered all and every further
reasonable act, deed, conveyance, transfer and assurance necessary to assure
their compliance with the terms, provisions, purposes and intents of this
Agreement and the effectiveness of the rights, benefits and remedies provided
for hereby; it being understood that no Party, nor any of their respective
Affiliates, shall be required to expend money, commence any litigation or
offer or grant any accommodation (financial or otherwise) to any Third Party
in connection with this _Section 7.7_.

  



  

7.8. _Right of First Refusal_ If Legacy Corporation or CHOP (each a

another Party to this Agreement other than Purchaser (a "Payment
Stream Buyer") to acquire such Payment Stream Seller's portion of any Earnout
Payments (a "Payment Stream") or (ii) in good faith determines to offer to
sell such Payment Stream Seller's portion of a Payment Stream to a Payment
Stream Buyer (each of (i) and (ii) being an "Offer"), such Payment Stream
Seller shall provide a written notice to the Purchaser informing Purchaser of
such Payment Stream Seller's intention to sell a Payment Stream (a
"Payment Stream Sale Notice"). Purchaser shall have thirty (30) days
following the date Purchaser receives the Payment Stream Sale Notice to
decide whether or not it is interested in participating in the Payment Stream
sale process. If Purchaser is interested, the Payment Stream Seller shall
include Purchaser in the Payment Stream sale process with no less information
than provided to any other potential bidder. Legacy Corporation and the
Payment Stream Seller shall again comply with this _Section 7.8_ (in all
respects) if no definitive agreement for a Payment Stream sale is entered into
by the Payment Stream Seller within 180 days after the Payment Stream Sale
Notice delivery. In the event Legacy Corporation shall have dissolved or
otherwise transferred the right to receive Earnout Payments to Harper and
Hakonarson, Harper and Hakonarson shall be bound by this _Section 7.8_ as a
Payment Stream Seller in the event either one of them receives or negotiates
any Offer(s). Nothing herein shall require any Payment Stream Seller from
completing any sale of the Payment Stream to Purchaser or any Third Party.

(d) any Third Party Claim related to any of the foregoing.

  



  

8.4. _Payment; Procedure for Indemnification_.

  



  

(a) _Claim or Loss_. In the event that a Purchaser Indemnitee or an
Equityholder Indemnitee entitled to indemnification under this _Article VIII_
(each, an "Indemnified Party") shall suffer a Loss or identify any Loss Event,
such Indemnified Party shall promptly, after obtaining knowledge of the
incurrence of any such indemnifiable Loss or Loss Event, send a written
notice prior to the applicable Survival Date of its intent to seek indemnity,
describing the Loss or Loss Event in reasonable detail (an "Indemnity
Notice") to the Party from whom indemnification under this _Article VIII_ is
sought (the "Indemnifying Party"). Provided the Indemnity Notice is given
prior to the applicable Survival Date, the failure of any Indemnified Party
to give the Indemnifying Party the Indemnity Notice shall not release the
Indemnifying Party of Liability under this _Article VIII_ , except to the
extent that the Indemnifying Party's ability to defend such Loss is actually
and materially prejudiced by the failure to give such Indemnity Notice. Within
fifteen (15) calendar days after the receipt by the Indemnifying Party of the
Indemnity Notice, the Indemnifying Party shall either (i) pay to the
Indemnified Party an amount equal to the indemnifiable Loss, or, if the
Indemnity Notice identifies a Loss Event in respect of which all
potential Losses thereunder have not been incurred by the applicable
Indemnified Party, agree in writing that any such prospective Losses are,
when incurred, indemnifiable by such Indemnified Party, or (ii) object to such
Indemnity Notice, in which case the Indemnifying Party shall give written
notice to the Indemnified Party of such objection together with the reasons
therefor, it being understood that the failure of the Indemnifying Party to
so object shall preclude the Indemnifying Party from asserting any Loss,
defense or counterclaim relating to the Indemnifying Party's failure to pay
any indemnifiable Loss. The Indemnifying Party's objection shall not, in and
of itself, relieve the Indemnifying Party from its obligations under this
_Article VIII_. Within fifteen (15) calendar days after the giving of such
notice of objection, the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party
shall negotiate in a bona fide attempt to resolve the subject of the
Indemnity Notice. In the event that the Parties are unable to resolve the
subject of the Indemnity Notice, within fifteen (15) calendar days after the
giving of such notice of objection, the subject of such Indemnity Notice
shall be submitted to a court of competent jurisdiction for resolution as set
forth in this Agreement.

  



    

 | -34-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) _Third Party Claim or Loss_.

  



  

(i) Notwithstanding anything set forth in _Section 8.4(a)_ , in the
event the facts giving rise to the Claim for indemnification under this
_Article VIII_ shall involve any action, or threatened Claim or demand, or
other notice of the commencement of a proceeding, audit, investigation,
review, suit or other action, by any Third Party (each, a "Third Party
Claim"), the Indemnified Party shall, promptly after obtaining knowledge of
such Third Party Claim or demand giving rise to the Claim for
indemnification, send written notice prior to the applicable Survival Date of
its intent to seek indemnity, describing such action or Claim in reasonable
detail (a "Third Party Claim Notice") to the Indemnifying Party. Provided the
Third Party Claim Notice is given prior to the applicable Survival Date, the
failure of the Indemnified Party to give the Indemnifying Party the Third
Party Claim Notice shall not release the Indemnifying Party of Liability under
this _Article VIII_ , except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party's
ability to defend such Third Party Claim or Loss is actually and materially
prejudiced by the failure to give such Third Party Claim Notice. Subject to
the last sentence of this _subparagraph (b)(i)_ , if the Indemnifying Party
shall acknowledge in writing that, subject to the limitations in _Section 8.5_
, it is responsible to indemnify the applicable Indemnified Party for any
Losses arising out of the Third Party Claim identified in such Third Party
Claim Notice, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to defend such Third
Party Claim in the name of the Indemnified Party at its own expense and
through counsel of its own choosing that is reasonably acceptable to the
Indemnified Party; _provided_ , that if the applicable Third Party Claim is
against, or if the defendants in any such Legal Proceeding shall include, both
the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party
reasonably concludes that there are defenses available to it that are
different or additional to those available to the Indemnifying Party or if
the interests of the Indemnified Party may be reasonably deemed to conflict
with those of the Indemnifying Party, then the Indemnified Party shall have
the right to select separate counsel and to assume the Indemnified Party's
defense of such Legal Proceeding, with the fees, expenses and disbursements of
such counsel to be reimbursed by the Indemnifying Party as incurred. The
Indemnifying Party shall give the Indemnified Party notice in writing within
ten (10) calendar days after receiving the Third Party Claim Notice from the
Indemnified Party in the event of Legal Proceeding or otherwise of its intent
to exercise its right to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim together
with the requisite acknowledgment of responsibility for related Losses. If
the Indemnified Party has received no such notice within such time period or
in the case of any (A) Claims resulting from, relating to or arising out of
the provisions of (1) _Section 4.13_ (Taxes), (2) _Section 8.2(b)(iv)_ with
respect to a breach related to _Article IX_ or (3) _Section 8.2(b)(iv)_ ; (B)
any Third Party Claim which seeks an Order, injunction or other equitable
relief against any Purchaser Indemnitee; and (C) any Third Party Claim
which reasonably could be expected, when aggregated with all other unresolved
indemnifiable Claims, to result in Losses in excess of the Representation
Cap, the Indemnified Party may take control of the defense of such Third Party
Claim but the Indemnifying Party shall pay the costs of such defense incurred
by the Indemnified Party (and all such costs shall be deemed to be Losses for
purposes of this _Article VIII_ ).

  



  

(ii) Whenever the Indemnifying Party is entitled to defend any Third
Party Claim hereunder, the Indemnified Party may elect, by notice in writing
to the Indemnifying Party, to continue to participate through its own counsel,
at its expense, but the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to control
the defense of the Legal Proceeding; _provided_ , that the Indemnifying
Party retains counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party;
otherwise, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to control the defense
of the Legal Proceeding.

  



    

 | -35-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(iii) Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement,
the party controlling the defense of the Legal Proceeding shall not
settle any such Legal Proceeding without the prior written consent of the
other party; _provided_ , that if the Indemnified Party is controlling the
defense of the Legal Proceeding and shall have, in good faith, negotiated a
settlement thereof, which proposed settlement contains terms that are
reasonable under the circumstances, then the Indemnifying Party shall
not withhold, condition or delay the giving of such consent (and in the event
the Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party are unable to agree as to
whether the proposed settlement terms are reasonable, the Indemnifying Party
and Indemnified Party will submit the disagreement to a court of competent
jurisdiction for resolution as set forth in this Agreement); and
_provided further_ , that the Purchaser Indemnitees shall not be required to
consent to a proposed settlement that could reasonably be expected to affect
Taxes for a taxable period, or portion thereof, beginning after the Closing
Date.

  



  

(c) _Right of Set-Off_. Purchaser may (but is not obligated to)
satisfy any portion of indemnification obligations of the Legacy Stockholders
and the Equityholders by setting off any such Claims against any unpaid
Milestone Payments or Earnout Payments due to such Legacy Stockholders and
Equityholders, as applicable.

  



  

8.5. _Limitation on Indemnification_.

  



  

(a) Subject to _Section 8.5(c)_ , no Purchaser Indemnitee or
Equityholder Indemnitee shall make a Claim for indemnifiable Losses pursuant
to _Sections 8.2(b)(i)_ , _8.2(c)(i)_ or _8.3(a)_ , respectively, unless and
until the aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses of all Purchaser
Indemnitees, on the one hand, or the Equityholder Indemnitees, on the
other hand, as the case may be, under this _Article VIII_ exceeds Seventy-
Five Thousand Dollars ($75,000) (the "Threshold Amount"), and then, such
Party shall be entitled to recover all indemnifiable Losses in excess of the
Losses incurred in achieving the Threshold Amount, and in no event shall the
aggregate amount of the indemnifiable Losses pursuant to _Sections 8.2(b)(i)_
, _8.2(c)(i)_ or _8.3(a)_ , respectively, for which all
Purchaser Indemnitees, on the one hand, or Equityholder Indemnitees, on the
other hand, as the case may be, shall be indemnified hereunder exceed twenty-
five percent (25%) of the aggregate amount paid by Purchaser to the
Equityholders as Base Purchase Price or Milestone Payments, if any, at
Closing or thereafter (the "Representation Cap"). Subject to _Section 8.5(c)_
, in no event shall the aggregate amount of the indemnifiable Losses for which
any Equityholder shall be liable pursuant to this Agreement exceed the value
of cash and Purchaser securities received by such Equityholder under the terms
of this Agreement at Closing or thereafter (the "Overall Cap").

  



  

(b) Subject to _Section 8.5(c)_ , in no event shall the aggregate
amount of the indemnifiable Losses for which Purchaser shall be liable
pursuant to this Agreement to indemnify the Equityholder Indemnitees exceed
the Base Purchase Price.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Threshold Amount nor
the Representation Cap shall apply to breaches or inaccuracies of any of
the Fundamental Representations (other than with respect to _Section 4.10_
(Intellectual Property), to which the Threshold Amount shall apply).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Threshold Amount nor the
Representation Cap nor the Overall Cap shall apply to, or shall in any way
limit or impair the right of any Party to pursue, any rights, remedies or
Claims against any other Party based on fraud by such Party. For purposes
only of calculating the amount of Losses incurred by a Purchaser Indemnified
Party arising out of or resulting from any breach of a representation or
warranty, covenant or agreement (but not for purposes of determining the
existence of a breach), the references to a "Material Adverse Effect" or
materiality (or other correlative terms) shall be disregarded.

  



    

 | -36-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d) No Claim under this _Article VIII_ shall be made unless an
Indemnity Notice or a Claim Notice (as applicable) has been given prior to
the applicable Survival Date.

  



  

8.6. _Characterization of Indemnity Payments_. Except as otherwise
required by Law, any payment made pursuant to this _Article VIII_ shall be
treated, for financial accounting and Tax purposes, as an adjustment to the
Consideration (except to the extent treated as interest pursuant to Law) and
will be allocated in accordance with GAAP, as consistently applied by the
Legacy Corporation in accordance with past practices.

  



  

8.7. _Sole Remedy_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement and notwithstanding any otherwise available right
or remedy of the Parties, at Law or in equity, from and after the Closing, the
Parties agree that the sole and exclusive remedy for any breach of this
Agreement by another Party, including any misrepresentation, breach of
covenant or warranty, or for any other Loss, cost damage or expense relating
to, arising out of or otherwise connected with this Agreement or the
Contemplated Transactions (other than in connection with _Sections 2.1, 2.2,
2.3, 2.4, 2.5_ , _Article I_ , _Article IX_ and _Article X_ ), shall be the
right of indemnification as and to the extent set forth in this
_Article VIII_ , and in all events subject to all of the limitations herein,
the Parties waiving all and each other remedy available to it at Law or in
equity. This provision is not intended and will not be construed as limiting
in any fashion the right of any of the Parties to assert and pursue any
claims based on fraud.

  



  

ARTICLE IX

  

TAXES; BULK SALES

  



  

9.1. _Preparation and Filing of Pre-Closing and Post-Closing Tax
Returns for LLC_. Purchaser shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file
or cause to be filed (i) all Tax Returns of the Company for all periods
ending on or prior to the Closing Date, and (ii) all Tax Returns of the
Company for all periods beginning on or before the Closing Date and ending
after the Closing Date. Except as required by Law, such Tax Returns shall be
prepared in a manner consistent with the past custom and practice of the
Legacy Corporation and its Subsidiaries with respect to the preparation of
their Tax Returns. Purchaser shall deliver all such Tax Returns to
the Stockholder Representative at least fifteen (15) days prior to their
filing for the Stockholder Representative's review and comment. Purchaser
shall incorporate all reasonable comments of the Stockholder Representative
therein. The Stockholder Representative (on behalf of the Equityholders)
thereafter shall pay, or cause to be paid, an amount of Taxes owed with
respect to such Tax Returns equal to: _(x)_ in the case of a taxable period
ending on or before the Closing Date, all Taxes owed with respect to such Tax
returns, and _(y)_ in the case of a taxable period beginning on or before the
Closing Date and ending after the Closing Date, the portion of such Taxes
which relates to the portion of such taxable period ending on the Closing Date
determined pursuant to _Section 9.2_. The Stockholder Representative shall
pay or cause to be paid such amounts of Taxes within ten (10) Business Days
of receiving demand therefor from Purchaser. The Legacy Company shall, to the
extent needed, sign any Tax Return for the Company prepared in accordance
with this section for any period that ends of the Closing Date.

9.2. _Allocation_. In the case of any Taxes that are imposed on a
periodic basis and are payable for a taxable period that includes, but
does not end on, the Closing Date, the portion of such Tax which relates to
the portion of such taxable period ending on the Closing Date shall (a) in
the case of any Taxes, other than Taxes based upon or related to income or
receipts or expenses ( _e.g._ , payroll Taxes), be deemed to be the amount of
such Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction the numerator
of which is the number of days in the taxable period ending on the Closing
Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire taxable
period, and (b) in the case of any Tax based upon or related to income or
receipts or expenses, other than as set forth in _Section 9.2_ , be deemed
equal to the amount which would be payable if the relevant taxable period
ended as of the end of the Closing Date.

  



  

9.3. _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. The Parties shall, and shall each
cause its Affiliates to, provide to the other such cooperation
and information, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other, in
connection with the filing of Tax Returns, determining liability for Taxes,
and any audit or other Legal Proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such
cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other Party's request)
the provision of records and information reasonably relevant to any such Tax
Returns, Tax liability, or audit or other Legal Proceeding. Each Party will
retain all Tax Returns and related records and materials of the Legacy
Corporation and the Company for the Tax periods first ending after the
Closing Date and for all prior Tax periods until the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations (and, to the extent the other Party
reasonably requests, any extensions thereof) for the Tax periods to which the
Tax Returns and other records and materials relate, and abide by any
applicable record retention agreements entered into with any Governmental
Entity. Thereafter, the Party holding such Tax Returns or related records or
materials may dispose of them _provided_ that such Party shall give the other
Party notice in accordance with _Section 13.5_ prior to doing so, and if the
other Party so requests allow the other Party to take possession or make
copies of such Tax Returns or related records or materials. Each Party shall
make its employees reasonably available on a mutually convenient basis at its
cost to provide explanation of any documents or information so provided.

  



  

9.4. _Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, real
property transfer, recording, stock transfer, stamp, registration and other
such Taxes and fees (including any penalties and interest) incurred in
connection with the Contemplated Transactions shall be paid by Purchaser when
due, and Purchaser shall, at its own expense, file all necessary Tax Returns
and other documentation with respect to all such transfer, documentary,
sales, use, real property transfer, recording, stock transfer, stamp,
registration and other Taxes and fees, and, if required by applicable Law, the
Equityholders shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, join in the execution
of any such Tax Returns and other documentation.

  



  

9.5. _Tax Advice_. The Legacy Stockholders and the Equityholders
acknowledge and agree that none of Purchaser, its Affiliates
or Representatives has provided any advice with respect to Taxes arising out
of, related to or in connection with the Contemplated Transactions to any of

any of their Affiliates or Representatives.

RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS

  



  

10.1. _Confidentiality_. Until the end of the five (5) year period
beginning on the Closing Date (the "Restricted Period"), each of the Legacy
Stockholders and the Equityholders shall, and shall take action to direct
their counsel, accountants, financial advisors and lenders to: (a) keep all
Proprietary Information of the Legacy Corporation, the Company, and Purchaser
and their respective Affiliates confidential and not to disclose or reveal
any such Proprietary Information to any Person other than its Affiliates and
Representatives, including counsel, accountants and financial advisors who
otherwise need to know such Proprietary Information; and (b) not to use such
Proprietary Information for any purpose other than: (i) to the
extent necessary to obtain any of the Consents required hereunder; or (ii) to
enforce such Party's rights and remedies under this Agreement.

  



  

10.2. _Restrictive Covenants_.

  



  

(a) _Non-Solicitation/Non-Acceptance_. As a material inducement to
Purchaser's consummation of the Contemplated Transactions, including
Purchaser's acquisition of the goodwill, the Legacy Corporation and the
Legacy Stockholders shall not, during the Restricted Period, directly or
indirectly, without the prior written consent of Purchaser in each instance in
its sole discretion:

  



  

(i) solicit, accept, call on, divert, take away, influence, induce
or attempt to do any of the foregoing with respect to the customers
or prospective customers of Purchaser or its Affiliates (including, after the
Closing, the Company); or

  



  

(ii) (A) solicit, direct or influence any of the suppliers, vendors,
service providers, insurance carriers, agents, personnel and others having
business relations with the Legacy Corporation or the Company as of the
Closing Date, (B) hire or attempt to hire any of the employees or independent

their Affiliates or (C) attempt to influence or induce any such employee or

Purchaser in each instance in its sole discretion:

  



  

(i) participate or engage in, or offer any services related to, any
lines of business in the Territory which use any product to diagnose, treat
or cure any Indication (collectively, the "Restricted Business"); _provided,
however_ , that nothing contained herein shall prevent the Legacy Corporation
or either of the Legacy Stockholders from performing services for the
Company, Purchaser or any of its Affiliates; or

  



    

 | -39-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(ii) become an owner, equityholder, member, lender, partner, co-
venturer, director, manager, officer, employee, agent or consultant, directly
or indirectly, in any Person that engages in the Restricted Business;

Stockholders may own, as a passive investor, and not as part of a group with
any other Person, not more than five percent (5%) of the outstanding
Securities of any class of any publicly traded Securities of such Person.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall limit
Hakonarson's ability to perform research and engage in the clinical
practice of medicine at CHOP (or any of its affiliates) or any other academic
institution or research institute.

  



  

10.3. _Specific Enforcement_.

  



  

(a) Each of the Legacy Stockholders and the Equityholders
acknowledge that any breach or threatened breach by it of any provision
of the Restrictive Covenants will cause continuing and irreparable injury to
Purchaser and its Affiliates for which monetary damages would not be an
adequate remedy. Accordingly, Purchaser shall be entitled to injunctive relief
from any court of competent jurisdiction, including specific performance,
with respect to any such breach or threatened breach. In
connection therewith, no Equityholder shall, in any Legal Proceeding to so
enforce any provisions of this _Article X_ assert the claim or defense that
an adequate remedy at Law exists or that the injunctive relief is not an
appropriate form of relief under the circumstances.

  



  

(b) The rights and remedies of Purchaser set forth in this _Section
10.3_ are in addition to any other rights or remedies to which Purchaser may
be entitled, whether existing under this Agreement, at Law or in equity, all
of which shall be cumulative. Furthermore, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, the obligations for set-off and the limitations
in _Article VIII_ shall not apply to any Losses resulting from a breach of the
obligations set forth in this _Article X_.

  



  

(c) The periods of time set forth in this _Article X_ shall not
include, and shall be deemed extended by, any time required for litigation to
enforce the relevant covenant periods. The term "time required for litigation"
as used in this _Section 10.3(c)_ shall mean the period of time from the
earlier of any Seller's first breach of the provisions of _Section 10.1_ or
_10.2_ or service of process upon any such Seller with respect to a Legal
Proceeding instituted by Purchaser through the expiration of all appeals
related to such Legal Proceeding.

  



  

10.4. _Disclosure_. Each of the Sellers acknowledges that Purchaser may
disclose the existence of this Agreement and the Restrictive Covenants to any
Person with, through or on behalf of which the Sellers may, directly or
indirectly, breach or threaten to breach any of the provisions of _Sections
10.1_ or _10.2_.

  



    

 | -40-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

10.5. _Interpretation_. It is the desire and intent of the Parties that
the provisions of this _Article X_ shall be enforceable to the fullest extent
permissible under Law and public policy. Accordingly, if any provision of this
_Article X_ shall be determined to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal for
any reason, then the validity and enforceability of all of the remaining
provisions of this _Article X_ shall not be affected thereby. If any
particular provision of this _Article X_ shall be adjudicated to be invalid
or unenforceable, then such provision shall be deemed amended to delete
therefrom the portion thus adjudicated to be invalid or unenforceable, such
amendment to apply only to the operation of such provision in the
particular jurisdiction in which such adjudication is made; _provided_ ,
that, if any provision contained in this _Article X_  shall be adjudicated to
be invalid or unenforceable because such provision is held to be excessively
broad as to duration, geographic scope, activity or subject, then such
provision shall be deemed amended by limiting and reducing it so as to
be valid and enforceable to the maximum extent compatible with the Laws and
public policy of such jurisdiction, such amendment only to apply with respect
to the operation of such provision in the applicable jurisdiction in which the
adjudication is made.

  



  

10.6. _Acknowledgment_. Each of the Legacy Stockholders and the
Equityholders acknowledges that it has carefully read and considered the
provisions of this _Article X_. Each Legacy Stockholder and Equityholder
believes that he or it has received and will receive sufficient consideration
and other benefits to justify the restrictions in this _Article X_. Each
Legacy Stockholder and Equityholder also acknowledges and understands that
these restrictions are reasonably necessary to protect interests of Purchaser
and its Affiliates and none of the Legacy Stockholders and the Equityholders
believe that such restrictions will prevent them from conducting businesses
that are not excluded from the Restricted Business during the periods covered
by the Restrictive Covenants.

  



  

ARTICLE XI

changes in the Registration Statement or the prospectus so that, as of such

material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein (in the case of the prospectus, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made) not misleading;

  



  

(c) use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the withdrawal
of any order suspending the effectiveness of any Registration Statement as
soon as reasonably practicable;

  



  

(d) if the Stockholder Representative so requests in writing,

(e) during the Registration Period, promptly deliver to the
Stockholder Representative, without charge, at least one copy of
the prospectus included in such Registration Statement and any amendment or
supplement thereto and as many additional copies as the Stockholder
Representative may reasonably request; and Purchaser consents to the use,
consistent with the provisions hereof, of the prospectus or any amendment or
supplement thereto by the Stockholder Representative in connection with
the offering and sale of the Registrable Securities covered by the prospectus

(g) upon the occurrence of any event contemplated by _Section
11.3(b)(iv)_ above, except for such times as Purchaser is permitted hereunder
to suspend the use of the prospectus forming part of the Registration
Statement, Purchaser will use its commercially reasonable efforts to as soon
as reasonably practicable prepare a post-effective amendment to the
Registration Statement or a supplement to the related prospectus, or file any
other required document so that, as thereafter delivered to the Stockholder
Representative, the prospectus will not include any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading;

  



  

(h) comply in all material respects with all applicable rules and
regulations of the SEC which could affect the sale of the

required to delay the filing of the Registration Statement or any amendment or
supplement thereto to incorporate any comments to the Registration Statement
or any amendment or supplement thereto by or on behalf of the Stockholder
Representative if such comments would require a delay in the filing of such
Registration Statement, amendment or supplement, as the case may be.

  



    

 | -43-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

11.4. _Furnishing Information_. It shall be a condition precedent to
the obligations of Purchaser to take any action pursuant to _Section 11.1_
that the Legacy Corporation and/or the Legacy Stockholders shall furnish to
Purchaser such information regarding themselves, the Registrable Securities
held by them and the intended method of disposition of such securities as
shall be legally required under the Securities Act or otherwise required by
the SEC to effect the registration of their Registrable Securities.

  



  

11.5. _Indemnification; Contribution_.

  



  

(a) Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless each Equityholder
(including the employees, agents, representatives, officers and directors of
the Equityholder, if applicable, and its Affiliates) and each Person who
controls such Equityholder (within the meaning of the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act) (each a "Registration Holder Indemnitee") from and against any
and all Losses, claims, damages, Liabilities and expenses (including
reasonable costs of investigation and reasonable legal fees) arising out of
or based upon (i) any untrue, or allegedly untrue, statement of a material
fact contained in any Registration Statement, prospectus or preliminary
prospectus or notification or offering circular prepared by Purchaser in
connection with the registration and/or offering of the Registrable Securities
(as amended or supplemented if Purchaser shall have furnished any amendments
or supplements thereto) or arising out of or based upon any omission or
alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except
insofar as the same are caused by or contained in any information concerning
such Equityholder furnished in writing to Purchaser by such Equityholder
expressly for use in such document or (ii) any violation or alleged violation
by Purchaser (or any of its agents or Affiliates) of the Securities Act, the
Exchange Act, any state securities law, or any rule or regulation promulgated
under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, or any state securities law.

  



  

(b) Each Equityholder and Legacy Stockholder, severally and not
jointly, shall indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser, and its directors,
officers, employees and each Person who controls Purchaser (within the meaning
of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act) from and against any and all
Losses, claims, damages, Liabilities and expenses (including reasonable costs
of investigation) arising out of or based upon any untrue, or allegedly
untrue, statement of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement,
prospectus or preliminary prospectus or notification or offering circular
prepared by Purchaser in connection with the registration and/or offering of
the Registrable Securities (as amended or supplemented if Purchaser
shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto) or arising out of
or based upon any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
not misleading, if such statement or omission was made in reliance upon and
in conformity with any information concerning such Equityholder or Legacy
Stockholder or the Company furnished in writing to Purchaser by such
Equityholder or Legacy Stockholder or the Company specifically for use in the
preparation of such document.

  



    

 | -44-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) Each Person entitled to indemnification hereunder (the
"Registration Indemnified Party") agrees to give prompt written notice to the
indemnifying party (the "Registration Indemnifying Party") after the receipt
by the Registration Indemnified Party of any written notice of the
commencement of any action, suit, proceeding or investigation or threat
thereof made in writing for which the Registration Indemnified Party intends
to claim indemnification or contribution pursuant to this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to so notify the Registration
Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Registration Indemnifying Party of
any liability that it may have to the Registration Indemnified Party
hereunder unless, and only to the extent that, such failure results in the
Registration Indemnifying Party's forfeiture of substantive rights or
defenses. If notice of commencement of any such action is given to the
Registration Indemnifying Party as above provided, the Registration
Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in and, to the extent it
may wish, jointly with any other Registration Indemnifying Party similarly
notified, to assume the defense of such action at its own expense, with
counsel chosen by it and reasonably satisfactory to such Registration
Indemnified Party. The Registration Indemnified Party shall have the right to
employ separate counsel in any such action and participate in the defense
thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel (other than reasonable
costs of investigation) shall be paid by the Registration Indemnified Party
unless (i) the Registration Indemnifying Party agrees to pay the same, (ii)
the Registration Indemnifying Party fails to assume the defense of such
action with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Registration Indemnified
Party in its reasonable judgment or (iii) the named parties to any such action
(including any impleaded parties) have been advised by such counsel that
either (x) representation of such Registration Indemnified Party and the
Registration Indemnifying Party by the same counsel would be inappropriate
under applicable standards of professional conduct or (y) there may be one or
more legal defenses available to it which are different from or additional to
those available to the Registration Indemnifying Party. In either of such
cases, the Registration Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to assume
the defense of such action on behalf of such Registration Indemnified Party.
No Registration Indemnifying Party shall be liable for any settlement entered
into without its written consent (other than in the case where the
Registration Indemnifying Party is unconditionally released from liability and
its rights are not adversely effected), which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld.

  



  

(d) If the indemnification provided for in this _Section 11.5_ from
the Registration Indemnifying Party pursuant to applicable Law is unavailable
to a Registration Indemnified Party hereunder in respect of any Losses,
claims, damages, Liabilities or expenses referred to therein, then the
Registration Indemnifying Party, in lieu of indemnifying such Registration
Indemnified Party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such
Registration Indemnified Party as a result of such Losses, claims, damages,
Liabilities or expenses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the
relative fault of the Registration Indemnifying Party and Registration
Indemnified Party in connection with the actions which resulted in
such Losses, claims, damages, Liabilities or expenses, as well as any other
relevant equitable considerations. The relative faults of such Registration
Indemnifying Party and Registration Indemnified Party shall be determined by
reference to, among other things, whether any action in question, including
any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission
or alleged omission to state a material fact, has been made by, or relates to
information supplied by, such Registration Indemnifying Party or Registration
Indemnified Party, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access
to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such action. The amount
paid or payable by a party as a result of the Losses, claims, damages,
Liabilities and expenses referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject
to the limitations set forth in _Sections 11.5(a)_ , _(b)_ and _(c)_ , any
legal or other fees, charges or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in
connection with any investigation or proceeding. The parties hereto agree that
it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this _Section
11.5(d)_ were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of
allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations
referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. No Person guilty of
fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the
Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person.

notice from CHOP.

result of such act or omission.

   | 4.8| Late Payments. In addition to any other remedies available  to
CHOP, including the right to terminate this Agreement, any failure by
Licensee  to make a payment within thirty (30) days after the date when due
shall obligate Licensee  to pay computed interest, the interest period
commencing on the due date and ending on  the actual payment date, to CHOP at
a rate per annum equal to the average of the United  States Prime Rate as
published by the Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition, plus an additional 
one percent (1.0%) per month calculated for the period of the delinquent

interest rate shall be adjusted  with changes to the reference rate published
by the Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition,  and interest shall be
calculated daily and compounded monthly in arrears. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 4.9| Default Payment. In the event of default in payment of any

connection therewith. 
---|---|---

records of all Products developed, manufactured, used or sold and all
Sublicenses, collaboration agreements and joint venture agreements entered
into by Licensee that involved CHOP Patent Rights and/or CHOP Know-How.
Licensee will preserve these books and records for at least six (6) years
from the date of the Financial Report to which they pertain. Upon
reasonable notice, the books and records will be open to examination by
representatives or agents of CHOP during regular office hours to determine
their accuracy and assess Licensee's compliance with the terms of this
Agreement, provided that Licensee shall not have an obligation to provide
access more than once in any given twelve (12) month period, other than for
cause.  
---|---|--- 
  



  

   | 4.12| Audits.  
---|---|--- 
  



   | 4.12.1| Licensee agrees to conduct an independent audit of
the relevant records of Licensee pertaining to the calculation of any
Royalties and CHOP Sublicense Income due to CHOP under this Agreement at
least every two years if annual sales of the Licensed Product or Licensed
Processes are over fifty million dollars ($50,000,000). Such audit shall
address, at a minimum, the amount of gross sales by or on behalf of Licensee
during the audit period, the amount of Sublicense Income, the amount of funds
owed to CHOP under this Agreement, and whether the amount owed has been paid
to CHOP and is reflected in the records of the Licensee. A report by the
auditor shall be submitted promptly to CHOP on completion. Licensee shall pay
for the entire cost of such audit.  
---|---|--- 
  

  



  

   

 | 17| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

       | 4.12.2  | In addition to the right of CHOP to examine the
books and records as provided in Section 4.9 and the periodic audit required
in Section 4.12.1, CHOP, at its own cost, through an independent auditor
reasonably acceptable to Licensee (and who has executed an appropriate
confidentiality agreement reasonably acceptable to Licensee that requires the
auditor to keep any information learned by it confidential except as needed to
report its audit conclusions to CHOP), may inspect and audit the relevant
records of Licensee pertaining to the calculation of any Royalties and CHOP
Sublicense Income due to CHOP under this Agreement. Licensee shall provide
such auditors with access to the records during reasonable business hours.
Such access need not be given to any such set of records more often than once
each year. CHOP shall provide Licensee with written notice of its election to
inspect and audit the records related to the royalty due hereunder not less
than thirty (30) days prior to the proposed date of review of Licensee's
records by CHOP's auditors. Should the auditor find any underpayment of
Royalties or CHOP Sublicense Income by Licensee, Licensee shall (a) promptly
pay CHOP the amount of such underpayment, and shall reimburse CHOP for the
cost of the audit, should such underpayment equal or exceed five percent (5%)
of Royalties or CHOP Sublicense Income paid during the time period audited,
and (b) provide such auditors with an audit right exercisable within six (6)
months after Licensor receives the audit report. If the auditor finds
overpayment by Licensee, then Licensee shall have the right to deduct the
overpayment from any future royalties due to CHOP by Licensee or, if no such
future royalties are payable, then CHOP shall refund the overpayment to
Licensee within thirty (30) days after Licensor receives the audit report.
Licensee may designate competitively sensitive information which such auditor
may see and review but which it may not disclose to Licensor; provided,
however, that such designation shall not restrict the auditor's investigation
or conclusions. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 4.13| Taxes. All payments made by Licensee under the Agreement shall
be made free and clear of and without any deduction for or on account of any
Taxes.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

  



   | 5.1| Patent Filing Prosecution and Maintenance.  
---|---|--- 
  



   | 5.1.1| CHOP Patent Rights, [ *** ].  Licensee shall be engaged [ ***
] as client, and CHOP shall be engaged by [ *** ] as an accommodated
party, each in accordance with an engagement letter reasonably satisfactory
to CHOP and Licensee. Licensee shall control all actions and decisions with
respect to the filing, prosecution and maintenance of such CHOP Patent Rights;
provided that Licensee may not take any actions that may adversely impact
such CHOP Patent Rights without CHOP's prior written approval and CHOP may
take any actions that are necessary to preserve rights if Licensee has failed
to do so in a timely fashion. In addition, Licensee will consider any
reasonable comments or suggestions by CHOP with respect to the filing,
prosecution and maintenance of such CHOP Patent Rights. Licensee will copy,
and will instruct [ *** ] to copy, CHOP on all correspondence related to such
CHOP Patent Rights (including all copies of patent applications, office
action, response to office action, request for terminal disclaimer, and
request for reissue or reexamination of any patent or patent application) and
to interact with CHOP in regards to the preparation, filing, prosecution and
maintenance of such CHOP Patent Rights. Licensee has the right to take any
action to preserve rights whether or not CHOP has commented, and will not
allow any such CHOP Patent Rights for which Licensee is licensed and is
underwriting the costs to lapse or become abandoned without providing at
least thirty (30) days prior written notice to CHOP and CHOP's
written authorization under this Agreement, except for filing of
continuations, divisionals, or the like that substitute for the
lapsed application. Control of CHOP Patent Rights (including the right to
control all actions and decisions with respect to the filing, prosecution and
maintenance) will revert to CHOP upon termination of this Agreement or upon
any decision by Licensee to terminate or abandon any CHOP Patent Rights in
accordance with Section 5.2.2 or otherwise.

   | 5.1.2| CHOP Patent Rights [ *** ]. CHOP shall control all actions 
and decisions with respect to the filing, prosecution and maintenance of such
CHOP Patent  Rights and will consider any reasonable comments or suggestions
by Licensee with respect  to such. CHOP will instruct [ *** ] to copy
Licensee on all correspondence related to  such CHOP Patent Rights (including
all copies of patent applications, office action,  response to office action,
request for terminal disclaimer, and request for reissue or  reexamination of
any patent or patent application) and to interact with Licensee in regards 
to the preparation, filing, prosecution and maintenance of such CHOP Patent
Rights. CHOP  has the right to take action to preserve rights whether or not
Licensee has commented,  and will use reasonable efforts to not allow any
such CHOP Patent Rights for which Licensee  is licensed and is underwriting
the costs to lapse or become abandoned without Licensee's  written
authorization under this Agreement, except for filing of continuations,
divisionals,  or the like that substitute for the lapsed application. For
clarity, CHOP shall have  no requirement to file, prosecute, or maintain such
CHOP Patent Rights if Licensee is  not current with the Patent Cost
obligations as set forth in this Agreement. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 5.1.3| Disagreements regarding the filing, prosecution, and
maintenance  of CHOP Patent Rights will be resolved by the Parties in favor
of preserving rights and  breadth of claim coverage. If there is a dispute
between the Parties relating to the  actions and decisions with respect to
the filing, prosecution and maintenance of CHOP  Patent Rights that cannot be
resolved based on the foregoing principle, then the dispute  shall first be
referred to the chief scientific officers of the Parties, who shall confer 
in good faith on the resolution of the issue. Any final decision mutually
agreed to by  the chief scientific officers shall be conclusive and binding
on the Parties. If the  chief scientific officers are not able to agree on
the resolution of any such issue within thirty (30) days after such issue was
first referred to them (or such shorter time period as may be required due to
filing, prosecution or maintenance deadlines), then, such dispute shall be
handled in accordance with Section 9.9; provided that while any such dispute
is ongoing, all actions will continue to be taken in favor of preserving
rights and breadth of claim coverage.

   | 5.2| Patent Costs. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 5.2.1| Within thirty (30) days of the Effective Date, Licensee will 
reimburse CHOP for all out-of-pocket costs incurred prior to the Effective
Date for the  filing, prosecution and maintenance of CHOP Patent Rights,
including all accrued attorney  fees, expenses, official and filing fees
("Patent Costs"). As of July  10, 2015, Patent Costs are approximately
$85,000 US dollars. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 5.2.2| Licensee will bear all Patent Costs incurring during the Term.
Licensee shall pay [ ***  ] directly, and will reimburse CHOP for all costs
associated with [ *** ] preparation and prosecution of CHOP Patent  Rights,
as applicable, for any such Patent Costs within thirty (30) days of receipt of
each invoice.

 | 19| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

  



   | 5.2.3| Licensee may terminate its rights in, and obligations with 
respect to any or all of CHOP Patent Rights by providing written notice to
CHOP ("Patent  Termination Notice"). Termination of Licensee's rights in and
obligation  with respect to such Patent Rights will be effective six (6)
months after receipt of  such Patent Termination Notice by CHOP. In the event
of termination of less than the  full CHOP Patent Rights, the non-terminated
Rights remain subject to all terms of License.  CHOP will use reasonable
efforts to curtail Patent Costs chargeable to Licensee under  this Agreement
after the receipt of the Patent Termination Notice is received. CHOP may 
prosecute and maintain such Patent Rights at its sole discretion and expense,
and such  Patent Rights will thereafter not be subject to this Agreement,
including the License,  and Licensee will have no further rights or license
to them. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 5.3| Infringement. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 5.3.1| If either Party believes that an infringement by a Third 
Party with respect to any CHOP Patent Right in the Field is occurring or may
potentially  occur, the knowledgeable Party will provide the other Party with
(a) written notice of  such infringement or potential infringement and (b)
evidence of such infringement or  potential infringement (the "Infringement
Notice"). During the period  in which, and in the jurisdiction where,
Licensee has exclusive rights under this Agreement,  neither CHOP or Licensee
will notify such a Third Party (including the infringer) of  infringement or
put such Third Party on notice of the existence of CHOP Patent Rights 
without first obtaining the written consent of the other Party. Both CHOP and
Licensee  will use their diligent efforts to cooperate with each other to
terminate such infringement  without litigation. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   | 5.3.2| If infringing activity of potential commercial significance
has  not been abated within ninety (90) days following the date the
Infringement Notice for  such activity was provided, then Licensee may
institute suit for patent infringement  against the infringer in the Field.
CHOP may voluntarily join such suit at Licensee's  reasonable expense, but
may not thereafter commence suit against the infringer for the  acts of
infringement that are the subject of Licensee's suit or any judgment
rendered  in such suit. Licensee may not join CHOP in a suit initiated by
Licensee without CHOP's  prior written consent. If in a suit initiated by
Licensee, CHOP is involuntarily joined  other than by Licensee, then Licensee
and CHOP may choose mutually agreeable co-counsel,  and Licensee will pay any
costs incurred by CHOP arising out of such suit, including  any legal fees of
co-counsel. If CHOP and Licensee choose to employ co-counsel, CHOP  and
Licensee each may engage separate counsel in addition to co-counsel, at the
engaging  Party's expense. Licensee shall be free to enter into a settlement,
consent judgment  or other voluntary disposition, provided that any
settlement, consent judgment or other  voluntary disposition that (a) limits
the scope, validity or enforcement of CHOP Patent  Rights or (b) admits fault
or wrongdoing on the part of Licensee or CHOP must be approved  in advance by
CHOP in writing. Licensee's request for such approval shall include  complete
copies of final settlement documents, a detailed summary of such settlement, 
and any other information material to such settlement. CHOP shall provide
Licensee notice  of its approval or denial within thirty (30) days of any
request for such approval by  Licensee, provided that, in the event CHOP
wishes to deny such approval, such notice  shall include a detailed written
description of CHOP's reasonable objections to  the proposed settlement,
consent judgment, or other voluntary disposition. 
---|---|--- 
 



  

    

 | 20| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

  



   | 5.3.3| If, within one hundred and twenty (120) days following the
date  the Infringement Notice was provided, infringing activity of potential
commercial significance  has not been abated and if Licensee has not brought
suit against the infringer, then  CHOP may, following consultation with and
good faith consideration of any Licensee comments,  and only if Licensee
fails to provide a reasonable basis for its decision, institute  suit for
patent infringement against the infringer. If CHOP institutes such suit,
then  Licensee may not join such suit without the prior written consent of
CHOP and may not  thereafter commence suit against the infringer for the acts
of infringement that are  the subject of CHOP's suit or any judgment rendered
in such suit. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 5.3.4| Notwithstanding Sections 5.3.2 and 5.3.3, in the event that
any  CHOP Patent Rights are infringed by a Third Party (a) prior to the First
Commercial Sale  of a Product in the United States or (b) if any of the
infringed CHOP Patent Rights are  also licensed by CHOP to a Third Party,
prior to any enforcement action being taken by  either Party regarding such
infringement, the Parties shall discuss, and will mutually  agree, in
writing, as to how to handle such infringement by such Third Party. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 5.3.5| In the event that any CHOP Patent Right in the Field is the
subject  of a Paragraph IV Certification (21 U.S.C. § 355(j)(2)(B)(iv)) or
the like, Licensee  and CHOP will convene to mutually consider options for
response. In the event that CHOP  and Licensee cannot come to a mutually
agreeable response, Licensee will have unilateral  rights to determine how
and when respond. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 5.3.6| Any recovery or settlement received in connection with any
suit  in the Field will first be shared by CHOP and Licensee equally to cover
any litigation  costs of co-counsel. Any remaining recoveries shall be
allocated as follows: 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   | (a)| For any portion of the recovery or settlement where Licensee was
a party in the litigation, other than for amounts attributable and paid as
enhanced damages for willful infringement:  
---|---|--- 
  



   | (i)| for any suit that is initiated by Licensee and in which CHOP was
not a party in the litigation, CHOP shall receive twenty five percent (25%) of
the recovery and Licensee shall receive the remainder; and  
---|---|--- 
  



   | (ii)| for any suit that is initiated by Licensee or CHOP and that the
other Party joins voluntarily (but only to the extent such voluntary joining
is allowed under this Agreement or expressly by the other Party in a separate
agreement) or involuntarily, the non-initiating party's percentage of the
total litigation costs incurred by CHOP and Licensee, but in no event shall
the non-initiating Party receive less than twenty five percent (25%) of such
recovery, while the initiating party shall receive the remainder.  
---|---|--- 
  



   | (b)| For any portion of the recovery or settlement paid as enhanced
damages for willful infringement where Licensee was a party in the
litigation:  
---|---|--- 
  



   | (i)| for any suit that is initiated by Licensee and in which CHOP was
not a party in the litigation, CHOP shall receive thirty percent (30%) and
Licensee shall receive the remainder; and  
---|---|--- 
  



  

    

 | 21| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



   | (ii)| for any suit that is initiated by Licensee or CHOP and the
other Party voluntarily but only to the extent such voluntary joining is
allowed under this Agreement or expressly by the other Party in a separate
agreement) or involuntarily, CHOP shall receive fifty percent (50%) and
Licensee shall receive the remainder.  
---|---|--- 
  



   | (c)| For any portion of the recovery or settlement received in
connection with any suit that is initiated by CHOP and in which Licensee was
not a party in the litigation, any recovery in excess of litigation costs
will belong to CHOP.  
---|---|--- 
  



   | 5.4| Invalidity or Unenforceability Defenses  or Actions. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 5.4.1| Each Party shall promptly notify  the other Party in writing
of any alleged or threatened assertion of invalidity or unenforceability  of
any of the CHOP Patent Rights by a Third Party of which such Party becomes
aware. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 5.4.2| Licensee shall have the first right, but not the obligation, 
to defend and control the defense of the validity and enforceability of the
patents in  CHOP Patent Rights at its own expense. CHOP may participate in
any such claim, suit,  or proceeding with counsel of its choice. If Licensee
elects not to defend or control  the defense of the patents in CHOP Patent
Rights in a suit, or otherwise fails to initiate  and maintain the defense of
any such claim, suit, or proceeding, then CHOP may, but shall  not have the
obligation to, conduct and control the defense of any such claim, suit,  or
proceeding. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   | 5.5| Litigation Costs and Expenses. If CHOP is a party to any  suit
or action under Sections 5.3 or 5.4, Licensee shall reimburse CHOP for all 
reasonable costs, expenses, and fees (including reasonable attorneys' fees),
which  CHOP incurs as a result of becoming a party to such suit or other
action, including any  and all costs, expenses and fees (including attorneys'
fees), except if CHOP and  Licensee engage separate counsel in addition to
co-counsel according to Section 5.4.2.  Licensee shall reimburse any and all
such costs, expenses and fees within thirty (30)  days after receiving an
invoice from CHOP. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 5.6| Patent Marking. Licensee shall place in a conspicuous location 
on any Product (or its packaging where appropriate and practicable) made or
sold  under this Agreement a patent notice in accordance with the Laws
concerning the marking  of patented articles where such Product is made or
sold, as applicable. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 5.7| Confidentiality. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 5.7.1| Each Party agrees that, for the Term and for five (5) years 
thereafter, such Party shall (a) use the same degree of care to maintain the
secrecy  of the Confidential Information of the other Party that it uses to
maintain the secrecy  of its Confidential Information of like kind but in no
case less than a reasonable degree  of care, (b) use the Confidential
Information only to accomplish the purpose of this  Agreement or for audit or
management purposes and (c) ensure that any employees, customers, 
distributors are bound to it by similar obligations of confidence and to make
sure such  disclosure only as required to accomplish the purposes of this
Agreement. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 5.7.2| Neither Party will have any confidentiality  obligations with
respect to Confidential Information belonging to the other Party that: 
---|---|--- 
  



  

    

 | 22| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

  

  



   | (a)| is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a
result of disclosure by the recipient;  
---|---|--- 
  



   | (b)| is already known by or in the possession of the recipient at the
time of disclosure by the disclosing Party;  
---|---|--- 
  



   | (c)| is independently developed by recipient without use of or
reference to the disclosing Party's Confidential Information; or  
---|---|--- 
  



   | (d)| is obtained by recipient from a Third Party that
lawfully obtained it and has not breached any obligations of
confidentiality.  
---|---|--- 
  



   | 5.7.3| A Party may disclose the Confidential Information of the 
other Party to the extent required by Law or court order; provided, however,
that the  recipient promptly provides to the disclosing Party prior written
notice of such disclosure  and provides reasonable assistance in obtaining an
order or other remedy protecting the  Confidential Information from public
disclosure.

respective successors, heirs and assigns (the "CHOP Indemnitees") from and
against any and all liability, damage, loss, demands, cost or expense
(including reasonable attorneys' fees), including bodily injury, risk of
bodily injury, death and property damage to the extent arising out of claims
or suits related to (a) Licensee, Affiliate or Sublicensee or their customers
activities related to Products, Patent Rights, CHOP Patent Rights or CHOP
Know-How, (b) this Agreement or any Sublicense, including (i) the development,
design, testing, use, manufacture, packaging, promotion, import, export,
distribution, lease, sale or other disposition of any Product (including any
product liability claim), (ii) any enforcement action or suit brought by
Licensee against a Third Party for infringement of CHOP Patent Rights, (iii)
any claim by a Third Party that the practice of CHOP Patent Rights or the
design, composition, manufacture, use, sale or other disposition of any
Product infringes or violates any patent, copyright, trade secret, trademark
or other intellectual property right of such Third Party, (iv) any breach of
this Agreement or Laws by Licensee, its Affiliates or Sublicensees, and (c)
Licensee's negligence, omissions or willful misconduct, provided that
Licensee's obligations pursuant to this Section 7.1 shall not apply to
the extent such claims or suits result from the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of CHOP. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 7.1.2| CHOP shall: (a) promptly notify Licensee as soon as it becomes
aware of a claim or suit for which indemnification may be sought pursuant
hereto; provided that any failure to provide such prompt notice shall not
relieve Licensee of any of its obligations hereunder except and only to the
extent Licensee is prejudiced thereby; (b) reasonably cooperate, and cause the
individual CHOP Indemnitees to reasonably cooperate, with Licensee in the
defense, settlement or compromise of such claim or suit; and (c) permit the
Licensee to control the defense, settlement or compromise of such claim or
suit, including the right to select defense counsel reasonably acceptable to
CHOP. In no event, however, may Licensee compromise or settle any claim or
suit in a manner which (a) admits fault or negligence on the part of CHOP or
any other CHOP Indemnitee; or (b) commits CHOP or any other CHOP Indemnitee to
take, or forbear to take, any action, without the prior written consent of
CHOP. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 7.1.3| Notwithstanding Section 7.1.2 above, in the event that CHOP
believes in good faith that a bona fide conflict exists between Licensee and
CHOP or any other CHOP Indemnitee with respect to a claim or suit subject to
indemnification hereunder, then CHOP or any other CHOP Indemnitee shall have
the right in defending against any such claim or suit itself, including by
selecting its own counsel, and Licensee will not be required to pay for any
fees and expenses incurred by CHOP. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 7.2| Insurance.

   | 7.2.2| If the above insurance is written on a claims-made form, it
shall continue for three (3) years following termination or expiration of
this Agreement. The insurance shall have a retroactive date of placement prior
to or coinciding with the Effective Date of this Agreement. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 7.2.3| Licensee expressly understands, however, that the coverages and
limits in Section 7.2.1 do not in any way limit Licensee's liability or

   | (a)| Be issued by an insurance carrier with an A.M. Best rating of "A"
or better; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (b)| Provide for thirty (30) day advance written notice to CHOP of any
modification; 
---|---|---

ARTICLE 8

  

TERM AND TERMINATION

  



   | 8.1| Term. The term of this Agreement (the "Term") shall commence on
the Effective Date and, unless terminated sooner as provided below, shall
continue in full force and effect until the expiration of the Royalty Term.
Upon expiration of the Term, the licenses granted to Licensee under Section 2
shall automatically become non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, fully paid-
up and royalty-free and shall remain subject to the provisions of Section 2.3. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 8.2| Termination by Licensee for Convenience. At any time during the
Term, Licensee may, at its convenience, terminate this Agreement upon
providing at least six (6) months prior written notice to CHOP of such
intention to terminate. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 8.3| Termination by CHOP for Cause. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 8.3.1| Termination for Breach of Diligence Obligations. If Licensee
fails to fulfill its obligations under Sections 3.1 or 3.2 (including the
failure to achieve any Diligence Event by the corresponding Achievement Date,
as may be amended pursuant to Section 3.2.3), CHOP may provide written notice
to Licensee of such failure. If Licensee fails to address such failure to the
reasonable satisfaction of CHOP within three (3) months of receiving such
written notice, CHOP may, upon written notice to Licensor, terminate this
Agreement (a) in its entirety or (b) if such failure is with respect to a
given Indication, terminate this Agreement with respect to such Indication.  
---|---|--- 
  



   | 8.3.2| Termination for Other Material Breach. If Licensee materially
breaches any of its material obligations under this Agreement other than
those covered in Section 8.3.1 above, CHOP may give to Licensee a written
notice specifying the nature of the default, requiring it to cure such
breach, and stating its intention to terminate this Agreement. If such breach
is not cured within thirty (30) days of such notice, such termination shall
become effective upon a notice of termination by CHOP thereafter. For
clarity, such breach of a material obligation includes: 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (a)| failure to deliver to CHOP any payment at the time or times that
such payment is due to CHOP under this Agreement; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (b)| failure to provide reports as set forth in Sections 3.3.1 and
4.7; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (c)| failure to possess and maintain insurance as set forth in Section
7.2; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (d)| grant of a sublicense under the CHOP Patent Rights or CHOP Know-
How that is not in accordance with the terms of this Agreement; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (e)| failure to terminate a Sublicense upon written request of CHOP
where Sublicensee is in breach of the obligations on it pursuant to (i)
Sections 2.4.2(a), 2.4.2(d), 2.4.2(g) and 2.4.2(i) and fails to cure such
breach within thirty (30) days of being notified of such breach and (ii)
Section 2.4.2(e). 
---|---|--- 
  



    

 | 27| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



   | 8.3.3| Termination for Patent Challenge. In addition to all other
remedies available to it, CHOP may terminate this Agreement, upon written
notice, with immediate effect, upon a breach of Section 6.4.1. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 8.3.4| Termination for Insolvency. CHOP may terminate this Agreement,
upon written notice, with immediate effect if, at any time, Licensee files in
any court or agency pursuant to any statute or regulation of any state,
country or jurisdiction, a petition in bankruptcy or insolvency or for
reorganization or for an arrangement or for the appointment of a receiver or
trustee of Licensee or of its assets, or if Licensee proposes a written
agreement of composition or extension of its debts, or if Licensee is served
with an involuntary petition against it, filed in any insolvency proceeding,
and such petition is not dismissed within ninety (90) days after the filing
thereof, or if Licensee proposes or is a party to any dissolution or
liquidation, or if Licensee makes an assignment for the benefit of its
creditors of all or substantially all its assets (in each case, a
"Bankruptcy Action"). 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 8.3.5| Termination for Breach of Purchase Agreement. If the
transaction for the purchase of Licensee contemplated by the Purchase
Agreement is consummated, and Medgenics, its Affiliates, successors or assigns
fails to pay CHOP an amount due under Article II of the Purchase Agreement by
the applicable due date, CHOP may give Medgenics written notice of such
failure in accordance with the Purchase Agreement (such amount, the "Claimed
Amount Due"). If Medgenics pays the Claimed Amount Due in accordance with the
terms of the Purchase Agreement, CHOP shall have no right to terminate this
Agreement. If Medgenics disputes the Claimed Amount Due pursuant to the terms
of Section 2.5 of the Purchase Agreement, the dispute shall be subject to the
dispute procedures set forth in Section 2.5(g) of the Purchase Agreement. If
the result of such formal dispute resolution process is that Medgenics is
ordered to pay CHOP in a final order from which no appeal can be taken or is
taken within the deadline to take such appeal, then Medgenics shall make the
required payment pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement. If such
required payment is not paid pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement,
then CHOP may deliver notice to Medgenics specifying the nature of the
default and stating its intention to terminate this Agreement. If such
required payment is not made by Medgenics within ninety (90) days of such
notice, such termination of this Agreement shall become effective upon a
notice of termination by CHOP thereafter. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 8.4| Effects of Termination. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 8.4.1| Notwithstanding the termination or expiration of this
Agreement, the following provisions shall survive termination or
expiration: Article 1, Section 2.7, Section 4.1, Sections 4.8 - 4.12, Section
5.7, Article 6, Article 7, Sections 8.1 and 8.4, and Article 9. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 8.4.2| Upon the effective date of termination of this Agreement, all
rights and licenses granted by CHOP hereunder shall terminate and Licensee
shall cease all activities that use or derive from the CHOP Know-How or would
infringe the CHOP Patent Rights. If Licensee violates this Section 8.4.2 and
continues such activities, in addition to all other remedies available to CHOP
under Law or this Agreement, Sections 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5.1, 4.6, 4.7, and
4.13 shall also survive termination of this Agreement and Licensee shall
continue to pay all Milestone Payments, Royalties and Annual Maintenance Fees
applicable to such ongoing activities following termination. 
---|---|--- 
  



    

 | 28| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



   | 8.4.3| Upon the effective date of the termination of this Agreement
for any reason, either Party may request in writing, and the other Party
either, with respect to Confidential Information to which such first Party
does not retain rights under the surviving provisions of this Agreement: (a)
as soon as reasonably practicable, destroy all copies of such Confidential
Information in the possession of the other Party and confirm such destruction
in writing to the requesting Party; or (b) as soon as reasonably practicable,
deliver to the requesting Party, at the other Party's expense, all copies of
such Confidential Information in the possession of the other Party; provided,
that the other Party shall be permitted to retain one (1) copy of such
Confidential Information for the sole purpose of performing any continuing
obligations hereunder, as required by Law, or for archival purposes.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, such other Party also shall be permitted to
retain such additional copies of or any computer records or files
containing such Confidential Information that have been created solely by
such Party's automatic archiving and back-up procedures, to the extent
created and retained in a manner consistent with such other Party's standard
archiving and back-up procedures, but not for any other use or purpose. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 8.4.4| Termination of this Agreement shall not relieve the Parties of
any obligation or liability that, at the time of termination, has already
accrued hereunder, or which is attributable to a period prior to the effective
date of such termination. Termination of this Agreement shall not preclude
either Party from pursuing all rights and remedies it may have hereunder or at
Law or in equity with respect to any breach of this Agreement nor prejudice
either Party's right to obtain performance of any obligation. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 8.4.5| Upon termination of this Agreement for any reason, Licensee
shall promptly pay all amounts owed to CHOP under this Agreement before the
earlier of (a) sixty (60) days from the effective date of termination or (b)
the due date for such payment in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 8.4.6| If this Agreement is terminated for any reason, all outstanding
Sublicenses (including all Sublicense Documents for each Sublicense) not in
default will be, in CHOP's sole discretion either (a) assigned by Licensee to
CHOP or (b) terminated. Each assigned Sublicense will remain in full force
and effect with CHOP as the licensor instead of Licensee, but the duties and
obligations of CHOP under the assigned Sublicenses will not be greater than
the duties of CHOP under this Agreement, and the rights of CHOP under the
assigned Sublicenses will not be less than the rights of CHOP under this
Agreement, including all financial consideration and other rights of CHOP.
CHOP may, at its sole discretion, amend such outstanding Sublicenses to
contain the terms and conditions found in this Agreement. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 8.4.7| If this Agreement is terminated for any reason, the following
shall apply with regard to Products: 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (a)| Licensee shall assign to CHOP, at Licensee's sole cost and
expense, all rights, title and interest of Licensee in and to (i) all
regulatory approvals and applications therefor and all pricing and
reimbursement approvals pertaining to Products (ii) all trademarks
(including, without limitation, the goodwill associated with such trademarks)
used to brand the Products and (iii) any copyrights to the extent necessary
or useful for marketing or commercialization of the Products. 
---|---|--- 
  



    

 | 29| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



   | (b)| Licensee shall transfer to CHOP, at Licensee's sole cost and
expense, copies of all non-clinical and clinical data and material regulatory
correspondence of Licensee relating to the Products. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (c)| Licensee agrees to grant, and hereby does grant, to CHOP a
perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, exclusive (even as to Licensee), fully
paid up, royalty-free and fully transferable and sublicensable license under
all Patent Rights and other intellectual property rights Controlled by
Licensee to the extent necessary or useful to make, use, sell, offer for sale
or import the Products. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (d)| Licensee shall furnish CHOP with reasonable cooperation to assure
a smooth transition of any clinical or other studies in progress related to
Product, CHOP Patent Rights or CHOP Know-How that CHOP determines to continue. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (e)| Licensee shall have the right to dispose of all previously made
or partially made Products within a period of one hundred and eighty (180)
days following the effective date of any such termination; provided, however,
that the sale of such Products shall be subject to the terms of this
Agreement including the payment of royalties at the rate and at the time
provided herein and the rendering of reports thereon.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and agreements made

3. _No Operating Agreement; Restrictions_. The parties acknowledge and agree that because CHOP will own the Membership Interest for a moment in time prior to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement, no Operating Agreement of Company shall be entered into by Parent and CHOP. Company agrees that it shall not issue any membership interest in Company other than as contemplated by this Agreement. Parent and CHOP agree to not transfer their respective membership interests except to Medgenics in connection with the Purchase Agreement. CHOP acknowledges and agrees that Company is not making any representations or warranties regarding Company's business or otherwise in connection with the issuance set forth herein.

  



    



 



    



  

4. _CHOP Representations_. In connection with the grant of the Membership Interest hereunder, CHOP represents and warrants to Company as follows:

5. _Company Representations_. In connection with the grant of the Membership Interest hereunder, Company represents and warrants to CHOP that Company has no assets or liabilities except for the "Contributed Assets" (as defined in the Contribution Agreement), the "Assumed Liabilities" (as defined in the Contribution Agreement), the Contribution Agreement and this Agreement.

  



  

6. _Miscellaneous_.

  



  

(a) _Assignment; Successors and Assigns_. No party may assign any
of its rights under this Agreement to any third party (whether by
operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other
party. Any assignment of this Agreement shall not relieve the assigning party
of its obligations hereunder. This Agreement is binding upon and inures to the
benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted
assigns, and survives the execution and delivery hereof.

  



  

(b) _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the Purchase Agreement and
the documents delivered pursuant hereto and thereto constitute the
entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.

  



  

(c) _Notices_. Any notices given in connection with this Agreement
shall be in writing and shall be delivered as set forth in Section 13.5

(d) _Amendment; Waiver_. This Agreement may be amended or modified
only by an instrument in writing by the parties hereto. Any term or
provision of this Agreement may be waived, or the time for its performance
may be extended, by the party or parties entitled to the benefit thereof. Any
such waiver is validly and sufficiently authorized if, as to any party, it is
authorized in writing by an authorized representative of such party. The
failure of any party hereto to enforce at any time any provision of this
Agreement shall not be construed to be a waiver of such provision, nor in any
way to affect the validity of this Agreement or any part hereof, or the right
of any party thereafter to enforce each and every provision. No waiver of any
breach of this Agreement shall be held to constitute a waiver of any other or
subsequent breach.

  



    



 



    



  

(e) _Partial Invalidity_. Wherever possible, each provision hereof
is to be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid
under applicable law, but in case any one or more of the provisions contained
herein is, for any reason, held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in
any respect, such provision will be ineffective to the extent, but only to the
extent, of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without
invalidating the remainder of such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision
or provisions or any other provisions hereof, unless such a construction
would be unreasonable.

  



  

(f) _Execution in Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in
one or more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in
separate counterparts, each of which when executed is to be deemed to be an
original but all of which taken together will constitute one and the same
instrument.

  



  

(g) _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_. This Agreement shall be governed
by and construed in accordance with the internal laws (as opposed to
the conflicts of law provisions) of the State of Delaware. The parties hereby
consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state courts located
in Delaware and the federal courts of the United States District Court for the
District of Delaware for any claims arising under this Agreement. Under no
circumstances will any party assert any claim or cause of action in any state
or federal court outside of the foregoing.

 _PURPOSE_

  



  

To provide a policy that governs the treatment of Intellectual Property.

  



  

 _POLICY_

  



  

The Hospital strives to be a world leader in the advancement of health care
for children by integrating excellent patient care, innovative research, and
quality professional education into all of its programs. Although the
Hospital does not undertake these activities principally for the purpose of
developing Intellectual Property, Intellectual Property may result from these
activities. In promulgating this policy, the Hospital seeks to achieve
certain objectives, including: (a) encouraging research and scholarship by
Hospital Personnel; (b) where appropriate, promoting the protection of
Intellectual Property that may arise in the course of Hospital activities; (c)
serving the public interest by making Intellectual Property available to the
public at the earliest appropriate time; (d) encouraging the earliest
possible disclosure of specific Intellectual Property to the Hospital in
order to avoid the unintended forfeiture of rights and to expedite the public
availability of the Intellectual Property; (e) defining the rights and
obligations of Hospital Personnel and of the Hospital with respect to
Intellectual Property; (f) generating funds for scientific investigation,
clinical innovation, and research; and (g) providing an administrative
function that can assist in the administration of this policy, including
evaluating Intellectual Property, appraising and determining the relative
rights and equities of parties involved in the creation of Intellectual
Property, overseeing the filing of Patent and Copyright applications and
related documents, promoting the licensing of Intellectual
Property, assisting in obtaining funds for research that may result in the
creation or further development of Intellectual Property, and otherwise
promoting the fair and uniform application of this policy.

  



  

 _SCOPE_

  



  

This policy applies to all Trustees, directors, officers, members of Board
committees, employees, members of the Medical Staff, and Scientists engaged in
research under the auspices, of The Children\'s Hospital of Philadelphia,
including The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Research Institute, the
CHOPPA Practice Plans (currently Children's Anesthesiology Associates,
Children's Health Care Associates, Children's Surgical Associates, Radiology
Associates of Children's Hospital, and their New Jersey affiliates), and
entities controlling, controlled by or under common control with The
Children\'s Hospital of Philadelphia, including, without limitation, The
Children\'s Hospital of Philadelphia Foundation (together, the "Hospital"),
and others who conduct research or develop Intellectual Property using
Hospital Facilities, Hospital Funds, and/or other Hospital Resources,
including, without limitation, students, residents, fellows, post-docs,
trainees, technicians, scientists, physicians, nurses, employees,

 _IMPLEMENTATION_

  



   | I.| _OWNERSHIP OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY_ 
---|---|--- 
  



   | A.| _Ownership of Intellectual Property In General_   
---|---|--- 
  



  

Except as otherwise provided in this policy, the Hospital owns all
Intellectual Property of Hospital Personnel, including any Inventions
conceived, reduced to practice, or developed in whole or in part by Hospital
Personnel in the course of research, teaching, clinical duties, or
other Hospital duties or activities or involving the use of Hospital
Facilities, Hospital Funds, and/or other Hospital Resources.

  



   | 1.| It is presumed that Hospital Personnel in conceiving, reducing to
practice or developing any Intellectual Property utilized Hospital
Facilities, Hospital Funds, or other Hospital Resources unless the Hospital
Personnel is able to prove by clear and persuasive evidence to the
satisfaction of the Hospital that (a) the Intellectual Property was conceived
and developed entirely outside the scope of the Hospital Personnel\'s
relationship with the Hospital, entirely on their own time, and without the
use of any Hospital Facilities, Hospital Funds or other Hospital Resources,
and (b) no other Hospital Personnel participated in the conception or
development of the Intellectual Property within the scope of their
relationship with the Hospital, on Hospital time, or using Hospital
Facilities, Hospital Funds, or other Hospital Resources. The Hospital will
exclude as de minimis incidental and limited use of Hospital computers, email
and telephones in determining whether Hospital Resources were used, but such
use may bear on other issues such as whether the Intellectual Property was
conceived and developed entirely outside the scope of the
Hospital Personnel\'s relationship with the Hospital and entirely on their
own time. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 2.| When an Inventor, Author, or other creator of Intellectual
Property has created Intellectual Property and believes that the Intellectual
Property was created wholly outside the scope of this policy, the Inventor,
Author, or other creator must promptly advise the IPA of the creation of the
Intellectual Property and provide the IPA with a written statement of all the
relevant circumstances leading to the creation of the Intellectual Property
and any other pertinent information or documentation and request confirmation
that the Hospital has no interest in the Intellectual Property. The IPA, or
his/her designee, may require additional information from the Inventor,
Author, or other creators and/or may conduct such additional investigation as
he/she considers appropriate. After receiving the requested information
and completing any additional investigation, the IPA, or his/her designee,
makes a recommendation to the IIPAC as to whether the Intellectual Property
was created wholly outside the scope of this policy. The IIPAC may conduct
additional investigation if it desires and then makes a final determination.
If it is determined by the IIPAC that the Intellectual Property was created
wholly outside the scope of this policy, the IPA, or his/her designee, will
provide the Inventor, Author, or other creator with a letter that the Hospital
has no right, title or interest in the Intellectual Property. The IPA, or
his/her designee, or the IIPAC may condition the release of such a letter on
all of the Inventors, Authors, or other creators executing an attestation, in
form and substance acceptable to the IPA, or his/her designee, or the IIPAC
with respect to the facts and acknowledging their obligations under this
policy.

     | **PATENT AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY POLICY**   | **7/1/09** 
  



   | B.| _Agreements Affecting Ownership_   
---|---|--- 
  



  

It is Hospital policy to avoid entering into agreements with third parties
containing terms that provide to third parties ownership of the Hospital's
rights in, to or under Intellectual Property developed, in whole or in part,
by Hospital Personnel and/or using Hospital Facilities, Hospital Funds, or
other Hospital Resources. However, where the Hospital enters into an agreement
that affects ownership, including where the Intellectual Property results
from sponsored research or other sponsored work involving agreements or
arrangements that control the Intellectual Property, the terms of the
applicable agreements or arrangements will determine the ownership of, and
rights to, affected Intellectual Property.

  



   | C.| _Restriction on Third Party Agreements_   
---|---|--- 
  



  

Certain Hospital Personnel, including Hospital Staff members of the Hospital
Medical Staff (as defined in the Hospital's Medical Staff Bylaws), Scientists
and other persons who are faculty members at the University of Pennsylvania
who perform some or all of their duties under the auspices of the Hospital,
must obtain advance review and approval and meet other requirements with
respect to consulting relationships. Advance review and approval for other
Hospital Personnel is available on a voluntary basis. See the _Hospital 's
Conflicts of Interest_ _Policy (A-3-1)_. In any event, Hospital Personnel may
not enter into any agreement concerning consulting or other work if such
agreement could jeopardize the Hospital\'s rights under this policy or is
otherwise in conflict with this policy or the Hospital's other policies,
including the Hospital's Conflicts of Interest Policy. The terms of any
consulting or other agreement may in no way abrogate or limit the rights of
the Hospital or the obligations of Hospital Personnel to the Hospital unless
the Hospital is a party to the agreement and an authorized administrative
signatory of the Hospital who holds the title of Vice President or above has
executed the agreement on behalf of the Hospital. Vendor support for research
also is governed by the _Interactions with Vendors Policy (A-3-7)._

  



   | D.| _Freedom from Third Party Claims_   
---|---|--- 
  



  

It is the responsibility of Hospital Personnel prior to engaging in research
to ensure that the Intellectual Property generated by such research,
including the rights to any Invention conceived or reduced to practice during
such research, is free of claims of third parties. As set forth in "C" above,
certain Hospital Personnel must obtain advance review and approval and
meet other requirements with respect to consulting relationships and advance
review for others is available on a voluntary basis. In any event, where any
Hospital Personnel (i) intends to engage in research funded by entities other
than Hospital, (ii) intends to collaborate, with investigators from
corporations or institutions other than Hospital, or (iii) has any reason to
believe that others may make a claim of ownership to Intellectual
Property stemming from their research, then such Hospital Personnel must
assure that the IPA is aware of such circumstances at the earliest feasible
time and far enough in advance so that potential issues concerning the rights
to such Intellectual Property can be resolved before their conception or
reduction to practice or other creation.

   | E.| _Ownership of Copyrights In General_   
---|---|--- 
  



  

As more fully described in Sections I.E.1. through I.E.4. below, all rights
in Copyright generally remain with the Author(s) unless the Work is an
Institutional Work.

  



   | 1.| _Books, Articles, and Similar Works_ 
---|---|--- 
  



  

In keeping with academic tradition, the Hospital does not claim ownership of
books, articles, and similar works that otherwise contain no Intellectual
Property owned by the Hospital, where the intended purpose is to disseminate
the results of academic or scholarly activities by students,
residents, fellows, post-docs, trainees, and faculty members. Such works
include those of students created in the course of their educations, such as
dissertations, papers, and articles. By way of example, Copyright in an
article submitted to a scholarly or professional journal normally vests in
the Author(s) of the contribution initially, and may be transferred to the
publisher by express agreement. Similarly, the Hospital claims no ownership
of popular nonfiction, novels, poems, musical compositions, or other works of
artistic imagination that are not Institutional Works.

  



   | 2.| _Institutional Works Protectable By Copyright_ 
---|---|--- 
  



  

The Hospital retains ownership of all Institutional Works and resulting
Intellectual Property therein and thereto. Institutional Works means all
works of authorship (i) commissioned by the Hospital, created for Hospital
purposes or supported by a direct allocation of funds through the Hospital
for the pursuit of a specific project, including without limitation, "works
made for hire," which includes work assigned to Hospital Personnel or
developed by Hospital Personnel during or within the scope or performance of
their Hospital employment or engagement (regardless of whether the work is in
the course of sponsored research, unsponsored research, or non-research
activities), including without limitation, a computer program developed by
employed or contracted staff in Hospital's Information Systems Department for
the Hospital's use; a web-based application, service or tool, a toolkit that
is written by physicians, nurses and social workers in one of Hospital's
disease centers for parents of children with that disease, that includes,
with Hospital permission, Hospital-developed protocols; a book written by a
Hospital faculty physician that would have met the requirements of Section
I.E.1. except that it was written with more than insubstantial assistance
from Hospital nurses and administrators during periods when they were acting
within the scope of their relationship with the Hospital; (ii) created using
Hospital Facilities, Hospital Funds, or other Hospital Resources; (iii)
created by Hospital Personnel at the Hospital that would otherwise be of the
type included in Section I.E.1., but are created during periods they are
supposed to be performing their assigned Hospital duties (i.e., in
dereliction of their Hospital duties) or utilize Hospital Facilities,
Hospital Funds, or other Hospital Resources (faculty may make insubstantial
use of their secretaries, computers, etc.), including without limitation, a
musical composition written by a salaried employee who composed the work
during work hours in lieu of providing the specific services at the Hospital
the employee was required to provide; or (iv) otherwise subject to third party
contractual obligations, (collectively, "Institutional Works"). With respect
to Works commissioned directly or indirectly by the Hospital, it is the
responsibility of all Hospital Personnel to ensure that all non-Hospital
Personnel sign an appropriate written agreement conveying ownership of
Institutional Works and Copyrights therein and thereto to the Hospital;
however, failure to obtain such agreement does not adversely impact any
rights the Hospital has in such Institutional Works and Copyrights.

     | **PATENT AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY POLICY**   | **7/1/09** 
  



   | 3.| _Determination of Equities in Copyright_ 
---|---|--- 
  



  

As set forth in Sections I.E.2., the Hospital asserts the Copyright interest
in materials generated as a result of assigned Hospital duty or using Hospital
Facilities, Hospital Funds, or other Hospital Resources. Accordingly, the
Copyright should be secured in the name of The Children\'s Hospital of
Philadelphia. Federal Copyright registration should not be sought without
informing and obtaining advice from the IPA or the Office of General Counsel.

  



   | 4.| _Sponsor 's Rights to Income From Copyright_ 
---|---|--- 
  



  

Where the Hospital entered into an agreement or arrangement that supported
all or part of the development of the copyrightable materials, the Hospital
and the Author(s), Inventor(s), creator(s) or other participant(s) in the
project may be obliged to adhere to the conditions of the grant or contract
as stipulated by the sponsor. For example, the sponsor may have a right to
part, or all, of the income derived from the sale of sponsor-supported
materials that are copyrighted.

  



   | F.| _Software_   
---|---|--- 
  



  

Software, to the extent not protectable by Patent law, generally is governed
by the provisions in Section 1.E. relating to Copyright; provided, however, in
those situations where the Copyright remains with the Author(s) and does not
vest in the Hospital, the Hospital enjoys the rights set forth in
Sections I.F.1. and I.F.2. Software protectable by Patent law is not subject
to the provisions of this policy relating to Copyright or Software, but is
subject to the other provisions of this policy.

   | 1.| _Hospital Royalty Free Right to Use Software_ 
---|---|--- 
  



  

In recognition of the special relationship between the Hospital and Hospital
Personnel, and the practical difficulty of defining the equities in the
various circumstances under which Software may emerge, the Hospital has the
absolute, unrestricted right to use without charge, for any purpose, any
Software created by, or through, the efforts of Hospital Personnel developed
within the scope of the Hospital Personnel\'s relationship with the Hospital
or using Hospital Facilities, Hospital Funds or other Hospital Resources.

  



   | 2.| _Hospital Non-Exclusive Right To Market Software_ 
---|---|--- 
  



  

In addition to Section I.F.1., the Hospital has a non-exclusive right to
market or license any Software created by Hospital Personnel within the scope
of Hospital Personnel\'s relationship with the Hospital or using Hospital
Facilities, Hospital Funds or any other Hospital Resources. If the Hospital
exercises its marketing right, whether acting alone or in concert with an
external developer, its revenues will be allocated in accordance with Section
III hereof.

  



   | 3.| _Request to Waive Non-Exclusive Marketing Rights To Software_ 
---|---|--- 
  



  

The Author(s) of any item of Software subject to Section I.F.2. may request
in writing to the IPA that the Hospital waive its non-exclusive marketing
rights. Such request should include a description of the Software sufficient
to determine whether commercial potential exists. The IPA, or his/her
designee, may require additional information from the Author(s) and/or may
conduct such additional investigation as he/she considers appropriate. After
receiving the requested information and completing any additional
investigation, the IPA, or his/her designee, makes a recommendation to the
IIPAC as to whether to the Hospital should waive its non-exclusive marketing
rights. The IIPAC may conduct additional investigation if it desires and then
makes a final determination in its sole discretion whether to grant or deny
this request.

  



   | 4.| _Hospital Retention of Commissioned Software_ 
---|---|--- 
  



  

In the case of Software that vests in the Hospital, all Authors, Inventors,
creators, or other participants in the project are required, upon the request
of the Hospital, to waive in writing any intellectual and/or financial
interest in the product they might otherwise enjoy.

  



   | 5.| _Sponsor 's Rights To Income From Software _ 
---|---|--- 
  



  

Where the Hospital entered into an agreement or arrangement that supported
all or part of the development of Software, the Hospital and the Author(s),
Inventor(s), creator(s) or other participant(s) in the project may be obliged
to adhere to the conditions of the grant or contract as stipulated by the
sponsor. For example, the sponsor may have a right to part, or all, of the
income derived from the sale of sponsor-supported Software.

   | II.| _ADMINISTRATION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY_ 
---|---|--- 
  



   | A.| _Implementation of Procedures_ 
---|---|--- 
  



  

The IPA and/or the Translational Medicine and Science Board Committee may, from
time to time, establish procedures relating to the disclosure to the
Hospital and administration of Intellectual Property, including without
limitation, Inventions and Copyrights. These procedures may require the
submission of manuscripts, papers, grants, notes, workpapers, summaries of
oral presentations, and other information designed to facilitate the
disclosure, evaluation, and/or protection of Intellectual Property.

  



   | B.| _Disclosure Requirement_ 
---|---|--- 
  



  

In order to preserve the Hospital\'s rights to Intellectual Property,
including, without limitation, Inventions and Copyrights, and assure
compliance with the relevant Patent and Copyright laws, all Intellectual
Property and supporting or underlying Data relating to Intellectual Property
are to be disclosed fully and as promptly as feasible by each Inventor,
Author, or other creator to the IPA or the Department of Technology Transfer
by completing a Technology Disclosure Form available from the Department of
Technology Transfer and/or online on the Hospital's intranet (in The
Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Research Institute section under Tech
Transfer). Disclosure is required of all Intellectual Property conceived,
reduced to practice or developed by Hospital Personnel while they are Hospital
Personnel, even if the Hospital Personnel believes that the Hospital does not
have rights to the Intellectual Property; provided, however that disclosure
is not required for Books, Articles, and Similar Works to which the Hospital
claims no rights, as described above in I.E.1.

  



   | C.| _Invention Disclosure Necessary to Avoid Forfeiture_ 
---|---|--- 
  



  

Disclosure of an Invention to the IPA or Department of Technology Transfer
must substantially precede the first occasion of an Inventor\'s publicly
disclosing (orally, in a poster, in an abstract, or otherwise), publishing
(in print or on-line), commercially using, publicly using, or offering the
Invention for sale. Failure to disclose such Inventions in advance of public
disclosure may result in the irrevocable loss of rights to the Invention in
the United States or in various foreign countries pursuant to their respective
Patent laws.

  



   | D.| _Intellectual Property Assignment Agreement_ 
---|---|--- 
  



  

All Hospital Personnel agree and are required to execute an Intellectual
Property assignment agreement or such other forms acknowledging the Hospital's
rights pursuant to this policy, when requested by the Hospital to do so, and
further agree that such execution may be a condition precedent to beginning
or continuing employment, membership on the Hospital Medical and Research
Staffs, participation in research, applying or receiving research grants,
contracts or awards, or use of Hospital Facilities, Hospital Funds or other
Hospital Resources. Notwithstanding the above, all Hospital Personnel agree
to be and are bound by this policy, as it may be amended from time to time,
irrespective of whether they have signed such an agreement and the absence of
a signed agreement does not adversely impact any rights the Hospital has in
Intellectual Property. The Intellectual Property Assignment Agreement is
available from the Department of Technology Transfer and/or online on the
Hospital's intranet (in The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Research
Institute section under Tech Transfer).

   | E.| _Assistance and Cooperation in Protecting Intellectual Property_ 
---|---|--- 
  



  

Where the Hospital is entitled to own Intellectual Property, including
without limitation, Inventions and Works, pursuant to this policy, each
Inventor, Author, or other creator will: (a) assign to the Hospital his/her
right, title, and interest in, to and under Intellectual Property,
including Patent Rights and/or Copyrights; (b) execute Patent and Copyright
applications and related documents relating to the Intellectual Property when
requested by the Hospital; (c) execute such other agreements and undertakings
as the Hospital believes to be reasonably necessary or appropriate to protect
Intellectual Property; (d) give all reasonable help in the procurement,
maintenance, and enforcement of the Patents and Copyrights; and (e) otherwise
reasonably assist the Hospital and/or its assignee(s) in securing and
maintaining of all Intellectual Property in the name of the Hospital (or its
assignee).

  



   | F.| _Evaluation of Disclosures_ 
---|---|--- 
  



  

Upon receipt of a disclosure relating to Intellectual Property, the Hospital
will, in its sole discretion, decide upon the method for evaluating and
administering the subject Intellectual Property.

  



   | G.| _Procedures For Protection of Inventions_ 
---|---|--- 
  



  

With respect to Inventions, the Hospital may elect in its sole discretion
whether or not to seek Patent protection, or pursue any other alternative
procedures intended to protect, maintain, and best fulfill the objectives of
this policy. In most instances where the Hospital elects to seek Patent
protection, the Hospital\'s primary interest will be in obtaining United
States Patent protection, if available. The Hospital will not normally file
Patent applications in all countries in which Patents might be granted, but
may, at its discretion, file for Patents in certain foreign countries. If an
Inventor is interested in personally funding all, or part, of the expense of
foreign filing for an application the Hospital would not otherwise file,
he/she should so notify the IPA in writing within six (6) months from the
filing of the Patent application in the United States, whereupon the Inventor
and IPA, or his/her designee, will discuss the terms upon which such foreign
filing should be undertaken. The IPA, or his/her designee, will then determine
whether the Inventor should be permitted to do so. Factors to be considered
include whether there is more than one Inventor and, if so, whether all co-
Inventors are in agreement with respect to the proposed course of action,
whether there is agreement as to how royalties relating to the foreign filing
will be shared; and whether the Inventor is willing and able to bear the full
cost of the foreign filing. If the Inventor is permitted to fund all, or
part, of the expense of foreign filing for an application the Hospital would
not otherwise file, the Hospital and all Inventors will enter into a written
agreement with respect to the terms and conditions that apply (such as
requiring that the Inventor advance funds on a schedule that will assure that
the Hospital has no liability). The IPA, or his/her designee, will make all
decisions with respect to the preparation and filing, prosecution,
reexamination, reissue, licensing, and/or enforcement of Patent applications
and/or Patents that are the subject of this policy, and has the right to make
the final decision whether or not, and upon what terms, to begin, settle, or
terminate any dispute, litigation, or other matter arising pursuant to this
policy.

   | H.| _Inventor 's Right To Request Release of a Patentable Invention _ 
---|---|--- 
  



  

If the Hospital does not apply for a Patent within one (1) year of the full
and complete disclosure (as determined by the IPA) of an Invention to the
Hospital, or if, after the Hospital has filed a Patent application, the
Hospital decides to abandon Patent prosecution, an Inventor may request in
writing, directed to the IPA, that the Hospital release the Inventor\'s rights
to his/her Invention to the Inventor. The IPA, or his/her designee, will
review the request and make a recommendation to the IIPAC, which will make the
determination. Unless the Hospital has reasonable grounds for refusing a
release, such as an agency funding the research must agree and refuses or
the Invention is not patentable, the Hospital will release its interest in
the subject Invention and the Inventor will be free to apply for a Patent in
his/her own name at his/her own expense.

  



   | 1.| The release of an Invention is not a release of improvements,
enhancements or derivatives of the Invention; and the Inventor is obligated
to disclose and assign such improvements, enhancements and derivatives and any
other Inventions as new Inventions pursuant to this policy. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 2.| If the Hospital releases the Inventor's rights to his/her
Invention and the Inventor subsequently licenses or otherwise commercializes
the Invention, the Inventor is required to distribute to the Hospital ten (10)
percent of the Net Income and ten (10) percent of any equity or other thing
of value received (or receivable) by the Inventor for so long as the Inventor
receives (or is able to receive) Gross Income, equity or other value for the
Invention. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 3.| If the Hospital releases the Inventor's rights to his/her
Invention, the Inventor is required to grant, and is deemed to have granted,
to the Hospital a royalty-free, irrevocable, non-exclusive license to make or
use the Invention for the purposes of the Hospital. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 4.| If the Hospital releases an Inventor's rights, but there is more
than one Inventor, the Hospital will release an undivided interest, as
defined by United States Patent laws, to each Inventor unless directed
otherwise in writing by all the Inventors prior to such release.

   | I.| _License Agreements Favored_ 
---|---|--- 
  



  

In those cases in which the Hospital expects to obtain or has obtained Patent
protection, the Hospital normally will seek to license or otherwise arrange
for the commercial development of the Invention. In those cases in which the
Hospital does not expect to obtain Patent protection, the IPA will
determine on a case-by-case basis whether to seek to license or otherwise
arrange for the commercial development of the Intellectual Property.

  



   | 1.| The Department of Technology Transfer will notify Inventors of
prospective licensees in an early stage of the negotiation process. If the
Inventor objects to the prospective licensee, he/she may, within thirty (30)
days of such notification, file a written protest with the IPA, or his/her
designee, who will render a written decision within thirty (30)
days thereafter. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 2.| In the event that an arrangement for commercial development is not
made within a reasonable period (a reasonable period where the Hospital
expects to obtain or has obtained Patent protection, is a reasonable period
after the date of issuance of a Patent), an Inventor may request in writing,
directed to the IPA, that the Inventor be allowed independently to pursue
commercial development on the Hospital\'s behalf. The IPA, or his/her
designee, will consider the request and make a recommendation to the IIPAC,
which may in its sole discretion grant (with or without conditions) or deny
this request. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 3.| Inventors or Hospital Personnel involved in the potential
licensing or other commercialization of an Invention or otherwise
Intellectual Property, whether assisting the Department of Technology
Transfer, acting independently as set forth in Section II.I.2. or otherwise,
are required to disclose to the Conflicts of Interest Committee any
relationship with a prospective licensee or other party and are required to
otherwise comply with the Hospital's _Conflicts of Interest Policy (A-3-1_ ). 
---|---|--- 
  



   | J.| _Release of Intellectual Property Other Than Patentable
Inventions_ 
---|---|--- 
  



  

There may be situations with Intellectual Property, other than patentable
Inventions, where the Hospital has determined it has no interest, or where the
Hospital fails in a reasonable time to protect the Intellectual Property or
to license or commercialize the Intellectual Property. In such situations, a
creator of the Intellectual Property may request in writing, directed to the
IPA, that the Hospital release to the creator rights in his/her Intellectual
Property or allow the creator independently to pursue commercial development
on the Hospital\'s behalf. The IPA, or his/her designee, will review the
request and make a recommendation to the IIPAC, which will make the
determination. Because these situations can vary significantly, the IIPAC
will determine if and under what conditions such action is appropriate.

  



   | 1.| The release of such Intellectual Property is not a release of
improvements, enhancements or derivatives of the Intellectual Property and
the creator is obligated to disclose and assign such improvements,
enhancements and derivatives and any other Intellectual Property as new
Intellectual Property pursuant to this policy.

   | 2.| If the Hospital releases the creator's rights to his/her
Intellectual Property and the creator subsequently licenses or otherwise
commercializes the Intellectual Property, the creator is required to
distribute to the Hospital ten (10) percent of the Net Income and ten (10)
percent of any equity or other thing of value received (or receivable) by the
creator for so long as the Inventor receives (or is able to receive) Gross
Income, equity or other value for the Intellectual Property.

   | Q.| _2000 Patent Policy_ 
---|---|--- 
  



  

Revisions in this policy from the version effective November 1, 2006 ("2006
Policy") are relatively minor. However the policy promulgated
effective November 1, 2006 made substantial changes to the Patent Policy
effective July 20, 2000 ("2000 Policy"). Intellectual Property having an
Effective Disclosure Date prior to November 1, 2006 and on or after July 20,
2000, and certain Intellectual Property prior to that date, is subject to the
2000 Policy. For Intellectual Property having an Effective Disclosure Date
between July 1, 2005 and October 31, 2006, inclusive, Hospital Personnel were
given the opportunity to irrevocably elect to have the Intellectual Property
subject to the 2006 Policy in lieu of the 2000 Policy, subject to a process
set forth in the 2006 Policy.

  



   | III.| _DISTRIBUTION OF INCOME_ 
---|---|--- 
  



   | A.| _Right to Share Income_

   | B.| _Distribution of Net Income_ 
---|---|--- 
  



  

Net Income will be distributed as follows:

  



       | 1.  |   | Inventor Share (see Section III.C.)  | 30.0  |
%  | 
---|---|---|---|---|---|--- 
     |   |   |   |   |   | 
     | 2.  |   | Inventor Laboratory Share (see Section III.D.)  |
12.5  | %  | 
     |   |   |   |   |   | 
     | 3.  |   | Inventor Department Share (see Section III.E.)  |

     |   |   |   |   |   | 
     | 4.  |   | Hospital Research Share (see Section III.F.)  |
45.0  | %  | 
  



  

This Net Income sharing schedule pertains to amounts stemming from each item
of Intellectual Property or collection of related Intellectual Property (such
as from each Invention or collection of related Inventions). Where such
Intellectual Property is licensed pursuant to a single licensing or
commercialization agreement, whether prospectively or retrospectively, this
schedule applies once as to income stemming from such agreement (and not
successively as later improvements or enhancements may occur).

  



   | C.| _Inventor Share_ 
---|---|--- 
  



  

The Inventor Share, as set forth in Section III.B., is the total amount
payable to all Hospital Personnel who are Inventors, Authors, or other
creators of the Intellectual Property generating the Net Income.

  



   | 1.| If there is only one such Inventor, Author, or other creator, the
total Inventor Share is payable to that person. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 2.| Where there is more than one such Inventor, Author, or other
creator, and all such persons unanimously agree in writing how the Net Income
should be distributed among them (by executing, and submitting to the IPA, the
Hospital's Inventors Agreement for Distribution of Net Income), prior to the
Hospital entering into a licensing or other agreement that may result in
Gross Income, then the Net Income will distributed in accordance with such
agreement. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 3.| Where there is more than one such Inventor, Author, or other
creator, and all such persons have not unanimously agreed on the distribution
by executing and submitting the Hospital's Inventors Agreement for
Distribution of Net Income prior to the Hospital entering into a licensing or
other agreement that may result in Gross Income, then the IPA, or his/her
designee, will determine an appropriate allocation of Net Income among the
Inventors, Authors, or other creators. Any affected Inventor, Author, or
other creator may appeal the allocation to the President and CEO in accordance
with Section II.K.2.

   | 4.| Each Inventor, Author, or other creator will be entitled to
receive his/her Inventor Share of Net Income in accordance with this policy
whether or not he/she remains Hospital Personnel. In the event of the death of
an Inventor, Author, or other creator, such Net Income will be paid to
his/her estate. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | D.| _Inventor Laboratory Share_ 
---|---|--- 
  



  

The Inventor Laboratory Share of Net Income, as set forth in Section III.B.,
is the total amount that may be available to the principal Hospital laboratory
or laboratories of the Inventors, Authors, or other creators of the
Intellectual Property generating the Net Income.

  



   | 1.| The total Inventor Laboratory Share is limited to a maximum of
Three Hundred and Fifty Thousand Dollars ($350,000) available for any given
July 1 fiscal year, irrespective of the number of principal Hospital
laboratories involved. Half of any excess above the maximum with respect to
any fiscal year is added to the Inventor Department Share and the other half
is added to the Hospital Research Share. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 2.| If there is only one Inventor, Author, or other creator, or if
there is more than one such Inventor, Author, or other creator and they share
the same principal Hospital laboratory, then the total Inventor Laboratory
Share is available to that principal Hospital laboratory. If there is only
one Inventor, Author, or other creator and such person leaves the
Hospital, or if all of the Inventors, Authors, or other creators share the
same principal Hospital laboratory and all such persons leave the Hospital,
the Inventor Laboratory Share is added to the Inventor Department Share. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 3.| Where there is more than one Inventor, Author, or other creator
and they do not share the same principal Hospital laboratory, then the
Inventor Laboratory Share is available to their respective principal Hospital
laboratories in the same proportion that the Inventor Share is allocated
among them. In the event that one or more of the Inventors, Authors, or other
creators leave the Hospital, but at least one Inventor, Author, or other
creator remains, then the Inventor Laboratory Share is available to the
principal Hospital laboratories of the remaining Inventors, Authors, or other
creators in the same proportion that the Inventor Share is allocated among
them without regard to the Inventor Share of the leaving Inventor(s),
Author(s), or other creator(s). If all of the Inventors, Authors, or other
creators leave the Hospital, the Inventor Laboratory Share is added to the
Inventor Department Share. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 4.| Where an Inventor, Author, or other creator does not have a
principal Hospital laboratory, or remains at the Hospital but ceases to have
a principal Hospital laboratory, the Inventor Laboratory Share attributable to
such person is added to the Inventor Department Share. 
---|---|---

   | 5.| In the event that Inventors are students, residents, fellows,
post-docs, trainees, technicians, occupants of the Hospital laboratories,
volunteers of the Hospital, their principal Hospital laboratory is the
laboratory, if any, in which they worked resulting in their becoming
Inventors. Where they do not have a principal Hospital laboratory, the
Inventor Laboratory Share attributable to such person is added to the
Inventor Department Share. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 6.| The Hospital will advise the Inventor's Laboratory (or Inventors'
Laboratories, if applicable) on or about January 31 of each year of the
amount of Inventor Laboratory Share received by the Hospital in the
immediately prior calendar year and available to the Inventor's Laboratory
for research purposes in the upcoming July 1 fiscal year. The Inventor's
Laboratory may submit a proposal, including a budget, with respect to how it
proposes to spend all or part of the available Inventor Laboratory Share for
research purposes in the upcoming fiscal year beginning July 1. The proposal
must be approved by the applicable Division Chief and Department Chair and
submitted to the Chief Scientific Officer for his/her approval no later than
March 31. If the Chief Scientific Officer, or his/her designee, approves the
proposal, then the amounts will be available for expenditure in accordance
with the budget, which will be administered by the Vice President - Research
Administration. If the Chief Scientific Officer, or his/her designee, does
not approve the proposal, or all of the proposal, then the
Inventor's Laboratory may appeal the decision to the President and CEO within
two weeks after the decision of the Chief Scientific Officer, or his/her
designee, in accordance with Section II.K.2. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 7.| Any portion of the Inventor Laboratory Share not approved for
expenditure for the upcoming fiscal year beginning July 1, or not expended in
such upcoming fiscal year in accordance with the approved budget, will be
added to the Hospital Research Share. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 8.| The principal Hospital laboratory of an Inventor, Author, or other
creator is determined as of March 31 with respect to of the amount of
Inventor Laboratory Share received by the Hospital in the immediately prior
calendar year. If an Inventor, Author, or other creator changes principal
Hospital laboratories after March 31, the principal Hospital Laboratory for
purposes of the Inventory Laboratory Share for the upcoming July 1 fiscal year
remains that in effect on March 31, but the succeeding year's principal
Hospital Laboratory for purposes of the Inventory Laboratory Share is
determined based on the principal Hospital Laboratory of the Inventor,
Author, or other creator as of the succeeding March 31.
