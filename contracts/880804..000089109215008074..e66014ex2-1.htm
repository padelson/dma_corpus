Article 2 
 The Merger

  

Section 2.01. The Merger.

  

(a)  At the Effective Time, Merger Sub will be merged with and
into the Company pursuant to the terms, conditions and provisions of this
Agreement and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the GBCC,
whereupon the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the
Company shall be the surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation"). The
Merger will have the effects set forth in the GBCC.

  

(b)  Subject to the provisions of Article 9, the closing of the
Merger (the "Closing") shall take place (i) at the offices of Sidley Austin
LLP, 787 Seventh Avenue, New York, New York 10019, remotely via the exchange
of documents and signatures by facsimile or electronic delivery, at 10:00
a.m. Eastern time on the third Business Day after the date on which all of the
conditions set forth in Article 9 (other than conditions that by their nature
are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or, to
the extent permissible, waiver of those conditions at the Closing) have been
satisfied or, to the extent permissible, waived by the party or parties
entitled to the benefit of such conditions; _provided_ that, if the Marketing
Period has not ended at the time of the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions set forth in Article 9 (other than conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Closing), the Closing shall take place on,
and, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement that may be deemed to the
contrary, Parent and Merger Sub shall not have any obligation whatsoever to
consummate the Closing until, the earlier to occur of (x) a date before or
during the Marketing Period specified by Parent on no fewer than two Business
Days' written notice to the Company or (y) the second Business Day
immediately following the final day of the Marketing Period (subject, in each
case, to the satisfaction or, to the extent permissible, waiver of all of the
conditions set forth in Article 9 as of the date determined pursuant to this
proviso) or (ii) at such other place, at such other time or on such other date
as Parent and the Company may mutually agree in writing. The date on which
the Closing actually occurs is referred to herein as the "Closing Date."

  

(c)  Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, a certificate
of merger shall be duly prepared, executed by the Surviving Corporation and
thereafter delivered to the Secretary of State of the State of Georgia for
filing, as provided in the GBCC, on the Closing Date (the "Certificate of
Merger"). The Merger shall become effective at such time (the
"Effective Time") as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Georgia (or at such later time as may be
specified in the Certificate of Merger).

  

(d)  From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall possess all the rights, powers, privileges and
franchises and be subject to all of the obligations, liabilities,
restrictions and disabilities of the Company and Merger Sub, all as
provided under the GBCC.

  

 11

 



    

Section 2.02. Cancellation and Conversion of Capital Stock _._ __ At
the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part
of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or the holders of any securities of the
Company or Merger Sub:

  

(a)  Each share of Company Stock that is owned directly by
Parent, Merger Sub or the Company (or any direct or indirect Subsidiary of
the Company) as treasury stock or otherwise (collectively, "Owned Shares")
shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration
shall be delivered in exchange for such cancellation and retirement.

  

(b)  Except as otherwise provided in Section 2.02(a), Section
2.02(c) or Section 2.04, each share of Company Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any shares forfeited
pursuant to Section 2.05(b)) shall be converted automatically into the right
to receive $14.00 in cash, without interest (the "Merger Consideration"). As
of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Stock shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease
to exist, and shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration to be paid in accordance with Section 2.03, without interest.

  

(c)  Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into and become one share of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation with the same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so
converted and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of
the Surviving Corporation.

  

Section 2.03. Surrender and Payment.

  

(a)  Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall enter into an
agreement (in a form reasonably acceptable to the Company) with an agent
selected by Parent (that is reasonably satisfactory to the Company) (the
"Paying Agent") for the purpose of exchanging for the Merger Consideration
(i) certificates representing shares of Company Stock (the "Certificates") or
(ii) uncertificated shares of Company Stock (the "Uncertificated Shares"). At
or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit (or cause to be
deposited) in cash with the Paying Agent the Merger Consideration to be paid
in respect of all shares of Company Stock issued and outstanding prior to the
Effective Time (other than Owned Shares and Dissenting Shares) entitled to
payment pursuant to Section 2.02(b) (collectively, the "Aggregate Merger
Consideration"). For the avoidance of doubt, such amounts on deposit with the
Paying Agent shall not be used for any purpose other than to fund payments due
pursuant to Section 2.02(b). The Aggregate Merger Consideration deposited
with the Paying Agent shall, pending its disbursement to such holders, be
invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent; _provided_ that such
investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of
America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody's
Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor's respectively, or in money market
funds having a rating in the highest investment grade granted by a recognized
credit rating agency at the time of the investment. Any net profit resulting
from, or interest or income produced by, such amounts on deposit with the
Paying Agent will be payable to Parent or as Parent otherwise directs.
Promptly after the Effective Time and in any event not later than the third
Business Day following the Effective Time, Parent shall send, or shall cause
the Paying Agent to send, to each holder of shares of

    

12

 



    

Company Stock (other than Owned Shares and Dissenting Shares) at the Effective
Time a letter of transmittal in customary form and instructions (which shall
specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title with
respect to any Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates to the Paying Agent) for use in such exchange.

  

(b)  Each holder of shares of Company Stock (other than Owned
Shares and Dissenting Shares) that have been converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive, (i) upon
surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly
completed letter of transmittal or (ii) receipt of an "agent's message" by the
Paying Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Paying Agent
may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of
Uncertificated Shares, the Merger Consideration payable for each share of
Company Stock (other than Owned Shares and Dissenting Shares) represented by
a Certificate or Uncertificated Share. Until so surrendered or transferred, as
the case may be, each such Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall
represent after the Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive
the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.02.

  

(c)  If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid
to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate
or the transferred Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition
to such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed
or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share
shall be properly transferred and (ii) the Person requesting such payment
shall pay to the Paying Agent any transfer or other Taxes required as a
result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of the
Paying Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

  

(d)  After the Effective Time, there shall be no further
registration of transfers of shares of Company Stock. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger
Consideration as provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set
forth, in this Article 2.

  

(e)  Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to
the Paying Agent pursuant to Section 2.03(a) (and any interest or other
income earned thereon) that remains unclaimed by the holders of shares of
Company Stock one year after the Effective Time shall be returned to the
Surviving Corporation, and any such holder who has not exchanged such shares
of Company Stock for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section
2.03 prior to that time shall thereafter look only to the Surviving
Corporation for payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of such shares
without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not
be liable to any holder of shares of Company Stock for any amounts paid to a
public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Stock
immediately prior to such time when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any Governmental Authority shall become, to the extent
permitted by Applicable Law, the property of the Surviving Corporation free
and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled
thereto.

     

13

 



    

(f)  Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to
the Paying Agent pursuant to Section 2.03(a) to pay for Dissenting Shares for
which appraisal rights have been perfected shall be returned to the Surviving
Corporation, upon demand.

  

Section 2.04. Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, any shares of Company Stock that are issued and outstanding
as of the Effective Time and that are held by a shareholder of the Company who
has properly asserted such holder's dissenters' rights under Article 13 of
the GBCC (the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration unless and until such holder shall have
failed to perfect, or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost, such holder's
right to payment for such shares under Article 13 of the GBCC (whereupon such
shares shall cease to be Dissenting Shares hereunder). If any such holder
shall have so failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost
such right at or following the Effective Time, each share of such holder's
Company Stock shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into and to
have become, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive, without any
interest thereon, the Merger Consideration. The Company shall give Parent (a)
prompt written notice of any notice or demands for appraisal or payment for
shares of Company Stock received by the Company or any other written
communication with the Company that relates to such notices or demands for
appraisal or payment and (b) the opportunity to participate in and direct all
negotiations and Proceedings with respect to any such demands or notices. The
Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, or as
required by the GBCC, make any payment with respect to, or settle, offer to
settle or otherwise negotiate, any such demands. Each holder of the
Dissenting Shares who becomes entitled under Article 13 of the GBCC to receive
payment for such holder's shares shall receive payment therefor from the
Surviving Corporation (but only after the amount thereof shall have been
agreed upon or finally determined pursuant to the GBCC), and such shares
shall be retired and cancelled.

  

Section 2.05. Treatment of Equity-Based Awards.

  

(a)  Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each share of
Company Stock subject to time-based vesting restrictions granted under a
Company Stock Plan (a "Company Restricted Share") that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become fully vested and
nonforfeitable and shall be converted automatically into and shall thereafter
represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration, less the amount of
any required withholding Tax, pursuant to Section 2.02(b).

  

(b)  Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each share of
Company Stock subject to performance-based vesting restrictions granted under
a Company Stock Plan (a "Company Performance Share") that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become vested and
nonforfeitable based upon (i) an assumed achievement of one hundred percent
(100%) of the performance goals, if the Effective Time occurs during the
first half of the applicable performance period, or (ii) the actual level of
achievement of the performance goals, measured as of the end of the calendar
quarter immediately preceding the Effective Time, if the Effective Time
occurs during the second half of the applicable performance period. Such
vested Company Performance Shares shall be converted automatically into and
shall thereafter represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration, less
the amount of any required withholding Tax, pursuant to Section 2.02(b).
Company Performance Shares having individual

  

   

 14

 



    

multi-year performance periods shall vest in accordance with this Section
2.05(b) only with respect to those Company Performance Shares that were
eligible to vest in the performance year in which the Effective Time
occurs. Any Company Performance Shares outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and not becoming vested in accordance with the above shall be
forfeited without payment therefor effective as of the Effective Time.

    

(c)  Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each stock unit
subject to time-based vesting restrictions granted under a Company Stock Plan
(a "Company Stock Unit"), whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and the holder
thereof shall be entitled to receive an amount in cash, without interest,
equal to (x) the product of (i) the number of Company Stock Units held by
such holder, multiplied by (ii) the per share Merger Consideration, less (y)
the amount of any required withholding Tax.

  

(d)  Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each stock unit
subject to performance-based vesting granted under a Company Stock Plan (a
"Company Performance Unit"), whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and the holder
thereof shall be entitled to receive an amount in cash, without interest,
equal to (x) the product of (1) the number of Company Performance Units held
by such holder that would vest based upon (A) an assumed achievement of one
hundred percent (100%) of the performance goals, if the Effective Time occurs
during the first half of the applicable performance period, or (B) the actual
level of achievement of the performance goals, measured as of the end of the
calendar quarter immediately preceding the Effective Time, if the Effective
Time occurs during the second half of the applicable performance
period, multiplied by (2) the per share Merger Consideration, less (3) the
amount of any required withholding Tax. Any Company Performance Units
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and not becoming vested in
accordance with the above shall be forfeited without payment therefor
effective as of the Effective Time.

  

(e)  Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each deferred
stock unit granted under a Company Stock Plan (a "Company Deferred Stock
Unit") that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
cancelled and the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive an amount in
cash, without interest, equal to (x) the product of (i) the number of Company
Deferred Stock Units held by such holder, multiplied by (ii) the per share
Merger Consideration, less (y) the amount of any required withholding Tax.

  

(f)  The Company shall take all actions necessary or
appropriate to ensure that, as of the Effective Time, (i) the Company
Stock Plans shall terminate and (ii) no holder of Company Restricted Shares,
Company Performance Shares, Company Stock Units, Company Performance Units or
Company Deferred Stock Units and no participant in any Company Stock Plan
shall have any rights to acquire, or other rights in respect of, the capital
stock of Company or the Surviving Corporation, except the rights contemplated
by Sections 2.05(a), (b), (c), (d) and (e).

  

(g)  At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Board
of Directors and its compensation committee, as applicable, shall adopt any
resolution and take all such actions as may be necessary or appropriate to
give effect to the transactions contemplated by this Section 2.05. All
amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.05 shall be subject to any applicable
withholding Tax.

  

   

 15

 



    

(h)  Parent shall take all actions necessary so that, no later
than three Business Days after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall pay or cause to be paid to each holder of Company Stock Units, Company
Performance Units or Company Deferred Stock Units the amounts to which such
holder is entitled as determined in accordance with Section 2.05(c) through
the Surviving Corporation's or applicable Subsidiary's payroll, unless
alternative arrangements are specified by a holder that is no longer able to
receive such payment through the Surviving Corporation's or applicable
Subsidiary's payroll system, to the extent permitted thereby. In the event
that the Surviving Corporation has insufficient cash to make such payment to
each holder of Company Stock Units, Company Performance Units or Company
Deferred Stock Units, Parent shall pay such amounts or provide to the
Surviving Corporation sufficient cash to pay such amounts.

  

Section 2.06. Adjustments _._ __ If, at any time during the period
between the date hereof and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Company shall have been changed into a different number
of shares or a different class or number of classes of shares, including by
reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination,
exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend thereon with a
record date during such period, but excluding any change that results from any
settlement of Company Stock Units, Company Performance Units or Company
Deferred Stock Units, the Merger Consideration and any other amounts payable
pursuant to this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted.

  

Section 2.07. Withholding Rights _._ _ _ Notwithstanding any provision
contained herein to the contrary, each of the Paying Agent, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this
Article 2 such amounts at it reasonably determines it is required to deduct
and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under any provision
of Tax law. If the Paying Agent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or
Parent, as the case may be, so withholds amounts, such amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person
in respect of which the Paying Agent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation
or Parent, as the case may be, made such deduction and withholding.

  

Section 2.08. Lost Certificates _._ _ _ If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a
bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent shall pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the
shares of Company Stock represented by such Certificate, as contemplated
by this Article 2.

  

Article 3 
 The Surviving Corporation

  

Section 3.01. Articles of Incorporation _. _ At the Effective Time, the
articles of incorporation of the Company as the Surviving Corporation shall be
amended to be identical to that set forth in _Exhibit A_ hereto until
thereafter amended in accordance with Applicable Law

  

   

 16

 



    

and the applicable provisions of the articles of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation (subject to Section 7.02).

  

Section 3.02. Bylaws _._ __ At the Effective Time, and without any
further action on the part of the Company and Merger Sub, the bylaws of Merger
Sub in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the bylaws of
the Surviving Corporation (except the references to Merger Sub's name shall
be replaced by references to "Premiere Global Services, Inc."), until

Corporation (subject to Section 7.02).

Effective Time shall consist of the members of the board of directors of

Corporation until the earlier of their death, resignation or removal or until
their respective successors are duly elected, designated or qualified, as the
case may be. From and after the Effective Time, the officers of the Company
at the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation,
until the earlier of their death, resignation or removal or until their
respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified, as
the case may be.

  

Article 4

Subject to Section 11.05, except as disclosed in any Company SEC Document

SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., MIHI LLC and MacQuarie Capital (USA) Inc.
(collectively, the "Lenders") providing the terms and conditions on which the

(the "Debt Financing") and (ii) a commitment letter (together with all
annexes, exhibits, schedules and other attachments thereto, the "Equity
Commitment Letter" and together with the Debt Commitment Letters, the

  

   

 34

 



    

"Financing Commitment Letters") from Siris Partners II, L.P., Siris Partners

the amount set forth therein (the "Equity Financing" and together with the
Debt Financing, the "Financing").

  

(b)  As of the date hereof, (i) the Financing Commitment Letters
have not been amended, restated or otherwise modified and (ii) the respective
commitments contained in the Financing Commitment Letters have not been
reduced, withdrawn, terminated or rescinded in any respect and, to Parent's
Knowledge, no reduction, withdrawal, termination or rescission is contemplated

agreements or arrangements related to the funding or investment, as
applicable, of the Financing, except as set forth in the Financing Commitment

obligations under this Agreement, the compliance and performance in all
material respects by the Company of its covenants and agreements set forth in
this Agreement and the completion of the Marketing Period, to the Knowledge
of Parent and Merger Sub, there is no fact or occurrence existing as of the
date of this Agreement that makes any of the assumptions or statements set
forth in the Financing Commitment Letters inaccurate or that causes the
Financing Commitment Letters to be ineffective or unavailable or that
precludes the satisfaction of the conditions under Merger Sub's control set
forth in the Financing Commitment Letters. Assuming the accuracy of
the representations and warranties set forth in Article 4 in all material
respects and the compliance and performance by the Company of its covenants
and agreements set forth in this Agreement in all material respects, based on

satisfaction of the conditions to Parent's and Merger Sub's obligations to
consummate the Merger as set forth herein, (b) the performance in all material
respects by the Company of its obligations hereunder, (c) that any estimates,
projections or forecasts of the Company and its Subsidiaries provided by the
Company to Parent have been

  

   

 36

 



    

prepared in good faith based upon assumptions that are, and continue to be,
reasonable as of the Effective Time and immediately after giving effect to
all of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (d) that the
representations and warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement are
true and correct in all material respects, after giving effect to the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the payment of
all fees and expenses of all parties hereto, at and immediately after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will be Solvent.

  

Section 5.15. Interests in Competitors. As of the date hereof, neither
Parent nor Merger Sub owns any interest, nor do any of their respective
Affiliates insofar as such Affiliate-owned interests would be attributed to
or require disclosure by Parent or Merger Sub under the HSR Act, in any
Person that derives a substantial portion of its revenue from a line of
business that competes with the Company's or its Subsidiaries' principal
lines of business. Parent will promptly update the Company concerning any such
interest that it or any of its Affiliates acquires after the date hereof.

  

Section 5.16. Limited Guaranty. Concurrently with the execution of this
Agreement, the Guarantors have duly executed and delivered to the Company the
Limited Guaranty. The Limited Guaranty is in full force and effect and is a
legal, valid and binding obligation of the Guarantors, enforceable
against the Guarantors in accordance with its terms, except as such
enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar laws affecting the
enforcement of creditors' rights generally or by general principles of
equity. There is no default under the Limited Guaranty by the Guarantors, and
no event has occurred that with the lapse of time or the giving of notice or
both would constitute a default thereunder by the Guarantor.

  

Section 5.17. Non-reliance on Company Estimates, Projections,
Forecasts, Forward-Looking Statements. In connection with the due diligence
investigation of the Company by Parent and Merger Sub, Parent and Merger Sub
have received and may continue to receive from the Company certain estimates,
projections, forecasts and other forward-looking information, as well as
certain business plan information, regarding the Company and its business and
operations. Parent and Merger Sub hereby acknowledge that there are
uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such estimates, projections,
forecasts and other forward-looking information, as well as in such business
plans, with which Parent and Merger Sub are familiar, that Parent and Merger
Sub are taking full responsibility for making their own evaluation of the
adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, projections, forecasts and other
forward-looking information, as well as such business plans, so furnished to
them (including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such
estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-looking information or business
plans), and that Parent and Merger Sub will have no claim against the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective shareholders,
Affiliates or Representatives, with respect thereto. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing in this Section 5.17 serves to modify or qualify the
representations and warranties of the Company contained in Article 4 or
the right of the Parent and Merger Sub to rely thereon.

   

 37

 



    

  

Section 5.18. Investigations; No Other Representations and Warranties.

 

(a)  Each of Parent and Merger Sub has conducted its own
independent review and analysis of the business, operations,
assets, liabilities, results of operations, financial condition and prospects
of the Company and its Subsidiaries and acknowledges that it has been
provided access for such purposes. In entering into this Agreement, each of
Parent and Merger Sub has relied solely upon its independent investigation
and analysis of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and each of Parent and
Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees that it has not been induced by and has
not relied upon any representations, warranties or statements, whether
express or implied, made by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, or any of
their respective Affiliates, shareholders, controlling persons or
Representatives, that are not expressly set forth in this Agreement, whether
or not such representations, warranties or statements were made in writing or
orally. Each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees that, to the
fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, the Company and its Subsidiaries,
and their respective Affiliates, shareholders, controlling persons or
Representatives, shall have no liability or responsibility whatsoever to
Parent, Merger Sub or their respective Affiliates, stockholders,
controlling persons or Representatives on any basis (including in contract or
tort, under federal or state securities laws or otherwise) based upon any
information (including any statement, document or agreement delivered in
connection with this Agreement and any financial statements and any
projections, estimates or other forward-looking information) provided or made
available (including in any data room, management presentation, information
or descriptive memorandum or supplemental information), or oral or written
statements made (or any omissions therefrom), to Parent, Merger Sub or their
respective Affiliates, stockholders, controlling persons or
Representatives, except for the representations and warranties of the Company
expressly set forth in Article 4 (subject to the qualifications set forth
therein).

     

(b)  Parent and Merger Sub each acknowledge and agree that,
except for the representations and warranties expressly set forth in Article
4 (subject to the qualifications set forth therein), (i) the Company does not
make, and has not made, any representations or warranties relating to itself
or its Subsidiaries or their respective businesses or otherwise in connection
with the Merger and Parent and Merger Sub are not relying on any
representation or warranty except for those expressly set forth in this
Agreement, (ii) no Person has been authorized by the Company to make any
representation or warranty relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries or
their respective businesses or otherwise in connection with the Merger, and if
made, such representation or warranty must not be relied upon by Parent or
Merger Sub as having been authorized by such party and (iii) any estimates,
projections, predictions, data, financial information, memoranda,
presentations or any other materials or information provided or addressed to
Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Representatives are not and shall not be
deemed to be or include representations or warranties unless any
such materials or information is the subject of any express representation or
warranty set forth in Article 4.

  

(c)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section
5.18 serves to modify or qualify the representations and warranties of the
Company contained in Article 4 or the right of Parent and Merger Sub to rely
thereon.

and its Subsidiaries pursuant to an executed Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement;  _provided_ that, to the extent that any material non-public
information relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries is provided to any
Third Party or any Third Party is given access which was not previously
provided to or made available to Parent, such material non-public information
or access is provided or made available to Parent prior to or substantially
concurrently therewith and (B) engage in, enter into, maintain or continue or
otherwise participate in discussions or negotiations with respect to potential
Acquisition Proposals or otherwise cooperate with, or assist or participate
in, or facilitate, any such inquiries, proposals, discussions
or negotiations.

  

(b)   _General Prohibitions - No-Shop Period_. From and after
the date hereof, except as set forth in Section 6.03(c)(ii) or Section
6.03(c)(iii), neither the Board of Directors (nor any committee thereof) shall
make any Adverse Recommendation Change or (ii) authorize, adopt, approve,
recommend, or allow the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to execute or enter

Section 6.03, from the

  

   

 42

 



    

No-Shop Period Start Time until the Effective Time, the Company shall not,
and the Company shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their respective
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or take

sentence solely with respect to an Excluded Party.

  

(c)   _Exceptions to Prohibitions_.

  

(i)   _Exception for Diligence and Discussions._
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if at any time
following the No-Shop Period Start Time and prior to obtaining the Company
Shareholder Approval or the valid termination of this Agreement in accordance
with Article 10, the Company or any of its Representatives receives a written
Acquisition Proposal (that did not result from a material breach of this
Section 6.03), then the Company (directly or through its Representatives) may
contact such Person and make inquiries solely for the purpose of clarifying
such Acquisition Proposal, and only to the extent necessary for such purpose,
and the Company, directly or indirectly through its Representatives may (A)
furnish to such Third Party or its Representatives non-public information
relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement;  _provided_ that all such information (to the
extent that such information has not been previously provided or made
available to Parent) is provided or made available to Parent, as the case
may be, prior to or substantially concurrently with the time it is provided or
made available to such Third Party, and (B) engage in negotiations or
discussions with such Third Party and its Representatives, if and only to the
extent that prior to taking any action described in clauses (A) and (B)
above, (x) the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action
would be inconsistent with the Board of Directors' fiduciary duties under
Applicable Law and (y) the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and its financial advisor, that
such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to
result in a Superior Proposal.

  

(ii)   _Exception for Superior Proposal._ Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, at any time prior to obtaining the Company
Shareholder Approval, if the Company receives a Superior Proposal, then the
Board of Directors may, subject to compliance with Section 6.03(d), make an
Adverse Recommendation Change and/or

  

   

 43

 



    

cause the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to and in accordance
with Section 10.01(d)(iii) in order to enter into a definitive Alternative
Acquisition Agreement in respect of such Superior Proposal (it being agreed
that the Company may not enter into such Alternative Acquisition Agreement
unless it concurrently terminates this Agreement in accordance with Section
10.01(d)(iii)).

  

(iii)   _Exception for Other Events._ Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, at any time prior to obtaining the Company
Shareholder Approval and other than in connection with a Superior Proposal, if
the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with
outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with the Board of Directors' fiduciary duties under Applicable
Law, the Board of Directors may, in response to an Intervening Event, and
subject to compliance with Section 6.03(d), make an Adverse Recommendation
Change contemplated by (and only by) clauses (A) and (B) of the definition of
Adverse Recommendation Change.

  

(iv)   _Compliance with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a)._ In
addition, nothing contained herein shall prevent the Board of Directors from
complying with Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act with regard
to an Acquisition Proposal so long as any action taken or statement made to
so comply is consistent with this Section 6.03; _provided_ that any such
action taken or statement made that relates to an Acquisition Proposal (other
than a customary "stop, look and listen" communication by the Board of
Directors pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act) shall be deemed to be
an Adverse Recommendation Change unless the Board of Directors reaffirms the
Company Recommendation in such statement or in connection with such action.

  

(d)   _Match Right_. The Board of Directors shall not make an
Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to Section 6.03(c)(ii) or Section
6.03(c)(iii) (and, in the case of an Adverse Recommendation Change to be made
following receipt of a Superior Proposal pursuant to Section 6.03(c)(ii),
shall not cause the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
10.01(d)(iii) in order to enter into a definitive Alternative Acquisition
Agreement in respect thereof) or otherwise, unless: (i) the Company
promptly notifies Parent, in writing at least three Business Days before
taking that action (such three Business Day period, the "Negotiation Period"),
of its intention to do so, (ii) (A) in the case of an Adverse Recommendation
Change to be made following receipt of a Superior Proposal pursuant to
Section 6.03(c)(ii), such notice specifies in reasonable detail the basis for
the Adverse Recommendation Change and attaches the most current version of
the proposed agreement under which such Superior Proposal is proposed to be
consummated and the identity of the third party making the Acquisition
Proposal and all terms and conditions material to such Superior Proposal to
the extent not set forth in such proposed agreement or (B) in the case of an
Adverse Recommendation Change to be made in response to an Intervening Event
pursuant to Section 6.03(c)(iii), such notice includes a reasonably detailed
description of the reasons for making such Adverse Recommendation Change,
(iii) during the Negotiation Period, the Company negotiates, and causes its
Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with Parent, to the extent Parent
wishes to negotiate, with respect to any proposed changes by Parent to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement and, if applicable, the other
Transaction Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (or
with respect to other proposals made by Parent), and (iv) the Board of

  

   

 44

 



    

Directors determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and after considering in good faith any offer or proposal made by
Parent during the Negotiation Period) that (A) in the case of an Adverse
Recommendation Change to be made following receipt of a Superior Proposal
pursuant to Section 6.03(c)(ii), or (B) in the case of an Adverse
Recommendation Change to be made in response to an Intervening Event pursuant
to Section 6.03(c)(iii), the failure to effect an Adverse Recommendation
Change would be inconsistent with the Board of Directors fiduciary duties
under Applicable Law; _provided_ that any material revisions to the terms
of a Superior Proposal, including any revision in price, shall require a new
notice pursuant to clauses (i) and (ii) above and the Negotiation Period
shall be extended to ensure that at least 48 hours remain in the Negotiation
Period subsequent to the time the Company notifies Parent of any such
material revisions (it being agreed that there may be multiple such
revisions).

  

(e)   _Certain Other Required Notices_.

  

(i)  None of the Board of Directors, any of the Company's
Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives shall take any of the
actions referred to in Section 6.03(c) unless the Company shall have delivered
to Parent a prior written notice advising Parent that it intends to take such
action, and, after taking any action referred to in Section 6.03(c), the
Company shall continue to advise Parent on a reasonably current basis of the
status and terms of any discussions and negotiations with the Third Party.

  

(ii)  From and after the date hereof, the Company shall provide
a written report to Parent every ten Business Days setting forth (A) the
total number of parties contacted to date prior to the No-Shop Period Start
Time, (B) the number of parties that have affirmatively declined to receive
information or enter into discussions regarding an Acquisition Proposal, (D)
the number of parties that have affirmatively expressed interest in receiving
information or entering into discussions regarding an Acquisition Proposal,
(E) the number of parties that have executed an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement and (F) the number of parties that are currently in discussions
with the Company regarding an Acquisition Proposal. In addition, at any time
on or after the date hereof until the Effective Time, the Company shall
notify Parent promptly (but in no event later than 48 hours) after receipt by
the Company (or any of its Representatives) of any Acquisition Proposal or
any request for material non-public information relating to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or for access to the business, properties, assets,
books, records or personnel of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any
Third Party that could reasonably be expected to make, or has made, an
Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall provide the notice provided for
in the immediately preceding sentence orally and in writing and shall
identify the Third Party making, and the terms and conditions of, any such
Acquisition Proposal, indication or request. On and after the date hereof, the
Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed of any significant
developments, discussions or negotiations regarding any Acquisition Proposal
on a reasonably timely basis, and shall promptly (but in no event later than
48 hours after receipt) provide to Parent copies of all material
correspondence and written materials sent or provided to the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries that describes any terms or conditions of any Acquisition
Proposal (as well as written summaries of any material oral communications
addressing such matters).

  

   

 45

 



    

(iii)  Without limiting its obligations pursuant to Section
6.03(e), (A) at or within 48 hours of the No-Shop Period Start Time, the
Company shall notify Parent of the identity of all Persons who are Excluded
Parties, and the basis on which the Company believes such Persons are
Excluded Parties, and provide Parent with a written summary of the material
terms and conditions of any Acquisition Proposal received from any Excluded
Party (which material terms and conditions shall include the identity of the
Third Party or group of Third Parties making the Acquisition Proposal and
shall include, copies of all drafts of transaction documents, including term
sheets, letters of intent or other similar documents, relating to such
Acquisition Proposal) and (B) thereafter, the Company shall continue to
comply with its obligations pursuant to Section 6.03(e).

  

(f)   _Application of this Provision to Representatives_. It is
agreed that any violation of the restrictions on the Company set forth in
this Section 6.03 by any Subsidiaries of the Company or any Representative of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be a breach of this Section 6.03
by the Company.

  

(g)   _Obligation to Terminate Discussions_. Subject to the
remainder of this Section 6.03 and except with respect to any Excluded Party,
on the No-Shop Period Start Time, the Company (i) shall, and shall cause any
of its Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives to, cease immediately
and cause to be terminated any and all existing activities, discussions or
negotiations, if any, with any Third Party and its Representatives conducted
prior to such time with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, and (ii) shall
promptly request that all copies of all confidential information that the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or its or their Representatives have
distributed or made available to any such Third Party in connection with their
consideration of any Acquisition Proposal (and all analyses and other
materials prepared by or on behalf of such Third Party that contains,
reflects or analyzes that information) be promptly destroyed or returned, and
cause any physical or virtual data room to no longer be accessible to or by

Article 7 
 Covenants of Parent

  

Parent agrees that:

  

Section 7.01. Obligations of Merger Sub _. _ Parent shall take all
action necessary to cause Merger Sub to perform its obligations under this
Agreement and to consummate the Merger on the terms and conditions set forth
in this Agreement.

  

Section 7.02. Director and Officer Liability _. _ Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation, and the Surviving Corporation hereby agrees, to do
the following:

  

(a)  For a period beginning at the Effective Time and ending on
the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall jointly and severally indemnify and hold harmless
all past and present directors, officers and employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (the "Indemnified Persons") to the same extent such Indemnified
Persons are indemnified as of the date hereof by the Company or such
Subsidiary pursuant to Applicable Law, the Company Articles, the Company
Bylaws, the organizational or governing documents of any of the Company's
Subsidiaries, and any indemnification agreements in existence on the date
hereof with any of the Indemnified Persons, arising out of acts or omissions
in their capacity as directors, officers or employees of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries occurring at or prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Parent agrees to, and will cause the Surviving Corporation
to, indemnify and hold harmless such Indemnified Persons to the fullest
extent permitted by Applicable Law for acts or omissions occurring in
connection with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

  

(b)  For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
to be maintained in effect provisions in the Surviving Corporation's articles
of incorporation and bylaws (or in such documents of any successor to the
business of the Surviving Corporation) regarding elimination of liability of
directors, indemnification of officers, directors and employees and
advancement of expenses that are no less advantageous to the intended
beneficiaries than the corresponding provisions in existence on the date
hereof. The indemnification agreements, if any, in existence on the date
hereof with any of the Indemnified Persons shall be assumed by the Surviving
Corporation, without any further action, and shall continue in full force and
effect in accordance with their terms following the Effective Time.

  

(c)  Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall or, if the
Company is unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the
Effective Time to, obtain and fully pay the premium for the non-cancellable
extension of the directors' and officers' liability coverage of the Company's
existing directors' and officers' insurance policies and the
Company's existing fiduciary liability insurance policies (collectively, "DandO
Insurance"), in each case for a claims reporting or discovery period of at
least six years from and after the Effective Time with respect

  

   

 48

 



    

to any claim related to any period of time at or prior to the Effective Time
with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are not
materially less favorable in the aggregate than the coverage provided under
the Company's existing policies with respect to any actual or alleged error,
misstatement, misleading statement, act, omission, neglect, breach of duty or
any matter claimed against a director or officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries by reason of him or her serving in such capacity that existed or
occurred at or prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions or actions contemplated hereby); _provided_
that (x) the Company shall give Parent a reasonable opportunity to
participate in the selection of such tail policy and the Company shall give
reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments made by Parent with
respect thereto, (y) in no event shall the Company or the Surviving
Corporation be required or permitted to expend for such policies pursuant to
this sentence an aggregate amount in excess of 300% of the last annual premium
paid by the Company prior to the date hereof in respect of such coverage, and
(z) if the aggregate premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount
and the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall obtain a
policy in accordance with this sentence, such policy shall provide the
greatest coverage available, with respect to matters occurring prior to the
Effective Time, for a cost not exceeding such amount. If the Company or the
Surviving Corporation for any reason fail to obtain such "tail"
insurance policies as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
continue to maintain in effect, for a period of at least six years from and
after the Effective Time, the DandO Insurance in place as of the date hereof
with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are not
materially less favorable in the aggregate than the coverage provided under
the Company's existing policies as of the date hereof, or the Surviving
Corporation shall purchase DandO Insurance for such six-year period with terms,
conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than
as provided in the Company's existing policies as of the date hereof;
_provided_ that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be
required to expend for such policies pursuant to this sentence an annual
premium amount in excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid by the
Company prior to the date hereof in respect of such coverage; and _provided,
further,_ that if the aggregate premiums of such insurance coverage exceed
such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy
with the greatest coverage available, with respect to matters occurring prior
to the Effective Time, for a cost not exceeding such amount.

  

(d)  If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to
the extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors
and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be,
shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 7.02.

    

(e)  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any
act or omission (whether arising before, at or after the Effective Time)
requiring indemnification under this Section 7.02 is instituted against any
Indemnified Person on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective
Time, the provisions of this Section 7.02 shall continue in effect until the
final disposition of such action.

  

   

 49

 



    

(f)  The rights of each Indemnified Person under this Section
7.02 shall be in addition to any rights such Person may have under the
Company Articles, the Company Bylaws and the organizational or governing
documents of any of the Company's Subsidiaries, or under Applicable Law or
under any agreement of any Indemnified Person with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. These rights shall survive consummation of the Merger and are
intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person
and their respective heirs and legal representatives.

  

Section 7.03. Employee Matters.

  

(a)  For the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending
on the first anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent shall provide or cause
to be provided to Company Employees, to the extent that and for such time as
such Company Employees remain employed with the Surviving Corporation or any
of its Subsidiaries, compensation and benefits that are no less favorable in
the aggregate to than the compensation and benefits provided to Company
Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time, excluding any
equity, change of control or other transaction-based compensation.

  

(b)  For all purposes under the compensation and benefit plans,
programs, agreements and arrangements of the Surviving Corporation providing
benefits to any Company Employee after the Effective Time, and in which such
Company Employee did not participate prior to the Effective Time (each a "New
Plan"), each Company Employee shall be credited with his or her years
of service with the Company and its Affiliates (and any additional service
with any predecessor employer) before the Closing, to the same extent as such
Company Employee was entitled, before the Closing, to credit for such service
under any analogous employee benefit plan maintained or sponsored by the
Company or its Subsidiaries, except where such credit would result in a
duplication of benefits. For purposes of each New Plan providing medical,
dental, prescription, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Company
Employee, Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to cause all pre-existing
condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be
waived for such Company Employee except to the extent such pre-existing
conditions and actively-at-work requirements would apply under any analogous
Company Employee Plan, and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to cause
any eligible expenses incurred by such Company Employee and his or her
covered dependents under a Company Employee Plan during the portion of the
plan year prior to the Closing to be taken into account under such New Plan
for purposes of satisfying all deductible, co-insurance, co-payment and
maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Company Employee for the
applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such
New Plan.

  

(c)  Notwithstanding the generality of the foregoing, as of the
Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries to, honor in accordance with their terms and, in each case,
subject to Section 6.9(d), all employment, change in control, severance and
other compensation plans and agreements existing immediately prior to the
execution of this Agreement, which are between the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and any director, officer or employee thereof or maintained by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each, a "Company Agreement"). Parent
and the Company hereby agree that the occurrence of the Effective Time shall
constitute a "Change in Control" for purposes of all Company Agreements and
all Company Employee Plans in which the term is relevant.

  

   

 50

 



    

(d)  For the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending
on January 1, 2016, the Parent shall not transfer the employment of any
Company Employee employed with the Surviving Corporation to the Parent or any
of its Affiliates (including the Subsidiaries of the Surviving Corporation)
or otherwise take action that would cause any Company Employee to have an
"employer" (as that term is used in 26 USC section 3102) other than the
Surviving Corporation.

  

(e)  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, (i) nothing herein shall be deemed to be a guarantee of
employment for any Company Employee, or to restrict the right of the
Surviving Corporation or its Affiliates to terminate the employment of any
Company Service Provider, (ii) the provisions of this Section 7.03 are solely
for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement, and no current or former
Company Employee or other Company Service Provider or other individual
associated therewith or any employee benefit plan or trustee thereof shall be
regarded for any purpose as a third party beneficiary of this Agreement, and
(iii) nothing herein shall be construed as an amendment to any employee
benefit plan for any purpose. In addition, nothing in this Agreement shall be
construed to limit the right of Parent or any of its Affiliates (including the
Surviving Corporation) to amend or terminate any employee benefit plan in
accordance with the terms thereof.

  

Section 7.04. Conduct of Parent _._ _ _ Parent and Merger Sub covenant
and agree that, between the date hereof and the earlier of the Effective Time
and the date, if any, on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
Article 10, Parent and Merger Sub shall not take any action which would have
a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

Section 8.03. Financing.

  

(a)  Parent and Merger Sub shall use their reasonable best
efforts to consummate the Debt Financing on a timely basis to facilitate the
Closing when required by Section 2.01 on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters (provided that Parent and
Merger Sub may replace or amend, supplement, modify, waive or supersede any
provision in the Debt Commitment Letters as set forth below), including their
reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Debt Commitment
Letters; (ii) negotiate and enter into

  

   

 53

 



    

definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing on the terms and
conditions contained in the Debt Commitment Letters (including after giving
effect to any "market flex" provisions contained therein) in all material
respects (the "Debt Financing Agreements"); (iii) satisfy (or obtain the
waiver of) on a timely basis (taking into account the Marketing Period) all
the conditions and covenants to obtain the Debt Financing applicable to Parent
and Merger Sub in the Debt Commitment Letters that are within their control;
and (iv) enforce their rights under the Debt Commitment Letters. Parent shall
keep the Company reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis of the
status of its efforts to arrange the Debt Financing. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub shall give the Company
notice as promptly as practicable: (x) of any material breach or default by
any party to any of the Debt Commitment Letters or the Debt Financing
Agreements, in each case of which Parent or Merger Sub obtains Knowledge, (y)
of the receipt of any written notice or other written communication, in each
case, received from any Debt Financing Source with respect to any (A) actual
or potential breach of Merger Sub's obligations under the Debt Commitment
Letters or the Debt Financing Agreements, or default or termination or
repudiation by any other party to any of the Debt Commitment Letters or the
Debt Financing Agreements or (B) material dispute between or among
any parties to any of the Debt Commitment Letters or the Debt Financing
Agreements, in each case, with respect to the obligation to fund the Debt
Financing at Closing on the terms and conditions set forth in the Debt
Financing Commitment Letters and (z) of the receipt of any written notice or
other written communication on the basis of which Parent believes in good
faith that it is reasonably likely that a party to the Debt Financing will
fail to fund the Debt Financing or is reducing the amount of the Debt
Financing and, as a result, the aggregate cash amount of the funding
commitments thereunder (after giving effect to any corresponding
increases) would be below the amount that, when combined with Parent's and
Merger Sub's other sources of funds, is sufficient to satisfy all of their
obligations under this Agreement to be satisfied on the Closing Date on the
terms contemplated hereby, including (x) the payment of the amounts payable
by Parent pursuant to Article 2 at the Closing, (y) the payment of the
Payoff Amount and (z) the payment of all related fees and expenses that are
required to be paid by Parent or Merger Sub at Closing pursuant to this
Agreement. In the event that any portion of the Debt Financing (including
after giving effect to the exercise of any "market flex" provisions) becomes
unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letters (other than as a result of (i) a breach by the Company of this
Agreement which prevents or renders impracticable the consummation of the
Debt Financing or (ii) the termination of the Debt Commitment Letters on or
prior to March 7, 2016 pursuant to the terms thereof), (A) Parent shall
notify the Company as promptly as practicable and (B) Parent and Merger Sub
shall use their reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain any such
portion from alternative sources (such alternative sources, together with the
Lenders, the "Debt Financing Sources"), on terms, taken as whole, that are no
less favorable to Merger Sub (including after giving effect to the exercise
of any "market flex" provisions) than those set forth in the Debt Commitment
Letters as in effect on the date of this Agreement.

  

In furtherance of the provisions of this Section 8.03(a), one or more Debt
Commitment Letters may be replaced or amended, restated, supplemented or
otherwise modified or superseded at the option of Parent or Merger Sub (as so
replaced or amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified or
superseded, the "New or Amended Debt Commitment Letters") to (A) add and/or
replace lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar
entities, as applicable, (B) modify pricing or implement or exercise any of
the "market

  

   

 54

 



    

flex" provisions contained in the Debt Commitment Letters, (C) reallocate
commitments or assign or reassign titles or roles to, or between or among,
any parties to the Debt Commitment Letters or (D) otherwise on terms which
would not, without the prior written consent of the Company (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) (1) impose new or
additional conditions or otherwise expand or amend or modify the conditions
precedent in a manner that would make the timely funding of the Debt
Financing or satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Debt Financing
less likely to occur, any of the conditions precedent to the Debt Financing
as set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters as in effect on the date of this
Agreement, (2) materially delay or hinder the consummation of, or prevent
Parent and Merger Sub from being able to consummate, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as and when required by Section 2.01 or (3)
reduce the aggregate cash amount of the funding commitments thereunder
below an amount that, when combined with Parent's and Merger Sub's other
sources of funds, is sufficient to satisfy all of their obligations under
this Agreement to be satisfied on the Closing Date on the terms contemplated
hereby, including (x) the payment of the amounts payable by Parent pursuant
to Article 2 at the Closing, (y) the payment of the Payoff Amount and (z) the
payment of all related fees and expenses that are required to be paid by
Parent or Merger Sub at Closing pursuant to this Agreement. Parent shall (i)
to the extent practicable, notify the Company of its intention to make any
such amendment or obtain such alternative financing and keep the Company
reasonably informed of the terms thereof and (ii) provide to the Company
final drafts of all New or Amended Debt Commitment Letters prior to their
execution (which, in the case of any amendments to or replacement fee
letters, may be redacted as set forth in the related commitment letter) as
promptly as practicable and shall provide to the Company executed copies of
the New or Amended Debt Commitment Letters promptly after their execution. In
such event, the term "Debt Commitment Letters" as used herein shall be deemed
to include the Debt Commitment Letters that are not so superseded at the time
in question and the New or Amended Debt Commitment Letters to the extent then
in effect and the term "Debt Financing" as used herein shall be deemed to
include the debt financing contemplated by any such New or Amended Debt
Commitment Letters. For purposes of this Agreement, "Marketing Period" means a
period of 15 consecutive Business Days after the date hereof following
receipt by Parent of the Required Information which is Compliant,
together with the authorization letters contemplated by Section 8.03(b)(ii),
during which no event has occurred and no conditions exist that would cause
any of the conditions set forth in Article 9 to fail to be satisfied before
the Closing (assuming the Closing were to be scheduled for any time during
such 15 Business Day period); _provided_ , _however_ , that the
"Marketing Period" shall not be deemed to have commenced if, prior to the
completion of such 15 consecutive Business Day period, (x) Parent has
received a notice from the Debt Financing Sources in accordance with the Debt
Commitment Letter that (A) the Required Information has not been delivered
and (B) specifying any additional Required Information to be provided, (y) the
Company's independent auditors have withdrawn, or advised the Company in
writing that they intend to withdraw, their audit opinion with respect to any
financial statements contained in any of the Company's filings with the SEC or
in the Required Information or (z) the Company, the Board of Directors or the
Company's independent auditors shall have determined that a restatement of
any material financial information in the Required Information is required;
_provided_ , _further_ , that (1) November 27, 2015 shall be excluded from
the determination of such 15 consecutive Business Day period and (2) such 15
consecutive Business Day period shall be completed on or prior to December
18, 2015 or, if such period has not been completed on or prior to December 18,
2015,

  

   

 55

 



    

then such period shall commence no earlier than January 4, 2016. "Compliant"
means, with respect to any Required Information, that such Required
Information (i) does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact necessary in order to made such Required

exclusive remedy against Parent, Merger Sub, any Debt Financing Source, any
Guarantor, any Equity Investor or any of their respective Affiliates and any
of their respective former, current and future direct or indirect equity
holders, controlling persons, stockholders, agents, Affiliates, members,
managers, general or limited partners, assignees or Representatives
(collectively, the "Parent Related Parties"), whether at law or equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise, shall be to terminate this Agreement in
accordance with Section 10.01 and to collect, if due, the Parent Termination
Fee and any other amounts payable pursuant to Section 11.04(e) or under the
Limited Guaranty, (ii) the payment of the Parent Termination Fee and any other
amounts payable pursuant to Section 11.04(e) shall be deemed liquidated
damages for any and all direct or indirect losses or damages of any kind,
character or description incurred or suffered by the Company or any other
Person in connection with this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents or
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, and (iii) no other Parent
Related Party shall have any further liability or obligation whatsoever
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any other Transaction
Document or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. For the
avoidance of doubt, under no circumstances shall the Company be (x) entitled
to collect the Parent Termination Fee on more than one occasion (or, after the
receipt thereof, any portion thereof or any further funds or amounts) or (y)
permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance as
contemplated by Section 11.13 and any money damages, including all or any
portion of the Parent Termination Fee. The Company further agrees that the
maximum aggregate liability of Parent, Merger Sub and all of the other Parent
Related Parties, taken as a whole, shall be limited to an amount equal to the
amount of the Parent Termination Fee, and in no event shall the Company seek
to recover, or be entitled to recover, any money damages or other losses or
damages of any kind, character or description in excess of such amount,
except as expressly permitted by Section 11.04(e) (and only to such limited
extent). In no event shall the Company seek to recover, or be entitled to
recover, monetary damages from any Parent Related Party, other than Parent and
Merger Sub under this Agreement or the Guarantors under the Limited Guaranty.
The Company hereby covenants and agrees that it shall not, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries not to, institute any proceeding or bring any other claim
arising under, or in connection with, this Agreement, the Financing
Commitment Letters, the Limited Guaranty or the negotiation, execution,
performance, abandonment or termination of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby (whether at law or in equity, under any theory
of liability (including without limitation by attempting to pierce a
corporate, limited liability company or partnership veil)) against Parent or
any Parent Related Party except for claims: (i) against Parent and/or Merger
Sub in accordance with and pursuant to the terms of this Agreement; (ii)
against the Guarantors under the Limited Guaranty, subject to the terms and
limitations thereof; (iii) against the Equity Investors for specific
performance of their respective obligations under the Equity Commitment
Letter to fund their respective commitments thereunder, subject to the terms
and limitations thereof if, and only if, the conditions of Section 11.13(a)
have been satisfied; and (iv) against Siris Capital Group, LLC under the
Confidentiality Agreement, subject

  

   

 66

 



    

to the terms and limitations thereof (the claims described in clauses (i)
through (iv) collectively, the "Retained Claims"). Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, the Company (on behalf of itself and each of its
current and future direct or indirect equity holders, controlling persons,
stockholders, agents, Affiliates, members, managers, general or limited
partners, assignees and Representatives) hereby waives any rights or claims
against any Debt Financing Source or any of its Affiliates and any of their
respective former, current and future direct or indirect equity holders,
controlling persons, stockholders, agents, Affiliates, members, managers,
general or limited partners, assignees or Representatives (collectively,
including the Debt Financing Sources, the "Debt Financing Source Related
Parties") in connection with this Agreement, the Debt Financing or the Debt
Commitment Letters, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise, and the Company (on behalf of itself and each of its current and
future direct or indirect equity holders, controlling persons, stockholders,
agents, Affiliates, members, managers, general or limited partners, assignees
and Representatives) agrees not to commence (and if commenced, agrees to
dismiss or otherwise terminate) any dispute, suit, claim, litigation,
investigation, proceeding or other action against any Debt Financing Source
Related Party in connection with this Agreement, the Debt Financing or the
Debt Commitment Letters. In furtherance and not in limitation of the
foregoing waiver, it is agreed that no Debt Financing Source Related Party
shall have any liability for any claims, losses, settlements, damages, costs,
expenses, fines or penalties to the Company (or any of its current and future
direct or indirect equity holders, controlling persons, stockholders, agents,
Affiliates, members, managers, general or limited partners, assignees and
Representatives) in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section
10.02(b) shall in any way limit or modify the rights and obligations of
Parent or Merger Sub (nor, following the Closing Date, the Company as the
Surviving Corporation) under the Debt Commitment Letters or the Debt
Financing Agreements.

Section 11.03. Amendments and Waivers.

  

(a)  Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived
prior to the Effective Time if, but only if, such amendment or waiver is in
writing and is signed, in the case of an amendment, by each party to this
Agreement or, in the case of a waiver, by each party against whom the waiver

having first been obtained. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the
foregoing, no DFS Provision may be amended or waived without the consent of
the Debt Financing Sources.

  

(b)  No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right,

and remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any
rights or remedies provided by Applicable Law.

  

Section 11.04. Expenses; Termination Fees.

    

(a)   _General_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement
shall be paid by the party incurring such cost or expense.

  

(b)   _Company Termination Fee_.

  

(i)  If this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to any
clause of Section 10.01(c)(i), then the Company shall pay to Parent (or one
or more designees of Parent) the Company Termination Fee.

  

(ii)  If (A) this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the
Company pursuant to Section 10.01(b)(iii) or by Parent pursuant to Section
10.01(c)(ii), (B) after the date hereof and prior to such termination, an
Acquisition Proposal shall have been communicated to the Chairman or Chief
Executive Officer the Company or to the Board of Directors or publicly
announced or otherwise been communicated to the Company's shareholders at or
prior to the Company Shareholder Meeting and not publicly withdrawn on an
unconditional basis, and (C) within 9 months following the date of such
termination, the Company enters into a definitive written agreement for, or
consummates, an Acquisition Proposal which, for the avoidance of doubt, need
not be with the party to such Acquisition Proposal referenced in Section
11.04(b)(ii)(B) (except that, for purposes of this clause (C), each reference
to "20%" in the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be a
reference to "50%"), then the Company shall pay to Parent (or one or more
designees of Parent) the Company Termination Fee.

  

(iii) If this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to
Section 10.01(d)(iii), then the Company shall pay the Company Termination Fee
to Parent or one or more of Parent's designees in the manner and at the time
required by Section 11.04(d)(i).

  

"Company Termination Fee" means, (i) $9,871,421 if the Company Termination
Fee is payable pursuant to Section 11.04(b)(iii) due to a termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 10.01(d)(iii) by the Company in order to enter
into a definitive Alternative Acquisition Agreement with an Excluded Party
and such Alternative Acquisition Agreement is entered into within ten Business
Days following the end of the No-Shop Period Start Time, and (ii) $19,742,842
in all other circumstances. The parties agree and acknowledge that in no
event shall the Company be required to pay the Company Termination Fee on more
than one occasion.

  

   

 69

 



    

(c)   _Parent Termination Fee_. If this Agreement is terminated
by the Company pursuant to (i) Section 10.01(d)(i) and there is no state of
facts or circumstances (other than a state of facts or circumstances caused by
a breach of Parent's or Merger Sub's representations and warranties or
covenants and other agreements hereunder) that would reasonably be expected to
cause the conditions in Section 9.01 and Section 9.02 not to be satisfied on
or prior to the End Date or (ii) Section 10.01(d)(ii), then Parent shall pay
or cause to be paid to the Company $39,485,684 (the "Parent Termination Fee").

  

(d)   _Manner of Fee Payments_. Any payment of the Company
Termination Fee, the Parent Termination Fee or any other amount due under
this Section 11.04 upon a termination of this Agreement shall be paid (i)
simultaneously with, and as a condition precedent to, such termination in the
case of a payment due pursuant to Section 11.04(b)(iii), (ii) in the case of
payments due pursuant to Section 11.04(b)(ii), promptly, and in any event
within two Business Days of, the occurrence of the applicable event described
in clause (C) thereof and (iii) in all other cases, promptly, and in any
event within two Business Days of, such termination, in each case by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to one or more accounts designated by
the recipient party.

  

(e)   _Other Costs and Expenses_. Each of the Company and
Parent acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 11.04 are
an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that,
without these agreements, the parties would not enter into this Agreement.
Accordingly, if either the Company or Parent, as the case may be, fails
promptly to pay any amount due to the other party pursuant to this Section
11.04, it shall also pay any costs and expenses incurred by such other party
in connection with a legal action to enforce this Agreement that results in a
judgment against it for such amount, together with interest on the amount of
any unpaid fee, cost or expense, from the date such fee, cost or expense was
required to be paid to (but excluding) the payment date, at the prime rate as
published in the _Wall Street Journal_ on the date that such payment was
required to be made.

  

Section 11.05. Disclosure Schedule and SEC Document References _._

  

(a)  The parties hereto agree that any reference in a
particular Section of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall only be deemed to
be an exception to (or, as applicable, a disclosure for purposes of) (i) the
representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the Company
that are contained in the corresponding Section of this Agreement and (ii) any
other representations and warranties of the Company that are contained in
this Agreement, but only if the relevance of that reference as an
exception to (or a disclosure for purposes of) such representations and
warranties would be reasonably apparent to a reasonable person who has read
that reference and such representations and warranties, without any
independent knowledge on the part of the reader regarding the matter(s) so
disclosed.

  

(b)  The parties hereto agree that any information contained in
any part of any Company SEC Document shall only be deemed to be an exception
to (or a disclosure for purposes of) the Company's representations and
warranties if the relevance of that information as an exception to (or a
disclosure for purposes of) such representations and warranties would be
reasonably apparent to a person who has read that information concurrently
with such representations and warranties, without any independent
knowledge on the part of the reader

  

   

 70

 



    

regarding the matter(s) so disclosed; _provided_ that in no event shall any
information contained in any part of any Company SEC Documents entitled "Risk
Factors" or containing any "Forward Looking Statements," or any other
statements that are predictive, cautionary or forward-looking in nature, be
deemed to be an exception to (or disclosure for purposes of) any
representations or warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement.

  

Section 11.06. Binding Effect; Benefit; Assignment.

  

(a)  The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon
and, except as provided in Section 7.02, shall inure to the benefit of the
parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. Except as provided
in Section 7.02, no provision of this Agreement is intended to confer any
rights, benefits, remedies, obligations or liabilities hereunder upon any
Person other than the parties hereto and their respective successors and
assigns. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the Parent Related Parties shall
be express third party beneficiaries with respect to Section 10.02(b),
this Section 11.06, Section 11.07, Section 11.08 and Section 11.09 and (ii)
each Debt Financing Source Related Party shall be an express third party
beneficiary with respect to Section 10.01(d)(ii), Section 10.02(b), Section
11.03, this Section 11.06, Section 11.07, Section 11.08(b) and Section 11.09
(the "DFS Provisions").

  

(b)  No party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of
its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the consent of each
other party hereto, except that Parent and Merger Sub may assign their
respective rights under this Agreement as collateral to the applicable Debt
Financing Sources in connection with the Debt Financing. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit
of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective permitted successors
and assigns. Any attempted assignment in violation of this Section 11.06
shall be null and void.

  

Section 11.07. Governing Law _._ __ Except to the extent that the laws of
the State of Georgia are mandatorily applicable to the Merger, this Agreement
shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State
of Delaware, without regard to the conflicts of law rules of such state;
_provided _ that, except as set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters, any
dispute, suit, claim, litigation, investigation, proceeding or other action
against arising out of or related to this Agreement, the Debt Commitment
Letters or the transactions contemplated hereby that involves any Debt
Financing Source Related Party shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the laws of the State of New York without regard to the
conflicts of law rules of such state.

  

Section 11.08. Jurisdiction.

  

(a)  The parties hereto agree that any suit, action or
proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any
matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement, any other
Transaction Document or any transactions contemplated hereby or thereby
(whether brought by any party or any of its Affiliates or against any party or
any of its Affiliates) shall be brought in the Delaware Court of Chancery or,
if such court shall not have jurisdiction, any federal court sitting in
Delaware, so long as one of such courts shall have subject matter
jurisdiction over such action, and that any such action arising out of this
Agreement or the other Transaction Documents shall be deemed to have arisen
from a transaction of business in the

  

   

 71

 



    

State of Delaware, and each of the parties hereby irrevocably consents to the
jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts
therefrom) in any such suit, action or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to
the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection that it may now or
hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or
proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, action or proceeding
brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.

  

(b)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Proceeding that involves
any of Debt Financing Source Related Party or the performance of services by
any Debt Financing Source Related Party with respect to the Debt Commitment
Letters shall be brought and determined in the federal court sitting in the
Borough of Manhattan, City of New York or, if that court does not have subject
matter jurisdiction, in any state court located in the City and County of New
York, and any appellate court from any thereof, each of the parties
hereby irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and of the
appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit, action or
proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by
law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the
venue of any such suit, action or proceeding in any such court or that any
such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in
an inconvenient forum.

  

(c)  Without limiting the foregoing, each party agrees that
service of process on such party as provided in Section 11.01 shall be deemed
effective service of process on such party.

  

Section 11.09. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY (INCLUDING THE DEBT FINANCING).

  

Section 11.10. Counterparts; Effectiveness _._ __ This Agreement may be
signed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with
the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same
instrument. This Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto shall
have received a counterpart hereof signed by all of the other parties hereto.
Until and unless each party has received a counterpart hereof signed by the
other party hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no party shall
have any right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral
or written agreement or other communication).

  

Section 11.11. Entire Agreement _._ __ This Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents together constitute the entire agreement between the
parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede
all prior agreements and understandings, both oral and written, between the
parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof.

  

Section 11.12. Severability _._ __ If any term, provision, covenant or
restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or
other Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the
remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be
affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance
of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any party. Upon such a determination, the

  

   

 72

 



    

parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be
consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

  

Section 11.13. Specific Performance _._ __ Subject to the remainder of this
Section 11.13, the parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur if
any provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with the
terms hereof and that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically
the performance of the terms and provisions hereof in the courts chosen in
Section 11.08, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at
law or in equity. Notwithstanding the foregoing, or anything else to the
contrary in this Agreement it is acknowledged and agreed by each party that:

    

(a)  the Company shall only be entitled to specific performance
of Parent's obligations to cause the Equity Financing to be funded and to
consummate the Merger if and only if each of the following conditions has been
satisfied: (i) all of the conditions set forth in Article 9 have been
satisfied or validly waived (other than those conditions that, by their terms,
are to be satisfied by action taken at the Closing (but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of those conditions)), (ii) the third Business Day
after the final day of the Marketing Period shall have occurred, (iii) the
Debt Financing has been funded or will be funded at the Closing if the Equity
Financing is funded at the Closing, (iv) Parent and Merger Sub fail to
complete the Closing in accordance with Section 2.01 and (v) the Company has
irrevocably confirmed to Parent in writing that if specific performance is
granted and the Equity Financing and Debt Financing are funded, then the
Closing will occur; _provided_ that, for the avoidance of doubt, in no
event shall the Company be entitled to enforce or seek to enforce
specifically Parent's obligations to cause the Equity Financing to be funded
or to complete the Merger if the Debt Financing has not been funded or will
not be funded at the Closing even if the Equity Financing is funded at the
Closing;

  

(b)  nothing in this Section 11.13 is intended to be and shall
not be construed to limit in any way the provisions of Section 10.02(b); and

  

(c)  in no event shall the exercise of the Company's right to
pursue a grant of specific performance pursuant to this Section 11.13 reduce,
restrict or otherwise limit the Company's right to terminate this Agreement
and receive payment of the Parent Termination Fee; _provided_ that under no
circumstance shall the Company be permitted or entitled to receive both a
grant of specific performance pursuant to this Section 11.13 and any payment
of the Parent Termination Fee or other amounts payable pursuant to Section
11.04.
