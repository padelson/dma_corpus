                          AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

         THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER ("Agreement") is made and entered
into as of April 29, 2001, by and among: VERTEX PHARMACEUTICALS INCORPORATED, a
Massachusetts corporation ("Parent"); AHAB ACQUISITION SUB, INC., a Delaware
corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"); and AURORA
BIOSCIENCES Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"). Certain
capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined in EXHIBIT A.

                                    RECITALS

         A. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company intend to effect a merger (the
"Merger") of Merger Sub into the Company in accordance with this Agreement and
the Delaware General Corporation Law (the "DGCL"). Upon consummation of the
Merger, Merger Sub will cease to exist, and the Company will become a wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent.

         B. It is intended that the Merger qualify as a reorganization within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the "Code"). For financial reporting purposes, it is intended that the Merger
be accounted for as a "pooling of interests."

         C. The respective boards of directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company have approved this Agreement and the Merger and Parent, acting as the
sole stockholder of Merger Sub, has approved this Agreement and the Merger.

                                    AGREEMENT

         The parties to this Agreement, intending to be legally bound, agree as
follows:

                                    ARTICLE 1

                                   THE MERGER

SECTION 1.1 MERGER OF MERGER SUB INTO THE COMPANY. Upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement and the DGCL, at the Effective Time
(as defined in Section 1.3), Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the
Company, and the separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease. Following the
Effective Time, the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation (the
"Surviving Corporation").

SECTION 1.2 EFFECT OF THE MERGER. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in
this Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time all
the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and
Merger Sub shall continue with, or vest in, as the case may be, the Surviving
Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub
shall continue to be, or become, as the case may be, the debts, liabilities and
duties of the Surviving Corporation. As of the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall be a direct subsidiary of Parent.


<PAGE>

     SECTION 1.3 CLOSING; EFFECTIVE TIME. The consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (the "Closing") shall take place at the offices
of Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky and Popeo, PC, One Financial Center,
Boston, Massachusetts, at 10:00 a.m. on a date to be designated by Parent and
the Company (the "Closing Date"), which shall be no later than the fifth
business day after the satisfaction or waiver of the last to be satisfied or
waived of the conditions set forth in Articles 6, 7 and 8 (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject
to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions). Subject to the provisions of
this Agreement, a certificate of merger satisfying the applicable requirements
of the DGCL (the "Certificate of Merger") shall be duly executed by the Company
and, simultaneously with or as soon as practicable following the Closing, filed
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the "Secretary of State").
The Merger shall become effective upon the latest of: (a) the date and time of
the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State, or (b) such
later date and time as may be specified in the Certificate of Merger with the
consent of Parent (the "Effective Time").

     SECTION 1.4 CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND BYLAWS; DIRECTORS AND
OFFICERS. : At the Effective Time:

         (a) the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall
     be amended to conform to the Certificate of Incorporation of Merger Sub as
     in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time;

         (b) the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and
     restated to conform to the bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately
     prior to the Effective Time; and

         (c) the officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time
     shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation from and after the
     Effective Time, in each case until their successors are appointed and
     qualified or until their resignation or removal. The directors of Merger
     Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the
     Surviving Corporation, in each case until their successors are elected or
     until their resignation or removal. If at the Effective Time a vacancy
     shall exist on the Board of Directors or in any office of the Surviving
     Corporation, such vacancy may thereafter be filled in the manner provided
     by applicable Legal Requirements and the bylaws of the Surviving
     Corporation.

     SECTION 1.5 CONVERSION OF SECURITIES.

         (a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
     further action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any
     stockholder of the Company:

              (i) any shares of Company Common Stock then held in the Company's
         treasury or owned by any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company shall
         be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration
         shall be delivered in exchange therefor;


                                       2
<PAGE>

              (ii) any shares of Company Common Stock then held by Parent,
         Merger Sub or any other wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent shall be
         canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration
         shall be delivered in exchange therefor;

              (iii) except as provided in clauses "(i)" and "(ii)" above and
         subject to Sections 1.5(b), 1.5(c) and 1.5(d), each share of Company
         Common Stock then outstanding shall be converted into the right to
         receive 0.62 of a share of Parent Common Stock; and

              (iv) each share of the common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of
         Merger Sub then outstanding shall be converted into one share of common
         stock of the Surviving Corporation.

The fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock specified in Section 1.5(a)(iii)
(as such fraction may be adjusted in accordance with Section 1.5(b)) is referred
to as the "Exchange Ratio."

         (b) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the
     outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock are
     changed into a different number or class of shares by reason of any stock
     split, stock dividend, reverse stock split, reclassification,
     recapitalization or other similar transaction, then the Exchange Ratio
     shall be appropriately adjusted.

         (c) To the extent any shares of Company Common Stock outstanding
     immediately prior to the Effective Time are unvested or are subject to a
     repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition under any
     applicable restricted stock purchase agreement or other agreement with the
     Company or under which the Company has any rights, then the shares of
     Parent Common Stock issued in exchange for such shares of Company Common
     Stock will also be unvested and subject to the same repurchase option, risk
     of forfeiture or other condition, and the certificates representing such
     shares of Parent Common Stock may accordingly be marked with appropriate
     legends.

         (d) No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in
     connection with the Merger, and no certificates or scrip for any such
     fractional shares shall be issued. Any holder of Company Common Stock who
     would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent
     Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common
     Stock issuable to such holder) shall, in lieu of such fraction of a share
     and, upon surrender of such holder's Company Stock Certificate(s) (as
     defined in Section 1.6), be paid in cash the dollar amount (rounded to the
     nearest whole cent), without interest, determined by multiplying such
     fraction by the closing price of a share of Parent Common Stock on The
     Nasdaq Stock Market on the date the Effective Time occurs.

     SECTION 1.6 CLOSING OF THE COMPANY'S TRANSFER BOOKS. At the Effective Time:
(a) all shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to
exist, and all holders of certificates representing shares of Company Common
Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease
to have any rights as stockholders of the Company (other than the right to
receive shares of Parent Common Stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares as
set forth



                                       3
<PAGE>


in Section 1.5); and (b) the stock transfer books of the Company shall
be closed with respect to all shares of Company Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. No further transfer of any such shares
of Company Common Stock shall be made on such stock transfer books after the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, a valid certificate previously
representing any shares of Company Common Stock (a "Company Stock Certificate")
is presented to the Exchange Agent (as defined in Section 1.7) or to the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, such Company Stock Certificate shall be
canceled and shall be exchanged as provided in Section 1.7.

     SECTION 1.7 EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES.

         (a) On or prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall select a reputable
     bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as
     exchange agent in the Merger (the "Exchange Agent"). Promptly (but in any
     event within five (5) business days) after the Effective Time, Parent shall
     deposit with the Exchange Agent (i) certificates representing the shares of
     Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to this Article 1, and (ii) cash
     sufficient to make payments in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with
     Section 1.5(d). The shares of Parent Common Stock and cash amounts so
     deposited with the Exchange Agent, together with any dividends or
     distributions received by the Exchange Agent with respect to such shares,
     are referred to collectively as the "Exchange Fund."

         (b) As soon as reasonably practicable (but in any event within five (5)
     business days) after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange
     Agent to mail to the record holders of Company Stock Certificates (i) a
     letter of transmittal in customary form and containing such provisions as
     Parent may reasonably specify (including a provision confirming that
     delivery of Company Stock Certificates shall be effected, and risk of loss
     and title to Company Stock Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of
     such Company Stock Certificates to the Exchange Agent), and (ii)
     instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Company Stock
     Certificates in exchange for certificates representing Parent Common Stock.
     Upon surrender of a Company Stock Certificate to the Exchange Agent for
     exchange, together with a duly executed letter of transmittal and such
     other documents as may be reasonably required by the Exchange Agent or
     Parent, (1) the holder of such Company Stock Certificate shall be entitled
     to receive in exchange therefor a certificate representing the number of
     whole shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder has the right to
     receive pursuant to the provisions of Section 1.5 (and cash in lieu of any
     fractional share of Parent Common Stock), and (2) the Company Stock
     Certificate so surrendered shall be canceled. Until surrendered as
     contemplated by this Section 1.7, each Company Stock Certificate shall be
     deemed, from and after the Effective Time, to represent only the right to
     receive shares of Parent Common Stock (and cash in lieu of any fractional
     share of Parent Common Stock) as contemplated by Section 1.5. If any
     Company Stock Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent
     may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance of any
     certificate representing Parent Common Stock, require the owner of such
     lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock Certificate to provide an
     appropriate affidavit and to deliver a bond (in such sum as Parent may
     reasonably direct) as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
     the Exchange Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation with respect to
     such Company Stock Certificate.

         (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
     Agreement, no shares of Parent Common Stock (or certificates therefor)
     shall be issued in exchange for any Company Stock Certificate to any Person
     who may be an "affiliate" (as that term is used in Rule 145 under the
     Securities Act) of the Company until such Person shall have delivered to
     Parent and the Company a duly executed Affiliate Agreement as contemplated
     by Section 5.10.

         (d) No dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect
     to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be
     paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Company Stock Certificate with
     respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder has the right
     to receive in the Merger until such holder surrenders such Company Stock
     Certificate in accordance with this Section 1.7 (at which time such holder
     shall be entitled, subject to the effect of applicable escheat or similar
     laws, to receive all such dividends and distributions, without interest).

         (e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to
     holders of Company Stock Certificates as of the date 180 days after the
     date on which the Merger becomes effective shall be delivered to Parent
     upon demand, and any holders of Company Stock Certificates who have not
     theretofore surrendered their Company Stock Certificates in accordance with
     this Section 1.7 shall thereafter look only to Parent for satisfaction of
     their claims for Parent Common Stock, cash in lieu of fractional shares of
     Parent Common Stock and any dividends or distributions with respect to
     Parent Common Stock.

         (f) Each of the Exchange Agent, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
     shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable or
     otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former
     holder of Company Common Stock such amounts as may be required to be
     deducted or withheld therefrom under the Code or any provision of state,
     local or foreign tax law or under any other applicable Legal Requirement.
     To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall
     be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the
     Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

         (g) Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any
     holder or former holder of Company Common Stock or to any other Person with
     respect to any shares of Parent Common Stock (or dividends or distributions
     with respect thereto), or for any cash amounts, delivered to any public
     official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property law, escheat law or
     similar Legal Requirement.

     SECTION 1.8 TAX CONSEQUENCES. For federal income tax purposes, the Merger
is intended to constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of
the Code. The parties to this Agreement hereby adopt this Agreement as a "plan
of reorganization" within the meaning of Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a) of
the United States Treasury Regulations and agree to take whatever other steps
are necessary to give effect to the Merger on such a basis.

     SECTION 1.9 ACCOUNTING CONSEQUENCES. For financial reporting purposes, the
Merger is intended to be accounted for as a "pooling of interests."

     SECTION 1.10 FURTHER ACTION. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any
further action is determined by Parent to be necessary or desirable to carry out
the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full
right, title and possession of and to all rights and property of Merger Sub and
the Company, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation and Parent
shall be fully authorized (in the name of Merger Sub, in the name of the Company
and otherwise) to take such action.

     contribution to any other Entity. None of the Acquired Corporations has, at
     any time, been a general partner of any general partnership, limited
     partnership or other Entity.

         (b) Each of the Acquired Corporations is a corporation duly organized,
     validly existing and in good standing (in jurisdictions that recognize such

     use its assets in the manner in which its assets are currently owned and

     a foreign corporation, and is in good standing (in jurisdictions that
     recognize such concept), under the laws of all jurisdictions where the
     nature of its business requires such qualification except where the failure

     the Acquired Corporations.

     SECTION 2.2 CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND BYLAWS. The Company has made
available to Parent accurate and complete copies of the certificate of
incorporation, bylaws and other charter and organizational documents of the

enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject to (i)
laws of general application relating to bankruptcy, insolvency and the relief of
debtors, and (ii) rules of law governing specific performance, injunctive relief
and other equitable remedies. No state takeover statute or similar statute or
regulation applies or purports to apply to the Merger, this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated hereby. Except for the dividend of rights to

<PAGE>

uses to which they are being put, are in good and safe condition and repair
(ordinary wear and tear excepted) and are adequate for the conduct of the
business of the Acquired Corporations in the manner in which such business is
currently being conducted. None of the Acquired Corporations own any real

whether as lessor or lessee, other than the leases (the "Leases") described in
Part 2.10 of the Company Disclosure Schedule. Part 2.10 of the Company

obligations contained therein. The Company has made available to Parent a true
and complete copy of each Lease and all amendments thereto.

     SECTION 2.11 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.

         (a) Part 2.11(a)(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth, with
     respect to all Intellectual Property owned by the Acquired Corporations and
     registered with any Governmental Authority or for which an application has
     been filed with any Governmental Authority, (i) the registration or
     application number and the date filed, the title, if applicable, of the
     registration or application, and (ii) the names of the jurisdictions
     covered by the applicable registration or application. Part 2.11(a)(ii) of
     the Company Disclosure Schedule identifies and provides a brief description
     of all other Intellectual Property owned by the Acquired Corporations as of
     the date hereof that is material to the business of the Acquired
     Corporations. Part 2.11(a)(iii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule
     identifies each Contract currently in effect containing any ongoing royalty
     or payment obligations in excess of $50,000 per annum with respect to,
     Intellectual Property that is licensed or otherwise made available to the
     Acquired Corporations by any Person or is material to the business of the
     Acquired Corporations (except for any Intellectual Property that is
     licensed to the Acquired Corporations under any third party software
     license generally available to the public). The Acquired Corporations have
     good and valid title to all of the Acquired Corporation Intellectual
     Property identified in Parts 2.11(a)(i) and 2.11(a)(ii) of the Company
     Disclosure Schedule, free and clear of all Encumbrances, except for
     Permitted Encumbrances. To the Company's knowledge, the Acquired
     Corporations have a valid right to use, license and otherwise exploit all
     Intellectual Property identified in Part 2.11(a)(iii) of the Company
     Disclosure Schedule. Except as set forth in Part 2.11(a)(iv) of the Company
     Disclosure Schedule, none of the Acquired Corporations has developed
     jointly with any other Person any Acquired Corporation Intellectual
     Property that is material to the business of the Acquired Corporations with
     respect to which such other Person has any rights. Except as set forth in
     Part 2.11(a)(v) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, there is no Acquired
     Corporation Contract (with the exception of end user license agreements in
     the form previously made available to Parent) pursuant to which any Person
     has any right (whether or not currently exercisable) to use, license or
     otherwise exploit any Acquired Corporation Intellectual Property that is
     material to any of the Acquired Corporations.

         (b) The Acquired Corporations have taken reasonable measures and
     precautions to protect and maintain the confidentiality, secrecy and value
     of all material Acquired Corporation



                                       14
<PAGE>

     Intellectual Property (except Acquired Corporation Intellectual Property
     whose value would be unimpaired by disclosure). Without limiting the
     generality of the foregoing, except as set forth in Part 2.11(b) of the
     Company Disclosure Schedule, (i) all current and former employees of the
     Acquired Corporations who are or were involved in, or who have contributed
     to, the creation or development of any material Acquired Corporation
     Intellectual Property have executed and delivered to the Acquired
     Corporations an agreement (containing no exceptions to or exclusions from
     the scope of its coverage with respect to the assignment of Intellectual
     Property other than inventions conceived of or reduced to practice prior to
     such person's employment with the Company) that is similar in scope to the
     form of Proprietary Information and Inventions Agreement previously made
     available to Parent, and (ii) all current and former consultants and
     independent contractors to the Acquired Corporations who are or were
     involved in, or who have contributed to, the creation or development of any
     material Acquired Corporation Intellectual Property have executed and
     delivered to the Company an agreement (containing no exceptions to or
     exclusions from the scope of its coverage with respect to the assignment of
     Intellectual Property other than inventions conceived of or reduced to
     practice prior to such person's providing services to the Company) that
     contains terms substantially similar to those in the form of Proprietary
     Information and Inventions Agreement previously made available to Parent.
     No current or former employee, officer, director, stockholder, consultant
     or independent contractor has any right, claim or interest in or with
     respect to any Acquired Corporation Intellectual Property. All Proprietary
     Information and Inventions Agreements signed by current and former
     employees, consultants and independent contractors remain in full force and
     effect and have not been superceded by any subsequent agreements.

         (c) To the knowledge of the Company and except as described on Part
     2.11(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule: (i) all patents, trademarks,
     service marks and copyrights held by any of the Acquired Corporations are
     valid, enforceable and subsisting; (ii) none of the Acquired Corporation
     Intellectual Property and no Intellectual Property that is currently being
     developed by any of the Acquired Corporations (either by itself or with any
     other Person) infringes, misappropriates or conflicts with any Intellectual
     Property owned or used by any other Person; (iii) none of the products that
     are or have been designed, created, developed, assembled, manufactured or
     sold by any of the Acquired Corporations is infringing, misappropriating or
     making any unlawful or unauthorized use of any Intellectual Property owned
     or used by any other Person, and none of the Acquired Corporations has
     received any notice or other communication (in writing or otherwise) of any
     actual or alleged infringement, misappropriation or unlawful or
     unauthorized use of, any Intellectual Property owned or used by any other
     Person; (iv) no other Person is infringing, misappropriating or making any
     unlawful or unauthorized use of, and no Intellectual Property owned or used
     by any other Person infringes or conflicts with, any material Acquired
     Corporation Intellectual Property.

         (d) The Acquired Corporation Intellectual Property constitutes all the
     Intellectual Property necessary to enable the Acquired Corporations to
     conduct their business in the manner in which such business is being
     conducted. Except as described on Part 2.11(d) of the Company Disclosure
     Schedule, none of the Acquired Corporations has (i) licensed any of the
     material Acquired Corporation Intellectual Property to any Person on an
     exclusive basis, or (ii) entered into any covenant not to compete or
     Contract (other than non-exclusive license agreements) limiting its ability
     to exploit fully any material Acquired Corporation Intellectual Property or
     to transact business in any market or geographical area or with any Person.

         (e) Except as set forth in Part 2.11(e) of the Company Disclosure
     Schedule, none of the Acquired Corporations has disclosed or delivered to
     any Person, or permitted the disclosure or delivery to any escrow agent or
     other Person, of any Acquired Corporation Source Code. No event has
     occurred, and no circumstance or condition exists, that (with or without
     notice or lapse of time) would reasonably be expected to, result in the
     disclosure or delivery to any Person of any Acquired Corporation Source
     Code. Part 2.11(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedule identifies each
     Contract currently in effect pursuant to which the Company has deposited or
     is required to deposit with an escrowholder or any other Person of any
     Acquired Corporation Source Code, and further describes whether the
     execution of this Agreement or the consummation of any of the transactions
     contemplated hereby would reasonably be expected to result in the release
     or disclosure of any Acquired Corporation Source Code.

     the applicable due date (including any extensions of such due date), and
     (ii) has been, or will be when filed, prepared in all material respects in
     compliance with all applicable Legal Requirements. All amounts shown on the
     Acquired Corporation Returns to be due on or before the Closing Date have
     been or will be paid on or before the Closing Date.

         (b) Except as disclosed in Part 2.18(b) of the Company Disclosure
     Schedule, the Company Balance Sheet fully accrues all actual and contingent
     liabilities for Taxes with respect to all periods through December 31, 2000
     in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Each Acquired
     Corporation will establish, in the ordinary course of business and
     consistent with its past practices, reserves adequate for the payment of
     all Taxes for the period from December 31, 2000 through the Closing Date.

         (c) Except as set forth in Part 2.18(c) of the Company Disclosure
     Schedule, (i) no Acquired Corporation Return has ever been examined or
     audited by any Governmental Authority, and (ii) no extension or waiver of
     the limitation period applicable to any of the Acquired Corporation Returns
     has been granted (by the Company or any other Person), and no such
     extension or waiver has been requested from any Acquired Corporation.

         (d) No claim or Legal Proceeding is pending or, to the best of the
     knowledge of the Company, has been threatened against or with respect to
     any Acquired Corporation in respect of any material Tax. There are no
     unsatisfied liabilities for material Taxes (including liabilities for
     interest, additions to tax and penalties thereon and related expenses) with
     respect to any notice of deficiency or similar document received by any
     Acquired Corporation with respect to any material Tax (other than
     liabilities for Taxes asserted under any such notice of deficiency or
     similar document which are being contested in good faith by the Acquired
     Corporations and with respect to which adequate reserves for payment have
     been established on the Company Balance Sheet). There are no liens for
     material Taxes upon any of the assets of any of the Acquired Corporations
     except liens for current Taxes not yet due and payable. None of the
     Acquired Corporations has entered into or become bound by any agreement or
     consent pursuant to Section 341(f) of the Code (or any comparable provision
     of state or foreign Tax laws). None of the Acquired Corporations has been,
     and none of the Acquired Corporations will be, required to include any
     adjustment in taxable income for any tax period (or portion thereof)
     pursuant to Section 481 or 263A of the Code (or any comparable provision
     under state or foreign Tax laws) as a result of transactions or events
     occurring, or accounting methods employed, prior to the Closing.

         (e) Except as set forth in Part 2.18(e) of the Company Disclosure
     Schedule, none of the Acquired Corporations is a party to any agreement,
     plan, arrangement or other Contract covering any employee or independent
     contractor or former employee or independent contractor of any of the
     Acquired Corporations that, considered individually or considered
     collectively with any other such Contracts, would reasonably be expected
     to, give rise directly or indirectly to the payment of any amount that
     would not be deductible pursuant to Section 280G or Section 162(m) the Code
     (or any comparable provision of state or foreign Tax laws). None of the
     Acquired Corporations is, or has ever been, a party to or bound by any tax
     indemnity agreement, tax sharing agreement, tax allocation agreement or
     similar Contract.

         (f) Neither Company nor any of its affiliates has taken, failed to take
     or agreed to take any action or knows of any fact, circumstance, plan or
     intention that is or would be reasonably likely to prevent the Merger from
     qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
     the Code.

     SECTION 2.19 EMPLOYEE AND LABOR MATTERS; BENEFIT PLANS.

         (a) Part 2.19(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule identifies each
     salary, bonus, vacation, deferred compensation, incentive compensation,
     stock purchase, stock option, severance pay, termination pay, death and
     disability benefits, hospitalization, medical, life or other insurance,
     flexible benefits, supplemental unemployment benefits, profit-sharing,
     pension or retirement plan, program or agreement and each other employee
     benefit plan or arrangement sponsored, maintained, contributed to or

                                       21
<PAGE>

     Corporations for the benefit of any current or former employee of any of
     the Acquired Corporations (collectively, the "Plans"). Part 2.19(a) of the
     Company Disclosure Schedule also identifies (i) each Legal Requirement
     pursuant to which any of the Acquired Corporations is required to establish
     any reserve or make any contribution for the benefit of any current or
     former employee located in any foreign jurisdiction and (ii) any change of
     control provision in any agreement or arrangement between an employee,
     director or consultant of any of the Acquired Corporations and any of the
     Acquired Corporations. Except as disclosed in Part 2.19(a) of the Company
     Disclosure Schedule, none of the Acquired Corporations has any outstanding
     payment or other obligation pursuant to any severance agreement, separation
     agreement, or other agreement to settle or compromise any legal claim or
     right, regardless of whether any Legal Proceeding to enforce any such claim
     or right has been threatened or commenced.

         (b) Except as set forth in Part 2.19(b) of the Company Disclosure
     Schedule, none of the Acquired Corporations maintains, sponsors or

     benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(2) of the Employee Retirement Income
     Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), or any similar pension benefit
     plan under the laws of any foreign jurisdiction, whether or not excluded
     from coverage under specific Titles or Subtitles of ERISA for the benefit
     of employees or former employees of any of the Acquired Corporations (a
     "Pension Plan").

         (c) Except as set forth in Part 2.19(c) of the Company Disclosure
     Schedule, none of the Acquired Corporations maintains, sponsors or
     contributes to any employee welfare benefit plan (as defined in Section
     3(1) of ERISA or any similar welfare benefit plan under the laws of any
     foreign jurisdiction, whether or not excluded from coverage under specific
     Titles or Subtitles of ERISA), for the benefit of any current or former
     employees or directors of any of the Acquired Corporations (a "Welfare
     Plan"). No Welfare Plan is a self-insured Welfare Plan or a "multiple
     employer welfare arrangement" as such term is defined in Section 3(40) of
     ERISA.

         (d) With respect to each Plan, the Company has made available to
     Parent: (i) an accurate and complete copy of such Plan (including all
     amendments thereto); (ii) an accurate and complete copy of the annual
     report (along with all schedules and attachments), if required under ERISA,
     with respect to such Plan for the last three (3) years; (iii) an accurate

     third party funding vehicle, an accurate and complete copy of the trust or
     other funding agreement (including all amendments thereto) and accurate and
     complete copies of the most recent financial statements thereof; (v)
     accurate and complete copies of all Contracts relating to such Plan,
     including service provider agreements, insurance contracts, minimum premium
     contracts, stop-loss agreements, investment management agreements,
     subscription and participation agreements and record keeping agreements;
     (vi) an accurate and complete copy of the most recent determination letter
     received from the Internal Revenue Service with respect to such Plan (if
     such Plan is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code);
     and (vii) a copy of the nondiscrimination testing completed with respect to
     each plan for the last three (3) years, if applicable



                                       22
<PAGE>

         (e) None of the Acquired Corporations is or has ever been required to
     be treated as a single employer with any other Person under Section
     4001(b)(1) of ERISA or Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code, except
     for the Acquired Corporations. None of the Acquired Corporations has ever
     been a member of an "affiliated service group" within the meaning of
     Section 414(m) of the Code. None of the Acquired Corporations has ever
     maintained, participated in or contributed to a multiemployer plan (within
     the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA). None of the Acquired Corporations
     has ever made a complete or partial withdrawal from a multiemployer plan,
     as such term is defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA, resulting in "withdrawal
     liability," as such term is defined in Section 4201 of ERISA (without
     regard to subsequent reduction or waiver of such liability under either
     Section 4207 or 4208 of ERISA). None of the Acquired Corporations has ever
     sponsored, maintained or contributed to an employee pension benefit plan as
     defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA or which is subject to Title IV of ERISA
     or Section 412 of the Code.

         (f) None of the Acquired Corporations has any plan or commitment to
     create any Welfare Plan or any Pension Plan, or to modify or change any
     existing Welfare Plan or Pension Plan (other than to comply with applicable
     Legal Requirements).

         (g) No Plan provides death, medical or health benefits (whether or not
     insured) with respect to any current or former employee or director of any
     of the Acquired Corporations after any termination of service of such
     employee or director (other than benefit coverage mandated by applicable
     Legal Requirements, including coverage provided pursuant to Section 4980B
     of the Code).

         (h) With respect to any Plan constituting a group health plan within
     the meaning of Section 4980B(g)(2) of the Code, the provisions of Section
     4980B of the Code ("COBRA") have been complied with in all material
     respects. Any such Plan is in compliance with the requirements of the
     Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. Part 2.19(h)
     of the Company Disclosure Schedule describes all obligations of the
     Acquired Corporations as of the date of this Agreement under any of the
     provisions of COBRA.

         (i) Each of the Plans has been operated and administered in all
     material respects in accordance with its terms and with applicable Legal
     Requirements, including ERISA, the Code and applicable foreign Legal
     Requirements, and all required governmental filings and participant reports
     or disclosures have been made on a timely basis.

         (j) Each of the Plans intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of
     the Code has received a favorable determination letter from the Internal
     Revenue Service, covering changes mandated by TRA '86. Each trust
     maintained with respect to each Plan is exempt from taxation under Section
     501(a) of the Code. No act or omission has occurred that would adversely
     affect such qualified or tax exempt status. There have been no "prohibited
     transactions" within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of
     the Code involving any of the Plans. There are no pending, or to the
     knowledge of the Company threatened or anticipated claims, litigation,
     administrative actions or proceedings against or otherwise involving any of
     the Plans or related trusts, or any fiduciary thereof, by any governmental
     agency, or by any employee, former employee, retiree, participant or
     beneficiary covered under any of the Plans, or otherwise involving the
     Plans (other than routine claims for benefits). There is no judgment,
     decree,



                                       23
<PAGE>

     injunction, rule or order of any court, governmental body, commission,
     agency or arbitrator outstanding against or in favor of any Plan or any
     fiduciary thereof in that capacity.

         (k) Part 2.19(k) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth all
     bonus, golden parachute, severance or other payments or obligations to any
     current or former employee or director of any of the Acquired Corporations
     (whether or not under any Plan, written or oral) which will become payable
     or will be materially increased, or which such payment or vesting of such
     benefit will be accelerated, as a direct or indirect result of the
     execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement, or the consummation
     of the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this
     Agreement, irrespective of whether such material increase or acceleration
     of vesting or time of payment is directly or indirectly related to a
     "change in control" (as defined in any applicable Plan, arrangement or
     agreement) or a voluntary or involuntary termination of employment within a
     certain period of time either before or after such "change in control" (as
     defined in the applicable Plan, arrangement or agreement). Without limiting
     the generality of the foregoing, except as set forth in Part 2.19(k) of the
     Company Disclosure Schedule, there is no stock option, restricted stock or
     other type of agreement pursuant to which such individual shall be entitled
     to actual or potential acceleration of vesting or lapsing of restrictions
     as a result, either directly or indirectly, of the consummation of the
     Merger, or the consummation of any other transactions contemplated by this
     Agreement, including, but not limited to, any Company Options or options or
     stock grants which were granted by PanVera Corporation or Quorum Sciences,
     Inc. without regard to whether such options have been converted into
     Company Options or other options or awards in the Common Stock or any other
     class of stock of Parent.

         (l) Part 2.19(l)(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule contains a list
     of all salaried employees of each of the Acquired Corporations as of the
     date of this Agreement, and correctly reflects, in all material respects,
     their salaries, any other compensation payable to them (including
     compensation payable pursuant to bonus, deferred compensation or commission
     arrangements), their dates and terms of employment, their positions and any
     notice, payment, bonus, accelerated vesting of Company Options, or other
     form of remuneration (exclusive of accrued vacation pay) to which each such
     employee may be entitled upon termination of his or her employment. None of
     the Acquired Corporations is a party to any collective bargaining contract
     or other Contract with a labor union involving any of its employees. Except
     as set forth on Part 2.19(l)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, all
     employees of the Acquired Corporations are "at will" employees. The
     standard offer letters used by the Acquired Corporations are substantially
     identical in form to those previously made available to Parent.

         (m) Part 2.19(m) of the Company Disclosure Schedule identifies each
     employee of any of the Acquired Corporations who is not fully available to
     perform work because of disability or other leave and sets forth the basis
     of such disability or leave and the anticipated date of return to full
     service.

         (n) Each of the Acquired Corporations is in compliance in all material
     respects with all applicable Legal Requirements and Contracts relating to
     employment, employment practices, wages, bonuses and terms and conditions
     of employment, including employee compensation matters.



                                       24
<PAGE>

         (o) Each of the Acquired Corporations has good labor relations, and the
     Company has no knowledge of any facts indicating that (i) the consummation
     of the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this
     Agreement will have a Material Adverse Effect on the labor relations of any
     of the Acquired Corporations, or (ii) any of the employees of any of the
     Acquired Corporations intends to terminate his or her employment with the
     Acquired Corporation with which such employee is employed.

         (p) None of the Acquired Corporations has entered into any Contracts
     with any labor union or employee association or made any commitments, to or
     conducted negotiations with, any labor union or employee association with

     any current attempts to organize or establish labor union or employee
     association with respect to any employees of the Acquired Corporations.

         (q) During the last five (5) years, there has not occurred nor been
     threatened any labor strike, dispute, slowdown, work stoppage, picketing,
     concerted refusal to work regular or overtime hours or similar labor
     activity with respect to any employees of the Acquired Corporations.

     SECTION 2.20 ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS. Except as disclosed in Part 2.20 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, each of the Acquired Corporations is in compliance
in all material respects with all applicable Environmental Laws, which
compliance includes, among other things, the possession by each of the Acquired
Corporations of all permits, approvals, and other Governmental Authorizations
required under applicable Environmental Laws, and compliance with the terms and
conditions thereof, except for incidents of noncompliance which, taken in the
aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, a Material
Adverse Effect on the Acquired Corporations. No prior authorization of any
Governmental Authority is required in order to maintain the effectiveness of any
material permit, approval or other Governmental Authorization beyond the
Effective Time. Except as set forth in Part 2.20 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, none of the Acquired Corporations has received any notice or other
communication (in writing or otherwise), whether from a Governmental Authority,
citizens group, employee or otherwise, that alleges liability, potential
liability, or noncompliance of the Acquired Corporations with any Environmental
Law; nor is the Company aware of any facts, circumstances, conditions, or
occurrences regarding the Acquired Corporations' operations or any property
owned, leased, managed, or operated by the Acquired Corporations that would
reasonably be expected to result in such a notice, communication or allegation.
To the knowledge of the Company, except as disclosed in Part 2.20 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, all property that is owned, leased, managed or operated by
the Acquired Corporations, and all surface water, groundwater and soil
associated with or adjacent to such property, is free of any Material
Environmental Concern. To the knowledge of the Company, none of the property
owned, leased, managed or operated by any of the Acquired Corporations contains
any underground storage tanks, asbestos, equipment using PCBs or underground
injection wells. To the knowledge of the Company, none of the property owned,
leased, managed or operated by any of the Acquired Corporations contains any
septic tanks into which process wastewater or any Materials of Environmental
Concern have been released, spilled, or discharged. No Acquired Corporation has
ever sent or transported, or arranged to send or transport, any Materials of
Environmental Concern to a site that, pursuant to any applicable Environmental
Law (i) has been placed on the "National Priorities List" of hazardous waste
sites or any similar state list, (ii) is



                                       25

closure or other environmental remedial activity, or (iii) is subject to a Legal
Requirement to take "removal" or "remedial" action as detailed in any applicable
Environmental Law or to make payment for the cost of cleaning up the site. (For
purposes of this Section 2.20: (i) "Environmental Law" means any federal, state,
local or foreign Legal Requirement relating to pollution or protection of human
health, safety, or the environment (including, among others, ambient air,
surface water, ground water, land surface or subsurface strata), including any
Legal Requirement relating to emissions, discharges, releases (including, but
not limited to, any dumping, spilling, leaking, leaching, escaping, migrating,

use, treatment, storage, disposal, transport or handling of Materials of
Environmental Concern; and (ii) "Materials of Environmental Concern" include
chemicals, pollutants, contaminants, wastes, toxic substances, radioactive
substances, petroleum and petroleum products and any other substance that is
regulated by any Environmental Law.

     SECTION 2.21 INSURANCE. The Company has made available to Parent a copy of
all material insurance policies and all material self insurance programs and
arrangements relating to the business, assets and operations of the Acquired
Corporations. Part 2.21 of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists each such
insurance policy, program and arrangement and sets out a description of all
claims made (whether pending or satisfied) thereunder since January 1, 1996.
Each of such insurance policies is in full force and effect. None of the
Acquired Corporations has received any notice or other communication regarding
any actual or possible (a) cancellation or invalidation of any insurance policy,
(b) refusal of any coverage or rejection of any material claim under any
insurance policy, or (c) material adjustment in the amount of the premiums
payable with respect to any insurance policy. Except as set forth in Part 2.21
of the Company Disclosure Schedule, there is no pending workers' compensation or
other claim under or based upon any insurance policy of any of the Acquired

Company pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC. Part 2.22

     Company, no Person has threatened to commence any Legal Proceeding: (i)
     that involves any of the Acquired Corporations or any of the assets owned
     or used by any of the Acquired Corporations; or (ii) that challenges, or
     that may have the effect of preventing, delaying, making illegal or
     otherwise interfering with, the Merger or any of the other transactions
     contemplated by this Agreement. Except as disclosed in Part 2.23 of the
     Company Disclosure Schedule, to the knowledge of the Company, no event has
     occurred, and no claim, dispute or other condition or circumstance exists,
     that would reasonably



                                       26
<PAGE>

     be expected to, give rise to or serve as a basis for the commencement of
     any such Legal Proceeding.

         (b) There is no material order, writ, injunction, judgment or decree to
     which any of the Acquired Corporations, or any of the assets owned or used
     by any of the Acquired Corporations, is subject. To the knowledge of the
     Company, no officer or key employee of any of the Acquired Corporations is

     such officer or other employee from engaging in or continuing any conduct,
     activity or practice relating to the business of any of the Acquired
     Corporations.

     SECTION 2.24 NO EXISTING DISCUSSIONS. Except as set forth in Part 2.24 of

the Company, neither the Company nor any "affiliate" (as that term is used in

accounting for the Merger as a "pooling of interests."

     SECTION 2.26 VOTE REQUIRED. The affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority of the shares of Company Common Stock outstanding on the record date

and at all times on or prior to the Effective Time, the board of directors of
the Company has taken and will take all actions so that the restrictions
applicable to business combinations contained in Section 203 of the DGCL are,
and will be, inapplicable to the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement and to the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. No state takeover statute or similar Legal
Requirement applies or purports to apply to the Merger, this Agreement or any of
the other transactions contemplated hereby.

     SECTION 2.28 FAIRNESS OPINION. The Company's board of directors has
received the written opinion of Goldman, Sachs & Co., financial advisor to the
Company, dated the date of this Agreement, to the effect that the Exchange Ratio
is fair from a financial point of view to the stockholders of the Company. The

     submitted to the Company or a Representative of the Company by such Person
     (and not withdrawn) if (1) neither the Company nor any Representative
     acting on behalf of any of the Acquired Corporations shall have violated
     any of the restrictions set forth in this Section 4.4, (2) the board of
     directors of the Company concludes in good faith, after consultation with
     its outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would create a
     substantial risk of liability for breach of its fiduciary duties to the
     Company's stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements, and (3) at
     least two (2) business days prior to having such discussions with, such
     Person, the Company gives Parent written notice of the identity of such
     Person and of the Company's intention to furnish nonpublic information to,
     or enter into discussions with, such Person, and the Company receives from
     such Person an executed confidentiality agreement containing customary
     limitations on the use and disclosure of all nonpublic written and oral
     information furnished to such Person by or on behalf of the Company and
     containing reasonable "standstill" provisions which continue for a term of
     no less than one (1) year, provided further that this Section 4.4(a) shall
     not prohibit the Company's board of directors from complying with Rules
     14d-9 and 14e-2 under the Exchange Act or making any disclosure to the
     Company's stockholders that is required by applicable Legal Requirements.
     Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company acknowledges
     and



                                       43
<PAGE>

     agrees that any violation of or the taking of any action inconsistent
     with any of the restrictions set forth in the preceding sentence by any
     Representative acting on behalf of any of the Acquired Corporations, shall
     be deemed to constitute a breach of this Section 4.4 by the Company for all
     purposes of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
     contained in this Section 4.4(a), at any time after the date hereof, the
     Company may file with the SEC (i) a report on Form 8-K with respect to this
     Agreement and may file a copy of this Agreement and any related agreements
     as exhibits thereto, and (ii) all materials and documents that the Company
     is required to file under Regulation M-A.

         (b) The Company shall promptly (and in no event later than two (2)
     business days after receipt by any officer or director of the Company or by
     any employee of the Company's financial advisors of any Acquisition
     Proposal, any inquiry or indication of interest that could lead to an
     Acquisition Proposal or any request for nonpublic information) advise
     Parent in writing of any Acquisition Proposal, any inquiry or indication of
     interest that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition
     Proposal (which shall include any Acquisition Proposal received prior to
     the date hereof) or any request for nonpublic information relating to any
     of the Acquired Corporations by a Person who would reasonably be expected
     to submit an Acquisition Proposal (including the identity of the Person
     making or submitting such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, indication of
     interest or request, and the terms thereof) that is made or submitted by
     any Person during the Pre-Closing Period. The Company shall keep Parent
     informed with respect to the status of any Acquisition Proposal, inquiry,
     indication of interest or request and any modification or proposed
     modification thereto. Nothing contained in this Section 4.4(b) shall
     prevent any party hereto from taking a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9
     and Rule 14e-2 of the Exchange Act.

         (c) The Company shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
     existing discussions or negotiations with any Person (other than Parent
     and/or Merger Sub) that relate to any Acquisition Proposal.

         (d) The Company has not, within the prior twelve months, released or
     permitted the release, and agrees not to release or permit the release of
     any Person from, or to waive or permit the waiver of any provision of, any
     confidentiality, "standstill" or similar agreement to which any of the
     Acquired Corporations is a party, and will use its best efforts to enforce
     or cause to be enforced each such agreement at the request of Parent. The
     Company also will promptly request each Person that has executed, within
     twelve months prior to the date of this Agreement, a confidentiality
     agreement in connection with its consideration of a possible Acquisition
     Transaction not consummated to return all confidential information
     heretofore furnished to such Person by or on behalf of any of the Acquired
     Corporations.

     and the Company shall prepare and cause to be filed with the SEC the Joint
     Proxy Statement and Parent



                                       44

     shall prepare and cause to be filed with the SEC the Form S-4 Registration
     Statement, in which the Joint Proxy Statement will be included as a
     prospectus, with respect to the issuance of Parent Common Stock in the

     concerning it and the holders of its capital stock as the other may
     reasonably request in connection with the preparation of the Form S-4
     Registration Statement and Joint Proxy Statement. Each of Parent and the
     Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) cause the Form S-4
     Registration Statement and the Joint Proxy Statement to comply with the
     rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC, (ii) respond promptly, after
     consultation with each other, to any comments of the SEC or its staff and
     (iii) have the Form S-4 Registration Statement declared effective under the
     Securities Act as promptly as practicable after it is filed with the SEC.
     Parent will cause the Joint Proxy Statement to be mailed to Parent's
     stockholders, and the Company will cause the Joint Proxy Statement to be
     mailed to the Company's stockholders, as promptly as practicable after the
     Form S-4 Registration Statement is declared effective under the Securities
     Act. Parent shall also promptly file, use all reasonable efforts to cause
     to become effective as promptly as possible and, if required, Parent and
     the Company shall mail to their respective stockholders any amendment to
     the Form S-4 Registration Statement or Joint Proxy Statement that becomes
     necessary after the date the S-4 Registration Statement is declared
     effective.

         (b) If at any time prior to the Effective Time any event or
     circumstance relating to Parent or any Parent Subsidiary or their
     respective directors or officers is discovered by Parent which is required
     to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Form S-4 Registration
     Statement or Joint Proxy Statement, Parent shall promptly inform the
     Company. All documents that Parent is responsible for filing with the SEC
     in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby will comply as to
     form and substance in all material respects with the applicable
     requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act.

         (c) If at any time prior to the Effective Time any event or
     circumstance relating to any of the Acquired Corporations or their
     respective directors or officers is discovered by the Company which is
     required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Form S-4
     Registration Statement or Joint Proxy Statement, the Company shall promptly
     inform Parent. All documents that the Company is responsible for filing
     with the SEC in connection with the transaction contemplated herein will
     comply as to form and substance in all material respects with the
     applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act.

         (d) Each of Parent and the Company will advise the other, promptly
     after it receives notice thereof, of the time when the Form S-4
     Registration Statement has become effective or any supplement or amendment
     thereto has been filed, the issuance of any stop order, or any request by
     the SEC for amendment of the Joint Proxy Statement or Form S-4 Registration
     Statement or comments thereon or responses thereto.

         (e) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall use reasonable efforts to
     obtain all regulatory approvals needed to ensure that the Parent Common
     Stock to be issued in the Merger (including shares of Parent Common Stock
     to be issued in connection with Company Options assumed by Parent) will be
     registered or qualified under the securities law of every jurisdiction of
     the United States in which any registered holder of Company Common Stock
     has an address of record on the record date for determining the
     stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at



                                       45
<PAGE>

     the Company Stockholders' Meeting; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Parent shall not
     be required (i) to qualify to do business as a foreign corporation in any
     jurisdiction in which it is not now qualified or (ii) to file a general
     consent to service of process in any jurisdiction.

     SECTION 5.2 COMPANY STOCKHOLDERS' MEETING.

         (a) The Company shall take all action necessary under all applicable
     Legal Requirements to call, give notice of and hold a meeting of the
     holders of Company Common Stock to vote on a proposal to adopt this
     Agreement (the "Company Stockholders' Meeting"). The Company Stockholders'
     Meeting shall be held (on a date selected by the Company in consultation
     with Parent) as promptly as practicable after the Form S-4 Registration
     Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act. Once the Company
     Stockholders' Meeting has been called and notice given, the Company shall
     not postpone or adjourn (other than for the absence of a quorum and then
     only to a future date selected by the Company after consultation with
     Parent) the Company Stockholders' Meeting without the written consent of
     Parent. The Company shall ensure that all proxies solicited in connection
     with the Company Stockholders' Meeting are solicited in compliance with all
     applicable Legal Requirements.

         (b) Subject to Section 5.2(c): (i) the Joint Proxy Statement shall
     include a statement to the effect that the board of directors of the
     Company recommends that the Company's stockholders vote to adopt this
     Agreement at the Company Stockholders' Meeting (the recommendation of the
     Company's board of directors that the Company's stockholders vote to adopt
     this Agreement being referred to as the "Company Board Recommendation");
     and (ii) the Company Board Recommendation shall not be withdrawn or
     modified in a manner adverse to Parent, and no resolution by the board of
     directors of the Company or any committee thereof to withdraw or modify the
     Company Board Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent shall be adopted
     or proposed.

         (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 4.4
     or 5.2(b), the Company Board Recommendation may be withdrawn or modified in
     a manner adverse to Parent and such modification thereto may be included in
     the Joint Proxy Statement (or the withdrawal of the Company Board
     Recommendation may be noted therein) if the board of directors of the
     Company determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
     counsel that the failure to do so would create a substantial risk of
     liability for breach of its fiduciary duties to the Company's stockholders
     under applicable Legal Requirements.

         (d) The Company's obligation to call, give notice of and hold the
     Company Stockholders' Meeting in accordance with Section 5.2(a) shall not
     be limited or otherwise affected by the commencement, disclosure,
     announcement or submission of any Superior Proposal or other Acquisition
     Proposal, or by any withdrawal or modification of the Company Board
     Recommendation.

     SECTION 5.3 PARENT STOCKHOLDERS' MEETING.

         (a) Parent shall take all action necessary under all applicable Legal
     Requirements to call, give notice of and hold a meeting of the holders of
     Parent Common Stock to vote on the issuance of Parent Common Stock in the
     Merger (the "Parent Stockholders' Meeting"). The



                                       46
<PAGE>

     Parent Stockholders' Meeting will be held, on the same date and at the same
     time as the Company Stockholders' Meeting. Once the Parent Stockholders'
     Meeting has been called and notice given, Parent shall not postpone or
     adjourn (other than for the absence of a quorum and then only to a future
     date selected by Parent after consultation with the Company) the Parent
     Stockholders' Meeting without the written consent of the Company. Parent
     shall ensure that all proxies solicited in connection with the Parent
     Stockholders' Meeting are solicited in compliance with all applicable Legal
     Requirements.

         (b) The Joint Proxy Statement shall include a statement to the effect
     that the board of directors of Parent recommends that Parent's stockholders
     vote to approve the issuance of Parent Common Stock in the Merger (the
     recommendation of Parent's board of directors that Parent's stockholders
     vote to approve the issuance of Parent Common Stock in the Merger being
     referred to as the "Parent Board Recommendation"). The Parent Board
     Recommendation shall not be withdrawn or modified in a manner adverse to
     the Company, and no resolution by the board of directors of Parent or any
     committee thereof to withdraw or modify the Parent Board Recommendation in
     a manner adverse to the Company shall be adopted or proposed.

         (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section
     5.3(c), nothing in this Agreement shall prevent Parent's board of directors
     from making any disclosure to Parent's Stockholders where it determines in
     good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure
     to do so would create a substantial risk of liability for breach of its
     fiduciary duties to Parent's stockholders under applicable Legal
     Requirements.

         (d) Parent's obligation to call, give notice of and hold the Parent
     Stockholders' Meeting in accordance with Section 5.3(a) shall not be
     limited or otherwise affected by any withdrawal or modification of the
     Parent Board Recommendation.

     SECTION 5.4 REGULATORY APPROVALS.

         (a) Subject to Section 5.4(c), Parent and the Company shall use
     commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions
     necessary to consummate the Merger and make effective the other
     transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting the
     generality of the foregoing, but subject to Section 5.4(c), Parent and the
     Company (i) shall make all filings (if any) and give all notices (if any)
     required to be made and given by such party in connection with the Merger
     and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to submit
     promptly any additional information requested in connection with such
     filings and notices, (ii) shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
     obtain each Consent (if any) required to be obtained (pursuant to any
     applicable Legal Requirement or Contract, or otherwise) by such party in
     connection with the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by
     this Agreement, and (iii) shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to
     lift any restraint, injunction or other legal bar to the Merger. Each party
     shall promptly deliver to the other party a copy of each such filing made,
     each such notice given and each such Consent obtained by such party during
     the Pre-Closing Period.

         (b) Without limiting the generality of Section 5.4(a), the Company and
     Parent shall, promptly after the date of this Agreement, prepare and file
     the notifications required under the HSR Act and any applicable foreign
     antitrust laws or regulations in connection with the Merger.



                                       47
<PAGE>

     The Company and Parent shall respond as promptly as practicable to any
     inquiries or requests received from any Governmental Authority in
     connection with antitrust or related matters. Except as may be prohibited
     by any Governmental Authority or any Legal Requirement, each of the Company
     and Parent shall: (1) give the other party prompt notice of the
     commencement or threat of commencement of any Legal Proceeding by or before
     any Governmental Authority with respect to the Merger or any of the other
     transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (2) keep the other party
     informed as to the status of any such Legal Proceeding or threat, and (3)
     promptly inform the other party of any material communication concerning
     the HSR Act or any other foreign, federal or state antitrust or fair trade
     laws to or from any Governmental Authority regarding the Merger. Except as
     may be prohibited by any Governmental Authority or by any Legal
     Requirement, the Company and Parent will consult and cooperate with one
     another, and will consider in good faith the views of one another, in
     connection with any analysis, appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief,
     argument, opinion or proposal made or submitted in connection with any
     Legal Proceeding under or relating to the HSR Act or any other foreign,
     federal or state antitrust or fair trade law. Subject to the foregoing,
     Parent shall be principally responsible for and in control of the process
     of dealing with any Governmental Authority concerning the effect of the HSR
     Act and any other applicable foreign, federal or state antitrust or fair
     trade law on the transaction contemplated by this Agreement. In addition,
     except as may be prohibited by any Governmental Authority or by any Legal
     Requirement, in connection with any Legal Proceeding under or relating to
     the HSR Act or any other foreign, federal or state antitrust or fair trade
     law or any other similar Legal Proceeding, each of the Company and Parent
     will permit authorized Representatives of the other party to be present at
     each meeting or conference relating to any such Legal Proceeding and to
     have access to and be consulted in connection with any document, opinion or
     proposal made or submitted to any Governmental Authority in connection with
     any such Legal Proceeding.

         (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
     Agreement, neither Parent nor the Company shall have any obligation under
     this Agreement: (i) to dispose or transfer or cause any of its Subsidiaries
     to dispose of or transfer any assets, or to commit to cause any of the
     Acquired Corporations to dispose of any assets; (ii) to discontinue or
     cause any of its Subsidiaries to discontinue offering any product or
     service, or to commit to cause any of the Acquired Corporations to
     discontinue offering any product or service; (iii) to license or otherwise
     make available, or cause any of its Subsidiaries to license or otherwise
     make available, to any Person, any technology, software or other
     Intellectual Property, or to commit to cause any of the Acquired
     Corporations to license or otherwise make available to any Person any
     technology, software or other Intellectual Property; (iv) to hold separate
     or cause any of its Subsidiaries to hold separate any assets or operations
     (either before or after the Closing Date), or to commit to cause any of the
     Acquired Corporations to hold separate any assets or operations; (v) to
     make or cause any of its Subsidiaries to make any commitment (to any
     Governmental Authority or otherwise) regarding its future operations or the
     future operations of any of the Acquired Corporations, or (vi) to contest
     any Legal Proceeding relating to the Merger if Parent determines in good
     faith that contesting such Legal Proceeding might not be advisable.

     SECTION 5.5 STOCK OPTIONS.

         (a) Subject to Section 5.5(b), at the Effective Time, all rights with
     respect to Company Common Stock under each Company Option then outstanding,
     except for Company



                                       48
<PAGE>

     Options outstanding under the Company's Non-Employee Directors' Stock
     Option Plan, shall be converted into and become rights with respect to
     Parent Common Stock, and Parent shall assume each such Company Option in
     accordance with the terms (as in effect as of the date of this Agreement
     or, for Company Options granted after the date hereof, as in effect on the
     date of such grants) of the Stock Plan under which it was issued and or the
     terms of the stock option agreement by which it is evidenced. From and
     after the Effective Time, (i) each Company Option assumed by Parent may be
     exercised solely for shares of Parent Common Stock, (ii) the number of
     shares of Parent Common Stock subject to each such Company Option shall be
     equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
     Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the
     Exchange Ratio, rounding down to the nearest whole share, (iii) the per
     share exercise price under each such Company Option shall be adjusted by
     dividing the per share exercise price under such Company Option by the
     Exchange Ratio and rounding up to the nearest cent and (iv) any restriction
     on the exercise of any such Company Option shall continue in full force and
     effect and the term, exercisability, vesting schedule and other provisions
     of such Company Option shall otherwise remain unchanged. All Company
     Options granted and outstanding under the Company's Non-Employee Directors'
     Stock Option Plan shall terminate immediately prior to the Effective Time.
     The rights of participants in the Company ESPP with respect to the offering
     period beginning June 1, 2001 under the Company ESPP shall continue in
     effect until such offering period terminates on March 31, 2002 pursuant to
     the Company ESPP provided, however, if the stockholders of the Company do
     not approve an increase of 500,000 shares of Company Common Stock under the
     Company ESPP at the Company's Annual Meeting of Stockholders on May 22,
     2001, the Company shall terminate the Company ESPP and any outstanding
     offering periods prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall file with the
     SEC, no later than 20 days after the date on which the Effective Time
     occurs, a registration statement on Form S-8 relating to the shares of
     Parent Common Stock issuable with respect to the Company Options assumed by
     Parent in accordance with this Section 5.5(a).

         (b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all action that
     may be necessary (under the Stock Plans pursuant to which Company Options
     are outstanding and otherwise) to effectuate the provisions of this Section
     5.5 and to ensure that, from and after the Effective Time, holders of
     Company Options have no rights in connection with the Merger with respect
     thereto other than those specifically provided in this Section 5.5.

     SECTION 5.6 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS.

         (a) Parent agrees that all employees of the Acquired Corporations who
     continue employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any
     Subsidiary of Parent or the Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time
     ("Continuing Employees") shall be eligible to participate in the Surviving
     Corporation's retirement, health, vacation and other non-equity based
     employee benefit plans; provided, however, that (i) nothing in this Section
     5.6 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall limit the right of Parent or the
     Surviving Corporation to amend or terminate any such retirement health,
     vacation or other employee benefit plan at any time, and (ii) if Parent or
     the Surviving Corporation terminates any such retirement, health, vacation
     or other employee benefit plan, then, subject to any necessary transition
     period, the Continuing Employees shall be eligible to participate in
     Parent's retirement, health, vacation and other non equity based employee
     benefit plans, to substantially the same extent as employees of Parent in
     similar



                                       49
<PAGE>

     positions and at similar grade levels. Parent shall, or shall cause
     the Surviving Corporation to, give each Continuing Employee full credit for
     purposes of eligibility and vesting under any employee benefit plans or
     arrangements maintained by Parent or the Surviving Corporation for such
     Continuing Employee's service with any Acquired Corporation to the same
     extent recognized by such Acquiring Corporation prior to the Effective
     Time. If a Continuing Employee commences participation in an employee
     benefit plan of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, Parent will or will
     cause the Surviving Corporation to use its best efforts to cause an
     applicable insurance carrier to (i) waive all limitations as to preexisting
     condition, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and
     coverage requirements applicable to the Continuing Employees under any
     employee benefits plans maintained by Parent or the Surviving Corporation
     that such employees may be eligible to participate in after the Effective
     Time, and (ii) provide each Continuing Employee with credit for any
     co-payments and deductibles paid during the calendar year prior to the
     Effective Time in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket
     requirements under any employee benefit plans that such employees may be
     eligible to participate in after the Effective Time. Nothing in this
     Section 5.6 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be construed to create a
     right in any employee to employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation
     or any other Subsidiary of Parent and, subject to any other binding
     agreement between an employee and Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any
     other Subsidiary of Parent, the employment of each Continuing Employee
     shall be "at will" employment.

         (b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company, at the sole discretion of
     Parent, shall complete all such steps as Parent reasonably determines to be
     necessary to correct operational failures and design defects with respect
     to any Plan in order for such Plan as corrected to fully comply with
     Applicable Law, such steps shall include without limitation the submission
     of any such Plan for approval of any corrections to the Internal Revenue
     Service in accordance with Revenue Procedure 2001-17 and/or the U.S.
     Department of Labor in accordance with the U.S. Department of Labor
     Voluntary Fiduciary Correction Program, as applicable, and implementation
     of such corrective action required by the Internal Revenue Service and/or
     the Department of Labor, as applicable, in connection with each such
     submission.

     SECTION 5.7 INDEMNIFICATION OF OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS.

         (a) All rights to indemnification existing in favor of those Persons
     who are, or were, directors and officers of the Company at or prior to the
     Effective Time (the "Indemnified Persons") shall survive the Merger and
     shall be observed by the Surviving Corporation to the fullest extent
     permitted by Delaware law for a period of six years from the Effective
     Time. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall cause
     the Surviving Corporation to fulfill and honor in all respects the
     obligations of the Company to the Indemnified Persons, pursuant to (i) each
     indemnification agreement currently in effect between the Company and each
     Indemnified Person, and (ii) any indemnification provision under the
     Company's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or Amended and
     Restated Bylaws, each in effect as of the date of this Agreement.

         (b) Without limiting the provisions of Section 5.7(a), during the
     period ending six years after the Effective Time, Parent will indemnify and
     hold harmless each Indemnified Person against and from any costs or
     expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees), judgements, fines, losses,
     claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection
     with any claim,



                                       50
<PAGE>

     action, suit, proceeding or investigation to the extent such claim, action,
     suit, proceeding or investigation arises out of or pertains to (i) any
     action or omission or alleged action or omission in his or her capacity as
     a director or officer of the Company or any of its subsidiaries (regardless
     of whether such action or omission occurred prior to, on or after the
     Closing Date, or (ii) any of the transactions contemplated by this
     Agreement; provided however that if at any time prior to the sixth
     anniversary of the Effective Time, any Indemnified Person delivers to
     Parent a written notice asserting a claim for indemnification under this
     Section 5.7(b), then the claim asserted in such notice shall survive the
     sixth anniversary of the Effective Time until such time as such claim is
     fully and finally resolved. Parent shall not be entitled to settle,
     compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment or otherwise seek
     termination of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation for
     which indemnification may be sought under this Agreement unless such
     settlement, compromise, consent or termination includes an unconditional
     release of all Indemnified Persons from all liability arising out of such
     claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation.

         (c) From the Effective Time until the sixth anniversary of the
     Effective Time, Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
     maintain in effect, for the benefit of the Indemnified Persons with respect
     to acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time, the existing
     policy of directors' and officers' liability insurance maintained by the
     Company as of the date of this Agreement in the form disclosed by the
     Company to Parent prior to the date of this Agreement (the "Existing
     Policy"); provided, however, that (i) the Surviving Corporation may
     substitute for the Existing Policy a policy or policies of comparable
     coverage, and (ii) the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay
     annual premiums for the Existing Policy (or for any substitute policies) in
     excess of $180,000 in the aggregate. In the event any future annual
     premiums for the Existing Policy (or any substitute policies) exceeds
     $180,000 in the aggregate, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to
     reduce the amount of coverage of the Existing Policy (or any substitute
     policies) to the amount of coverage that can be obtained for a premium
     equal to $180,000.

         (d) Parent and the Surviving Corporation agree to pay all expenses,
     including attorneys' fees, that may be incurred by the Indemnified Persons
     in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided for in this
     Section 5.7. This Section 5.7 shall survive the consummation of the Merger
     and the Effective Time, is intended to benefit and may be enforced by the
     Company, Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Indemnified Persons, and
     shall be binding on all successors and assigns of Parent and the Surviving
     Corporation.

     SECTION 5.8 POOLING OF INTERESTS. Each of the Company and Parent agrees,
and the Company agrees to cause the Acquired Corporations, (a) not to take any
action during the Pre-Closing Period that would adversely affect the ability of
Parent to account for the Merger as a "pooling of interests," and (b) to use all
reasonable efforts to attempt to ensure that none of its "affiliates" (as that
term is used in Rule 145 under the Securities Act) takes any action that could
adversely affect the ability of Parent to account for the Merger as a "pooling
of interests." The Company agrees to provide to Ernst & Young such letters as
shall be reasonably requested by Ernst & Young in connection with the letters
referred to in Section 7.5(c).

     SECTION 5.9 DISCLOSURE. Each of Parent and the Company shall consult with
and obtain the approval of the other party before issuing any press release or
other public announcement



                                       51
<PAGE>

with respect to the Merger or this Agreement and shall not issue any such press
release prior to such consultation and approval, except as may be required by
applicable Legal Requirements or any listing agreement related to the trading of
the shares of either party on any national securities exchange or national
automated quotation system, in which case the party proposing to issue such
press release or make such public announcement shall use reasonable efforts to
consult in good faith with the other party before issuing any such press release
or making any such public announcement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the
event either party's Board of Directors withdraws its recommendation of this
Agreement in compliance herewith, such will no longer be required to consult
with or obtain the agreement of the other party in connection with any press
release or public announcement.

     SECTION 5.10 AFFILIATE AGREEMENTS AND STOCKHOLDER AGREEMENTS.

         (a) Contemporaneous with the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
     each of the parties shall deliver to the other party Stockholder Agreements
     in the form of Exhibit B that have been executed by each of the directors
     and executive officers of such party.

         (b) The parties shall use all reasonable efforts to cause each Person
     who is or becomes (or may be deemed to be) an "affiliate" (as that term is
     used in Rule 145 under the Securities Act) of such party to execute and
     deliver to the other party, prior to the date that is 30 days prior to
     consummation of the Merger, an Affiliate Agreement in the form of Exhibit
     C. Shares of Parent Common Stock and shares of Company Common Stock
     beneficially owned by each "affiliate" of the Company who has not provided
     a signed Affiliate Agreement in accordance with this Section 5.10 shall not
     be transferable during any period prior to and after the Effective Time if,
     as a result of the transfer during any such period, taking into account the
     nature, extent and timing of the transfer and similar transfers by all
     other "affiliates" of Parent and the Company, the transfer may, in the
     reasonable judgment of the independent accountants to Parent, prevent
     Parent from accounting for the Merger as a "pooling of interests" in
     accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, Accounting
     Principles Board Opinion No. 16 and all published rules, regulations and
     policies of the SEC. Neither Parent nor the Company shall register, or
     allow its transfer agent to register, on its books any transfer of any
     shares of Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock of any "affiliate" of
     the Company who has not provided a signed Affiliate Agreement in accordance
     with this Section 5.10.

     SECTION 5.11 TAX MATTERS. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and Company agrees
that it will not engage in any action, or fail to take any action, and will
cause its respective subsidiaries not to engage in any action, or fail to taken
any action, which action or failure to take action would reasonably be expected
to cause the Merger to fail to qualify as a "reorganization" under Section
368(a) of the Code, whether or not permitted by the provisions of this
Agreement. At or prior to the filing of the Form S-4 Registration Statement, the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall execute and deliver to Mintz, Levin, Cohn,
Ferris, Glovsky and Popeo, PC and to Cooley Godward LLP tax representation
letters in customary form. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall each confirm
to Mintz, Levin, Cohn,



                                       52
<PAGE>

Ferris, Glovsky and Popeo, PC and to Cooley Godward LLP the accuracy and
completeness as of the Effective Time of the tax representation letters
delivered pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence. Following delivery of
the tax representation letters pursuant to the previous sentence of this Section
5.11, each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable efforts to cause
Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky and Popeo, PC and Cooley Godward LLP,
respectively, to deliver to it a tax opinion satisfying the requirements of Item
601 of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Securities Act. In rendering such
opinions, each of such counsel shall be entitled to rely on the tax
representation letters referred to in this Section 5.11.

     SECTION 5.12 LETTER OF THE COMPANY'S ACCOUNTANTS. The Company shall use all
reasonable efforts to cause to be delivered to Parent a letter of Ernst & Young,
dated no more than two business days before the date on which the Form S-4
Registration Statement becomes effective (and reasonably satisfactory in form
and substance to Parent), that is customary in scope and substance for letters
delivered by independent public accountants in connection with registration
statements similar to the Form S-4 Registration Statement.

     SECTION 5.13 LISTING. Parent shall use reasonable efforts to cause the
shares of Parent Common Stock being issued in the Merger (including the shares
of Parent Common Stock required to be reserved for issuance with respect to
Company Options) to be approved for listing (subject to notice of issuance) on
The Nasdaq Stock Market prior to the Effective Time.

     SECTION 5.14 SECTION 16B-3. Parent, Merger Sub, and the Company shall take
all such steps as may be required to cause the transactions contemplated by
Article 1 and Section 5.5 and any other dispositions of equity securities of the
Company (including derivative securities) or acquisitions of equity securities
of Parent by each individual who (a) is a director or officer of the Company, or
(b) at the Effective Time will become a director or officer of Parent, to be
exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

     SECTION 5.15 EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS.

         (a) On the date of this Agreement, subject to and as a condition to the
     occurrence of the Closing, Company shall enter into employment agreements
     with the individuals identified in Part 5.15(a) of the Company Disclosure
     Schedule, substantially in the form attached hereto as Part 5.15(a) of the
     Company Disclosure Schedule.

         (b) On the date of this Agreement, subject to and as a condition to the
     occurrence of the Closing, Company shall enter into an employment agreement
     with Stuart J.M. Collinson, substantially in the form attached hereto as
     Part 5.15(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

     SECTION 5.16 RIGHTS AGREEMENTS. The Board of Directors of the Company shall
take all action necessary (including amending the Company Rights Agreement dated
April 2, 2001) in order to render the Company rights thereunder inapplicable to
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Except in
connection with the foregoing sentence or where the board of directors of the
Company determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel,
that the failure to do so would create a substantial risk of liability for
breach of its fiduciary duties to the Company's stockholders under applicable
Legal Requirements, the Board of Directors of the Company shall not, without the
prior written consent of Parent, (i) amend the Company Rights Agreement or (ii)
take any action with respect to, or make any determination under, the Company
Rights Agreement, including a redemption of the Company rights, in each case in
order to facilitate an Acquisition Transaction.

     SECTION 5.17 TERMINATION OF CHANGE IN CONTROL BONUS PLAN. As soon as
practicable (and, in any event, prior to the Effective Time), the Company's
Board of Directors shall terminate, as of its effective date, the Company Change
in Control Bonus Plan, effective March 26, 2001 (the "Change In Control Bonus
Plan"), with the intention that the Change In Control Bonus Plan and the
payments and benefits provided therein are rescinded as of such date, that the
Change In Control Bonus Plan has no past, present or future force or effect,
and, in accordance with such termination, that no employee of the Company or any
other individual has any past, present or future rights to any payments or
benefits under the Change In Control Bonus Plan.

     Ernst & Young is not aware of any fact concerning the Company or any of the
     Company's stockholders or affiliates that could preclude Parent from
     accounting for the Merger as a "pooling of interests" in accordance with

     Opinion No. 16 and all published rules, regulations and policies of the
     SEC;

     that Parent may account for the Merger as a "pooling of interests" in
     accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, Accounting
     Principles Board Opinion No. 16 and all published rules, regulations and
     policies of the SEC; and

         (e) the written resignations of all directors of each of the Acquired

Disclosure Schedule made or purported to have been made after the date hereof
shall be disregarded.

     SECTION 9.1 TERMINATION. This Agreement may be terminated by action taken
by the board of directors of Parent or the Company, as the case may be, prior to
the Effective Time (whether before or after adoption of this Agreement by the
Company's stockholders and whether before or after the approval of the issuance
of Parent Common Stock in the Merger by Parent's stockholders) as follows:

         (a) by mutual written consent of Parent and the Company;

         (b) by either Parent or the Company if the Merger shall not have been
     consummated by September 30, 2001; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if the Merger
     shall not have been consummated solely due to the waiting period (or any
     extension thereof) or approvals under the HSR Act not having expired or
     been terminated or received, then such date shall be extended to December
     31, 2001; and PROVIDED, FURTHER, that the right to terminate this Agreement
     under this Section 9.1(b) shall not be available to any party whose willful
     failure to fulfill any material obligation under this Agreement has been
     the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Merger to have been
     consummated on or before such date;

         (c) by either Parent or the Company if a court of competent
     jurisdiction or other Governmental Authority shall have issued an order,
     decree or ruling, or shall have taken any other action, having the effect
     of permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Merger
     and such order, decree, ruling or other action shall have become final and
     non-appealable;

         (d) by either Parent or the Company if (i) the Company Stockholders'

     a proposal to adopt this Agreement, and (ii) this Agreement shall not have
     been adopted at such meeting (and shall not have been adopted at any
     adjournment or postponement thereof) by the Required Company Stockholder
     Vote; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that (A) a party shall not be permitted to
     terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(d) if the failure to
     obtain such stockholder approval is attributable to a failure on the part
     of such party to perform any material obligation required to be performed
     by such party at or prior to the Effective Time pursuant to this Agreement,
     and (B) the Company shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement
     pursuant to this Section 9.1(d) unless the Company shall have made the

     issuance of Parent Common Stock in the Merger shall not have been approved
     at such meeting (and shall not have been approved at any adjournment or
     postponement thereof) by the Required Parent Stockholder Vote; PROVIDED,
     HOWEVER, that a party shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement
     pursuant to this Section 9.1(e) if the failure to obtain such stockholder
     vote is attributable to a failure on the part of the party seeking to
     terminate this Agreement to perform any material obligation required to be
     performed by such party at or prior to the Effective Time pursuant to this
     Agreement, and (B) Parent shall not be permitted to terminate this
     Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(e) unless Parent shall have made the
     payment, if any, required to be made pursuant to Section 9.3(b);

         (f) by Parent (at any time prior to the adoption of this Agreement by
     the Required Company Stockholder Vote) if a Company Triggering Event shall
     have occurred;

         (g) by the Company (at any time prior to the approval by the
     stockholders of Parent of the issuance of Parent Common Stock in the
     Merger) if a Parent Triggering Event shall have occurred;

         (h) by Parent (i) if any of the Company's representations and
     warranties shall have been inaccurate as of the date of this Agreement,
     such that the condition set forth in Section 7.1 would not be satisfied, or
     (ii) if (a) any of Company's representations and warranties become
     inaccurate as of a date subsequent to the date of this Agreement (as if
     made on such subsequent date), such that the condition set forth in Section
     7.1(b) would not be satisfied, and (B) such inaccuracy has not been cured
     by the Company by the later of (1) twenty (20) business days after its
