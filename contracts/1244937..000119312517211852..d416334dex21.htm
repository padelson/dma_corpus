corporation and a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent (" _Purchaser_ "); ENEL
S.P.A., an Italian joint-stock company and the parent of Parent (the "
_Guarantor_ ") (solely for the purposes of Section 9.11 hereof); and ENERNOC,
INC., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "). Certain capitalized terms
used in this Agreement are defined in Exhibit A.

RECITALS

 

A. Parent has agreed to cause Purchaser to commence a cash tender offer (as it
may be amended from time to time as permitted under this Agreement, the "
_Offer_ ") to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
(the " _Shares_ ") for $7.67 per share (such amount, or any higher amount per
share paid pursuant to the Offer, being the " _Offer Price_ "), net to the
seller of such Shares in cash, without interest, upon the terms and subject to
the conditions of this Agreement.

 

B. Following the consummation of the Offer, Purchaser will be merged with and
into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), with the Company continuing as the
surviving corporation in the merger and as a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent
(the " _Surviving Corporation_ "), on the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, whereby, except as expressly provided in Section
2.5, (i) each issued and outstanding Share not owned by Parent, Purchaser or
the Company as of the Effective Time, and excluding Dissenting Shares, shall
be converted into the right to receive the Offer Price, in cash, without
interest and (ii) the Company shall become a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent
as a result of the Merger.

 

C. The board of directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ ") has (i)
determined that this Agreement and the Transactions, including the Offer and
the Merger, are advisable, and in the best interest of, the Company and its
stockholders, (ii) agreed that the Merger shall be effected under Section
251(h) and other relevant provisions of the DGCL, (iii) approved the
execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Transactions, including the Offer and the Merger and (iv)
resolved to recommend that the stockholders of the Company tender their
Shares to Purchaser pursuant to the Offer (the " _Company Board
Recommendation_ ").

D. The board of directors of each of Parent and Purchaser have approved this
Agreement and declared it advisable for Parent and Purchaser, respectively, to
execute and enter into this Agreement.

 

E. Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and as a
condition and inducement to Parents and Purchasers willingness to enter
into this Agreement, Parent and Purchaser have entered into agreements with
Timothy Healy, the Companys Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and David
Brewster, the Companys President, pursuant to which, among other things, Mr.
Healy and Mr. Brewster have irrevocably agreed to tender the Shares
beneficially owned by each of them in the Offer (each, a " _Support Agreement_
" and, collectively, the " _Support Agreements_ ").

E. Parent, Purchaser and the Company acknowledge and agree that the Merger
shall be effected under Section 251(h) of the DGCL and shall, subject to
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in this Agreement, be consummated
immediately following the Offer Acceptance Time.

 



1\. AGREEMENT

 

The Parties to this Agreement, intending to be legally bound, agree as
follows:

 



   SECTION 1. | THE OFFER 
---|--- 

1.1 The Offer.

 

(a) Commencement of the Offer. Provided that this Agreement shall not have
been terminated in accordance with Section 8, as promptly as practicable
after the date of this Agreement, but in no event more than 12 business days
after the date of this Agreement, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause
Purchaser to) commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange
Act) the Offer.

(b) Terms and Conditions of the Offer. The obligations of Purchaser to, and
of Parent to cause Purchaser to, accept for payment, and pay for, any Shares
validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer are subject
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including the prior
satisfaction of the Minimum Condition and the satisfaction or waiver of the
other conditions set forth in Annex I (collectively, the " _Offer Conditions_
"). The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the " _Offer to
Purchase_ ") that contains the terms set forth in this Agreement, the Minimum
Condition and the other Offer Conditions. Purchaser expressly reserves the
right to (i) increase the Offer Price, (ii) waive any Offer Condition and
(iii) make any other changes in the terms and conditions of the Offer not
inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement; _provided, however,_ that
unless otherwise provided by this Agreement, without the prior written
consent of the Company, Purchaser shall not (A) decrease the Offer Price, (B)
change the form of consideration payable in the Offer, (C) decrease the
maximum number of Shares sought to be purchased in the Offer, (D) impose
conditions or requirements to the Offer in addition to the Offer Conditions,
(E) amend or modify any of the Offer Conditions in a manner that adversely
affects, or reasonably could adversely affect, any holder of Shares, (F)
change or waive the Minimum Condition, (G) extend or otherwise change the
Expiration Date in a manner other than as required or permitted by this
Agreement or (H) provide any "subsequent offering period" within the meaning
of Rule 14d-11 promulgated under the Exchange Act. The Offer may not be
withdrawn prior to the Expiration Date (or any rescheduled Expiration Date) of
the Offer, unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Section 8\.

(c) Expiration and Extension of the Offer. The Offer shall initially be
scheduled to expire at one minute following 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on the
20th business day following the Offer Commencement Date, determined as set
forth in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) and Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act (unless
otherwise agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company) (the " _Initial
Expiration Date_ _,_ " such date or such subsequent date and time to which

 



2\.  the expiration of the Offer is extended in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, the " _Expiration Date_ "). Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, but subject to the Parties respective
termination rights under Section 8.1: (i) if, as of the scheduled Expiration
Date, any Offer Condition is not satisfied and has not been waived, Purchaser
may, in its discretion (and without the consent of the Company or any other
Person), extend the Offer on one or more occasions, for an additional period
of up to 10 business days per extension, to permit such Offer Condition to be
satisfied; (ii) Purchaser shall extend the Offer from time to time for: (A)
any period required by any Legal Requirement, any interpretation or position
of the SEC, the staff thereof or any rules and regulations of the NASDAQ Stock
Market applicable to the Offer; and (B) periods of up to 10 business days per
extension, until any waiting period (and any extension thereof) applicable to
the consummation of the Offer under the HSR Act or any foreign Antitrust Law
in a jurisdiction identified in Schedule 6.2(c) shall have expired or been
terminated; and (iii) if, as of the scheduled Expiration Date, any Offer
Condition is not satisfied and has not been waived, at the request of the
Company, Purchaser shall extend the Offer on one or more occasions for an
additional period of up to 10 business days per extension, to permit such
Offer Condition to be satisfied; _provided, however,_ that in no event shall
Purchaser: (1) be required to extend the Offer beyond the earlier to occur of
(the " _Extension Deadline_ ") (x) the valid termination of this Agreement in
compliance with Section 8.1 and (y) the first business day immediately
following the End Date; (2) be permitted to extend the Offer beyond the
Extension Deadline without the prior written consent of the Company; or (3) be
required by the Company to extend the Offer by periods exceeding an aggregate
of 20 business days in the event that each Offer Condition (other than
the Minimum Condition) shall have been satisfied or waived as of any then
scheduled Expiration Date and the Minimum Condition shall not have been
satisfied as of such scheduled Expiration Date. Purchaser shall not terminate
the Offer prior to any scheduled Expiration Date without the prior written
consent of the Company except in the event that this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to Section 8.1.

 

(d) Termination of Offer. Nothing in this Section 1.1 shall be deemed to
impair, limit or otherwise restrict in any manner the right of the Company,
Parent or Purchaser to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1. In
the event that this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section 8.1,
Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) promptly (and, in any
event, within 24 hours of such termination or the next business day if
terminated on a non-business day), irrevocably and unconditionally terminate
the Offer and shall not acquire any Shares pursuant to the Offer. If the
Offer is terminated or withdrawn by Purchaser, Purchaser shall promptly
return, and shall cause any depository acting on behalf of Purchaser to
return, in accordance with applicable Legal Requirements, all tendered Shares
to the registered holders thereof.

(e) Offer Documents. As promptly as practicable on the Offer Commencement
Date, Parent and Purchaser shall (i) file with the SEC a tender offer
statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer (together with all
amendments and supplements thereto and including exhibits thereto, the "
_Schedule TO_ ") that will contain or incorporate by reference the Offer to
Purchase and form of the related letter of transmittal and (ii) cause the
Offer to Purchase and related documents to be disseminated to holders of
Shares. Parent and Purchaser agree that they shall cause the Schedule TO and
all exhibits, amendments or supplements thereto (which together constitute the
" _Offer Documents_ ") filed by either Parent or Purchaser with the SEC to
comply in all material respects with the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations

 



3\.  thereunder and other applicable Legal Requirements. Each of Parent,
Purchaser and the Company agrees to promptly correct any information provided
by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such
information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect, and
Parent further agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents
as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to holders of
Shares, in each case, as and to the extent required by applicable federal
securities laws. The Company hereby consents to the inclusion of the Company
Board Recommendation in the Offer Documents. The Company shall promptly
furnish or otherwise make available to Parent and Purchaser or Parents legal
counsel all information (subject to Section 3.4(g)(i)) concerning the Company
and the Companys stockholders that may be required in connection with any
action contemplated by this Section 1.1(e). The Company and its counsel shall
be given reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Offer Documents
prior to the filing thereof with the SEC. Parent and Purchaser agree to
provide the Company and its counsel with any comments Parent, Purchaser or
their counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer
Documents promptly after receipt of such comments. Each of Parent and
Purchaser shall respond promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff with
respect to the Offer Documents or the Offer. Parent and Purchaser shall
provide the Company and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to participate in
the formulation of any response to any such comments of the SEC or its staff
and a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any such response.

(f) Payment; Funds. On the terms specified herein and subject to the
satisfaction or, to the extent waivable by Parent or Purchaser, waiver of the
Offer Conditions, Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause Purchaser to,
irrevocably accept for payment at the Offer Acceptance Time and pay for, all
Shares validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) pursuant to the Offer as
promptly as practicable after the applicable Expiration Date. Without limiting
the generality of Section 9.10, Parent shall cause to be provided
to Purchaser all of the funds necessary to purchase any Shares that Purchaser
becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer, and shall cause Purchaser
to perform, on a timely basis, all of Purchasers obligations under this
Agreement. Parent and Purchaser shall, and each of Parent and Purchaser shall
ensure, that all of their respective Affiliates shall, tender any Shares held
by them into the Offer.

 

(g) Adjustments. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, if, between the date of this Agreement and the Offer Acceptance
Time, the outstanding Equity Interests of the Company are changed into a
different number or class of shares by reason of any stock split, division or
subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of
shares, reclassification, recapitalization, issuance, grant, repricing or
other similar transaction, then the Offer Price shall be appropriately
adjusted; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this Section 1.1(g) shall
be construed to permit the Company to take any action with respect to its
Equity Interests that is prohibited by this Agreement.

1.2 Company Actions.

(a) Schedule 14D-9. As promptly as practicable on the Offer Commencement
Date, following the filing of the Schedule TO (and in any event within two
business days after the filing of the Schedule TO), the Company shall file
with the SEC and disseminate to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the
extent required by applicable federal securities laws, a Tender Offer
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9

 



4\.  (together with any exhibits, amendments or supplements thereto, the "
_Schedule 14D-9_") that, subject to Section 6.1(b), shall reflect the Company
Board Recommendation. The Company agrees that it shall cause the Schedule
14D-9 to comply in all material respects with the Exchange Act and the rules
and regulations thereunder and other applicable Legal Requirements. Each of
Parent, Purchaser and the Company agrees to respond promptly to any comments
of the SEC or its staff and to promptly correct any information provided by it
for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that such information
shall have become false or misleading in any material respect, and the Company
further agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so
corrected to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to holders of
Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal
securities laws. Parent and Purchaser shall promptly furnish or otherwise
make available to Company or its legal counsel all information concerning
Parent and Purchaser and their stockholders that may be required in connection
with any action contemplated by this Section 1.2(a). Parent and its counsel
shall be given reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule
14D-9 and any amendment or supplement thereto prior to the filing thereof with
the SEC. The Company agrees to provide Parent and its counsel with any
comments the Company or its counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with
respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt of such comments (and
shall give Parent prompt telephonic notice of any material discussions with
the SEC or its staff). The Company shall respond promptly to any comments of
the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9. The Company
shall provide Parent and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to participate
in the formulation of any response to such comments of the SEC or its staff.

 

(b) Stockholder Lists. The Company shall promptly furnish, or shall cause to
be promptly (and in no event more than three business days after the date of
this Agreement) furnished to, Parent with a list of its stockholders, mailing
labels and any available listing or computer file containing the names and
addresses of all record holders of Shares and lists of securities positions
of Shares held in stock depositories, in each case accurate and complete as of
the most recent practicable date, and shall provide to Parent such additional
information (including updated lists of stockholders, mailing labels and
lists of securities positions) and such other assistance as Parent may
reasonably request in connection with the Offer. Subject to any Legal
Requirements, Parent and Purchaser and their agents shall hold in confidence

as provided in this Section 2.6(a), the Payment Fund

 



7\.  shall not be used for any other purpose. The Payment Fund shall be invested
by the Paying Agent as directed by the Surviving Corporation; _provided_ ,
that such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United

respectively, in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or

in money market funds having a rating in the highest investment category
granted by a recognized credit rating agency at the time of acquisition or a
combination of the foregoing and, in any such case, no such instrument shall
have a maturity exceeding three months.

 

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event later than five
business days thereafter), the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying
Agent to mail to each Person who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of
record of Shares entitled to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
Section 2.5 a form of letter of transmittal (which shall be in reasonable
and customary form and shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title to the certificates formerly evidencing such shares
(the " _Certificates_ ") shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Paying
Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to such letter of transmittal. Upon surrender to
the Paying Agent of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof) or Book-Entry Shares, together with such letter of transmittal, duly
completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto,
and such other documents as may be reasonably required pursuant to such
instructions, the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each
Share formerly evidenced by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and such
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares shall then be canceled. No interest shall
accrue or be paid on the Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of
any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for the benefit of the holder thereof.
If the payment of any Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificates formerly evidencing
the Shares is registered on the stock transfer books of the Company, it shall
be a condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be
endorsed properly or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the
Person requesting such payment shall have paid all transfer and other similar
Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a
Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or
shall have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that
such Taxes either have been paid or are not applicable. Payment of the
applicable Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only
be made to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered.

 

(c) At any time following 12 months after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it
any funds which had been made available to the Paying Agent and not disbursed
to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares (including, all interest and
other income received by the Paying Agent in respect of all funds
made available to it), and, thereafter, such holders shall be entitled to
look to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat and
other similar Legal Requirements) only as general creditors thereof with
respect to the Merger Consideration that may be payable upon due surrender of
the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares held by them. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, neither the Surviving Corporation nor the Paying Agent shall be 

 



8\.  liable to any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for the Merger
Consideration delivered in respect of such share to a public official pursuant
to any abandoned property, escheat or other similar Legal Requirements. Any
amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders at such time at which such amounts
would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Body shall
become, to the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, the
property of the Surviving Corporation or its designee, free and clear of all
claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 

(d) At the close of business on the day of the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company with respect to the Shares shall be closed and
thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on
the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
the Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease
to have any rights with respect to such shares except as otherwise provided
herein or by applicable Legal Requirements. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation
for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this
Agreement.

(e) Each of the Surviving Corporation, Parent and Purchaser shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold (or cause the Paying Agent to deduct and withhold) from
any cash amounts payable to any holder of Shares, Company Options or RSUs such
amounts as it is required by any Legal Requirement to deduct and withhold
with respect to Taxes. Each such payor shall take all action that may be
necessary to ensure that any such amounts so withheld are promptly and
properly remitted to the appropriate Governmental Body. If any withholding
obligation may be avoided by a payee providing information or documentation
to the applicable payor, such payor shall request such information from such
payee and use commercially reasonable efforts to avoid such withholding
obligation. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and timely remitted to
the appropriate Governmental Body, such withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such
amounts would otherwise have been paid.

 

(f) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate
to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation,
the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may
direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to such Certificate (which shall not exceed the Merger
Consideration payable with respect to such Certificate), the Paying Agent will
pay (less any amounts entitled to be deducted or withheld pursuant to Section
2.6(e)), in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the
applicable Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the Shares formerly
represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this Section 2\.

 

2.7 Dissenters Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, and
held by holders who are entitled to demand appraisal rights under Section 262
of the DGCL and have properly exercised and perfected their respective demands
for appraisal of such shares in the time and manner provided in Section 262
of the DGCL and, as of the Effective Time, have neither effectively withdrawn
nor lost their rights to such appraisal and payment under the DGCL (the "
_Dissenting Shares_ "), shall not be converted into the right to receive
Merger Consideration, but shall, by virtue of the

 



9\.  Merger, be entitled to only such consideration as shall be determined
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided,_ that if any such holder shall
have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such
holders right to appraisal and payment under the DGCL, such holders Shares
shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration (less any amounts entitled to be deducted
or withheld pursuant to Section 2.6(e)), and such shares shall not be deemed
to be Dissenting Shares. The Company shall provide each of the holders of
Company Common Stock with the notice required by Section 262 of the DGCL with
the notice contemplated thereby as part of the Schedule 14D-9. The Company
shall give prompt notice to Parent and Purchaser of any demands received by
the Company for appraisal of any Dissenting Shares, withdrawals of such
demands and any other instruments served pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL,
in each case prior to the Effective Time. Parent and Purchaser shall have the
right to direct and participate in all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to such demands, and the Company shall not, without the prior written
consent of Parent and Purchaser, settle or offer to settle, or make any
payment with respect to, any such demands, approve any withdrawal of any such
demands or agree or commit to do any of the foregoing.

2.8 Treatment of Equity Incentive Awards. 

(a) Each Company Option that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Offer Acceptance Time shall accelerate and become fully vested and
exercisable effective immediately prior to, and contingent upon, the Offer
Acceptance Time. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any further action on the part of the holders thereof, Parent, Purchaser or
the Company, each Company Option that is then outstanding and unexercised as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and converted
into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to the product of (i) the
total number of Shares subject to such fully vested Company Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by (ii) the excess, if
any, of (x) the Merger Consideration over (y) the exercise price payable per
Share under such Company Option, which amount shall be paid in accordance
with Section 2.8(f) (the " _Option Consideration_ "). No holder of a Company
Option that has an exercise price per Share that is equal to or greater than
the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to any payment with respect to
such canceled Company Option before or after the Effective Time.

 

(b) Each restricted stock unit award granted pursuant to any of the Company
Equity Plans or otherwise (the " _RSUs_ ") that is outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, shall be
canceled and converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to
(i) the total number of Shares issuable in settlement to such RSU immediately
prior to the Effective Time without regard to vesting multiplied by (ii) the
Merger Consideration, which amount shall be paid in accordance with Section
2.8(f) (the " _RSU Consideration_ ").

(c) Each holder of shares of restricted and unvested Company Common Stock
granted pursuant to any of the Company Equity Plans or otherwise ("
_Restricted Shares_ ") may tender such Restricted Shares pursuant to the Offer
and any such Restricted Shares shall be treated in the same manner as any
other share of Company Common Stock. The Company shall accelerate the vesting
of all Restricted Shares, such that all Restricted Shares will vest in full
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 



10\. (d) The Company ESPP shall terminate effective as of immediately prior to, but
subject to the occurrence of the Effective Time.

(e) Effective as of no later than the Offer Acceptance Time, the Company shall
have taken all actions necessary to effect the preceding provisions of this
Section 2.8.

(f) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but no later
than the earlier of (x) 10 business days after the Effective Time or (y) the
first payroll date after the Effective Time), Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation or a Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation to, pay
through the Surviving Corporations or the applicable Subsidiarys payroll the
aggregate Option Consideration and RSU Consideration payable with respect to
Company Options and RSUs held by current or former employees of the Company
or the other Acquired Corporations (net of any withholding Taxes required to
be deducted and withheld by applicable Legal Requirements); _provided,
however_ , that to the extent the holder of a Company Option or RSU is not,
and was not at any time during the vesting period of the Company Option or
RSU, an employee of the Company or any other Acquired Corporation for
employment tax purposes, the Option Consideration or RSU Consideration payable
pursuant to Section 2.8 with respect to such Company Option or RSU shall be
deposited in the Payment Fund and paid by the Paying Agent in the manner
described in Section 2.6.

 

2.9 Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further
action is reasonably determined by Parent to be necessary or desirable to
carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation
with full right, title and possession of and to all rights and property of
Purchaser and the Company, the officers and directors of the Surviving
Corporation and Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name of Purchaser,
in the name of the Company and otherwise) to take such action.

basis all reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents
(including exhibits and all other information incorporated therein) required
to be filed or furnished by the Company with the SEC (the " _Company SEC
Documents_ "). As of their respective dates, the Company SEC Documents
complied in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act,
the Exchange Act or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the case may be, and the rules
and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to such Company
SEC Documents and, except to the extent that information contained in such
Company SEC Document has been revised, amended, modified or superseded (prior
to the date of this Agreement) by a later filed Company SEC Document, none of
the Company SEC Documents when filed or furnished contained any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

(b) The consolidated financial statements (including any related notes and
schedules) contained or incorporated by reference in the Company SEC
Documents: (i) complied as to form in all material respects with the published
rules and regulations of the SEC applicable thereto; (ii) were prepared in
accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ("
_GAAP_ ") applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods covered (except
as may be indicated in the notes to such financial statements or as permitted
by Regulation S-X, or, in the case of unaudited financial statements, as
permitted by the SEC on Form 10-Q, Form 8-K or any successor form under
the Exchange Act); and (iii) fairly present, in all material respects, the
financial position of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the
respective dates thereof and the results of operations and cash flows of the
Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries for the periods covered thereby
(subject, in the case of the unaudited financial statements, to normal and
recurring year-end adjustments that are not, individually or in
the aggregate, material). No financial statements of any Person other than
the Subsidiaries of the Company are required by GAAP to be included in the
consolidated financial statements of the Company.

 



14\. (c) The Company maintains, and at all times since January 1, 2015, has
maintained, a system of internal controls over financial reporting (as
defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) which is
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with GAAP, and includes those policies and procedures
that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
conformity with GAAP and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management and the Company Board; and (iii)
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection
of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the assets of the Company
that could have a material effect on the financial statements. The Companys
management has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys
system of internal controls over financial reporting in compliance with the
requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2016, and such assessment concluded that such controls were
effective. To the knowledge of the Company, except as set forth in the
Company SEC Documents filed prior to the date of this Agreement, since January
1, 2015, or as specified in Part 3.1(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
neither the Company nor the Companys independent registered accountant has
identified or been made aware of: (1) any significant deficiency or material
weakness in the design or operation of internal control over financial
reporting utilized by the Company; (2) any illegal act or fraud, whether or
not material, that involves the management or other employees of the Company;

maintained, disclosure controls and procedures as defined and required by

employment statute or regulation, privacy right, labor dispute, workers

safety, retaliation, immigration, classification or discrimination matters
involving any Company Associate, including charges of unfair labor practices
or harassment complaints. The Company has complied in all material respects
with the CBA and with all applicable Legal Requirements related to employment,
including employment practices, wages, hours and other terms and conditions
of employment (including the classification and compensation of employees for
purposes of the Fair Labor Standards Act and cognate state laws and the
classification of independent contractors), immigration, discrimination, and
other Legal Requirements in respect of any reduction in force, including
notice, information and consultation requirements.

(c) To the knowledge of the Company, no Company Associate is in violation in
any material respect of any term of any employment agreement, nondisclosure
agreement, common law nondisclosure obligation, fiduciary duty, non-
competition agreement, restrictive covenant or other obligation: (i) to any of
the Acquired Corporations; or (ii) to a former employer of any such employee
relating (A) to the right of any such employee to be employed by any of the
Acquired Corporations or (B) to the knowledge or use of trade secrets or
proprietary information. To the knowledge of the Company, no employee of the
Company whose annual aggregate total compensation inclusive of commissions
and any bonuses is above $150,000 per annum intends to terminate his or her
employment within the 12 month period following execution of this Agreement.

 

(d) Part 3.15(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth an accurate and
complete list of the material Employee Plans and separately identifies each
material Employee Plan that is maintained primarily for the benefit of
individuals outside the United States (each, a " _Foreign Employee Plan_ ").
The Company has either delivered or made available to Parent or Parents
Representatives prior to the execution of this Agreement with respect to each
material Employee Plan accurate and complete copies of the following, as
relevant: (i) all material plan documents and all material
amendments thereto, and all related trust or other funding documents; (ii)
any currently effective determination letter or opinion letter; (iii) the most
recent annual actuarial valuation and the most recent Form 5500; (iv) the most
recent summary plan descriptions and any material modifications thereto; and
(v) the most recent nondiscrimination tests required to be performed under the
Code.

 

(e) During the preceding 6 years neither an Acquired Corporation nor any other
entity that would be deemed a single employer with an Acquired Corporation
pursuant to Section 4001(b) of ERISA has maintained, contributed to, or been
required to contribute to a

 



26\.  plan subject to Section 302 or Title IV of ERISA or Code Section 412,
including any "single employer" defined benefit plan or any "multiemployer
plan" each as defined in Section 4001 of ERISA.

(f) Each of the Employee Plans that is intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code has obtained a favorable determination letter (or opinion
letter, if applicable) as to its qualified status under the Code and to the
knowledge of the Company, no events have occurred that could cause the
revocation of such letter. Each of the Employee Plans is now and has been
operated in compliance in all material respects with its terms and all
applicable Legal Requirements, including but not limited to ERISA and the
Code. There are no pending, or to the knowledge of the Company, threatened
claims in respect of any Employee Plan (other than routine claims for
benefits).

(g) Except to the extent required under Section 601 et seq. of ERISA or 4980B
of the Code (or any other similar state or local Legal Requirement), neither
any Acquired Corporation nor any Employee Plan has any present or future
obligation to provide post-employment welfare benefits to or make any payment
to, or with respect to, any present or former employee, officer or director of
an Acquired Corporation pursuant to any retiree medical benefit plan or other
retiree welfare plan.

 

(h) All Foreign Employee Plans comply in all material respects with applicable
Legal Requirements. All Foreign Employee Plans that are intended to be funded
and/or book-reserved are funded and/or book-reserved, as appropriate, based on
reasonable actuarial assumptions and as applicable in accordance with normal
accounting practices. Except as would not reasonably be expected to result in
material liability to the Company, the fair market value of the assets of each
funded Foreign Employee Plan, the liability of each insurer for any Foreign
Employee Plan funded through insurance or the book reserve established for
any Foreign Employee Plan, together with any accrued contributions, is
sufficient to procure or provide for the accrued benefit obligations with
respect to all current and former participants in such plan according to the
actuarial assumptions most recently used to determine the liabilities of such
Foreign Employee Plan for financial accounting purposes, and no transaction
contemplated by this Agreement shall cause such assets or insurance
obligations to be less than such accrued benefit obligations.

(i) The consummation of the Transactions (including in combination with other
events or circumstances) will not (i) entitle any current or former Company
Associate to severance pay, unemployment compensation or any other cash
payment, (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or increase the
amount of, compensation or benefits due to any such Company Associate, (iii)
directly or indirectly cause the Acquired Corporations to transfer or set
aside any material assets to fund any benefits under any Employee Plan, (iv)
otherwise give rise to any material liability under any Employee Plan or (v)
result in any payment or benefit that will fail to be deductible for federal
income tax purposes by reason of Section 280G of the Code.

 

(j) To the extent applicable, each Employee Plan complies in form with, and
has been operated in a manner that will not give rise to any tax under,
Section 409A of the Code.

 



27\. 3.16 Environmental Matters. Except for those matters that would not reasonably
be expected to result in any material liability of an Acquired Corporation:
(a) the Acquired Corporations are, and since January 1, 2012, have been, in

Authorizations required under Environmental Laws for the operation of their
respective business, (b) as of the date hereof, there is no investigation,

Corporations have not received any written notice, report or other information

of the respective Acquired Corporations relating to or arising under
Environmental Laws, (d) (1) no Person has been exposed to any Hazardous
Materials at a property or facility of an Acquired Corporation at levels in
excess of applicable permissible exposure levels; and (2) there are no
activities, circumstances, conditions, or events, including the presence or
Release of any Hazardous Material on, at, under or from any property or
facility, including the Leased Real Property, that would reasonably be
expected to result in any Legal Proceeding against or liability of an Acquired
Corporation under any Environmental Law, and (e) no Acquired Corporation
has assumed, undertaken, or otherwise become subject to any liability of
another Person relating to Environmental Laws other than any indemnities in
Material Contracts or leases for real property.

Parents Representatives an accurate and complete copy of all insurance
policies and all self-insurance programs and arrangements relating to the
business, assets and operations of the Acquired Corporations. Except as would
not reasonably be expected to be materially adverse to the Acquired
Corporation, all such insurance policies are in full force and effect (except
for any expiration thereof in accordance with its terms), no notice of
cancellation or modification has been received, and there is no existing
default or event which, with the giving of notice or lapse of time or both,
would constitute a default by any insured thereunder. The Company maintains
insurance coverage in such amounts and covering such risks as are in
accordance in all material respects with normal industry practice for
companies of similar size and stage of development and all premiums thereon
have, in all material respects, been timely paid or, if not yet due, accrued
to the extent required in accordance with GAAP. There is no material claim
pending under any of the Companys insurance policies as to which coverage
has been questioned, denied or disputed by the underwriters of such policies.

Company Common Stock (other than Parent, Purchaser or any of their respective
Affiliates) in connection with the Offer and the Merger is fair from a

waive or permit the waiver of any provision of, or fail to enforce or cause
to be enforced, any standstill or similar agreement to which any of the
Acquired Corporations is a party; and (iii) resolve or agree to do any of the

anticipation of potentially making an Acquisition Proposal, within the last
twelve months, to the effect that the Company is ending all discussions and
negotiations with such Person with respect to any Acquisition Proposal,
effective on the date hereof, and the notice shall also request such Person to

Offer Acceptance Time any Acquired Corporation or any of their Representatives
receives a written Acquisition Proposal from any Person or group of Persons,
which Acquisition Proposal was made or renewed on or after the date of this
Agreement and did not result from a breach of this Section 5.3, (i) the
Company and its Representatives may contact such Person or group of Persons
solely to clarify the terms and conditions thereof solely to determine
whether such

 



39\.  Acquisition Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to
a Superior Offer and inform such Person or group of Persons of the terms of
this Section 5.3 and (ii) if the Company Board determines in good faith,
after consultation with financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that (A)
such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead
to a Superior Offer and (B) that the failure to take any of the following

to the stockholders of the Company that the Company determines is required by

position described in clause (i) or (ii) shall be deemed to be a Company
Adverse Change Recommendation subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, unless the Company Board reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation
in such disclosure or in connection with such action.

 

(f) The Company agrees that in the event that any Acquired Corporation or any
Representative of any Acquired Corporation takes any action that, if taken by

40\. ---|--- 

6.1 Company Board Recommendation: Superior Proposal; Change in Circumstance.

(a) The Company hereby consents to the Offer and represents that the Company
Board, at a meeting duly called and held, has made the Company Board
Recommendation. Subject to Section 6.1(b), the Company hereby consents to the
inclusion of a description of the Company Board Recommendation in the Offer
Documents. During the Pre-Closing Period, neither the Company Board nor any
committee thereof shall: (i)(A) withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to
Parent or Purchaser), or publicly propose to withdraw (or modify in a
manner adverse to Parent or Purchaser), the Company Board Recommendation or
(B) approve, recommend or declare advisable, or publicly propose to approve,
recommend or declare advisable, any Acquisition Proposal (any action described
in this clause (i) being referred to as a " _Company Adverse Change
Recommendation_ "); (ii) fail to publicly reaffirm its recommendation of this
Agreement within five business days after Parent so requests in writing,
provided that, unless an Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly
disclosed, Parent may only make such request once every 30 days unless such
request arises due to the occurrence of an event described in Section 5.3(e);
or (iii) approve, recommend or declare advisable, or propose to approve,
recommend or declare advisable, or allow the Company to execute or enter into
any Contract with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, or enter into any other
Contract or agreement in principle requiring, or reasonably expected to
cause, the Company to abandon, terminate, delay or fail to consummate, or that
would otherwise materially impede, interfere with or be inconsistent with, the
Transactions (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement).

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at
any time prior to accepting, for the first time, for payment such number of
Shares validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as
satisfies the Minimum Condition (the " _Offer Acceptance Time_ "):

 

(i) if the Company has received a written Acquisition Proposal (which
Acquisition Proposal did not arise out of a breach of Section 5.3) from any
Person that has not been withdrawn and after consultation with outside legal
counsel and financial advisors, the Company Board shall have determined, in
good faith, that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Offer, (x) the
Company Board may make a Company Adverse Change Recommendation or (y) the
Company may terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(f) to enter into
a Specified Agreement with respect to such Superior Offer, in each case, if
and only if: (A) the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel, that the failure to do
so would reasonably constitute a breach of the fiduciary duties of the Company
Board to the Companys stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements; (B)
the Company shall have given Parent prior written notice of its intention to
consider making a Company Adverse Change Recommendation or terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(f) at least four business days prior to
making any such Company Adverse Change Recommendation or termination (a "
_Determination Notice_ ") (which notice shall not constitute a Company Adverse
Change Recommendation or termination); and (C) (1) the Company shall have
provided to Parent information with respect to such Acquisition Proposal in
accordance with Section 5.3(d), (2) the Company shall have given Parent the
four business days

 



41\.  after the Determination Notice to propose revisions to the terms of this
Agreement or make another proposal so that such Acquisition Proposal would
cease to constitute a Superior Offer, and the Company shall have negotiated
in good faith with Parent (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) with
respect to such proposed revisions or other proposal, if any, and (3) after
considering the results of any such negotiations and giving effect to the
proposals made by Parent, if any, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, the Company Board shall have determined, in good faith, that such
Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Offer and that the failure to make the
Company Adverse Change Recommendation or terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.1(f) would reasonably constitute a breach of the fiduciary duties of
the Company Board to the Companys stockholders under applicable Legal
Requirements. Issuance of any "stop, look and listen" communication by or on
behalf of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) shall not be considered a
Company Adverse Change Recommendation and shall not require the giving of a
Determination Notice or compliance with the procedures set forth in this
Section 6.1. For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this Section
6.1(b)(i) shall also apply to any material amendment to any
Acquisition Proposal and require a new Determination Notice, except that the
references to four business days shall be deemed to be three business days;
and

 

(ii) other than in connection with an Acquisition Proposal, the Company Board
may make a Company Adverse Change Recommendation in response to a Change in
Circumstance, if and only if: (A) the Company Board determines in good faith,
after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel, that the failure
to do so would reasonably constitute a breach of the fiduciary duties of the
Company Board to the Companys stockholders under applicable Legal
Requirements; (B) the Company shall have given Parent a Determination Notice
at least four business days prior to making any such Company Adverse Change
Recommendation; and (C) (1) the Company shall have specified the Change in
Circumstance in reasonable detail, (2) the Company shall have given Parent the
four business days after the Determination Notice to propose revisions to the
terms of this Agreement or make another proposal so that such Change in
Circumstance would no longer necessitate a Company Adverse Change
Recommendation, and shall have negotiated in good faith with Parent (to the
extent Parent desires to negotiate) with respect to such proposed revisions
or other proposal, if any, and (3) after considering the results of any such
negotiations and giving effect to the proposals made by Parent, if any, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, the Company Board shall have
determined, in good faith, that the failure to make the Company Adverse Change
Recommendation in response to such Change in Circumstance would reasonably be
expected to constitute a breach of fiduciary duties of the Company Board to
the Companys stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements. For the
avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this Section 6.1(b)(ii) shall also apply
to any material change to the facts and circumstances relating to such Change
in Circumstance and require a new Determination Notice, except that the
references to four business days shall be deemed to be three business days.

 

6.2 Filings, Consents and Approvals.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of
the Parties shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, to file, or cause to be filed, all documents
and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other
Parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable Antitrust Laws to consummate and make effective the Transactions
as soon as

 



42\.  reasonably practicable, and in any event prior to the End Date, including
(i) the obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents,
clearances, decisions, declarations, approvals and, expirations or
terminations of waiting periods from Governmental Bodies and the making of all
necessary registrations and filings and the taking of all steps as may be

from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any Governmental Body in
connection with any Antitrust Law, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary
consents, authorizations, approvals or waivers from third parties and (iii)

(b) Subject to the last sentence of this Section 6.2(b), the Parties agree to
use reasonable best efforts, and cause their Affiliates to use their
reasonable best efforts, to promptly take, all actions and steps requested or
required by any Governmental Body as a condition to granting any consent,
permit, authorization, waiver, clearance and approvals, and to cause
the prompt expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period and to
resolve objections, if any, as the FTC or DOJ, or other Governmental Bodies of
any other jurisdiction for which consents, permits, authorizations, waivers,
clearances, approvals and expirations or terminations of waiting periods are
sought with respect to the Transactions, so as to obtain such consents,
permits, authorizations, waivers, clearances, approvals or termination of the
waiting period under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws, and to avoid the
commencement of a lawsuit by the FTC, the DOJ or other Governmental Bodies
under Antitrust Laws, and to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution
of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in any suit or
proceeding which would otherwise have the effect of preventing the Closing or
materially delaying the Offer Acceptance Time or the Closing or delaying the
Offer Acceptance Time beyond the Expiration Date; _provided _ that the
Company, the Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries shall only be
required to take or commit to take any such action, or agree to any such
condition or restriction, if such action, commitment, agreement, condition or
restriction is binding on the Company, the Parent or any of their respective
Subsidiaries only in the event the Closing occurs. Subject to the last
sentence of this Section 6.2(b), the Parties shall defend through litigation
on the merits any claim asserted in court by any party under Antitrust Laws
in order to avoid entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any decree,
order or judgment (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that could
restrain, delay, or prevent the Closing by the End Date. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as requiring Parent,
Purchaser or their Affiliates (including, for this purpose, the Acquired
Corporations in respect of any post-Closing periods) to submit to or accept
any Burdensome Condition or commence or threaten to commence any claim, action
or proceeding.

(c) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the
Parties hereto shall (and shall cause their respective Affiliates, if

promptly, but in no event later than 10 business days after the date hereof,
make all other filings, notifications or other consents as may be required to

only jurisdictions where filing, notification, expiration of a waiting period
or consent or approval is a condition to Closing; and (iii) cooperate with
each other in determining whether, and promptly preparing and making, any
other filings or notifications or other consents required to be made with, or
obtained from, any other Governmental Bodies in connection with the
Transactions.

 



43\. (d) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this Section 6.2,
during the Pre-Closing Period, each Party hereto shall use its reasonable

connection with any filing or submission in connection with any investigation
or other inquiry, including allowing the other Party to have a reasonable
opportunity to review in advance and comment on drafts of filings and

Governmental Body in connection with any such request, inquiry,
investigation, action or Legal Proceeding, (v) upon request, promptly furnish
to the other Party, subject to an appropriate confidentiality agreement to
limit disclosure to outside counsel and consultants retained by such counsel,
with copies of documents provided to or received from any Governmental Body in
connection with any such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal
Proceeding (other than Item "4(c)" and "4(d)" "documents" as those terms are
used in the rules and regulations under the HSR Act), (vi) subject to an
appropriate confidentiality agreement to limit disclosure to counsel and
outside consultants retained by such counsel, and to the extent
reasonably practicable, consult in advance and cooperate with the other
Parties and consider in good faith the views of the other Parties in
connection with any analysis, appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief,
argument, opinion, proposal or substantive communication to be made or
submitted in connection with any such request, inquiry, investigation, action
or Legal Proceeding and (vii) except as may be prohibited by any Governmental
Body or by any Legal Requirement, in connection with any such request,
inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding in respect of the
Transactions, each Party hereto shall provide advance notice of and permit
authorized Representatives of the other Party to be present at each meeting or
conference relating to such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal
Proceeding and to have access to and be consulted in advance in connection
with any argument, opinion or proposal to be made or submitted to any
Governmental Body in connection with such request, inquiry, investigation,
action or Legal Proceeding; _provided_ , _however_ , Parent shall, on behalf
of the Parties, control and make the final determination as to the appropriate
strategy relating to any filing or submission which is necessary under the
HSR Act, including with respect to any filings, notifications, submissions and
communications with or to any Governmental Body. Each Party shall supply as
promptly as practicable such information, documentation, other material or
testimony that may be reasonably requested by any Governmental Body, including
by complying at the earliest reasonably practicable date with any reasonable
request for additional information, documents or other materials received by
any Party or any of their respective Subsidiaries from any Governmental Body
in connection with such applications or filings for the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Purchaser shall pay all filing fees under the
HSR Act and for any filings required under foreign Antitrust Laws, but the
Company shall bear its own costs for the preparation of any such filings.
Neither Party shall commit to or agree with any Governmental Body to stay,
toll or extend any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act, or pull and
refile under the HSR Act, or other applicable Antitrust Laws, without the
prior written consent of the other.

 



44\. (e) Parent agrees that it shall not, and shall cause its controlled Affiliates
not to, directly or indirectly, acquire or agree to acquire any assets,
business or any Person, whether by merger, consolidation, purchasing a
substantial portion of the assets of or equity in any Person or by any other
manner or engage in any other transaction or take any other action, if the
entering into of an agreement relating to or the consummation of such
acquisition, merger, consolidation or purchase or other transaction or action
would reasonably be expected to (i) impose any material delay in the
expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period or impose any
material delay in the obtaining of, or materially increase the risk of not
obtaining, any authorization, consent, clearance, approval or order of
a Governmental Body necessary to consummate the Offer, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any approvals and
expiration of waiting periods pursuant to the HSR Act or any other applicable
Legal Requirements, (ii) materially increase the risk of any Governmental
Body entering, or materially increase the risk of not being able to remove or
successfully challenge, any permanent, preliminary or temporary injunction or
other order, decree, decision, determination or judgment that would
materially delay, materially restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit
consummation of the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or (iii) otherwise intentionally and materially delay or
intentionally impede the consummation of the Offer, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(f) The Company shall give (or shall cause its respective Subsidiaries to
give) any notices to third parties, and shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain the third party consents, approvals or waivers identified on
Schedule 6.2(f) (the " _Specified Consents_ ") and the Company and the
Purchaser shall coordinate and cooperate in seeking any such Specified
Consents.

(g) Prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, the Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to either (i) obtain all required approvals from the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (" _FERC_ ") with respect to the
Transactions or (ii) terminate the need for any such approvals by the Federal

determinations and/or resolutions of the Company Board or a committee thereof)
that may be reasonably necessary (under the Company Equity Plans and award
agreements pursuant to which Company Stock Awards are outstanding or
otherwise) to (i) accelerate the vesting and exercisability (as applicable) of
each unexercised Company Option, RSUs and Restricted Shares then outstanding
so that each such Company Option, RSUs and Restricted Shares shall be fully
vested and exercisable (as applicable) effective as of immediately prior to,
and contingent upon, the Offer Acceptance Time or the Effective Time
(as applicable) in accordance with Section 2.8(a), 2.8(b), 2.8(c) and 2.8(e),
(ii) terminate each Company Equity Plan (except as otherwise agreed by Parent
and a holder thereof) effective as of and contingent upon the Effective Time
and (iii) following the vesting acceleration described in (i) above, cause,
as of the Effective Time, each unexpired

 



45\.  and unexercised Company Option and each unexpired RSU then outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time (and each plan, if any, under which
any Company Stock Award may be granted except, with respect to any such plan,
as otherwise agreed by Parent and a holder thereof) to be canceled, terminated
and extinguished, subject, if applicable, to payment pursuant to Section 2.8.

 

6.4 Employee Benefits.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, honor all employment
agreements to which they are party and all other Employee Plans, in each case
in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately before the Effective
Time, except as otherwise specifically provided herein.

 

(b) For a period of at least one year following the Effective Time, Parent
shall provide to, or cause to be provided to, each employee of the Company
who is employed by the Company as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
(each, a " _Continuing Employee_ ") severance benefits, in the case of a
Continuing Employee who was employed by the Company on April 30, 2017, no
less favorable than the severance benefits available to the Continuing
Employee on April 30, 2017, or in respect of any Continuing Employee hired
after April 30, 2017, as in effect immediately prior to the execution of this
Agreement (exclusive in either event of any alternative or additional
severance available under a bilateral employment agreement, which shall be
subject to Section 6.4(a)).

 

(c) With respect to each Parent employee benefit plan or arrangement in which
a Continuing Employee may participate after the Effective Time, Parent shall
provide to, or cause to be provided to, each Continuing Employee service
credit for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and, for purposes
of vacation and severance benefits only, benefit accrual purposes in respect
of service with the Company (and its Subsidiaries and predecessors) prior to
the Closing Date to the extent such service was credited for such purpose
under an Employee Plan immediately before the Closing Date, _provided_ , that
the foregoing shall not result in the duplication of benefits.

(d) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation, or its Subsidiaries, as
applicable, to continue to honor any accrued but unused personal, sick or
vacation time to which any Continuing Employee is entitled pursuant to the
personal, sick or vacation policies applicable to such Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time and allow such Continuing Employee to
use such accrued personal, sick or vacation time in accordance with the
practice and policies of the Company.

 

(e) To the extent that service is relevant for eligibility, vesting or
allowances (including paid time off) under any health or welfare benefit plan
of Parent and/or the Surviving Corporation, then Parent shall (i) waive all
limitations as to pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with
respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to the
Continuing Employees, to the extent that such conditions, exclusions and
waiting periods would not apply under a similar Employee Plan in which such
Continuing Employees participated prior to the Effective Time and (ii) ensure
that such health or welfare benefit plan shall, for purposes of eligibility,
vesting, deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums and allowances

 



46\.  (including paid time off), credit Continuing Employees for service and
amounts paid prior to the Effective Time with the Company to the same extent
that such service and amounts paid was recognized prior to the Effective Time
under a corresponding Employee Plan.

(f) The provisions of this Section 6.4 are solely for the benefit of the
Parties to this Agreement, and no provision of this Section 6.4 is intended
to, or shall, constitute the establishment or adoption of or an amendment to
any employee benefit plan for purposes of ERISA or otherwise and no current
or former employee or any other individual associated therewith shall be
regarded for any purpose as a third party beneficiary of the Agreement or have
the right to enforce the provisions hereof.

 

6.5 Indemnification of Officers and Directors.

 

(a) All rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation by
the Company existing in favor of those Persons who are directors and officers
of any Acquired Corporation as of the date of this Agreement or have been
directors and officers of any Acquired Corporation in the past (collectively,
the " _Indemnified Persons_ ") for their acts and omissions occurring prior
to the Effective Time, as provided in the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws (or applicable governing documents) of the applicable Acquired
Corporation (as in effect as of the date of this Agreement) and as provided
in the indemnification agreements between the Acquired Corporation and said
Indemnified Persons (as set forth on Part 6.5(a) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule and in effect as of the date of this Agreement) in the forms made
available by the Company to Parent or Parents Representatives prior to the
date of this Agreement, shall survive the Merger and shall not be amended,
repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect the
rights thereunder of such Indemnified Persons, and shall be observed by the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to the fullest extent available
under Delaware law for a period of six years from the Effective Time, and any
claim made pursuant to such rights within such six-year period shall continue
to be subject to this Section 6.5(a) and the rights provided under this
Section 6.5(a) until disposition of such claim.

 

(b) From the Effective Time until the sixth anniversary of the date on which
the Effective Time occurs, Parent and the Surviving Corporation (together
with their successors and assigns, the " _Indemnifying Parties_ ") shall, to
the extent described in Section 6.5(a), (i) indemnify and hold harmless each
Indemnified Person in his or her capacity as an officer or director of an
Acquired Corporation against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, fees,
expenses, judgments or fines incurred by such Indemnified Person as an officer
or director of an Acquired Corporation in connection with any pending or
threatened Legal Proceeding based on or arising out of, in whole or in part,
the fact that such Indemnified Person is or was a director or officer of an
Acquired Corporation at or prior to the Effective Time and pertaining to any
and all matters pending, existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time,
including any such matter arising under any claim with respect to the
transactions contemplated herein and (ii) advance reasonable and documented
out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable and documented
attorneys fees) incurred by the Indemnified Persons in connection with
matters for which such Indemnified Persons are eligible to be indemnified
pursuant to this Section 6.5(b) after receipt by Parent of a written request
for such advance, subject to the execution by such Indemnified Persons of
appropriate undertakings in favor of the Indemnifying Parties to repay such
advanced costs and

 



47\.  expenses if it is ultimately determined in a final and non-appealable
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that such Indemnified Person is
not entitled to be indemnified under this Section 6.5(b).

(c) From the Effective Time until the sixth anniversary of the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall maintain, and the Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to maintain, in effect, a policy of directors and
officers liability insurance that is substantially equivalent to
the existing policy maintained by the Company as of the date of this
Agreement (an accurate and complete copy of which has been made available by
the Company to Parent or Parents Representatives prior to the date of this
Agreement) for the benefit of the Indemnified Persons who are currently
covered by such existing policy with respect to their acts and omissions
occurring prior to the Effective Time in their capacities as directors and
officers of the Company (as applicable), on terms with respect to coverage,
deductibles and amounts no less favorable than the existing policy; _provided_
, _however_ , that at or prior to the Effective Time, Parent or the Company
may (through a nationally recognized insurance broker approved by Parent,
such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned)
purchase a six-year "tail" policy for the existing policy effective as of the
Effective Time and if such "tail policy" has been obtained, it shall be
deemed to satisfy all obligations to obtain and/or maintain insurance pursuant
to this Section 6.5(c); _provided, further_ , _however,_ that in no event
shall the Surviving Corporation be required to expend in any one year an
amount in excess of two hundred fifty percent (250%) of the annual premium
currently payable by the Company with respect to such current policy, it being
understood that if the annual premiums payable for such insurance coverage
exceeds such amount, Parent shall be obligated to cause the Surviving
Corporation to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost
equal to such amount.

 

(d) In the event Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
Entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such
case, Parent shall ensure that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, (or in the case of the Surviving
Corporation, at Parents option, Parent) shall assume the obligations set
forth in this Section 6.5.

(e) The provisions of this Section 6.5 shall survive the acceptance of Shares
for payment pursuant to the Offer and the consummation of the Merger and are
(i) intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of
the Indemnified Persons and their successors, assigns and heirs and (ii) in
addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification
or contribution that any such Person may have by contract or otherwise. Unless
required by applicable Legal Requirement, this Section 6.5 may not be amended,
altered or repealed after the Offer Acceptance Time in such a manner as to
adversely affect the rights of any Indemnified Person or any of their
successors, assigns or heirs without the prior written consent of the affected
Indemnified Person.

material filings or responses to be made by the Company in connection with

other Transactions, (ii) use reasonable best efforts to obtain each Consent
(if any) required to be obtained pursuant to any applicable Legal Requirement

filing made, each such notice given and each such Consent obtained by the
Company during the Pre-Closing Period.

 

6.8 Disclosure. The initial press releases relating to this Agreement shall be
issued independently by each of the Company and Parent. Parent and the
Company shall consult with each other before issuing such initial press
releases and thereafter Parent and the Company shall consult with each other

Company Associates without the other Partys written consent (which shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Notwithstanding the
foregoing: (a) each Party may, without such consultation or consent, make any
public statement in response to questions from the press, analysts, investors
or those attending industry conferences, make internal announcements to
employees and make disclosures in Company SEC Documents, so long as such
statements are consistent with previous press releases, public disclosures or
public statements made jointly by the Parties (or individually, if approved by
the other Party); (b) a Party may, without the prior consent of the
other Party but subject to giving advance notice to the other Party, issue
any such press release or make any such public announcement or statement as

statement or filing to be issued or made pursuant to Section 5.3(e) or with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal or Company Adverse Change Recommendation.

(a) If any Takeover Law may become, or may purport to be, applicable to the
Transactions, each of Parent and the Company and the members of their
respective Boards of Directors shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts to grant such approvals and take such

Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms and
conditions contemplated hereby and otherwise act to lawfully eliminate the
effect of any Takeover Law on any of the Transactions.

(b) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent (and shall subsequently

, that a Party shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this Section 8.1(b) if the failure of the acceptance for payment of

the " _End Date_ "); _provided, however,_ that a Party shall not be permitted
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(e) if the failure of

8.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination of this Agreement
as provided in Section 8.1, written notice thereof shall be given to the
other Party or Parties,

force and effect, (b) the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive the
termination of this Agreement and shall remain in full force and effect in

with respect to any such Acquisition Proposal, recommended any Acquisition
Proposal to its stockholders, or consummated any Acquisition Proposal (
_provided_ that for purposes of this clause (z) the references to "15%" in the

"50%");

 

then, in any such event under clause "(i)", "(ii)" or "(iii)" of this Section
8.3(b), the Company shall pay to Parent or its designee the Termination Fee
by wire transfer of same day funds (x) in the case of Section 8.3(b)(i), on

contemplated hereby (and the abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the

respective Affiliates (collectively, " _Parent Related Parties_ ") or any
other Person shall be entitled to bring or maintain any claim, action or
proceeding against the Company or any of its Affiliates arising out of or in
connection with this Agreement, any of the Transactions or any matters
forming the basis for such termination; _provided, however,_ that nothing in
this Section 8.3(b) shall limit the rights of Parent or Purchaser under
Section 9.5(b) or with respect to common law fraud or willful and
material breach of this Agreement by the Company prior to the date of
termination.

(c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to
Section 8.1(b) or Section 8.1(e), in any such case, due to the failure of the
condition set forth in clause "(a)" of Annex I, then the Company shall,
promptly and no later than two Business Days after the date of such
termination, pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent or its designee, the Parent
Expenses for which Parent has not theretofore been reimbursed by the Company.

 

(d) Parents right to receive payment from the Company of the Termination Fee
pursuant to Section 8.3(b) and any payments pursuant to Section 8.3(c) and

Parties against the Company and any of their respective former, current or
future officers, directors, partners, stockholders, optionholders, managers,
members or Affiliates (collectively, " _Company Related Parties_ ") for any
loss suffered as a result of the failure of the Offer or the Merger to be
consummated or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise, and

any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this

are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
that, without these agreements, the Parties would not enter into this

(including reasonable and documented attorneys fees) in connection with such

55\. 9.2 Waiver. No failure on the part of any Party to exercise any power, right,
privilege or remedy under this Agreement, and no delay on the part of any
Party in exercising any power, right, privilege or remedy under this
Agreement, shall operate as a waiver of such power, right, privilege or
remedy; and no single or partial exercise of any such power, right, privilege

delivered on behalf of such Party; and any such waiver shall not

delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Merger.

 

9.4 Entire Agreement; Counterparts. This Agreement and the other agreements,
exhibits, annexes and schedules (including the Company Disclosure Schedule)
referred to herein constitute the entire agreement and supersede all prior
agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among or between any of
the Parties, with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof; 
_provided, however,_ that the Confidentiality Agreement shall not be
superseded and shall remain in full force and effect; _provided, further,
that,_ if the Effective Time occurs, the Confidentiality Agreement shall

may be executed in several counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an
original and all of which shall constitute one and the same instrument. The
exchange of a fully executed Agreement (in counterparts or otherwise) by PDF

Agreement.

 



56\. 9.5 Applicable Legal Requirements; Jurisdiction; Specific Performance;
Remedies. 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that might otherwise
govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof. Subject to
Section 9.5(c), in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement: (i) each
of the Parties irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the Chancery Court of the State of
Delaware and any state appellate court therefrom or, if such court
lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the United States District Court sitting
in New Castle County in the State of Delaware (it being agreed that the
consents to jurisdiction and venue set forth in this Section 9.5(a) shall not
constitute general consents to service of process in the State of Delaware
and shall have no effect for any purpose except as provided in this paragraph
and shall not be deemed to confer rights on any Person other than the Parties
hereto); and (ii) each of the Parties irrevocably consents to service of
process by first class certified mail, return receipt requested, postage
prepaid, to the address at which such Party is to receive notice in accordance
with Section 9.8. The Parties hereto agree that a final judgment in any such
action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by
applicable Legal Requirements; _provided, however,_ that nothing in
the foregoing shall restrict any Partys rights to seek any post-judgment
relief regarding, or any appeal from, such final trial court judgment.

 

(b) The Parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even
if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that
the Parties hereto do not perform their obligations under the provisions of
this Agreement in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such
provisions. Subject to the following sentence, the Parties acknowledge and
agree that (i) the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions,
specific performance, or other equitable relief, to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in the
courts described in Section 9.5(a) without proof of damages or otherwise
prior to the valid termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section
8.1, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled
under this Agreement, (ii) the provisions set forth in Section 8.3: (x) are
not intended to and do not adequately compensate for the harm that would
result from a breach of this Agreement; and (y) shall not be construed to
diminish or otherwise impair in any respect any Partys right to specific
enforcement and (iii) the right of specific performance is an integral part of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and without that right,
neither the Company nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement. Each
of the Parties hereto agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that
the other Parties hereto have an adequate remedy at law or an award of
specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or
equity. The Parties hereto acknowledge and agree that any Party seeking an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in accordance
with this Section 9.5(b) shall not be required to provide any bond or other
security in connection with any such order or injunction. For the avoidance of
doubt, while the Company may pursue both a grant of specific performance in
accordance with this Section 9.5 and concurrently pursue the payment of any
damages under Section 8.2, under no circumstances shall the Company be
permitted or entitled to receive both (A) a grant of specific performance

(including legal fees) incurred by or on behalf of any of the Acquired
Corporations or Affiliates in connection with the Companys pursuit of such
grant of specific performance, which Parent or Purchaser shall pay or cause to
be paid to the Company if the Company is actually granted specific performance
in accordance with this Section 9.5(b)) and (B) damages under Section 8.2.

(c) EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL
BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING BETWEEN THE PARTIES HERETO (WHETHER BASED ON
CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE), INCLUDING ANY COUNTERCLAIM, ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE
ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND

enforceable by and inure solely to the benefit of, the Parties hereto and
their respective successors and permitted assigns; _provided, however,_ that
neither this Agreement nor any of the rights hereunder may be assigned without
the prior written consent of the other Parties hereto, and any attempted
assignment of this Agreement or any of such rights without such consent shall
be void and of no effect; _provided, further, however,_ that Parent or
Purchaser may assign this Agreement to any of their Affiliates ( _provided_
that such assignment shall not impede or delay the consummation of the
Transactions or otherwise impede the rights of the stockholders of the Company
under this Agreement); _provided_ that no such assignment or pledge permitted
pursuant to this Section 9.6 shall relieve Parent of its obligations
hereunder.

9.7 No Third Party Beneficiaries. Nothing in this Agreement, express or
implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any Person (other than the
Parties hereto) any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or
by reason of this Agreement; except for: (i) if the Offer Acceptance Time

9.9 Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid or
unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the

covenants, obligations and liabilities.

9.11 Guarantee. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
Guarantor absolutely and irrevocably guarantees to the Company, as the
primary obligor and not merely as surety, the due and punctual payment of the
obligations of Parent and Purchaser (and the full and timely performance
thereof) pursuant to this Agreement (the " _Obligations_ "); provided,
however, that in no event shall Guarantors liability under this Section 9.11
exceed $270,000,000. If Parent or Purchaser fails to pay the Obligations when
due, then all of the Guarantors liabilities

 



60\.  to the Company hereunder in respect of such Obligations shall, at the
Companys option, become immediately due and payable and the Company may at
any time and from time to time take any and all actions available hereunder
or under applicable law to enforce and collect the Obligations from the
Guarantor. In furtherance of the foregoing, Guarantor acknowledges that the
Company may, in its sole discretion, bring and prosecute a separate action or
actions against the Guarantor for the full amount of the Obligations,
regardless of whether any action is brought against Parent. To the fullest
extent permitted by law, the Guarantor hereby expressly and unconditionally
waives any and all rights or defenses arising by reason of any law,
promptness, diligence, notice of the acceptance of this guarantee and of the
Obligation, presentment, demand for payment, notice of non-performance,
default, dishonor and protest, notice of the Obligation incurred and all
other notices of any kind. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
Guarantor reserves the right to assert any and all defenses which Parent or
Purchaser may have to payment of the Obligations. The Guarantor acknowledges

transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that the waivers set forth in
this Guarantee are knowingly made in contemplation of such benefits.

9.12 Transfer Taxes. Except as expressly provided in Section 2.6(b), all
transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration, value-added and other
similar Taxes and fees incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by Parent and Purchaser when
due.

an Organizational and Management Model in accordance  in Italy  with Article
6 of Legislative Decree No. 231 of 2001 and  in the USA  with the United
States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 and following amendments (FCPA).

gender shall include the feminine and neuter genders; the feminine gender
