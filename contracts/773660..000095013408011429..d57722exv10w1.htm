The Reinsurer represents and warrants to the Companies and HealthMarkets as

5.1 _Reinsurer s Corporate Existence and Authority_. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (a) The Reinsurer is a stock life insurance company duly organized, existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Minnesota and is duly qualified and possesses all licenses, permits, approvals, authorizations and consents necessary to transact life, accident, and health insurance and/or reinsurance on an authorized basis, and possesses a certificate of authority, permit or license (or is exempted from such requirements) to act as a third party administrator in each of the jurisdictions in the United States shown on Schedule 5.1(a). All of such licenses, permits, approvals, authorizations and consents are valid and in full force and effect, except where the failure of which to be in full force and effect would not reasonably be expected to cause a Material Adverse Effect. The Reinsurer is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where such qualification is necessary, except for those jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect. 

   

 (b) The Reinsurer has all requisite corporate power and authority to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and the consummation by the Reinsurer of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Reinsurer. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered to the Ceding Companies and HealthMarkets by the Reinsurer and assuming due authorization, execution, delivery and performance by the other parties hereto, constitutes, and each Ancillary Agreement, when executed and delivered by the Reinsurer (assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by the other parties thereto) shall constitute, the valid and legally binding obligation of the Reinsurer, enforceable in accordance with its terms except as the same may be limited by the Enforceability Exception. 

   

 (c) The execution, delivery and performance by the Reinsurer of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements does not and will not (1) subject to obtaining the consents, approvals and authorizations set forth in Schedule 5.1(d), conflict with or result in any breach or violation of or any default under (or give rise to any right of termination, cancellation or acceleration under) (i) the bylaws or certificate of incorporation of the Reinsurer or (ii) any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, lease, license, permit, agreement or other instrument or obligation to which the Reinsurer is a party or by which the Reinsurer is or may be bound, excluding from the foregoing such breaches, violations or defaults that would not have a Material Adverse Effect; and (2) subject to obtaining the Required Closing Date Approvals, violate any Applicable Law to which the Reinsurer is subject. 

   

 (d) Except as set forth in Schedule 5.1(d), no consent, approval, non-disapproval, authorization, ruling, order of, notice to, or registration with, any Governmental Authority or any other Person is required on the part of the Reinsurer in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the 

   ##### 

  

    

Ancillary Agreements or the consummation by the Reinsurer, of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. 

   

 5.2 _Availability of Funds; Financial Impact_. At Closing, the Reinsurer will have sufficient cash or immediately available funds necessary to enable it to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements. The Reinsurer has sufficient capital and surplus as reported on its SAP financial statements filed with any Governmental Authority so that, after giving effect to the capital contribution provided to the Reinsurer as described on Schedule 5.2 and the receipt of assets from the Ceding Companies at Closing as contemplated by the Coinsurance Agreements, the establishment of the Statutory Reserves and Liabilities related to the Policies would not result in a reduction of its RBC Ratio (as defined in the Coinsurance Agreements) below 200%. 

   

 5.3 _Financial Statements_. The Reinsurer has previously delivered or made available to HealthMarkets and the Ceding Companies true, complete and correct copies of the following financial statements of the Reinsurer (collectively, the " _Reinsurer Financial Statements_ "): 

   

 (a) the annual audited financial statements as of and for each of the fiscal years ended December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2007, together with the exhibits, schedules and notes thereto (including the audit reports thereon); 

   

 (b) the annual statements of the Reinsurer filed with the insurance regulatory authorities in its state of domicile for each of the fiscal years ended December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2007 (including the supporting memoranda to the actuarial opinions given in connection with such annual statements); 

   

 (c) any annual statements of the Reinsurer that were filed for the year ended December 31, 2007 in any jurisdiction which differ in any material respect from the annual statements for the year ended December 31, 2007 referred to above in clause (b); and 

   

 (d) the unaudited quarterly statements of the Reinsurer for the calendar quarter ended March 31, 2008, as filed with the insurance regulatory authorities in its state of domicile. 

 

Except as set forth in Schedule 5.3, the Reinsurer Financial Statements
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial condition and results
of operations of the Reinsurer as of and for the period specified therein,
and were prepared in accordance with SAP, applied on a consistent basis for
the periods presented; _provided, however,_ that the unaudited statutory
balance sheet and statement of income of the Reinsurer, as of and for the
period ended March 31, 2008, are subject to normal recurring year-end
adjustments. 

    

 5.4 _Ratings_. As of the date hereof, the Reinsurer has a claims-paying ability or financial strength rating from A.M. Best and Co. of at least "A-." The Reinsurer has no reason to believe as of the date hereof that such rating will be adversely affected by the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any of the 

   ##### 

  

    

Ancillary Agreements, or by any other event, fact or circumstance of which
the Reinsurer is aware as of the date hereof. 

   

 5.5 _Absence of Certain Changes_. Except as set forth in Schedule 5.5, since December 31, 2007, there has not been any event, occurrence or development which has had, or would be reasonably expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect on the Reinsurer. Except as set forth in Schedule 5.5, since December 31, 2007, the Reinsurer has conducted its business in the ordinary course consistent with past practice. 

   

 5.6 _Compliance with Applicable Law_. The Reinsurer is (and, after giving effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, the Reinsurer will be) in compliance with all Applicable Law with respect to the conduct of its business and operations (including capital requirements), except where the failure to so comply would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. 

   

 5.7 _Litigation Against Reinsurer_. There are no actions, suits, investigations or proceedings pending or (to the Knowledge of the Reinsurer) threatened against the Reinsurer at law or in equity, in, before, or by any Person, that individually or in the aggregate have or would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. 

  

 5.8 _Reinsurer s Brokers_. Except for the persons or entities identified on Schedule 5.8 hereto (and for whose compensation the Reinsurer shall be solely responsible), no broker or finder has acted directly or indirectly for the Reinsurer, nor has the Reinsurer incurred any obligation to pay any brokerage or finders fee or other commission in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

 5.9 _Non-Reliance_. The Reinsurer is an informed and sophisticated purchaser, and has undertaken such investigation with respect to the Business and the Transferred Assets as it has deemed necessary to make an informed decision with respect to the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements. 

  

 5.10 _Investment Intent_. Reinsurer is acquiring the Offshore Assets for its own account and not with a view to their distribution within the meaning of Section 2(11) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. 

  

 5.11 _No Knowledge of Material Adverse Effect_. As of the date hereof, to the Knowledge of the Reinsurer, no Material Adverse Affect exists as to the ability of the Reinsurer to enter into this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

The Reinsurer shall maintain all books, records, files and other information related to the Coinsured Policies for such period of time as specified by Applicable Law regulating the preservation of books and records or such longer period of time as determined by the Reinsurer in accordance with its standard documentation retention practices.

their Books and Records relating to the Business, and shall furnish the
Reinsurer with such financial, operating and other data and information with

subcontractors or agents, may reasonably request. In exercising its
rights hereunder, the Reinsurer shall conduct itself so as not to
unreasonably interfere in the conduct of the business of the Ceding Companies

Companies shall undertake measures reasonably designed to preserve any
relevant privilege or confidentiality obligations that might otherwise be
lost or breached in connection with such access. 

   

 6.8 _Filings, Consents and Approvals_. The parties shall cooperate and use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all approvals and consents to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, including, without limitation, the Required Closing Date Approvals and the consents of third parties under the assigned contracts included in the Transferred Assets, and shall cooperate with each other and provide such information and communications to such Governmental Authorities as the party responsible for obtaining such approvals may reasonably request; provided that the Reinsurer shall not bear any cost or assume additional risk with respect to the assignment of any assigned contract included in the Transferred Assets (including without limitation any such assignment as to which a counter-party consent is a Required Closing Date Approval), and HealthMarkets and the Ceding Companies shall not be required to bear any cost or undertake any additional obligation, risk or arrangement in connection with obtaining Required Closing Date Approvals, other than any consent or approval that relate to the assignment of any contract included in the Transferred Assets that is a Required Closing Date Approval.

Following Closing, HealthMarkets and the Ceding Companies shall continue to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such consents, and if and when any such approval or consent shall be obtained or such agreement or license shall otherwise become assignable, HealthMarkets and each of the Ceding Companies shall promptly assign all of its rights and obligations thereunder to the Reinsurer without the payment of further consideration and the Reinsurer shall, without the payment of any 

   ##### 

  

    

further consideration therefor, assume such rights and obligations and

obligation or liability thereunder.

No such information shall impact any representation or warranty of the party disclosing such information in connection with any breach of any representation or warranty; provided that a breach of this _Section 6.9_ shall not be considered for purposes of determining the satisfaction of the closing conditions set forth in _Article VII_ or give rise to a right of termination under _Article XI_ if the underlying breach or breaches with respect to which the other party failed to give notice would not result in the failure of the closing conditions set forth in _Article VII_ or would not result in the ability of such non-breaching Party to terminate this Agreement under _Article XI_, as the case may be. 

   

 6.10 _Further Assurances_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Ceding Companies, HealthMarkets and the Reinsurer will use their best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions or to do, or cause to be done, all things or execute any documents reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements.

Insurance Company," "Mid-West National Life Insurance Company of Tennessee,"
or "The MEGA Life and Health Insurance Company," "Fidelity First Insurance

Policies in processing Permitted Transactions under the Policies.

For each risk reinsured hereunder that has been replaced under a program of internal replacement, in addition to any other remedies it may have at law or in equity, the Reinsurer shall have the option at its sole discretion of either treating the risks reinsured as recaptured on terms reasonably acceptable to the Reinsurer or continuing reinsurance on the new policy under the terms of the applicable Coinsurance Agreement without any additional ceding allowance therefor.

From and after the Closing Date, Reinsurer shall be responsible for providing any notification that may be required under the WARN Act with respect to its employees, including the Transferred Employees. 

   

 (h) Nothing in this Section 6.17 is intended to or shall require either HealthMarkets or Reinsurer to employ or continue to employ any employee for any period of time following the Closing Date or to continue to maintain any term or condition of employment, including, without limitation, the position, title, compensation, location or employer, with respect to any such employee or otherwise to treat any such employee on any basis other than as an employee-at-will.

 8.2.2. _Taxes for Short Taxable Year of Transferred Companies_. To the extent such action is permitted by applicable law, HealthMarkets and the Reinsurer shall close all relevant taxable periods of the Transferred Companies as of the close of business on the Closing Date. In any case in which a taxable period of the Transferred Companies cannot be closed as of the Closing Date, then, for purposes of this Agreement, the determination of Taxes of the Transferred Companies for each of the Pre-Closing Period and the Post-Closing Period of any resulting Straddle Period shall be determined on the basis of an interim closing of the books of the Transferred Companies as of the close of business on the Closing Date, except that exemptions, allowances, deductions or similar amounts that are calculated on an annual basis, such as the deduction for depreciation, and Taxes that are imposed ratably during a taxable period, shall be ratably apportioned on a per diem basis. 

   

 8.2.3. _Preparation and Filing of Tax Returns_. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (a) HealthMarkets shall cause to be prepared and timely filed, taking into account all valid extensions of time to file, all Tax Returns of the Transferred Companies (or Tax Returns in which the Transferred Companies are required to be included) that are due to be filed (taking into account extensions) on or before the Closing Date. HealthMarkets represents, warrants and covenants that (i) all such Tax Returns shall be prepared consistent with past practices and shall be true, accurate and complete in all material respects, and (ii) it shall pay or cause to be paid to the appropriate Governmental Authority on a timely basis the full amount of Taxes required to be shown on such Tax Returns. HealthMarkets shall provide the Reinsurer a copy of each such Tax Return or portion thereof related to the Transferred Companies, as filed. 

   

 (b) The Reinsurer shall cause to be prepared and timely filed (taking into account extensions) (i) all Tax Returns of the Transferred Companies that are due to be filed (taking into account extensions) after the Closing Date and (ii) all Tax Returns of the Transferred Companies for any Straddle Period. The Reinsurer represents, warrants and covenants that (i) all such Tax Returns shall be prepared consistent with past practices and shall be true, accurate and complete in all material respects, and (ii) it shall pay or cause to be paid to the appropriate Governmental Authority on a timely basis the full amount of Taxes required to be shown on such Tax Returns. Reinsurer shall provide to HealthMarkets a copy of such Tax Return at least 30 days prior to the due date thereof for HealthMarkets review and approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. HealthMarkets shall provide the Reinsurer its comments within 20 days of the receipt of such Tax Return. HealthMarkets shall remit to the Reinsurer no later than 3 days prior to the filing of any such Tax Return the portion of the Taxes shown on such Tax Return for which HealthMarkets is liable under this Agreement. 

   

 (c) HealthMarkets shall have the right to file (or cause to be filed or require the Reinsurer to file or cause to be filed) any amended Tax Return with respect to the Transferred Companies to the extent that such amended Tax Return (i) is in respect of any taxable period or portion thereof ending on or before the Closing Date and (ii) does not have an adverse effect on the Transferred Companies or the Reinsurer for any taxable period or portion thereof beginning after the Closing Date. The Reinsurer may only file amended Tax Returns in respect of any taxable period or portion thereof ending on or before the Closing Date following receipt of HealthMarkets written approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. 

   

 8.2.4. _Tax Proceedings_. 

   

 (a) Each party hereto shall provide the other with prompt notice of any Tax adjustment proposed by any Governmental Authority or other claim which could give rise to a claim for indemnification under Article VIII or Article X; _provided_ that the failure to provide such notice shall not affect any right to indemnification under this Agreement except to the extent the party not receiving 

   ##### 

  

    

notice is materially prejudiced thereby. If the resolution of any
Tax proceeding would be grounds for indemnification under this Agreement by
the party not in control of the conduct of such Tax proceeding pursuant to
this Section 8.2.4 (the " _Non-Controlling Party_ "), (A) the party in
control of such Tax proceeding (the " _Controlling Party_ ") shall keep the
Non-Controlling Party fully informed of any proceedings, events and
developments relating to or in connection with such Tax Proceeding; (B) the
Non-Controlling Party shall be entitled to receive copies of all
correspondence and documents relating to such Tax proceeding; and (C) at its
own cost and expense, the Non-Controlling Party shall have the right to
participate in (but not control) the conduct of such Tax proceeding.
Notwithstanding any such control (1) the Reinsurer shall not, and shall not
permit the Transferred Companies to, enter into any settlement or admit
any fault or liability with respect to any Tax proceeding that could give
rise to a claim for indemnification hereunder without HealthMarkets express
written prior consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed, and (2) HealthMarkets shall not enter into any settlement or admit
any fault or liability that is or purports to be binding on the Transferred
Companies for any taxable period that could have any adverse effect on the
liability of the Reinsurer or the Transferred Companies for Taxes for any
period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date, without the
Reinsurers express written prior consent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. 

   

 (b) HealthMarkets shall have the sole right to control any Tax proceeding relating to taxable periods of the Transferred Companies ending on or before the Closing Date, and to employ counsel of its choice and expense. 

   

 (c) With respect to Straddle Periods, the parties shall jointly control any Tax proceedings, and neither party shall admit any fault or liability, or settle or compromise any matter, without the prior written consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. 

   

 (d) The Reinsurer shall have the sole right to control any Tax proceeding relating to taxable periods of the Transferred Companies beginning on or after the Closing Date. 

   

 8.2.5. _Record Retention_. Any tax books, records and information of or relating to the Transferred Companies shall be retained by HealthMarkets and the Reinsurer until the expiration of the relevant statute of limitations applicable to the Taxes at issue. If HealthMarkets or the Reinsurer shall desire to dispose of any of such Tax books, records and information after the expiration of such period, such disposing party shall, prior to such disposition, give the other party a reasonable opportunity, at the other partys expense, to segregate and remove such books, records and information as the other party may select. 

   

 8.3 _Survival of Obligations_. The obligations of the parties set forth in Article VIII shall remain in effect until the later of (i) the closing of the period of the relevant 

   ##### 

  

    

statute of limitations applicable to the Taxes at issue or (ii) resolution of
any claims made pursuant to Article VIII prior to such date. 

   

 8.4 _Tax Sharing Agreement_. All Tax sharing agreements, Tax allocation agreements or similar agreements relating to Taxes (other than this Agreement) with respect to or involving the Transferred Companies shall be terminated as of the Closing, and, after the Closing Date, neither the Reinsurer and the Transferred Companies nor HealthMarkets (or any of its direct or indirect Affiliates) shall be bound thereby or have any liability thereunder. 

   

 8.5 _Certain Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and similar Taxes and fees (including any penalties and interest) incurred in connection with this Agreement shall be borne equally by the Reinsurer on the one hand and HealthMarkets on the other hand, and the Reinsurer and HealthMarkets shall cooperate in the filing of all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all such transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other Taxes and fees. If required by applicable legal requirements, the Reinsurer and HealthMarkets will join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other documentation. The Reinsurer or HealthMarkets, as the case may be, shall promptly, but in no case later than the due date for payment, reimburse HealthMarkets or the Reinsurer, as the case may be, in full for the reimbursing partys one-half share of any amounts paid by the other party in connection with any such Taxes or Tax Returns. 

   

 8.6 _Allocation_. Unless otherwise required by a determination (as defined in Section 1313 of the Code), neither the Reinsurer (or its Affiliates) nor HealthMarkets (or its Affiliates) shall file any Tax Return or take a position before any Governmental Authority that is inconsistent with the allocation of consideration as reasonably determined by the HealthMarkets and the Ceding Companies, with the approval of the Reinsurer, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. 

   

 8.7 _Tax Treatment of Payments_. HealthMarkets and the Reinsurer shall treat any indemnity payments made pursuant to _Article X_ and this _Article VIII_ as adjustments to the relevant portion of the Total Consideration for Tax purposes unless otherwise required pursuant to a "determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code or a similar or analogous provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. 

   

 8.8 _Refunds_. The Reinsurer shall pay (or cause to be paid) to HealthMarkets any refunds or credits of Taxes received or realized by the Reinsurer with respect to which HealthMarkets has agreed to provide indemnification under this Agreement (including any interest paid thereon and net of any Taxes incurred in respect of the receipt or accrual of the refund). 

   ##### 

  

  

ARTICLE IX 

   

 _ARBITRATION_   

   

 9.1 _Agreement to Arbitrate_. It is the intention of the parties that customs and usages of the business of insurance shall be given full effect in the interpretation of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements. All disputes (other than disputes relating to the Calculations which shall be resolved in accordance with Article II hereof and any disputes under Sections 3.1 and 3.2 of each Coinsurance Agreement) between the Reinsurer, on the one hand, and HealthMarkets or the Companies, on the other hand, arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements, including the formation and validity thereof, on which an amicable understanding cannot be reached will be decided by arbitration between the parties. Notwithstanding any other provision of this _Article IX_, if either the Reinsurer, HealthMarkets or any of the Ceding Companies seeks, consents to, or acquiesces in the appointment of or otherwise becomes subject to any trustee, receiver, liquidator or conservator (including any state insurance regulatory agency or authority acting in such a capacity), the other party shall not be obligated to resolve any claim, dispute or cause of action under this Agreement by arbitration. Notwithstanding any other provision of this _Article IX_, nothing contained in this Agreement shall require arbitration of any issue for which equitable or injunctive relief, including specific performance, is sought. 

   

 9.2 _Method_. The parties intend this _Article IX_ to be enforceable in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. Section 1, et seq.), including any amendments to that Act which are subsequently adopted, notwithstanding any other choice of law provision set forth in this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements. In the event that either party refuses to submit to arbitration as required herein, the other party may request a United States Federal District Court to compel arbitration in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act. Both parties consent to the jurisdiction of such court to enforce this article and to confirm and enforce the performance of any award of the arbitrators. Arbitration shall be conducted before a three-person arbitration panel appointed as follows: to initiate arbitration, either party shall notify the other in writing in the manner set forth in this Agreement for sending notices to the parties of its desire to arbitrate, stating the nature of the dispute and the remedy sought, and designating an arbitrator. The party to which the notice is sent shall respond thereto in writing within thirty (30) days of its receipt of such notice. In such response, the party shall also assert any claim, defense and other dispute it may have against the party initiating arbitration, and which arises out of or relates in any way to this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements, and designate its arbitrator. If the second party fails to respond within the time period set forth in this _Section 9.2_, or fails to designate its arbitrator in its response, the party initiating arbitration shall appoint a second arbitrator. The two arbitrators shall select an umpire within thirty (30) days of the designation of the second arbitrator. If they are unable to agree upon the selection of the umpire within thirty (30) days of the appointment of the second arbitrator, the parties shall appoint the umpire pursuant to the ARIAS-US Umpire Selection Procedure. The arbitrators and umpire shall be either present or former executive officers of life or health insurance or reinsurance companies, be certified to act as arbitrators or umpires by ARIAS-US, shall not be under the control 

   ##### 

  

    

of either party and shall have no financial interest in the outcome of the
arbitration. The arbitrators shall have the power to determine all procedural
rules for the conduct of the arbitration, including but not limited to the
production and inspection of documents, the examination of witnesses and any
other matter relating to the conduct of the arbitration. The arbitrators and
the umpire shall interpret this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements as an
honorable engagement and not merely as legal obligations between the parties.
In so far as not in conflict with the express terms of this Agreement or
the Ancillary Agreements, it is the intent of the parties hereto that customs
and practices of the life and reinsurance industries may be considered by the
arbitrators and the umpire in resolving any ambiguities inherent in this
Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements or, the operation thereof. In the
absence of any such ambiguity, the express terms of this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements will control. The arbitrators and umpire may
abstain from following the strict rules of law; provided, however, that the
arbitrators shall have no authority to award equitable relief or punitive
damages against or in favor of either party (except to reimburse a party for
extra-contractual or punitive damages that either the Ceding Companies or the
Reinsurer has paid or is legally obligated to pay to third parties). Unless
the arbitration panel orders otherwise, each party shall pay: (1) the fees
and expenses of its own arbitrator; and (2) an equal share of the fees and
expenses of the umpire and the other expenses of the arbitration. Each party
shall pay its own legal fees in connection with the arbitration, unless the
arbitrators award legal fees and expenses of the prevailing party as part of
any award. Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, the arbitration
shall be conducted in accordance with the Procedures for the Resolution of
U.S. Insurance and Reinsurance Disputes, Regular Panel Version, April
2004. The arbitration shall be held in Dallas, Texas, or at such other
location as may be designated by the arbitrators. The decision, in writing,
of the arbitrators shall be final and binding upon both of the parties.
Judgment may be entered upon the final decision of the arbitrators in any
court having jurisdiction. The arbitration will be conducted on
a confidential basis and no matters discussed or disclosed by any party at
the arbitration, or any decision or award of the arbitrators, will be
admitted into evidence or otherwise disclosed or used before any court or
other legal, regulatory or administrative body, authority or forum for any
purpose except as and to the extent necessary for entry of final judgment on
the award of the arbitrators in any court having jurisdiction.

Notwithstanding anything in this _Article X_ to the contrary, HealthMarkets and/or the Ceding Companies shall not have any indemnification liability under _Sections 10.2.1(i)_ or _10.2.2(i)_ hereof or Section 9.2(a) of the Student Loan Purchase Agreement (a) if the Loss arising from any particular act, circumstance, development, event, fact, occurrence or omission is less than fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000) (the " _Mini Threshold_ "); provided that all Losses arising from similar or related underlying facts, events or circumstances shall be aggregated in determining whether the Mini Threshold is met, and (b) unless the aggregate of all Losses (without counting any Losses not exceeding the Mini Threshold but including the full amount of Losses if such Losses exceed the Mini Threshold) for which HealthMarkets and/or the Ceding Companies would otherwise be liable hereunder and thereunder exceeds one and one-half percent (1.5%) of the sum of the Total Consideration and the Purchase Price as defined in the Student Loan Purchase Agreement (the " _Indemnification Threshold_ "), in which event HealthMarkets 

   ##### 

  

    

and/or the Ceding Companies, as applicable, shall be obligated to indemnify
the Reinsurer Indemnified Parties for the full amount of such Losses without
regard to the Indemnification Threshold, and the maximum amount for which
HealthMarkets and the Ceding Companies shall be liable in the aggregate under
_Sections 10.2.1(i)_ and  _10.2.2(i)_ hereof and Section 9.2(a) of the
Student Loan Purchase Agreement shall not exceed thirty-five percent (35.0%)
of the Total Consideration plus the Purchase Price as defined in the Student
Loan Purchase Agreement; provided, however, that the foregoing limitation
shall not apply, expressly or by implication, to claims based on  _Sections
3.1, 3.10, 3.11, 4.1, 4.2 or 4.3_ hereof or Sections 5.1, 5.2, 5.3 or 5.13 of
the Student Loan Purchase Agreement. 

   

 10.2.5. Notwithstanding anything in this _Article X_ to the contrary, the Reinsurer shall not have any indemnification liability under _Section 10.2.3(i)_ hereof or Section 9.3(a) of the Student Loan Purchase Agreement (a) if the Loss arising from any particular act, circumstance, development, event, fact, occurrence or omission is less than the Mini Threshold; provided that all Losses arising from similar or related underlying facts, events or circumstances shall be aggregated in determining whether the Mini Threshold is met, and (b) unless the aggregate of all Losses (without counting any Losses not exceeding the Mini Threshold but including the full amount of Losses if such Losses exceed the Mini Threshold) for which the Reinsurer would otherwise be liable hereunder and thereunder exceeds the Indemnification Threshold, in which event the Reinsurer shall be obligated to indemnify the Ceding Company Indemnified Parties or HealthMarkets, as applicable, for the amount of such Losses without regard to the Indemnification Threshold, and the maximum amount for which the Reinsurer shall be liable in the aggregate under _Section 10.2.3(i)_ hereof and Section 9.3(a) of the Student Loan Purchase Agreement shall not exceed thirty-five Percent (35.0%) of the sum of the Total Consideration and the Purchase Price as defined in the Student Loan Purchase Agreement; provided, however, that the foregoing limitation shall not apply, expressly or by implication, to claims based on _Sections 5.1 or 5.8_ hereof or Sections 6.1 or 6.6 of the Student Loan Purchase Agreement. 

   

 10.3 _Notice of Claim_. As soon as reasonably possible, but in no event subsequent to thirty (30) days after receipt by an indemnified party hereunder of written notice of any demand, claim or circumstances which, upon the lapse of time, would give rise to a claim or the commencement (or threatened commencement) of any action, proceeding or investigation (a " _Claim_ ") that may result in a Loss, such indemnified party shall give notice thereof (" _Claims Notice_ ") to the indemnifying party. The Claims Notice shall describe the Claim in reasonable detail, and shall indicate the amount (estimated, if necessary) of the Loss that has been or may be suffered by such indemnified party. The failure of the indemnified party to give the Claims Notice within in the time provided for herein shall not affect the indemnifying partys obligation under this _Article X_ except if, and then only to the extent that, such failure materially prejudices the indemnifying party or its ability to defend such Claim. 

   

 10.4 _Opportunity to Defend_. Within thirty (30) days of receipt of any Claims Notice given pursuant to _Section 10.3_, the indemnifying party shall notify the indemnified 

   ##### 

  

    

party in writing of the acceptance of or objection to the Claim and whether
the indemnifying party will indemnify the indemnified party and defend the
same at the expense of the indemnifying party with counsel selected by the
indemnifying party (who shall be approved in writing by the indemnified
party, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld); provided that the
indemnified party shall at all times have the right to fully participate in
the defense of the Claim at its own expense or, as provided hereinbelow, at
the expense of the indemnifying party. Failure by the indemnifying party to
object in writing within such thirty (30) day period shall be deemed to be
acceptance of the Claim by the indemnifying party. In the event that the
indemnifying party objects to a Claim within said thirty (30) days or
does not object but fails to meet its indemnification obligations hereunder,
the indemnified party shall have the right, but not the obligation, to
undertake the defense, and to compromise and/or settle (in the exercise of
reasonable business judgment) the Claim, all at the risk and expense
(including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) of
the indemnifying party. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, the
indemnified party shall not compromise and/or settle any Claim without the
prior written consent of the indemnifying party, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld. If the Claim is one that cannot by its nature be
defended solely by the indemnifying party, the indemnified party shall
make available all information and assistance that the indemnifying party may
reasonably request, provided that any associated expense shall be paid by the
indemnifying party. 

   

 10.5 _Limitation on Indemnification_. Neither party shall be entitled to indemnification unless the party seeking indemnification makes claim therefore pursuant to the procedures set forth in _Section 10.3_ of this Agreement. All indemnification payments under this _Article X_ shall be treated by the parties as adjustments to the relevant portion of the Total Consideration. 

   

 10.6 _Survival of Representations and Warranties_. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein or therein, the representations and warranties made by the Ceding Companies, HealthMarkets and the Reinsurer in this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, or in any certificate delivered by the Ceding Companies, HealthMarkets or the Reinsurer pursuant hereto or thereto, and the indemnification obligations of the Ceding Companies, HealthMarkets and the Reinsurer with respect thereto, shall survive for a period of eighteen (18) months following the Closing Date; provided, however, that the representations and warranties made by the Ceding Companies, HealthMarkets and the Reinsurer in _Sections 3.1(a), 3.1(b), 3.10, 3.11, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 5.1_ and _5.8_ shall survive indefinitely, and the representations and warranties of the Ceding Companies and HealthMarkets with respect to Taxes in _Sections 3.5_ and _4.2_ shall survive until the expiration of any statute of limitations applicable to the Taxes at issue. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any representation or warranty, and the indemnification obligations with respect thereto, that would otherwise terminate in accordance with this _Section 10.6_ shall continue to survive, if notice of a claim shall have been timely given under _Section 10.3_ on or prior to the date such representation or warranty would otherwise expire, until such claim has been satisfied or otherwise resolved as provided in this Agreement. All covenants and agreements made by the parties to the extent that the foregoing, by their express terms, are to have effect or be performed after the Closing Date, shall survive the Closing in accordance with their terms. 

   ##### 

  

   

 10.7 _Exclusive Remedy_. Except with respect to intentional fraud, from and after the Closing, the sole and exclusive remedy for any breach or failure to be true and correct, or alleged breach or failure to be true and correct, of any representation or warranty or any covenant or agreement in this Agreement, shall be indemnification in accordance with this  _Article X_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this _Section 10.7_ shall not limit the rights of the parties to seek equitable remedies (including specific performance or injunctive relief). 

  

ARTICLE XI

 11.1.5. Either the Ceding Companies and HealthMarkets or the Reinsurer may terminate this Agreement if Closing hereunder has not occurred by November 30, 2008, unless the failure of Closing to occur by such date arises out of, or results from, a material breach of this Agreement by the party seeking to terminate this Agreement; provided, however, that if Closing has not occurred due to the lack of

 _BASIS OF COINSURANCE_   

  

 2.1 _Coinsurance_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, effective as of the Coinsurance Effective Date, the Ceding Company hereby cedes or retrocedes to the Reinsurer and the Reinsurer hereby accepts reinsurance and coinsures on a one hundred percent (100%) quota share basis the Ceding Companys Insurance Liabilities under the Policies, by means of indemnity reinsurance. Subject to Section 2.1.4, the Ceding Company and the Reinsurer mutually agree that the Ceding Company will act at the Reinsurers written direction (and shall not act without such direction) in exercising all contractual rights and privileges of the Ceding Company under the Coinsured Policies, including, without limitation, Non-Guaranteed Elements, in accordance with the terms, provisions and conditions of such Coinsured Policies. The Reinsurer agrees to be responsible for one hundred percent (100%) of the Statutory Reserves and Liabilities applicable to Insurance Liabilities with respect to the Coinsured Policies, and shall be fully responsible, at its sole expense, for administration of the Coinsured Policies in all respects in the name, and on behalf, of the Ceding Company in accordance with the terms and conditions of _Article IV_ of this Agreement. 

   

 (a) In no event shall such coinsurance with respect to a particular Policy be in force and binding unless such underlying Policy as issued by the Ceding Company is in force and binding or has lapsed but would be entitled to reinstatement by its terms as of the Coinsurance Effective Date. 

   

 (b) With respect to each of the Coinsured Policies, the amount of coinsurance hereunder shall be maintained in force without reduction so long as the Coinsured Policy remains in force without reduction. If there is a reduction with respect to a Coinsured Policy, the Reinsurers liability with respect thereto shall be equally reduced. All coinsurance for which the Reinsurer is liable hereunder shall be subject to the same rates, terms, conditions, limitations and restrictions as are contained in the Coinsured Policy. 

   

 (c) On or after the Coinsurance Effective Date, the Reinsurer shall bear and shall have responsibility for the adjudication and payment of all claims for benefits arising under the Coinsured Policies (excluding any Excluded Liability) on behalf of the Ceding Company. 

   

 (d) The Ceding Company shall comply with any written directions from the Reinsurer on all matters affecting the Reinsurers obligations with respect to the Coinsured Policies. 

  

 2.2 _Duration of Coinsurance; Recapture_. The coinsurance provided under this Agreement shall remain continuously in force. The Coinsured Policies are not eligible for recapture by the Ceding Company. 

  

 2.3 _Existing Reinsurance Agreements_. The Reinsurer will reimburse the Ceding Company for, or pay on behalf of the Ceding Company, all premiums and other charges, if any,

Coinsurance Effective Date. The Ceding Company shall not be entitled to, and
shall pay over to the Reinsurer all payments from the reinsurers under the
Existing Reinsurance Agreements received by the Ceding Company on and after
the Coinsurance Effective Date. The Reinsurer, on behalf of the
Ceding Company, will assume all responsibility for administration of the
Existing Reinsurance Agreements (in accordance with the terms thereof) at the
same time as Reinsurer assumes responsibility for the administration of such
Coinsured Policies pursuant to this Agreement. With the consent of
the Reinsurer, the Ceding Company may, and, at the Reinsurers reasonable
request the Ceding Company shall, exercise any right it may have to recapture
risks now subject to the Existing Reinsurance Agreements; provided that the
Reinsurer shall reimburse the Ceding Company for reasonable out of pocket
costs incurred thereby in complying with any such request by the Reinsurer,
and the Ceding Company shall pay over to the Reinsurer any amounts received
from any third party reinsurer in connection with any such recapture. 

  

 2.4 _Parties to Coinsurance_. _Article II_ of this Agreement provides for indemnity reinsurance solely between the Ceding Company and the Reinsurer. The acceptance of reinsurance under this _Article II_ shall not create any right or legal relation between the Reinsurer and any Policyholder, insured, claimant or beneficiary under a Coinsured Policy, and the Ceding Company shall be and remain solely liable to such Policyholder under the Coinsured Policy.

 _CLOSING AND CONSIDERATION_   

  

 3.1 _Settlement Amount_. 

   

 (a) No later than three (3) days prior to the Closing Date, the Ceding Company shall provide to the Reinsurer its good faith estimate of the Settlement Amount in the form of and calculated in accordance with Schedule 3.1, based upon the life-only statutory financial statements of the Ceding Company as of the Coinsurance Effective Date (the " _Estimated Settlement Amount_ ") together with a certification of the chief accounting officer of the Ceding Company certifying that all items included in the Estimated Settlement Amount were calculated (i) based on the Books and Records of the Ceding Company, (ii) in a manner consistent with SAP and the methodologies utilized in preparing the Ceding Companys Statutory Statements and using the same methodologies as were used in the preparation of the Life-Only Statutory Statements. On the Closing Date, the Ceding Company agrees to pay the Reinsurer an amount, in cash, equal to the Estimated Settlement Amount as set forth on Schedule 3.1, which shall be remitted by the Ceding Company to the Reinsurer by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by the Reinsurer.

COINSURANCE AGREEMENT 

    ##### 

  

   

 (c) Following Closing, the parties agree to make appropriate adjustments to the Estimated Settlement Amount to reflect items that should have been included in such calculation in accordance with Schedule 3.1 but were erroneously or inadvertently omitted, included or miscalculated in determining the Estimated Settlement Amount or which are reinstated after the Coinsurance Effective Date and omitted in the calculation of the Estimated Settlement Amount as of the Closing Date. Within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, the Reinsurer shall deliver to the Ceding Company its good faith calculation of the Settlement Amount in the form of and calculated in accordance with Schedule 3.1 (the " _Proposed Settlement Amount_ ") based upon the data contained in the statutory financial statements of the Ceding Company as of June 30, 2008 filed with the insurance department of its state of domicile and reflecting any adjustments pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 3.1(c), together with a certification of the chief financial officer of the Reinsurer certifying that all items included in the Proposed Settlement Amount were calculated (i) based on the Books and Records, (ii) in a manner consistent with SAP and the methodologies utilized in preparing the Ceding Companys Statutory Statements and the Estimated Settlement Amount, (iii) using the same methodologies as were used in the preparation of the Life-Only Statutory Statements, and (iv) specifying in reasonable detail the reasons for any differences between the Reinsurers calculation of the Proposed Settlement Amount and the Estimated Settlement Amount. The Ceding Company shall have sixty (60) days to review the Reinsurers calculation of the Proposed Settlement Amount and the amounts set forth therein, and provide written notice to the Reinsurer of any dispute regarding the Reinsurers calculation of such amount, specifying the reasons therefor in reasonable detail (a " _Dispute Notice_ "). The Ceding Company and the Reinsurer shall cooperate in good faith to resolve such dispute as promptly as practicable and, upon such resolution, any adjustments to the calculation of any amount contained in the Reinsurers calculation of the Proposed Settlement Amount shall be made with the agreement of the Ceding Company and the Reinsurer. If the Ceding Company and the Reinsurer are unable to resolve any such dispute within thirty (30) days (or such longer period as the Ceding Company and the Reinsurer shall mutually agree in writing) of the Ceding Companys delivery of such Dispute Notice, such dispute shall be resolved by the Independent Accounting Firm, and such determination by the Independent Accounting Firm shall be final and binding on the parties;  _provided_ that the Reinsurer and the Ceding Company shall submit to the Independent Accounting Firm statements with respect to their respective positions on disputed issues and will cooperate with the Independent Accounting Firm by promptly providing any requested information. Any expenses relating to the engagement of the Independent Accounting Firm in respect of its services pursuant to this _Section 3.1(c)_ shall be shared fifty percent (50%) by the Reinsurer and fifty percent (50%) by the Ceding Company. The Independent Accounting Firm shall be instructed to use reasonable best efforts to perform its services within thirty days of submission by the Reinsurer and the Ceding Company of their respective statements with respect to the disputes and, in any case, as promptly as practicable after such submission. If no Dispute Notice is timely delivered by the Ceding Company, the Reinsurers calculation of the Proposed Settlement Amount shall be the " _Final Settlement Amount_ ". If a Dispute Notice is timely delivered by the Ceding Company, the amount determined 

  

COINSURANCE AGREEMENT 

    ##### 

  

    

pursuant to the resolution of such dispute in accordance with this Section
3.1(c), shall be the "Final Settlement Amount". 

   

 (d) If there is a difference between the Final Settlement Amount and the Estimated Settlement Amount (the " _Reconciliation Amount_ "), the Reconciliation Amount shall be paid by the Ceding Company to the Reinsurer, or refunded by the Reinsurer to the Ceding Company, as the case may be, with interest thereon at the Appraisal Rate from the Closing Date to the date the Reconciliation Amount is paid, which shall be within ten (10) days the calculation of the Final Settlement Amount is completed, or any disputes with respect to such calculation have been resolved. 

  

 3.2 _Post Coinsurance Effective Date Accounting_. Cash flows arising out of the Policies between the Coinsurance Effective Date and the Closing Date, together with interest on the Final Settlement Amount and on the cash flows of the Business during such period, in each case calculated in accordance with Schedule 3.2, shall be calculated in an accounting delivered by the Reinsurer to the Company (the " _Post-Effective Date Accounting_ "). The Post-Effective Date Accounting will be in the form attached as Schedule 3.2. The Reinsurer shall provide to the Ceding Company on a preliminary basis the calculation required by this Section within thirty (30) days of the Closing. The Reinsurer shall have until the sixtieth (60th) day following the Closing Date to submit its final Post-Effective Date Accounting.

The expense allowance to be included in the Post-Effective Date Accounting will be the total amount of expenses the Ceding Companies actually incurred, excluding costs incurred with respect to the non-Transferred Employees, and excluding any severance payments or retention bonuses, in the administration of the Policies during the period from the Coinsurance Effective Date to the Closing Date. The Reinsurer agrees to supply the Ceding Company with a copy of all computer runs, work papers and supporting data used in preparing the Post-Effective Date Accounting. If the Post-Effective Date Accounting reflects a balance due the Ceding Company, such balance shall be paid by the Reinsurer to the Ceding Company in cash simultaneously with the delivery of the Post-Effective Date Accounting. If the Post-Effective Date Accounting reflects a balance due the Reinsurer, such balance shall be paid by the Ceding Company to the Reinsurer in cash not later than three (3) Business Days following its receipt of the Post-Effective Date Accounting. Any dispute with respect to the Post-Effective Date Accounting shall be resolved by the dispute resolution mechanism described in _Section 3.1(c)_. 

  

 3.3 _Books and Records_. On the Closing Date, the Ceding Company will transfer the Books and Records relating to the Coinsured Policies to the Reinsurer. The Reinsurer agrees that, on and after the Closing Date, and for such period of time as may be required under the Reinsurers standard record retention practices and procedures, and in accordance with Applicable Law, it will maintain true and accurate books and records of all reinsurance hereunder, including, without limitation, all such records as may pertain to the Administrative Services described in _Article IV_.

Student loan-related settlements shall be effected on a monthly basis and otherwise in accordance with the information and other requirements set forth on Schedule 4.11 with respect thereto. 

   

 (ii) The Ceding Company or any of its Affiliates shall retain all responsibility for servicing student loans funded by Reinsurer hereunder on terms (including pricing and service standards) substantially identical to the terms under which the other student loans owned by the Ceding Company or any of its Affiliates are serviced, and the Reinsurer or an Affiliate of the Reinsurer will reimburse the Ceding Company for the incremental servicing cost directly attributable to such student loans funded by the Reinsurer or any Affiliate of the Reinsurer (without any allocation of corporate overhead).
