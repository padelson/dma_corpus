this article and to confirm and enforce the performance of any award of the arbitrators.
Arbitration shall be conducted before a three-person arbitration panel appointed as follows:
to initiate arbitration, either party shall notify the other in writing in the manner set
forth in this Agreement for sending notices to the parties of its desire to arbitrate,
stating the nature of the dispute and the remedy sought, and designating an arbitrator. The
party to which the notice is sent shall respond thereto in writing within thirty (30)&nbsp;days
of its receipt of such notice. In such response, the party shall also assert any claim,
defense and other dispute it may have against the party initiating arbitration, and which
arises out of or relates in any way to this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements, and
designate its arbitrator. If the second party fails to respond within the time period set
forth in this <U>Section&nbsp;9.2</U>, or fails to designate its arbitrator in its response, the
party initiating arbitration shall appoint a second arbitrator. The two arbitrators shall
select an umpire within thirty (30)&nbsp;days of the designation of the second arbitrator. If
they are unable to agree upon the selection of the umpire within thirty (30)&nbsp;days of the
appointment of the second arbitrator, the parties shall appoint the umpire pursuant to the

former executive officers of life or health insurance or reinsurance companies, be certified

The arbitrators shall have the power to determine all procedural rules for the conduct of
the arbitration, including but not limited to the production and inspection of documents,
the examination of witnesses and any other matter relating to the conduct of the
arbitration. The arbitrators and the umpire shall interpret this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements as an honorable engagement and not merely as legal obligations between
the parties. In so far as not in conflict with the express terms of this Agreement or the
Ancillary Agreements, it is the intent of the parties hereto that customs and practices of
the life and reinsurance industries may be considered by the arbitrators and the umpire in
resolving any ambiguities inherent in this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements or, the
operation thereof. In the absence of any such ambiguity, the express terms of this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements will control. The arbitrators and umpire may abstain
from following the strict rules of law; provided, however, that the arbitrators shall have
no authority to award equitable relief or punitive damages against or in favor of either
party (except to reimburse a party for extra-contractual or punitive damages that either the
Ceding Companies or the Reinsurer has paid or is legally obligated to pay to third parties).
Unless the arbitration panel orders otherwise, each party shall pay: (1)&nbsp;the fees and
expenses of its own arbitrator; and (2)&nbsp;an equal share of the fees and expenses of the
umpire and the other expenses of the arbitration. Each party shall pay its own legal fees
in connection with the arbitration, unless the arbitrators award legal fees and expenses of
the prevailing party as part of any award. Except as otherwise specifically provided
herein, the arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the Procedures for the
Resolution of U.S. Insurance and Reinsurance Disputes, Regular Panel Version, April&nbsp;2004.
The arbitration shall be held in Dallas, Texas, or at such other location as may be
designated by the arbitrators. The decision, in writing, of the arbitrators shall be final
and binding upon both of the parties. Judgment may be entered upon the final decision of
the arbitrators in any court having jurisdiction. The arbitration will be conducted on a
confidential basis and no matters discussed or disclosed by any party at the arbitration, or
any decision or award of the arbitrators, will be admitted into evidence or otherwise
disclosed or used before any court or other legal, regulatory or administrative body,
authority or forum for any purpose except as and to the extent necessary for entry of final
judgment on the award of the arbitrators in any court having jurisdiction.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 2%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12.7 <U>Confidentiality</U>. Each of the Ceding Companies, HealthMarkets and the

consultants, attorneys and other representatives to hold, in strict confidence, unless
compelled to disclose by judicial or administrative process (including, without limitation,
in connection with obtaining any Required Closing Date Approval) or by other requirements of
Applicable Law (provided, however, that such disclosure shall be limited only to the extent
that it is required by regulatory authorities or to satisfy such legal process, and the
party having such obligation of disclosure notifies the other party of such process in a
timely fashion sufficient to allow the party whose Confidential Information is the subject
of such disclosure to take appropriate legal action to quash or limit such disclosure), all
confidential documents and confidential information concerning the other party furnished to

Confidential Information to any other person, except to that party&#146;s respective auditors,
actuaries, attorneys, financial advisors and other consultants who need access to such
Confidential Information in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
herein. Each of the Ceding Companies and HealthMarkets and the Reinsurer will be
responsible for any breach of the terms of this <U>Section&nbsp;12.7</U> by its respective
officers, directors, employees, agents, consultants, attorneys and other representatives.
If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to <U>Article&nbsp;XI</U>, each of the parties will

party, and retrieve and destroy all copies of such Confidential Information distributed to
any other person.

Exhibits and Schedules annexed hereto or referred to herein are hereby incorporated in and

on one Schedule shall be deemed to have been disclosed on each other Schedule for which it
is readily apparent that the information in such Schedule is responsive notwithstanding any
reference to a specific Schedule. Disclosure of any item on any Schedule shall not
constitute an admission or indication that such item or matter is material or would have a

invalid or unenforceable under any present or future Applicable Law or if determined by a
court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, and if the rights or obligations of the
Companies, HealthMarkets or the Reinsurer under this Agreement will not be materially and
adversely affected thereby, such provision shall be fully severable, and this Agreement will
be construed and enforced as if such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision had never
comprised a part of this Agreement, and the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect and will not be affected by the illegal, invalid or
unenforceable provision or by its severance herefrom.
