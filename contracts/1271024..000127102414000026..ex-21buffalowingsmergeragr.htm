determined in accordance with Section 5 of Article IV of the Certificate of
Incorporation (as defined below) (the "Preferred Conversion").

Company Capital Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Section 1.7 and throughout this Agreement, including the escrow provisions set

converted automatically into the right to receive upon surrender of the
certificate representing such shares of Company Capital Stock in the manner
provided in Section 1.10 hereof, the following:

(A) With respect to shares of Company Capital Stock that are held by holders
who are not Key Holders: (1) an amount in cash equal to the Closing Per Share
Amount (without interest thereon) plus (2) any applicable Additional Per Share
Amount, payable in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

(B) With respect to shares of Company Capital Stock that are held by holders

vesting schedule set forth therein.

THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER
THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE "1933 ACT") AND MAY NOT BE
OFFERED, SOLD OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED, PLEDGED OR HYPOTHECATED UNLESS AND
UNTIL REGISTERED UNDER THE 1933 ACT OR, IN THE OPINION OF COMPANY COUNSEL
SATISFACTORY TO THE ISSUER OF THESE SECURITIES, SUCH OFFER, SALE OR TRANSFER,
PLEDGE OR HYPOTHECATION IS IN COMPLIANCE THEREWITH.

(c) Treatment of Company Options, Company RSUs and Company Warrants.

(i) Effect on Company Options.

(A) Company Options Held by Continuing Employees. At the Effective Time,
pursuant to the terms of the Plans, each Company Option held by a Continuing
Employee that is unexpired, unexercised and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (each an "Assumed Option" and together, the "Assumed
Options") shall, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, be assumed by Parent. Except as provided herein, each Assumed
Option shall continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and
conditions set forth in the Plans and the option agreements relating thereto
(including with respect to the vesting thereof), as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, except that (A) each Assumed Option will be
exercisable for that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal to
the product of the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were issuable
upon exercise of such Assumed Option immediately prior to the Effective Time
multiplied by the Company Option Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest
whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock, and (B) the per share exercise
price for the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such
Assumed Option will be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the
exercise price per share of Company Common Stock at which such Assumed Option
was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Company Option
Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent. It is intended that each
Assumed Options assumed by Parent shall qualify following the Effective Time
as incentive stock options as defined in Section 422 of the Code to the extent
Assumed Options qualified as incentive stock options immediately prior to the
Effective Time and the provisions of this Section 1.7(c)(i)(A) shall be
applied consistent with such intent. The conversion and assumption of the
Assumed Options is intended to comply with the regulations and other binding
guidance under Section 409A of the Code, including 

Treas. Reg. 1.409A-1(b)(5)(v)(D), and such converted options to purchase
Parent Common Stock shall be subject to the same terms and conditions
(including with respect to the vesting schedule thereof, expiration date,
exercise provisions and transfer restrictions) as were applicable to the
corresponding Assumed Options immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(B) Company Options Held by Persons other than Continuing Employees. At the
Effective Time, each Vested Company Option that is held by a Person other than
a Continuing Employee and that is unexpired, unexercised and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time will, by virtue of the Merger and
without any further action on the part of Parent, Sub, Company or the holder
thereof, be cancelled and converted without exercise into and, subject to the
terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, represent the right to
receive the positive difference (if any) of (x) the Per Share Amount less (A)
the exercise price of such Company Option. No Unvested Company Options held by
Persons who are not Continuing Employees shall be assumed by Parent and the
Company shall take all action necessary to cause each Unvested Company Option
held by a Person who is not a Continuing Employee to be cancelled and
terminated immediately prior to the Effective Time, either pursuant to its
terms or pursuant to an agreement with the holder thereof.

(C) As soon as reasonably practicable, but in no event more than fifteen (15)
Business Days, following the Effective Time, Parent shall file a registration
statement on Form S‑8 (or any successor or other appropriate form that Parent
is eligible to use) under the Securities Act with respect to the shares of
Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Assumed Options, and shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause such registration statement
to remain in effect for so long as the assumed Company Options remain
outstanding.

(ii) Effect on Company Warrants. No outstanding Company Warrants shall be
assumed by Parent. The Company shall take all action necessary to cause each
Company Warrant to be either (A) exercised by the holder of such Company
Warrant in full or (B) to the extent not exercised in full, terminated or
cancelled as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, either pursuant to
its terms or pursuant to an agreement with the holder thereof.

(i) Company RSUs Held by Continuing Employees. Immediately following the
Effective Time, pursuant to the terms of the Plan, each Company RSU held by a
Continuing Employee that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall be assumed by Parent (an "Assumed RSU"). Each Assumed RSU shall be
converted into an award to receive that number of shares of Parent Common
Stock equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Assumed RSU immediately prior to the
Effective Time by (y) the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole
number of shares of Parent Common Stock. Except as otherwise set forth in this
Agreement, each Company RSU so assumed by Parent pursuant to this Section
1.7(c)(iii) shall continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and
conditions (including vesting terms) set forth in the Plans and the restricted
stock unit agreements relating thereto as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, except that such assumed Company RSU will represent the right
to receive that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal to (x) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Assumed RSU
immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (y) the Exchange Ratio,
rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock.

(ii) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions that may
be reasonably necessary (under the Plans or otherwise) to effectuate the
provisions of this Section 1.7(c) and to use commercially reasonable efforts
to ensure that, from and after the Effective Time, each holder of a Company
Option that was outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that was
cancelled as provided in this 

Section 1.7(c) shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
right to receive the consideration specified in this Section 1.7(c) without
interest.

(iii) Fractional Shares. No fractional share of Parent Common Stock shall be
issued in connection with the Merger. In lieu thereof, each Key Holder that
would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Company
Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be
received by such Key Holder) shall be entitled to receive the nearest whole
number of shares of Parent Common Stock and an amount of cash (rounded to the
nearest whole cent), without interest, equal to the product of: (i) such
fraction, multiplied by (ii) the Parent Trading Price in respect of such
remaining fractional share.

(d) Effect on Capital Stock of Sub. Each share of common stock of Sub issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
into and exchanged for one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share
of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. Each stock certificate of Sub
evidencing ownership of any such shares shall continue to evidence ownership
of such shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

1.8 Calculation. For purposes of calculating the amount of cash payable to
each Company Stockholder pursuant to this Article I, all shares of Company
Capital Stock held (or deemed to be held, as the case may be) by each Company
Stockholder shall be aggregated, and the aggregate amount of cash issuable to
each Company Stockholder shall be rounded (up or down) to the nearest whole
cent; provided, however, that in no event shall the maximum amount of cash
payable to all Company Stockholders pursuant to this Agreement exceed the
Total Consideration.

1.9 Adjusted Working Capital Reconciliation.

(a) No later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall have delivered to Parent a written statement (the "Estimated
Adjusted Working Capital Statement") which sets forth an estimate of the
Adjusted Working Capital (the "Estimated Adjusted Working Capital"). The
Estimated Adjusted Working Capital Statement will have been prepared by the
Company in accordance with GAAP, applied using the same accounting methods,
practices, principles, policies and procedures, with consistent
classifications that were used in the preparation of the Financials. Parent
and its representatives, including Parent's independent accountants, will be
entitled to review all work papers of the Company and its representatives,
including its independent accountants, prepared in connection with the
delivery of the Estimated Adjusted Working Capital Statement. Nothing set
forth in this Section 1.9 shall limit any rights of any party as set forth in
this Section 1.9 or of any Indemnified Party as set forth in Article VI.

(b) Within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Parent shall deliver to
the Stockholder Representative a written statement (the "AWC Reconciliation
Notice") of the actual amount of the Adjusted Working Capital of the Company
(the "Actual Adjusted Working Capital"), and the difference, if any, between
the amount of the Actual Adjusted Working Capital and the Estimated Adjusted
Working Capital. The Actual Adjusted Working Capital will be prepared in
accordance with GAAP, applied using the same accounting methods, practices,
principles, policies and procedures, with consistent classifications that were
used in the preparation of the Financials.

(c) If the Stockholder Representative disputes the Actual Adjusted Working
Capital set forth in the AWC Reconciliation Notice, the Stockholder
Representative shall deliver to Parent written notice of such dispute (the
"Dispute Notice") within thirty (30) days of receipt of the AWC Reconciliation
Notice, which shall list with reasonable specificity the Stockholder
Representative's points of disagreement with Parent's calculation 

of the Actual Adjusted Working Capital. The Stockholder Representative's
failure to provide a Dispute Notice within thirty (30) days after receipt of
the AWC Reconciliation Notice shall be deemed an acceptance of such AWC
Reconciliation Notice and Parent's calculation of the Actual Adjusted Working
Capital. Upon receipt of the Dispute Notice, the Stockholder Representative
and Parent shall promptly consult with each other with respect to the
specified points of disagreement in an effort to resolve the dispute.

(d) After the acceptance or final determination of the Actual Adjusted Working
Capital, if (i) the amount of the Actual Adjusted Working Capital is less than
(ii) the Estimated Adjusted Working Capital (the amount, if any, by which (i)
is less than (ii), the "Excess Consideration"), then Parent and Stockholder
Representative shall provide a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent
to deliver promptly from the Escrow Amount to the Parent an amount in cash
equal to the amount of the Excess Consideration in immediately available
funds. After the acceptance or final determination of the Actual Adjusted
Working Capital, if (iii) the amount of the Actual Adjusted Working Capital is
greater than (iv) the Estimated Adjusted Working Capital (the amount, if any,
by which (iii) is greater than (iv), the "Shortfall Consideration"), then the
Shortfall Consideration shall be paid in cash by Parent or the paying agent
selected by Parent to the Company Security Holders within five (5) Business
Days of such acceptance of final determination, in proportion to such Company
Security Holders' respective Pro Rata Share.

1.10 Exchange Procedures.

(a) Promptly following the Effective Time, but in no event later than one (1)
Business Day thereafter, Parent shall deliver, in trust, to a paying agent
selected by Parent, for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company
Capital Stock, sufficient funds for timely payment of the aggregate cash
consideration payable pursuant to this Article I in exchange for the
applicable outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock.

(b) By virtue of this Agreement and as partial security for the indemnity
obligations provided for in Section 6.2 hereof, promptly following the
Effective Time (but in no event more than five (5) Business Days after the
Effective Time), Parent shall deposit with the Escrow Agent the Escrow Amount,
without any act of the Indemnifying Parties, in accordance with Section 6.5(a)
and the Spreadsheet.

(c) Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall mail, or shall cause to be
mailed, to each Company Stockholder immediately prior to the Effective Time a
letter of transmittal in the form attached hereto as Exhibit C (the "Letter of
Transmittal") that shall (i) specify that delivery of certificates
representing such Company Stockholder's shares of Company Capital Stock (the
"Company Stock Certificates") shall be deemed to have occurred, and, with
respect to Company Stock Certificates, risk of loss and title to the Company
Stock Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Company Stock
Certificates to Parent, (ii) include an undertaking to be bound by the terms
of this Agreement and a confirmation of the Stockholder Representative as the
agent of such holder pursuant to Section 6.7 for the purposes set forth
herein, (iii) include an IRS Form W-9 or instructions on how to obtain IRS
Form W-8BEN (or other applicable Form W-8), as applicable, and (iv) include
any other information required pursuant to any applicable Law. Upon surrender
of a Company Stock Certificate for cancellation to Parent, together with such
letter of transmittal, duly executed and properly completed in accordance with
the instructions thereto, the holder of such Company Stock Certificate (each
such holder, a "Surrendering Holder") shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor from Parent the consideration that such holder has the right to
receive in respect of the Company Stock Certificates surrendered pursuant to
the provisions of Section 1.7 as specified in the Spreadsheet, after giving
effect to any withholding Tax required to be withheld pursuant to applicable
Law, and the instrument so surrendered or transferred shall forthwith be
cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on the consideration payable to
holders of Company Stock Certificates. 

(d) At the Effective Time, Parent shall surrender the certificate(s)
representing the shares of Sub, and the Surviving Corporation shall issue to
Parent in exchange therefor a certificate or certificates representing the
number of shares of Surviving Corporation common stock to which Parent is
entitled pursuant to Section 1.7(d).

(e) Transfers of Ownership. If the cash payment or check evidencing the cash
to be paid pursuant to Section 1.7 hereof is to be made to a Person other than
the Person whose name is reflected on the Company Stock Certificate
surrendered in exchange therefor, it will be a condition of the issuance
thereof that the certificate so surrendered will be properly endorsed and
otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such
exchange will have paid to Parent or any agent designated by it any transfer
or other taxes required by reason of the payment of any portion of the Total
Consideration in any name other than that of the registered holder of the
certificate surrendered, or established to the satisfaction of Parent or any
agent designated by it that such tax has been paid or is not payable.

(f) No Liability. None of Parent, the Surviving Corporation, any Affiliate of
the foregoing or any other Person shall be liable to any Person in respect of
any portion of the Total Consideration and any portion of the Escrow Amount or
Expense Fund Amount delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

1.11 Dissenting Shares.

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any shares of
Company Capital Stock that are issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time
and that are held by a stockholder who has properly exercised his, her or its
appraisal rights under Delaware Law or under Chapter 13 of the California
Corporations Code (the "CCC"), if applicable (the "Dissenting Shares") shall
not be converted into the right to receive payments set forth in Section 1.7
unless and until the holder thereof shall have failed to perfect, or shall
have effectively withdrawn or lost, his, her or its right to dissent from the
Merger under Delaware Law or under Chapter 13 of the CCC, if applicable, and
to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due with respect to
such Dissenting Shares pursuant to and subject to the requirements of the
Delaware Law or under Chapter 13 of the CCC, if applicable. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, to the extent that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Company (i) makes any payment or payments in respect of any Dissenting Shares
in excess of the consideration that otherwise would have been payable in
respect of such shares in accordance with this Agreement or (ii) incurs any
Losses, (including reasonable attorneys' and consultants' fees, costs and
expenses and including any such fees, costs and expenses incurred in
connection with investigating, defending against or settling any action or
proceeding) in respect of any Dissenting Shares (excluding payments for such
shares) ((i) and (ii) together, "Dissenting Share Payments"), Parent shall be
entitled to recover under the terms of Section 6.2 hereof the amount by which
such Dissenting Share Payments exceed the amounts otherwise payable hereunder
to the holders of such Dissenting Shares if such holders had waived all of
their respective rights to dissent and appraisal rights with respect to the
Merger.

(b) The Company shall (i) give Parent prompt notice of any demands for
appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands, and any other
related instruments served pursuant to Delaware Law or under Chapter 13 of the
CCC, if applicable, and received by the Company and (ii) retain the right to
direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal
under Delaware Law or under Chapter 13 of the CCC, if applicable; provided,
however, the Company shall keep Parent informed of all material developments
with respect to any demands for appraisal. The Company shall not, except with
the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any
demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands, unless
and to the extent it is required to do so under applicable Law. 

1.12 No Further Ownership Rights in Company Capital Stock. The portion of the
Total Consideration paid or payable in respect of the surrender for exchange
of shares of Company Capital Stock in accordance with the terms hereof shall
be deemed to be full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of
Company Capital Stock, and there shall be no further registration of transfers
on the records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Capital Stock
that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Company Stock Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided
in this Article I.

1.13 Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event any Company Stock
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent shall issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificates or agreements, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, such
consideration, if any, as may be required pursuant to Section 1.7 hereof or
the Spreadsheet, as applicable; provided, however, that Parent may, as a
condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the Company Stockholder
who is the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificates to deliver a
bond in such amount as it may reasonably direct and enter into an agreement
indemnifying Parent against any claim that may be made against Parent with
respect to the certificates or agreements alleged to have been lost, stolen or
destroyed.

1.14 Withholding Taxes. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
the Company and, on its behalf, Parent, and the Surviving Corporation, shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable or otherwise
deliverable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be
deducted or withheld therefrom under any provision of U.S. federal, state,
local or non-U.S. tax law or under any applicable legal requirement, and to
request and be provided any necessary tax forms, including IRS Form W-9 or the
appropriate version of Form W-8, as applicable, or any similar information. To
the extent any such amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid over to the
appropriate authorities, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under
this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would
otherwise have been paid. Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, all amounts
so withheld to the appropriate taxing authority within the period required
under applicable law.

1.15 Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action. If at any time after the
Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full
right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of the Company, Parent, Sub, and the officers and
directors of the Company, Parent and Sub are fully authorized in the name of
their respective corporations or otherwise to take, and will take, all such
lawful and necessary action.

licensed) or the nature of its activities make such qualification or licensing
materially necessary to the Company's business as currently conducted. The
Company has made available a true and correct copy of its certificate of
incorporation, as amended to date (the "Certificate of Incorporation") and
bylaws, as amended to date, each in full force and effect on the date hereof
(collectively, the "Charter Documents"), to Parent. The Company is not in
violation of any of the provisions of its Charter Documents. The board of
directors of the Company (the "Board") has not approved or proposed any
amendment to any of the Charter Documents not reflected therein.

or any ERISA Affiliate, a "disqualified individual" (within the meaning of
Section 280G of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder), as 

determined immediately prior to the initiation of the solicitation of the
requisite Company Stockholder approval described in Section 4.2(c), and who
might otherwise receive or have the right or entitlement to receive a
parachute payment under Section 280G of the Code, unless the requisite Company
Stockholder approval of such parachute payments is obtained pursuant to
Section 4.2(c).

(c) Promptly following the delivery by the Company to Parent of each 280G
Waiver described in Section 4.2(b), the Company shall submit to the Company
Stockholders for approval by such number of Company Stockholders as is
required by the terms of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code any payments and/or
benefits that are subject to a 280G Waiver and that Parent reasonably
determines may separately or in the aggregate, constitute "parachute payments"
(within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and the regulations
promulgated thereunder), such that such payments and benefits shall not be
deemed to be "parachute payments" under Section 280G of the Code, and prior to
the Effective Time the Company shall deliver to Parent evidence reasonably
satisfactory to Parent (i) that a Company Stockholder vote was solicited in
conformance with Section 280G and the regulations promulgated thereunder, and
the requisite Company Stockholder approval was obtained with respect to any
payments and/or benefits that were subject to the Company Stockholder vote
(the "280G Approval") or (ii) that the 280G Approval was not obtained and as a
consequence, that such "parachute payments" shall not be made or provided
pursuant to the 280G Waivers of those payments and/or benefits which were
executed by the affected individuals on the date of this Agreement.

(d) Any materials to be submitted to the Company Stockholders in connection
with the solicitation of their approval of the Merger and this Agreement,

Parent in writing if at any time prior to the Closing the Company obtains
Knowledge of any facts that might make it necessary or appropriate to amend or
supplement the Information Statement or any other Soliciting Materials in
order to make statements contained or incorporated by reference therein not
misleading or to comply with applicable law. Anything to the contrary
contained herein notwithstanding, the Company shall not include in the

contained herein notwithstanding, the Company shall not include in the
Soliciting Materials any information with respect to Parent or its affiliates
or associates, the form and content of which shall not have been consented to
in writing by Parent prior to such inclusion, except as required pursuant to
applicable law.

modify, change or revoke its approval of this Agreement, the Merger and the
transactions contemplated hereby nor its recommendation to the Company
Stockholders to vote in favor of this Agreement, the Merger and the
transactions contemplated hereby. 

4.3 Confidentiality. Parent and the Company hereby agree that the information
obtained in any investigation pursuant to Section 3 of Appendix A attached
hereto, or pursuant to the negotiation and execution of this Agreement or the
effectuation of the transactions contemplated hereby, or, if applicable, in
connection with any disputes or arbitration proceedings, shall be governed by
the terms of the Non‑Disclosure Agreement dated as of January 17, 2014 (the
"Confidential Disclosure Agreement") between the Company and Parent until
Closing. In this regard, the Company acknowledges that the Parent Common Stock
is publicly traded and that any information obtained during the course of its
due diligence could be considered to be material non‑public information within
the meaning of federal and state securities laws. Accordingly, the Company
acknowledges and agrees not to engage in any discussions, correspondence or
transactions in the Parent Common Stock in violation of applicable securities
laws.

4.4 Public Disclosure. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall not (nor will
it permit, as applicable, any of its officers, directors, members, employees,
stockholders, agents, partners, representatives or affiliates to), directly or
indirectly, issue any statement or communication to any third party (other
than its agents or representatives that are bound by confidentiality
restrictions) regarding the subject matter of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, including, if applicable, the termination of
this Agreement and the reasons therefor or any disputes or arbitration
proceedings, without the consent of Parent, except as may be required by
applicable regulatory, administrative or legal requirements; provided,
however, that in such event, the Company shall, or shall cause such Person, to
give Parent prompt written notice of such obligation to enable Parent to seek
a protective order or otherwise prevent such disclosure and that the Company
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Parent to obtain
such protective order or other appropriate remedy.

4.5 Reasonable Best Efforts. Subject to the terms and conditions provided in
this Agreement, each of the parties hereto shall use reasonable best efforts
to take promptly, or cause to be taken promptly, all actions, and to do
promptly, or cause to be done promptly, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable laws and regulations to consummate and make
effective the transactions contemplated hereby, to cause all conditions to the
obligations of the other parties hereto to cause the Merger to occur and to
effect all necessary registrations and filings and to remove any injunctions
or other impediments or delays, legal or otherwise, in order to consummate and
make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement for the purpose
of securing to the parties hereto the benefits contemplated by this Agreement;
provided, however, that neither the Company nor Parent shall be required to
agree to (a) any license, sale or other disposition or holding separate
(through establishment of a trust or otherwise) of any shares of its capital
stock or of any of its businesses, assets or properties, its subsidiaries or
affiliates, (b) the imposition of any limitation on the ability of Parent, its
subsidiaries or affiliates or the Company to conduct their respective
businesses or own any capital stock or assets or to acquire, hold or exercise
full rights of ownership of their respective businesses and, in the case of
Parent, the business of the Company, or (c) the imposition of any impediment
on Parent, its subsidiaries or affiliates or the Company under any statute,
rule, regulation, executive order, decree, order or other legal restraint
governing competition, monopolies or restrictive trade practices (any such
action described in (a), (b) or (c), an "Action of Divestiture"). Nothing
herein shall require the Company to make any payment to a third party to
obtain any waiver, consent or approval except such fees (including legal fees)
that are contemplated by the terms of a Contract between such third party and
the Company entered into prior to the date hereof. Nothing herein shall
require Parent or the Company to litigate with any third party, including
without limitation, any Governmental Entity.

notice to the Company that such 401(k) Plans shall not be terminated) and any
group severance, separation or salary continuation plans, programs or
arrangements specified by Parent in a written notice no later than three (3)
Business Days prior to 

the Closing Date. Unless Parent provides such written notice to the Company to
not terminate its 401(k) Plans, no later than three (3) Business Days prior to
the Closing Date, the Company shall provide Parent with evidence that each
401(k) Plan has been terminated (effective as of no later than the day
immediately preceding the Closing Date) pursuant to resolutions of the Board,
or such ERISA Affiliate, as the case may be. The form and substance of such
resolutions shall be subject to the reasonable review and approval of Parent.

4.7 Consents. With respect to any Material Contract listed in Annex 7 of
Appendix C, the Company shall have used commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain all necessary consents, waivers and approvals of any parties as are
required thereunder in connection with the Merger or for any such Contracts to
remain in full force and effect, all of which are required to be listed in
Section 2.5 of the Disclosure Schedule, so as to preserve all rights of, and
benefits to, the Surviving Corporation under such Contract from and after the
Closing. The Company shall be responsible for making any payments required to
obtain such consents, waivers and approvals and shall defend, protect and hold
harmless Parent and the Surviving Corporation from all Losses arising from the
same and shall reflect such payment or other consideration incurred by the
Company as of the Closing Date or anticipated to be incurred or payable after
the Closing on the Statement of Expenses. Such consents, waivers and

or effect immediately following the Effective Time. Upon the Closing, the
Company shall have paid all amounts owed under the Terminated Agreements (as a
result of the termination of the Terminated Agreements or otherwise), and the
Surviving Corporation will not incur any claim, Liability or obligation
(absolute, accrued, asserted or unasserted, contingent or otherwise) under any
Terminated Agreement following the Closing Date. The Company shall be
responsible for making any payments required to terminate the Terminated
Agreements and shall defend, protect and hold harmless Parent and the
Surviving Corporation from all Losses arising from the same and shall reflect
such payment or other consideration incurred by the Company as of the Closing
Date or anticipated to be incurred or payable after the Closing on the
Statement of Expenses. In the event the Merger does not close for any reason,
Parent shall not have any Liability to the Company or any other Person for any
costs, claims, Liabilities or damages resulting from the Company seeking to
obtain such terminations.

4.9 Notices. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause each of the notices set forth in Annex 9 to

to the Effective Time, the Company shall purchase a prepaid directors' and
officers' liability insurance policy or policies, which policy or policies
shall cover those persons who are currently covered by the Company's
directors' and officers' liability insurance policy for an aggregate period of
not less than six (6) years from the Effective Time with respect to claims
arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the Closing Date (the
"Company DandO Tail Policy"), including with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the premium for which shall be included in
Third Party 

Expenses if not fully paid prior to Closing. If the Merger is consummated,
Parent will (a) not cancel the Company DandO Tail Policy during its term and (b)
cause the Surviving Corporation to fulfill and honor in all respects the
obligations of the Company to its present and former directors and officers
determined as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "Company
Indemnified Parties") pursuant to the Charter Documents, the Company DandO Tail
Policy and any indemnification agreements between the Company and its
directors and officers with respect to claims arising out of acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time which are asserted after the
Effective Time. The terms and provisions of this Section 4.10 are intended to
be in addition to the rights otherwise available to the Company Indemnified
Parties by applicable law, charter, bylaw or agreement, and shall operate for
the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the Company Indemnified Parties
and their respective heirs and representatives, each of whom is an intended
third party beneficiary of this Section 4.10.

4.11 Expenses. Whether or not the Merger is consummated, all fees and expenses
incurred in connection with the Merger including all legal, accounting,
financial advisory, consulting and all other fees and expenses of third

and the transactions contemplated hereby, including, but not limited to, any

Merger, whenever incurred ("Third Party Expenses"), shall be the obligation of
the respective party incurring such fees and expenses. The Company shall
provide, no less than two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, to

satisfactory to Parent and certified as true and correct as of the Closing
Date by the Company's Chief Executive Officer (the "Statement of Expenses").
Any Third Party Expenses incurred by the Company that are not reflected on the

of the Total Consideration, shall be paid out of the Escrow Amount in
accordance with Section 6.4.

SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES; 
INDEMNIFICATION; ESCROW

6.1 Survival. The representations and warranties of the Company contained in
this Agreement and in the Certificates shall survive for a period of twelve
(12) months following the Closing Date (the date of expiration of such twelve
(12) month period, the "Survival Date"), except to the extent subject to a
pending claim for indemnification set forth in an Officer's Certificate
delivered prior to the termination of the Escrow Period; provided, however,
that in the event of fraud, willful breach or Intentional Misrepresentation by
the Company of a representation or warranty contained in this Agreement or in
the Certificates, as applicable, such representation or warranty shall not
terminate; provided further, however, that the representations and warranties
(i) contained in Section 2.1(a) (Organization of the Company), Section 2.2
(Company Capital Structure), Section 2.4 (Authority and Enforceability) and
Section 2.10 (Tax Matters) and the certificate delivered pursuant to Section
19 of Appendix C (Spreadsheet) shall remain in full force and effect,
regardless of any investigation or disclosure made by or on behalf of any of
the parties hereto, until the expiration of the statutes of limitations
(including any extensions or waivers thereof) which are the subject of any
such representations and warranties hereof (the "Fundamental Matters"). The
covenants of the Company shall survive without limitation and shall constitute
a Fundamental Matter for all purposes under this Agreement. The
representations and warranties of Parent contained in this Agreement, the
Related Agreements or in any certificate or other instrument delivered
pursuant to this Agreement shall terminate on the Survival Date, except to the
extent subject to a pending claim for indemnification set forth in an
Officer's Certificate delivered prior to Survival Date; provided, however,
that in the event of fraud, Intentional Misrepresentation or willful breach by

such representation or warranty shall not terminate; provided further,
however, that the representations and warranties (i) contained in Section 3.1
(Organization of the Company) and Section 3.2 (Authority and Enforceability)
shall remain in full force and effect until the expiration of the statutes of

Parent shall survive until such covenants are fully performed by their terms.
It is the express 

intent of the parties that, if an applicable survival period as contemplated
by this Section 6.1 is shorter than the statute of limitations that would
otherwise have been applicable, then, by contract, the applicable statute of
limitations shall be reduced to the survival period contemplated hereby. The
parties further acknowledge that the time periods set forth in this Section
6.1 for the assertion of claims under this Agreement are the result of
arms'-length negotiation among the parties, and that the parties intend for
the time periods to be enforced as agreed by the parties.

6.2 Indemnification.

(a) By virtue of the Merger, subject to the provisions of this Article VI,
from and after the consummation of the Merger, the Company Stockholders (each,
an "Indemnifying Party" and, collectively, the "Indemnifying Parties") agree
to severally (in accordance with their Pro Rata Portions) and not jointly
(except as otherwise specifically set forth in this Article VI) indemnify and
hold harmless Parent and its officers, directors, affiliates, employees,
agents and representatives, including the Company (the "Indemnified Parties"),
against all claims, losses, Liabilities, damages, Taxes, costs, interest,
awards, judgments, penalties and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' and
consultants' fees and expenses and including any such reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses incurred in connection with investigating, defending against or
settling any of the foregoing (hereinafter individually a "Loss" and
collectively "Losses") incurred or sustained by the Indemnified Parties, or
any of them (including the Company), directly or indirectly, as a result of
the following (the "Indemnifiable Matters"):

(i) any breach or inaccuracy of a representation or warranty of the Company
contained in this Agreement or in the Certificates;

(ii) any failure by the Company to perform or comply with any covenant or
agreement applicable to it contained in this Agreement;

(iii) any Unpaid Pre-Closing Taxes that are not reflected as current
liabilities for purposes of calculating Adjusted Working Capital or have not
otherwise specifically reduced the Total Consideration;

(iv) any Excess Consideration;

(v) any inaccuracy or omission in the Spreadsheet, including any amounts set
forth therein that are paid to a Person in excess of the amounts such Person
is entitled to receive pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or any amounts
a Person was entitled to receive pursuant to the terms of this Agreement that
was omitted from the Spreadsheet (collectively, "Spreadsheet Losses");

(vi) any Liabilities relating to or arising out of any "excess parachute
payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code;

(vii) (A) any fraud and (B) any willful breach or Intentional
Misrepresentation, in each case, related to this Agreement, any Certificate or
the Spreadsheet committed by the Company or any of its Affiliates;

(viii) any Dissenting Share Payments; and

(ix) any matters listed on Schedule 6.2(a)(ix) hereto. 

(b) Notwithstanding Section 6.2(a), any Indemnifying Party (i) that fails to
perform or comply with any covenant or agreement applicable to such
Indemnifying Party contained in this Agreement or (ii) that commits or
participates in any fraud, willful breach or Intentional Misrepresentation of
this Agreement, in the Certificates or in the Spreadsheet shall indemnify, and
hold the Indemnified Parties harmless for, any Losses incurred or sustained by
the Indemnified Parties, or any of them (including the Company), as a result
of such failure or fraud, willful breach or Intentional Misrepresentation.

(c) For the purposes of this Article VI only, solely when determining the
amount of Losses suffered by an Indemnified Party as a result of any breach,
inaccuracy or failure, any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
given or made by the Company that is qualified or limited in scope as to
materiality or Material Adverse Effect (including the definition of Material
Contracts), such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement shall be
deemed to be made or given without such qualification or limitation with
regard to damages but not determination of the breach.

(d) The Indemnifying Parties shall not have any right of contribution,
indemnification or right of advancement from the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or Parent with respect to any Loss claimed by an Indemnified
Party.

(e) Nothing in this Agreement shall limit the right of Parent or any other
Indemnified Party to pursue remedies under any Related Agreement (other than
the Certificates) against the parties thereto.

(f) With respect to any failure of the representations and warranties set
forth in Section 2.10 (Taxes) in the amount or availability of any net
operating loss, net capital loss, or any unused investment, foreign, or other
Tax credit of the Company shall not constitute Losses.

6.3 Maximum Payments; Remedy.

(a) Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as set forth in the second sentence
of this Section 6.3(a), an Indemnified Party may not recover any Losses under
Section 6.2(a)(i) hereof unless and until one or more Officer's Certificates
identifying such Losses under Section 6.2(a)(i) hereof in excess of $1,000,000
in the aggregate (the "Basket") has or have been delivered to the Stockholder
Representative as provided in Section 6.4(a) hereof, and such amount is
payable in accordance with this Article VI, at which time such Indemnified
Party shall be entitled to recover all Losses so identified in full from the
first dollar (including the amount of the Basket). For avoidance of doubt, the
provisions of this Section 6.3(a) shall not apply to any and all claims or
payments made with respect to all Losses (i) incurred pursuant to Section
6.2(a)(i) for any breach or inaccuracy of any Fundamental Matters, or (ii)
incurred pursuant to clauses (ii) through (vii) of Section 6.2(a) hereof, or
(iii) incurred pursuant to Section 6.2(b) hereof.

(b) From and after the Closing, recourse of Parent and the other Indemnified
Parties to the Escrow Amount pursuant to Article VI of this Agreement shall be
the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and the other Indemnified Parties for
recovery of Losses under the indemnification provisions contained in Section
6.2(a)(i) (it being understood that nothing in this Section 6.3(b) or
elsewhere in this Agreement shall affect Parent's rights to specific
performance or other equitable remedies with respect to the covenants referred
to in this Agreement to be performed after the Closing). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the Escrow Amount shall
be available to compensate the Indemnified Parties for any claims by such
parties for any Losses suffered or incurred by them and for which they are
entitled to recovery under this Article VI and nothing in this Agreement shall
limit the liability of any Indemnifying Party, and the Escrow Amount shall not
be the exclusive remedy, in respect of (i) Losses (A) arising out of the
Indemnifiable Matters described 

Sections 6.2(a)(ii) through 6.2(a)(viii) or (B) with respect to any
Fundamental Matter, (ii) Losses arising out of Section 6.2(a)(ix), provided,
however, that in the event that any such Losses arise after the end of the
Escrow Period, then the Indemnified Party's recovery with respect to such
claim made after the end of the Escrow Period shall not exceed an amount equal
to $5,000,000, or (iii) Losses arising out of fraud, willful breach or
Intentional Misrepresentation of or related to this Agreement, any
Certificate, the Spreadsheet or other instrument delivered pursuant to this
Agreement, in which case the liability of the Indemnifying Parties shall be
several (in accordance with their Pro Rata Portions) and not joint and the
maximum amount that the Indemnified Parties may recover from each Indemnifying
Party for such Losses shall be limited to an amount equal to the amount of the
Total Consideration actually received by such Indemnifying Party pursuant to
Section 1.7; provided, however, that the Escrow Amount shall be the first (but
not exclusive) source of indemnification for any claims arising out of the
Fundamental Matters, and no such claims may be satisfied against an
Indemnifying Party until the Escrow Amount has been exhausted; provided,
further that in no event shall an Indemnified Party be entitled to recover for
the same Loss under more than one clause of Section 6.2; provided, further,
that there shall be no limitation on the amount that the Indemnified Parties
may recover from an Indemnifying Party for Losses arising out of fraud,
willful breach or Intentional Misrepresentation committed by such Indemnifying
Party related to this Agreement, any Certificate or the Spreadsheet. From and
after the Closing, recourse of Parent and the other Indemnified Parties
pursuant to Article VI of this Agreement shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy of Parent and the other Indemnified Parties for monetary damages
arising out of the Indemnifiable Matters.

(c) Nothing in this Article VI shall limit the Liability of any party hereto
for any breach of any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement,
any Certificate or other instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement if
the Merger does not close.

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no Indemnifying
Party shall be required to indemnify any Indemnified Party pursuant to this
Article VI for any Losses to the extent that any Indemnified Party actually
receives proceeds from insurance, indemnification payments, contribution
payments, reimbursements, other recoveries or any amounts from third parties
with respect to such Losses to pay such Losses, net of costs and expenses
incurred in connection with the collection of such amounts; provided, however,
that no Indemnified Party shall be required to seek any insurance or maintain
any such insurance policies or other coverage or seek any indemnification
payments, contribution payments, reimbursements, other recoveries or any
amounts from third parties. The Indemnified Party shall promptly refund any
amount it actually receives (net of costs and expenses, incurred in connection
with the collection of such amount) pursuant to the preceding sentence from
insurance to the extent it actually receives such amount after payment by any
Indemnifying Party.

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the parties
hereto agree and acknowledge that any Indemnified Party may bring a claim for
indemnification for any Loss under this Article VI notwithstanding the fact
that such Indemnified Party had Knowledge of the breach, event or circumstance
giving rise to such Loss prior to the Closing or waived any condition to the
Closing related thereto. The waiver of any condition based on the accuracy of
any representation or warranty, or on the performance of or compliance with
any covenant or obligation, will not affect the right to indemnification based
on such representations, warranties, covenants and obligations.

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no Indemnified
Party shall have any right to seek or to obtain indemnification under this
Agreement for any exemplary or punitive damages, unless such exemplary or
punitive damages are in respect of any fraud, willful breach or Intentional
Misrepresentation of this Agreement or the Certificates or the subject of an
indemnifiable Third Party Claim pursuant to a final judgment. 

6.4 Claims for Indemnification; Resolution of Conflicts.

(a) Making a Claim for Indemnification; Officer's Certificate.

(iv) An Indemnified Party may seek recovery of Losses pursuant to this Article
VI by delivering to the Stockholder Representative (and, in the case of
recovery sought directly from one or more Indemnifying Parties directly,
delivering to such Indemnifying Party) an Officer's Certificate in respect of
such claim. The date of such delivery of an Officer's Certificate is referred
to herein as the "Claim Date" of such Officer's Certificate (and the claims
for indemnification contained therein). For purposes hereof, "Officer's
Certificate" shall mean a certificate signed by any officer of Parent: (A)
stating that an Indemnified Party has paid, sustained, incurred or accrued, or
reasonably anticipates that it will have to pay, sustain, incur or accrue
Losses and (B) specifying in reasonable detail the individual items of Losses
included in the amount so stated and the nature of the Indemnifiable Matter to
which such item is related.

(v) In the event that an Indemnified Party pursues a claim directly against
any Indemnifying Party, subject to the provisions of Section 6.3, Section
6.4(b) and Section 6.4(c) hereof, each Indemnifying Party shall promptly, and
in no event later than thirty (30) days after delivery of an Officer's
Certificate to such Indemnifying Party, wire transfer to the Indemnified Party
an amount of cash equal to the amount of the Loss.

(b) Objecting to a Claim for Indemnification.

(i) The Stockholder Representative (or, in the case of a claim directly
against one or more Indemnifying Parties, such Indemnifying Parties) may
object to a claim for indemnification set forth in an Officer's Certificate by
delivering to the Indemnified Party seeking indemnification a written
statement of objection to the claim made in the Officer's Certificate (an
"Objection Notice"), provided that, to be effective, such Objection Notice
must (i) be delivered to the Indemnified Party prior to midnight (California
time) on the thirtieth (30th) day following the Claim Date of the Officer's
Certificate (such deadline, the "Objection Deadline" for such Officer's
Certificate and the claims for indemnification contained therein) and (ii) set
forth in reasonable detail the nature of the objections to the claims in
respect of which the objection is made. Following the delivery of an Officer's
Certificate, Parent shall respond to reasonable inquiries from the Stockholder
Representative to understand matters asserted in such Officer's Certificate.

(ii) If the Stockholder Representative (or the Indemnifying Party, in the
event that indemnification is being sought hereunder directly from an
Indemnifying Party) does not object in writing (as provided in Section
6.4(b)(i)) to the claims contained in an Officer's Certificate prior to the
Objection Deadline for such Officer's Certificate, such failure to so object
shall be an irrevocable acknowledgment by the Stockholder Representative and
the Indemnifying Party that the Indemnified Party is entitled to the full
amount of the claims for Losses set forth in such Officer's Certificate (and
such entitlement shall be conclusively and irrefutably established) (any such
claim, an "Unobjected Claim"), and Parent shall release such amount from the
Escrow Amount in accordance with the terms such Officer's Certificate.

(c) Resolution of Conflicts. In case the Stockholder Representative (or the
Indemnifying Parties in the case of a claim for indemnification sought
directly from an Indemnifying Party) timely delivers an Objection Notice in
accordance with Section 6.4(b)(i) hereof, the Stockholder Representative (or
such objecting Indemnifying Party) and Parent shall attempt in good faith to
agree upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to each of such
claims. Either party may, but shall not be obligated to, initiate non‑binding
mediation of the dispute with the assistance of a neutral arbitrator belonging
to and under the rules of the CPR 

Institute for Dispute Resolution. The party requesting the mediation shall
arrange for mediation services, subject to the approval of the other party,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld. Mediation shall take place in Santa
Clara County, California during reasonable business hours and upon reasonable
advance notice. Mediation may be scheduled to begin at any time, but with at
least ten (10) Business Days' written notice to all parties. If one party
initiates mediation, the parties (i) shall participate in the mediation in
good faith and shall devote reasonable time and energy to the mediation so as
to promptly resolve the dispute or conclude that they cannot resolve the
dispute and (ii) shall not pursue other remedies while such mediation is
proceeding. If the Stockholder Representative (or the objecting Indemnifying
Parties) and Parent reach an agreement, a memorandum setting forth such
agreement shall be prepared and signed by both parties and, in the case of a
claim directly against the Indemnifying Parties, to the Indemnifying Parties.

6.5 Escrow Arrangements.

(a) Escrow Amount. By virtue of this Agreement and as partial security for the
indemnity obligations provided for in Section 6.2 hereof, at the Effective
Time Parent will deposit with the Escrow Agent the Escrow Amount without any
act of the Indemnifying Parties in accordance with the Escrow Agreement and
the Spreadsheet. The Escrow Amount shall be available to compensate the
Indemnified Parties for any claims by such parties for any Losses suffered or
incurred by them and for which they are entitled to recovery under this
Article VI. In the event that an Indemnified Party is compensated for any
Losses out of the Escrow Amount (a "Settlement"), (i) the amount of such
Losses shall be withdrawn from the Escrow Amount from both cash and shares of
Parent Common Stock in proportion to the amount of cash and Parent Common
Stock that comprised the Escrow Amount at Closing and (ii) the number of
shares of Parent Common Stock so withdrawn shall be determined by dividing (A)
the dollar value of such portion of Loss allocable to the Parent Common Stock
by (B) the Parent Trading Price; provided, however, that prior to the
Settlement, each Key Holder shall be given the option to substitute cash in
lieu of Parent Common Stock with respect to the Settlement.

(b) Escrow Period; Distribution upon Termination of Escrow Period. At 5:00
p.m., local time on the Survival Date (the "Escrow Period"), the Escrow Agent
shall distribute or cause to be distributed, any cash or Parent Common Stock
still held by the Escrow Agent, if any, to the Indemnifying Parties; provided,
however, that the Escrow Agent shall continue to withhold an amount comprised
of cash and shares of Parent Common Stock (with Parent Common Stock valued at
the Parent Trading Price) that (i) is in proportion to the amounts of cash and
Parent Common Stock that comprised the Escrow Amount at Closing, and (ii) is
equal to any unresolved and unsatisfied claims specified in any Officer's
Certificate ("Unresolved Claims") delivered to the Escrow Agent and
Stockholder Representative prior to the Escrow Period termination date with
respect to facts and circumstances existing prior to the Survival Date, and
any such amount shall not be distributed to the Indemnifying Parties at such
time. As soon as all such claims have been resolved, the Escrow Agent shall
deliver to the Indemnifying Parties the remaining portion of the Escrow
Amount, if any, not required to satisfy such Unresolved Claims. Deliveries of
the Escrow Amount to the Indemnifying Parties pursuant to this Section 6.5(b)
shall be made in proportion to their respective Pro Rata Portions of the
remaining portion of the Escrow Amount, if any (with the amount delivered to
each Indemnifying Party rounded to the nearest one hundredth (0.01) (with
amounts 0.005 and above rounded up)) and such amounts shall be delivered to
the Indemnifying Parties who are Key Holders in the form of Parent Common
Stock (valued at the Parent Trading Price) and in the form of cash to
Indemnifying Parties who are not Key Holders. If the sum of the Pro Rata
Portions, each rounded to the nearest one hundredth (0.01) (with amounts 0.005
and above rounded up), does not equal the remaining portion of the Escrow
Amount withheld due to Unresolved Claims, then the appropriate amount will be
added to or subtracted from the Indemnifying Party with the greatest Pro Rata
Portion such that the sum of the rounded Pro Rata Portions does equal the
remaining portion of the Escrow Amount. 

(c) Holdback of Amounts Payable to the Key Holders. The parties hereto agree
and acknowledge that a portion of the amounts otherwise payable to the Key
Holders in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereunder will be retained and held back by Parent in accordance with Schedule
6.5(c) hereto, such individual's Stock Restriction Agreement and as set forth
in the Spreadsheet without any act of such Key Holders. Notwithstanding
Section 6.5(b), upon termination of the Escrow Period, the Escrow Agent shall
distribute, or cause to be distributed, the remaining portion, if any, of the
Escrow Amount attributed to amounts payable to the Key Holders pursuant to
their respective Stock Restriction Agreements (subject to last two sentences
of Section 6.5(b)) to the Key Holders on the later of (i) the applicable
vesting date, subject to each such Key Holder continuing to be a Service
Provider (as defined in the Plan) through such date and further subject to the
other terms and conditions applicable to the accelerated vesting of such
payments, if applicable, as set forth in such Key Holder's Stock Restriction
Agreement and (ii) the resolution of any Unresolved Claims.

(d) Protection of the Escrow Amount. The parties agree that, except to the
extent there is a cancellation of shares of Parent Common Stock which comprise
part of the Escrow Amount in connection with Losses resulting from an
Indemnifiable Matter, shares of Parent Common Stock held by the Escrow Agent
shall be treated by Parent as issued and outstanding stock of Parent, and that
"Computershare, as Escrow Agent" shall be shown as the record holder of the
shares of Parent Common Stock that comprise part of the Escrow Amount (which
such shares being held by the Escrow Agent in escrow for the benefit of the
applicable Key Holder); provided, that the Escrow Agent shall not vote any of
the shares of Parent Common Stock which comprise part of the Escrow Amount.
Upon receiving any dividends with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock
which comprise part of the Escrow Amount, such dividends shall be included in
the Escrow Amount.

6.6 Third Party Claims. In the event Parent becomes aware of a third party
claim (a "Third Party Claim") which Parent reasonably believes may result in a
demand against the Escrow Amount or other indemnification pursuant to this
Article VI, Parent shall promptly notify the Stockholder Representative (or,
in the event indemnification is being sought hereunder directly from an
Indemnifying Party, such Indemnifying Party) of such claim (which such notice
shall include a summary in reasonable detail of the basis of the Third Party
Claim and to the extent practicable a reasonable estimate of the Losses), and
the Stockholder Representative shall be entitled on behalf of the Indemnifying
Parties (or, in the event indemnification is being sought hereunder directly
from an Indemnifying Party, such Indemnifying Party shall be entitled), at
their expense, to participate in, but not to determine or conduct, the defense
of such Third Party Claim. The failure to so promptly notify the Stockholder
Representative shall not relieve the Indemnifying Parties of any liability,
except to the extent and only to the extent the Stockholder Representative
demonstrates that the defense of such action is materially prejudiced thereby.
If there is a Third Party Claim that, if adversely determined would give rise
to a right of recovery for Losses hereunder, then any amounts incurred by the
Indemnified Parties in defense of such Third Party Claim shall be deemed
Losses hereunder. Parent shall have the right in its sole discretion to
conduct the defense of, and to settle, any such claim; provided, however,
that, in the event that the consent of the Stockholder Representative (or, in
the event indemnification is being sought hereunder directly from an
Indemnifying Party, such Indemnifying Party) is not obtained, such settlement
shall not be determinative that such claim was indemnifiable pursuant to this
Article VI or determinative of the amount of Losses; provided further,
however, that the consent of the Stockholder Representative with respect to
any settlement of any such Third Party Claim shall be deemed to have been
given unless the Stockholder Representative shall have objected within twenty
(20) days after a written request for such consent by Parent. In the event
that the Stockholder Representative has consented to any such settlement, the
Indemnifying Parties shall have no power or authority to object under any
provision of this Article VI to the amount of any Third Party Claim by Parent
against the Escrow Amount, or against the Indemnifying Parties directly, as
the case may be, with respect to such settlement. 

6.7 Stockholder Representative

(a) Shareholder Representative Services LLC is hereby appointed as the agent
and attorney‑in‑fact of the Indemnifying Parties as the Stockholder
Representative for and on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties to give and
receive notices and communications, to authorize satisfaction of claims by
Parent, to object to such payments, to agree to, negotiate, enter into
settlements and compromises of, and demand arbitration and comply with orders
of courts and awards of arbitrators with respect to such claims, and to take
all other actions that are either (i) necessary or appropriate in the judgment
of the Stockholder Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing or
(ii) specifically mandated by the terms of this Agreement. Such agency may be
changed by the Indemnifying Parties from time to time upon not less than ten
(10) days prior written notice to Parent; provided, however, that the
Stockholder Representative may resign at any time and may not be removed
unless the former holders of a majority of Company Capital Stock agree to such
removal and to the identity of the substituted agent. A vacancy in the
position of Stockholder Representative may be filled by the former holders of
a majority of Company Capital Stock. No bond shall be required of the
Stockholder Representative, and the Stockholder Representative shall not
receive any compensation for its services other than pursuant to the terms of
that certain Engagement Letter to be entered into by and among the Stockholder
Representative, the Company and certain of the Indemnifying Parties. After the
Closing, notices or communications to or from the Stockholder Representative
shall constitute notice to or from the Stockholder Representatives (including
the Indemnifying Parties).

(b) The Stockholder Representative shall not be liable for any act done or
omitted hereunder or under the Escrow Agreement as Stockholder Representative
while acting in good faith and in the absence of willful misconduct and gross
negligence. The Indemnifying Parties shall indemnify the Stockholder
Representative and hold the Stockholder Representative harmless against any
losses, liabilities, damages, claims, penalties, fines, forfeitures, actions,
fees, costs and expenses (including the fees and expenses of counsel and
experts and their staffs and all expenses of document location, duplication
and shipment) (collectively, "Representative Losses") arising out of or in
connection with the acceptance or administration of the Stockholder
Representative's duties hereunder or under the Escrow Agreement, in each case
as such Representative Loss is suffered or incurred; provided, that in the
event that any such Representative Loss is finally adjudicated to have been
directly caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the
Stockholder Representative, the Stockholder Representative will reimburse the
Indemnifying Parties the amount of such indemnified Representative Loss to the
extent attributable to such gross negligence or willful misconduct. If not
paid directly to the Stockholder Representative by the Indemnifying Parties,
any such Representative Losses may be recovered by the Stockholder
Representative from (i) the Expense Fund Amount and (ii) the Escrow Amount at
such time as remaining amounts would otherwise be distributable to the
Indemnifying Parties; provided, that while this Section allows the Stockholder
Representative to be paid from the Expense Fund Amount and the Escrow Amount,
this does not relieve the Indemnifying Parties from their obligation to
promptly pay such Representative Losses as they are suffered or incurred, nor
does it prevent the Stockholder Representative from seeking any remedies
available to it at law or otherwise. In no event will the Stockholder
Representative be required to advance its own funds on behalf of the
Indemnifying Parties or otherwise. The Indemnifying Parties acknowledge and
agree that the foregoing indemnities will survive the resignation or removal
of the Stockholder Representative or the termination of this Agreement.

(c) A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder Representative,
including but not limited to an amendment, extension or waiver of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.3 and Section 7.4 hereof, shall constitute a
decision of the Indemnifying Parties and shall be final, binding and
conclusive upon the Indemnifying Parties. Parent may rely upon any such
decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder Representative as
being the decision, act, consent or instruction of the Indemnifying Parties.
Parent is hereby 

relieved from any Liability to any Person for any acts done by them in
accordance with such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder
Representative.

6.8 Tax Treatment. Any payment under Article VI of this Agreement shall be
treated by the parties for U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. income Tax
purposes as a purchase price adjustment unless otherwise required by
applicable law.

8.10 Legal Representation; Attorney-Client Privilege.

(a) Each of the parties to this Agreement hereby agrees that Fenwick and West

Company Stockholder or Company Optionholder and such Company Stockholder's or
Company Optionholder's respective Affiliates (individually and collectively,

connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (the
"Existing Representation"), and that, following consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, Fenwick and West LLP (or any successor) may

waives any conflict of interest arising therefrom, and each of such parties
shall cause any Affiliate thereof to consent to waive any conflict of interest
arising from the Existing Representation.

or assert, and agrees to cause its Affiliates (including the Surviving
Corporation) to waive and to not control or assert, any attorney-client
privilege, attorney work-product protection or other similar privilege or
protection applicable to, or any expectation of client confidence with respect
to, (i) any communication between any legal counsel (including Fenwick and West
LLP), on the one hand, and the Holder Group, on the other hand, that is
protected by the attorney-client privilege between such parties, solely
regarding the negotiation, execution, and delivery of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby in any Post-Closing Representation (other
than any Third Party Claim), or (ii) any other advice given to the Holder
Group by Fenwick and West LLP, that is protected by the attorney-client
privilege between such parties, occurring during the Existing Representation
in connection with any Post-Closing Representation, including in connection
with a dispute between the Holder Group and

2. No Solicitation.

(a) Until the earlier of (i) the Closing, or (ii) the date of termination of

any of its affiliates permit any of its officers, directors, employees,
stockholders, agents, representatives or affiliates to), directly or
indirectly, take any of the following actions with any party other than Parent
and its designees: (A) solicit, initiate, participate or knowingly encourage
any negotiations or discussions with respect to any offer or proposal to
acquire all or material portion of the Company's business or properties, or
any equity interest in the Company or shares of Company Capital Stock or any
rights to acquire any shares of Company Capital Stock or other equity
interests in the Company, regardless of the form of transaction (a "Competing
Transaction"), or effect any such transaction, (B) disclose any information to
any Person concerning the business or properties of the Company, or afford to

receive, prior to the earlier of the Closing and the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with Section 7.1 of this Agreement, any offer,
proposal, or request, directly or indirectly, of the type referenced in clause
(A), (C) or (D) above, or any request for disclosure or access as referenced
in clause (B) above, the Company or such affiliate shall (x) immediately
terminate, suspend or otherwise discontinue any and all discussions or other
negotiations with such Person with regard to such offers, proposals, or
requests and (y) promptly (and in any event within 24 hours of such event)
notify Parent thereof, including information as to the identity of the Person
making any such offer or proposal and the specific terms of such offer or
proposal, as the case may be, and such other information related thereto as
Parent may reasonably request, including, but not limited to a copy of any
written inquiry, offer or proposal or a summary of the principal terms of any
such inquiry, offer or proposal that is not in writing; provided, however,
that to the extent the disclosure of any such information would require the
Company to breach any non-disclosure agreement existing prior to the date
hereof, the Company shall not be required to disclose such information but
will inform Parent as to the existence of any such Competing Transaction and
its good faith opinion (based upon the advice of legal counsel and its
financial advisors) as to whether the Competing Transaction is inferior or
superior from a financial point of view to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

(b) The parties hereto agree that irreparable harm would occur in the event
that the provisions of Section 2(a) were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed by
the parties hereto that Parent shall be entitled to an immediate injunction or
injunctions, without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of money damages
as a remedy and without the necessity of posting any bond or other security,
to prevent breaches of the provisions of this Section 2 and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the United States
or any state having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy
to which Parent may be entitled at law or in equity. Without limiting the
foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the restrictions set forth
above by any officer, director, agent, representative or affiliate of the
Company shall be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement by the Company.

3. Access to Information. The Company shall afford Parent and its accountants, counsel and other representatives, reasonable access during business hours and with prior notice to the Company during the period from the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time to (a) all of the properties, books, contracts, commitments and records of the Company (other than privileged documents), including all Company IP (including access to design processes and methodologies and all source code), (b) all other information concerning the business, properties and personnel (subject to restrictions imposed by applicable law and other than privileged documents) of the Company as Parent may reasonably request, and (c) all Employees of the Company as identified by Parent.

representatives copies of internal financial statements (including Tax Returns
and supporting documentation) promptly upon request.

4. Notification of Certain Matters. The Company or Parent, as the case may be, shall give prompt notice to the other parties of: (a) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event that is likely to cause any representation or warranty of the Company or Parent, respectively and as the case may be, contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate at or prior to the Closing, (b) any failure of the Company or Parent, as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder, and (c) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event, the occurrence or non-occurrence of which is reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect ; provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 4 shall not limit or otherwise affect any remedies available to the party receiving such notice or constitute an acknowledgement or admission of a breach of this Agreement. No disclosure by the Company, or Parent pursuant to this Section 4, however, shall be deemed to amend or supplement the Disclosure Schedule or prevent or cure any misrepresentation, breach of representation or warranty or breach of covenant.
