(b) On or as promptly as practicable after the Closing, the Paying Agent
shall distribute their respective portions of the Merger Consideration to the
Holders that have properly completed, executed and delivered to Acquiror, with
a copy to the Paying Agent, a Letter of Transmittal and all other
documentation required by the Letter of Transmittal (i) first to Holders of
Units other than Incentive Units (each such Holder, a " _Specified Holder_ ")
in accordance with the distribution mechanics set forth in Section 6.1(b)(i)
of Company's Amended and Restated Operating Agreement, and then (ii) to all
Holders of Units (including Incentive Units) in accordance with the
distribution mechanics set forth in Section 6.1(b)(ii) of Company's Amended
and Restated Operating Agreement; _provided_ that in the event any Specified
Holder has not delivered a Letter of Transmittal in accordance with _Section
_ _2.8(a)_ , the Paying Agent shall retain any amount that would be payable to
such Specified Holder until such time as it has received a Letter of
Transmittal in accordance with _Section _ _2.8(a)_ , and such amount shall
not be available for distribution pursuant to _Section 2.8_ _(b)_ _(ii)_.
Pending distribution of the Merger Consideration, the Merger Fund shall be
held by the Paying Agent in trust, uninvested in cash, for the benefit of the
Holders and shall not be used for any other purposes. Nothing contained herein
shall diminish the rights of any Holder to receive its portion of the Merger
Consideration as provided herein. The amount payable in respect of each
Incentive Unit pursuant to this _Section _ _2.8_ is sometimes referred to
herein as the " _Incentive Unit Distribution Amount_ ", and the amount payable
in respect of each Unit that is not an Incentive Unit pursuant to this
_Section_ _2.8_ is sometimes referred to herein as the " _Unit Distribution
Amount_."

 



 

 



   



 

(c) If payment is to be made to a Person other than the record Holder, it
shall be a condition to such payment that the Person requesting such payment
shall pay to the Paying Agent any transfer or other Taxes required as a result
of such payment being made to a Person other than the record Holder or
establish to the satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such Tax has been paid
or is not payable.

 



 

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further transfers recorded
in the register of members of the Surviving Entity of Units that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

(e) If any cash deposited with the Paying Agent for purposes of payment of
the consideration in exchange for Units in accordance with this _Section _
_2.8_ remains unclaimed for two (2) years after the Effective Time, such cash
shall be returned to Acquiror or its designee automatically, and any Holder of
Units who has not complied with the procedures set forth herein and in the
Letter of Transmittal shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Entity for
payment of such amount, without interest. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by
Holders after five (5) years after the Effective Time (or such earlier date
prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become
property of any Governmental Authority) shall, to the extent permitted by Law,
become the property of the Surviving Entity, free and clear of any claims or
interests of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 



 

(f) No dividends or other distributions with respect to shares in the
capital of the Surviving Entity with a record date after the Effective Time
shall be paid with respect to Units.

 



 

2.9 _Withholding_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, any payment to a Holder in respect of Units shall be reduced by the
applicable amount of withholding for Tax purposes that is required by Law (the
" _Withholding Amount_ "), which Withholding Amount shall be remitted by the
applicable withholding agent to the IRS or other appropriate Taxing Authority;
_provided_ , _however_ , that absent a change in Law, no withholding on
account of Taxes shall be performed by Acquiror, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Entity or the Paying Agent in respect of any payment to a Holder in respect of
such Holders Units that are not Incentive Units if Acquiror receives such
Holders Letter of Transmittal containing both (x) (i) a duly completed and
validly executed Non-Foreign Affidavit in the form attached as _Schedule 2.9_
and (ii) a duly completed and validly executed IRS Form W-9, in each case,
with respect to such Holder. Any such Withholding Amount shall be treated for
all purposes hereunder as having been paid to the Holder with respect to whom
such Withholding Amount was deducted and withheld if it is timely paid to the
appropriate Governmental Authority.

 



 

2.10 _Allocation_ _of Purchase Price_. Within ninety (90) days after the
Closing Date, Acquiror shall prepare and cause to be delivered to the Tax
Matters Member an allocation (the " _Purchase Price Allocation_ ") of the
consideration delivered pursuant to this Agreement (and all other capitalized
costs) among the assets of the Company in accordance with Section 1060 of the
Code and the Treasury Regulations issued thereunder (and any similar provision
of state, local, or other applicable Law, as appropriate). Acquiror will give
the Tax Matters Member reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the
Purchase Price Allocation and Acquiror will consider in good faith any
comments that the Tax Matters Member has with respect to the Purchase Price
Allocation. Acquiror, the Holders and their respective Affiliates shall
report, act and file any Tax Returns (including, but not limited to IRS Form
8594) in all respects and for all purposes consistent with such Purchase Price
Allocation prepared by Acquiror. The Tax Matters Member shall reasonably
discuss and consult with Acquiror on the timely and proper preparation,
execution, filing and delivery of all such documents, forms and other
information as Acquiror shall reasonably request to prepare such Purchase
Price Allocation. Neither Acquiror, the Holders nor their Affiliates shall
take any position (whether on any Tax Returns, in any Action relating to
Taxes, or otherwise) that is inconsistent with such Purchase Price Allocation,
unless required to do so by applicable Law.

4.3 _No Conflict_. Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.3_ subject to the
receipt of the consents, approvals, authorizations and other requirements set
forth on _Schedule 3.5_ or _Schedule_ _ 4.5_, the execution and delivery of
this Agreement by Acquiror and Merger Sub and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby do not and will not violate any provision of,
or result in the breach of any applicable Law, the other organizational
documents of Acquiror or any Subsidiary of Acquiror (including Merger Sub), or
any agreement, indenture or other instrument to which Acquiror or any
Subsidiary of Acquiror (including Merger Sub) is a party or by which Acquiror
or any Subsidiary of Acquiror (including Merger Sub) may be bound, or
terminate or result in the termination of any such agreement, indenture or
instrument, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the properties
or assets of Acquiror or any Subsidiary of Acquiror (including Merger Sub) or
constitute an event which, after notice or lapse of time or both, would
reasonably be expected to result in any such violation, breach, termination or
creation of a Lien, except to the extent that the occurrence of the foregoing
would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the
ability of Acquiror or Merger Sub to enter into and perform its obligations
under this Agreement.

 



 

4.4 _Litigation and Proceedings_. There are no Actions, or, to the
knowledge of Acquiror, investigations, pending before or by any Governmental

4.5 _Governmental Authorities; Consents_. Assuming the accuracy and
completeness of the representations and warranties of the Company contained in

of the HSR Act as described on _Schedule_ _3.5_ , (b) the Gaming Approvals
described on _Schedule_ _3.5_ , and (c) as otherwise disclosed on _Schedule_ _
_ _4.5_. To the knowledge of Acquiror, no fact or circumstance exists,

Acquiror or any of its Affiliates, that (a) would reasonably be expected to
prevent or delay, in any material respect, the filings, approvals, clearances,
authorizations or expiration of any applicable waiting period required under
the HSR Act or (b) would cause a Governmental Authority (including a Gaming
Authority) to seek to decline to grant any Gaming Approval, or prohibit or
materially delay consummation of the Merger.

sources of immediately available funds to enable it to consummate the

Merger Sub is entering into this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby with the actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or
future creditors. Assuming that the representations and warranties of the
Company contained in this Agreement are true and correct in all material
respects, and after giving effect to the Merger, at and immediately after the
Effective Time, each of Acquiror and the Surviving Entity and its Subsidiaries
(a) will be solvent (in that both the fair value of its assets will not be
less than the sum of its debts and that the present fair saleable value of its
assets will not be less than the amount required to pay its probable liability
on its recourse debts as they mature or become due); (b) will have adequate
capital and liquidity with which to engage in its business; and (c) will not
have incurred and does not plan to incur debts beyond its ability to pay as
they mature or become due.

 



 

4.10 _Licensability; Compliance with Gaming Laws_.

 



 

(a) None of Acquiror, Merger Sub, or their Affiliates or any of their
respective current executive officers, directors, partners, managers, members,
principals or Affiliates which may reasonably be considered in the process of
determining the suitability of Acquiror and Merger Sub for a Gaming Approval,
or any holders of Acquiror's common stock or other equity interests who will
be required to be licensed or found suitable under applicable Gaming Laws and
directors (the foregoing Persons collectively, the " _Licensing Affiliates_
"), has ever abandoned or withdrawn (in each case in response to a
communication from a Gaming Authority regarding a likely or impending denial,
suspension or revocation) or been denied or had suspended or revoked a Gaming
License, or an application for a Gaming License, by a Gaming Authority.
Acquiror, Merger Sub and each of their respective Licensing Affiliates which
is licensed or holds any Gaming License pursuant to applicable Gaming Laws
(collectively, the " _Licensed Parties_ ") is in good standing in each of the
jurisdictions in which such Licensed Party owns, operates or manages gaming
facilities. Following consultation with Acquiror's legal and regulatory
advisors, to the knowledge of Acquiror, there are no facts which, if known to
any Gaming Authority would be reasonably likely to (i) result in the denial,
revocation, limitation or suspension of a Gaming License of any of the
Licensed Parties, (ii) result in a negative outcome to any finding of
suitability proceedings of any of the Licensed Parties currently pending, or
under the suitability proceedings necessary for the consummation of the Merger
or (iii) unreasonably delay approval of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 



 

 



   



 

(b) To the knowledge of Acquiror, each of the Licensed Parties, and each
of the Licensed Parties' officers, directors, partners, managers, members,
principals, and Affiliates, holds all Gaming Licenses and all such permits as
are necessary to conduct the business and operations of the Licensed Parties
as currently conducted, each of which is in full force and effect (the "
_Acquiror Permits_ "), except for such permits not held or in full force and
effect as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected
to (i) prevent or materially delay the ability of Acquiror or Merger Sub to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) prevent or
materially delay the ability to obtain the Gaming Approvals or (iii)
materially adversely affect the ability of Acquiror or Merger Sub to perform
their obligations under this Agreement, and no event has occurred which
permits, or upon the giving of notice or passage of time or both would permit,
revocation, non-renewal, modification, suspension, limitation or termination
of any Acquiror Permit that currently is in effect, the loss of which, either
individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to (i) prevent
or materially delay the ability of Acquiror or Merger Sub to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) prevent or materially delay
the ability to obtain the Gaming Approvals or (iii) materially adversely
affect the ability of Acquiror or Merger Sub to perform their obligations
under this Agreement. Each of the Licensed Parties and each of the Licensed
Parties' respective officers, directors, partners, managers, members,
principals, and Affiliates is in compliance with the terms of the Acquiror
Permits, except for such failures to comply which would not, individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to (i) prevent or materially delay
the ability of Acquiror or Merger Sub to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) prevent or materially delay the ability
to obtain the Gaming Approvals or (iii) materially adversely affect the
ability of Acquiror or Merger Sub to perform their obligations under this
Agreement. Neither Acquiror nor any of its Licensing Affiliates has received
written notice with respect to any investigation or review by any Gaming
Authority or other Governmental Authority of Acquiror or any of its Licensing
Affiliates that is pending, and, to the knowledge of Acquiror, no
investigation or review is threatened, other than those investigations and
reviews the outcome of which would not reasonably be expected to (i) prevent
or materially delay the ability of Acquiror or Merger Sub to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) prevent or materially delay
the ability to obtain the Gaming Approvals or (iii) materially adversely
affect the ability of Acquiror or Merger Sub to perform their obligations
under this Agreement.

 



 

(c) No Licensed Party, and, to the knowledge of Acquiror, no Licensing
Affiliate or Affiliate of any Licensed Party, has received any written claim,
demand, notice, complaint, court order or administrative order from any Gaming
Authority or other Governmental Authority under, or relating to any violation
or possible violation of, any Gaming Law which did or would be reasonably
likely to result in an individual fine or penalty of $10,000 or more. To the
knowledge of Acquiror, there are no facts which if known to any Gaming
Authority would reasonably be expected to result in the revocation, limitation
or suspension of a Gaming License or other material Acquiror Permit, finding
of suitability, registration, or other permit or approval of the Licensed
Parties, or any of their respective Licensing Affiliates, except for such
revocations, limitations or suspensions which would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to (i) prevent or materially delay the
ability of Acquiror or Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, (ii) prevent or materially delay the ability to obtain the
Gaming Approvals or (iii) materially adversely affect the ability of Acquiror
or Merger Sub to perform their obligations under this Agreement. None of the
Licensed Parties, and, to the knowledge of Acquiror, none of their respective
Licensing Affiliates, has suffered a suspension, denial, non-renewal,
limitation or revocation of any Acquiror Permit within the last five years.

that would make the Merger illegal or otherwise delay or prohibit the
consummation of the Merger, Acquiror and its Affiliates and Subsidiaries shall
use their respective reasonable best efforts to promptly take any and all
actions to contest and defend any such Action to use their respective
reasonable best efforts to avoid entry of, or to have vacated, lifted,
reversed, repealed, rescinded or terminated, any such Governmental Order.

 



 

 



   



 

(e) Acquiror shall cooperate in good faith with the Regulatory Consent
Authorities and shall use its reasonable best efforts to complete lawfully the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as soon as practicable (but in any
event prior to the Termination Date) and shall use its reasonable best efforts
to avoid, prevent, eliminate or remove the actual or threatened commencement
of any proceeding in any forum by or on behalf of any Regulatory Consent
Authority described on _Schedule 3.5_ and _Schedule 4.5_ or the issuance of
any Governmental Order (permanent or preliminary) that would delay, enjoin,
prevent, restrain or otherwise prohibit the consummation of the Merger,
including using its reasonable best efforts in (i) proffering, negotiating and
consenting and/or agreeing to a Governmental Order or other agreement
providing for the sale, licensing or other disposition, or the holding
separate (through the establishment of a trust or otherwise), of particular
assets, categories of assets, properties or lines of business of the Company
(following the Merger) or Acquiror or its Affiliates and promptly effecting
the disposition, licensing or holding separate of assets or lines of business,
(ii) terminating, modifying or assigning existing relationships, Contracts or
obligations of Acquiror or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates or those relating to
any assets, categories of assets, properties or lines of business to be
acquired pursuant to this Agreement, (iii) changing or modifying any course of
conduct regarding future operations of Acquiror or its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates or the assets, categories of assets, properties or lines of
business to be acquired pursuant to this Agreement or (iv) otherwise taking or
committing to take any other action that would limit Acquiror or its
Subsidiaries and Affiliates' freedom of action with respect to, or their
ability to retain, one or more of their respective operations, divisions,
businesses, product lines, customers, assets or rights or interests, or their
freedom of action with respect to the assets, categories of assets, properties
or lines of business to be acquired pursuant to this Agreement, in the case of
each of (i)-(iv), at such time as may be necessary to permit the lawful
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby as soon as practicable
and, in any event, prior to the Termination Date. The entry by any
Governmental Authority in any Action of a Governmental Order permitting the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby but requiring any of the
assets or lines of business of Acquiror to be sold, licensed or otherwise
disposed or held separate thereafter (including the business and assets of the
Company and its Subsidiaries) shall not be deemed a failure to satisfy any
condition specified in _Article_ _8_ or the obligations under this _Section
6.1_.

 



 

(f) In furtherance of, but not in limitation of Acquiror's rights under
_Section 5.3(b)_ , Acquiror shall promptly furnish to the Company copies of
any notices or written communications received by Acquiror or any of its
Affiliates from any third party or any Governmental Authority with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and Acquiror shall permit
counsel to the Company an opportunity to review in advance, and Acquiror shall
consider in good faith the views of such counsel in connection with, any
proposed written communications by Acquiror and/or its Affiliates to any
Governmental Authority concerning the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Acquiror agrees to provide the Company and its counsel the
opportunity, on reasonable advance notice, to participate in any substantive
meetings or discussions, either in person or by telephone, between Acquiror
and/or any of its Affiliates, agents or advisors, on the one hand, and any
Governmental Authority, on the other hand, concerning or in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

 



   



 

(g) Acquiror further agrees that prior to the Closing Date it and its
Affiliates will not enter into any other Contract to acquire any other
business, if any such proposed acquisition would prevent the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

6.2 _Director and Officer Indemnification and Insurance_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Acquiror agrees that it shall, and
shall cause the Company and AG LLC, to indemnify and hold harmless each
present and former director and officer of the Company and AG LLC against any
costs or expenses (including attorneys' fees and disbursements), judgments,
fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any
Action, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out
of or pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to
the fullest extent that the Company or AG LLC, as the case may be, would have
been permitted under applicable Law and its respective certificate of
formation, operating agreement or other organizational documents and
agreements in effect on the date of this Agreement to indemnify such person
(including the advancing of expenses as incurred to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law). Without limiting the foregoing, (i) Acquiror
shall cause the Surviving Entity and each of its Subsidiaries (A) to maintain
for a period of not less than six (6) years from the Effective Time provisions
in its certification of formation, operating agreement and other
organizational documents or agreements concerning the indemnification and
exoneration (including provisions relating to expense advancement) of the
Company's and AG LLC's former and current officers, directors, employees, and
agents that are no less favorable to those Persons than the provisions of the
certificates of formation, operating agreements and other organizational
documents and agreements of the Company or AG LLC, as applicable, in each
case, as of the date of this Agreement and (B) not to amend, repeal or
otherwise modify such provisions in any respect that would adversely affect
the rights of those Persons thereunder, in each case, except as required by
Law and (ii) Acquiror agrees that (x) the covenants contained in this _Section
6.2_ are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
of the current and former directors and officers specified in this _Section
6.2_ and their respective heirs and (y) any indemnification and advancement of
expenses available to any current or former director of the Company or AG LLC
by virtue of such current or former director's service as a partner or
employee of any investment fund that is an Affiliate or equity owner of the
Company prior to the Closing (any such current or former manager, a " _Sponsor
Manager_ ") shall be secondary to the indemnification and advancement of
expenses to be provided by Acquiror, the Surviving Entity and its Subsidiaries
pursuant to this _Sectio_ _n_ _ 6.2_ and that Acquiror, the Surviving Entity
and its Subsidiaries (A) shall be the primary indemnitors of first resort for
Sponsor Managers pursuant to this _Section 6.2_, (B) shall be fully
responsible for the advancement of all expenses and the payment of all losses,
damages and other costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees and
disbursements) with respect to Sponsor Managers which are addressed by this
_Section_ _ 6.2_ and (C) shall not make any claim for contribution,
subrogation or any other recovery of any kind in respect of any other
indemnification available to any Sponsor Manager with respect to any matter
addressed by this _Section 6.2_. Acquiror shall assume, and be jointly and
severally liable for, and shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to
honor, each of the covenants in this _Section_ _ 6.2_.

 



 

(b) In the event that the Company has not done so on a date that is five
(5) Business Days prior the anticipated Closing Date, Acquiror shall cause the
Surviving Entity to purchase, on or prior to the Closing purchase a directors'
and officers' liability insurance policy covering a period of six (6) years
from the Effective Time, those Persons who are currently covered by the
Company's or AG LLC's directors' and officers' liability insurance policies
(true, correct and complete copies of which have been heretofore delivered to
or made available to Acquiror or its agents or representatives) on terms at
least as favorable as the terms of such current insurance coverage and which
are reasonably satisfactory to the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i)
the Company, Acquiror or the Surviving Entity may cause coverage to be
extended under the current directors' and officers' liability insurance by
obtaining a six-year "tail" policy containing terms at least as favorable as
the terms of such current insurance coverage with respect to matters existing
or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with
this Agreement or any of the Transaction Documents or the transactions or
actions contemplated hereby and thereby); _provided_ , that the premium paid
by the Company for such "tail" policy shall not exceed 300% of the current
premium for the Company's current directors' and officers' liability insurance
policy, and (ii) if any claim is asserted or made within such six-year period,
any insurance required to be maintained under this _Section_ _ 6.2_ shall be
continued in respect of such claim until the final disposition thereof.

 



 

 



   



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary,
this _Section_ _ 6.2_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger
indefinitely and shall be binding, jointly and severally, on all successors
and assigns of Acquiror and the Surviving Entity. In the event that Acquiror
or the Surviving Entity or any of their respective successors or assigns,
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving entity or entity of such consolidation or merger or
transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of Acquiror or the Surviving Entity, as the
case may be, shall succeed to the obligations set forth in this _Section_ _
6.2_.

 



 

6.3 _Employment Matters_.

 



 

(a) At any time prior to the Closing, Acquiror will have the right, but
not the obligation, to interview or otherwise meet and/or discuss with the
individuals employed by the Company or AG LLC that are (i) either (x) employed
pursuant to an employment agreement with a member of the Company Group, or (y)
among the Company Group's 25 most highly compensated employees (based on
aggregate cash compensation paid in 2015), and (ii) identified in a separate
notice provided by Acquiror to the Company (the " _Specified Employees_ ")
during normal business hours and as otherwise requested by Acquiror. In
connection therewith, the Company will, and will cause AG LLC to, reasonably
cooperate with Acquiror to facilitate any such interview, meeting or
discussion. The Company shall use its reasonable efforts to, effective as of
the Closing, terminate the employment of, including terminating the employment
agreement of, the individuals listed on one or more separate notices provided
by Acquiror to the Company, which notices will be given not less than five (5)
Business Days prior to the Closing (the " _Identified Employees_ "). All of
the liabilities, payments, costs and expenses associated with, or payable
upon, the termination of the Identified Employees at or prior to the Closing,
including any "change of control", severance or other payment that is
triggered by such termination or the consummation of the Merger or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, shall constitute "Transaction
Expenses".

 



 

(b) For a period of one (1) year following the Closing Date, Acquiror
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to, or shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Surviving Entity to, maintain for employees
who continue in the employ of Acquiror, the Surviving Entity or any of their
Subsidiaries following the Closing Date (" _Continuing Employees_ "), (i)
annual rates of base salaries or wage levels and annual target cash incentive
opportunities that are substantially comparable in all material respects to
those provided to the Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Closing
and (ii) employee benefits that are, in the aggregate, no less favorable than
the greater of (i) those provided to similarly situated employees of Acquiror
and (ii) those provided to the Continuing Employees immediately prior to the
Closing. This _Section_ _ 6.3_ shall not limit the obligation of Acquiror to
maintain any compensation arrangement or benefit plan that, pursuant to an
existing contract, must be maintained for a period longer than one (1) year
nor shall it limit or affect any payments to be made pursuant to any benefit
plan or bonus plan (it being understood that all such payments shall be made
in accordance with the terms thereof, without amendment or modification,
following the Closing by the Company and/or AG LLC). No provision of this
Agreement shall be construed as a guarantee of continued employment of any
Continuing Employee and this Agreement shall not be construed so as to
prohibit the Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries from having the right to
terminate the employment of any Continuing Employee, _provided_ that any such
termination is effected in accordance with applicable Law.

 



 

 



   



 

(c) From and after the Closing, the Acquiror shall give each Continuing
Employee full credit for purposes of eligibility to participate, level of
benefits, vesting and benefit accrual under any employee benefit plans,
arrangements, and employment-related entitlements provided, sponsored,
maintained or contributed to by Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries for such
Continuing Employee's service with the Company or AG LLC, and with any
predecessor employer, to the same extent recognized by the Company or AG LLC,
except (i) to the extent such credit would result in the duplication of
benefits for the same period of service. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (ii)
with respect to the extent permitted under applicable Law, Acquiror shall not
be required to provide credit for such service for benefit accrual purposes
under any employee benefit plan of Acquiror that is under a defined benefit
pension plan or retiree welfare benefit plan or (iii) with respect to any
newly established plan for which prior service is not taken into account for
employees of Acquiror.

 



 

(d) Acquiror shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to (i) waive or
cause to be waived for each Continuing Employee and his or her dependents, any
waiting period provision, payment requirement to avoid a waiting period, pre-
existing condition limitation, actively-at-work requirement and any other
restriction that would prevent immediate or full participation under the
welfare plans of Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries applicable to such
Continuing Employee to the extent such waiting period, pre-existing condition
limitation, actively-at-work requirement or other restriction would not have
been applicable to such Continuing Employee under the terms of the welfare
plans of the Company and AG LLC, and (ii) to give or cause to be given full
credit under the welfare plans of Acquiror and its Subsidiaries applicable to
each Continuing Employee and his or her dependents for all co-payments and
deductibles satisfied prior to the Closing in the same plan year as the
Closing, and for any lifetime maximums, as if there had been a single
continuous employer.

 



 

(e) This Agreement is not intended by the parties to, and nothing in this
_Section_ _ 6.3_ or otherwise in this Agreement, whether express or implied,
shall, (i) constitute an amendment to any Company Benefit Plan, (ii) obligate
Acquiror, the Company or any Subsidiary to maintain any particular
compensation or benefit plan, program, policy or arrangement, (iii) create any
obligation of the parties hereto with respect to any employee benefit plan of
Acquiror or any Company, or (iv) confer on any Continuing Employee or any
other Person (other than the parties to this Agreement) any rights or remedies
(including third-party beneficiary rights)

 



 

6.4 _Access to Books and Records_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Closing, in connection with any reasonable business
purpose relating to the Holders' ownership of Units or their, or any of their
Affiliates', status as a current or former officer, manager or equity holder
of the Company or AG LLC, including preparation of governmental or regulatory
reporting obligations, or the resolution of any claims made against or
incurred by the Holders in respect of periods prior to the Closing, for a
period of seven (7) years after the Closing, Acquiror shall cause the
Surviving Entity and its Subsidiaries to (i) retain the books and records
relating to the Surviving Entity and its Subsidiaries with respect to periods
prior to the Closing in a manner reasonably consistent with the prior practice
of the Company and AG LLC, and (ii) upon reasonable advance notice and subject
to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information (it being agreed
that Acquiror shall cause the Surviving Entity and its Subsidiaries to make
reasonable and appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under
circumstances in which such Laws apply), Acquiror and the Surviving Entity
shall, and shall cause AG LLC to, afford to the Holders and their respective
representatives, during normal business hours, reasonable access to the
Surviving Entity's and its Subsidiary's books and records (as they existed on
the Closing Date), _provided_ , that such right shall not (a) apply to
information that is proprietary or confidential to the Surviving Entity or is
subject to an attorney-client privilege or (b) cause the Surviving Entity or
any of its Subsidiaries to violate any applicable confidentiality obligations
(it being agreed that at the Holder's request, the Surviving Entity shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to seek a waiver of such third party
restriction and/or make reasonable and appropriate substitute disclosure
arrangements).

 



 

 



   



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary,
this _Section_ _ 6.4_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger for a
period of seven (7) years after the Closing and shall be binding, jointly and
severally, on all successors and assigns of Acquiror and the Surviving Entity.
In the event that Acquiror or the Surviving Entity or any of their respective
successors or assigns, consolidates with or merges into any other Person and
shall not be the continuing or surviving entity or entity of such
consolidation or merger or transfers or conveys all or substantially all of
its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Acquiror or the
Surviving Entity, as the case may be, shall succeed to the obligations set
forth in this _Section_ _ 6.4_.

 



 

(c) Acquiror agrees that the covenants contained in this Section 6.4 are
intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the
Holders and their respective heirs, successors and assigns.

 



 

6.5 _Payment of the Transaction Bonus Payments_. Except as otherwise
agreed in writing by the Company and the Acquiror prior to the Closing, at the
Closing, Acquiror shall pay, or cause to be paid, on behalf of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, all obligations in respect of the Transaction Bonus
Payments.

 



 

Article 7 
JOINT COVENANTS

 



 

7.1 _Support of Transaction_. Without limiting any covenant contained in
_Article 5_ or _Article 6_, including the obligations of Acquiror with
respect to the notifications, filings, reaffirmations and applications set
forth on _Schedule_ _ 4.5_ as described in _Section_ _ 6.1_, which
obligations shall control to the extent of any conflict with the succeeding
provisions of this _Section_ _ 7.1_, Acquiror and the Company shall each, and
shall each cause their respective Subsidiaries to: (a) use reasonable best
efforts to assemble, prepare and file any information (and, as needed, to
supplement such information) as may be reasonably necessary to obtain as
promptly as practicable all governmental and regulatory consents required to
be obtained in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (including
the Gaming Approvals), (b) use reasonable best efforts to obtain all material
consents and approvals of third parties that any of Acquiror, the Company, or
their respective Affiliates are required to obtain in order to consummate the
Merger (including the Gaming Approvals), and (c) take such other action as may
reasonably be necessary or as another party may reasonably request to satisfy
the conditions of _Article_ _ _ _8_ or otherwise to comply with this Agreement
and to consummate the transaction contemplated hereby as soon as practicable
and, in any event, prior to the Termination Date. Subject in all respects to
the covenants contained in _Article 5_ and _Article 6_ , in no event shall,
Acquiror, the Company or AG LLC be obligated to bear any material expense or
pay any material fee, or to grant any material concession in connection with
obtaining any consents, authorizations or approvals pursuant to the terms of
any Contract to which the Company or AG LLC is a party in connection with the
consummation of the Merger.

 



 

 



   



 

7.2 _Tax Matters_.

 



 

(a) The Parties agree to report the merger for U.S. federal income and
other applicable Tax purposes consistent with Situation 2 in Revenue Ruling
99-6., 1999-1 CB 432, i.e., as the purchase by a single purchaser of all of
the interests in an entity classified as a partnership at the time of its
purchase. Accordingly, a final partnership tax return for the Company shall be
prepared for the period January 1, 2016 through the date immediately preceding
the Closing Date.

 



 

(b) The Company shall prepare or cause to be prepared in a manner
consistent with past practices (except where otherwise required by applicable
Law), all Tax Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries for all taxable
years or periods ending on or before the Closing Date but which are required
to be filed after the Closing Date (taking into account all applicable
extensions of time for filing) and all Tax Returns with respect to any
Straddle Period (" _Acquiror Prepared_ _Tax Returns_ "); Acquiror shall cause
all such Acquiror Prepared Tax Returns to be delivered to the Tax Matters
Member no later than thirty (30) days before the due date (after giving effect
to any applicable extensions) of the applicable Acquiror Prepared Tax Return.
Acquiror shall cause the Company to incorporate such comments provided in
writing by the Tax Matters Member to Acquiror with respect to all Acquiror
Prepared Tax Returns, to the extent such comments (i) are not inconsistent
with this Agreement or past practice and, to the extent applicable, would not
cause any return preparer to be unable to sign such return and (ii) would not
materially and negatively impact the Company, AG LLC or Acquiror in any Post-
Closing Period. Further, Acquiror agrees that in the event that the Company
fails to incorporate any such comments for the reasons set forth in the
preceding sentence and Tax Matters Member continues to dispute or disagree
with the treatment or calculation of any amount or item on a Acquiror Prepared
Tax Return (which dispute or disagreement is not resolved on the earlier of
ten (10) Business Days of receipt by Acquiror of notice thereof and ten (10)
Business Days prior to the due date (after giving effect to any applicable
extensions) of the applicable Acquiror Prepared Tax Return), Acquiror shall
cause the Company to retain PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP to review the
applicable Acquiror Prepared Tax Return in dispute or the subject of the
disagreement and prepare a revised Acquiror Prepared Tax Return reflecting its
proposed resolution of the items the subject of such dispute or disagreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in preparing such revised Acquiror Prepared Tax
Return, (i) such firm shall be acting as an expert and not as an arbitrator
and shall prepare such revised Acquiror Prepared Tax Return in accordance with
this Agreement, (ii) such firm shall only address such items that remain the
subject of such dispute or disagreement, and (iii) the firm may not assign a
value to any item or other matter greater than the greatest value for such
item or other matter claimed by either party or less than the smallest value
for such item or other matter claimed by either party. The costs associated
with such firm shall be borne by Acquiror and the Tax Matters Member (for the
account of all the Holders) in proportion to the extent to which each did not
prevail in such dispute.

 



 

(c) Acquiror and the Tax Matters Member shall cooperate fully, and shall
cause their respective Affiliates to cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the filing of Tax
Returns and any Action regarding Taxes of, or with respect to, the Company or
its Subsidiaries. Such cooperation shall include the retention of and (upon
the other party's request) the provision of records and information reasonably
relevant to any such Action and making employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder.

 



 

 



   



 

(d) Acquiror shall promptly notify the Tax Matters Member in writing upon
receipt by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of a written notice of any
claim relating to Taxes for any period prior to the Closing Date.

 



 

(e) Acquiror and the Tax Matters Member agree that (i) any Company
Transaction Expenses, (ii) any fees, expenses, premiums and penalties with
respect to the prepayment of debt and the write-off or acceleration of the
amortization of deferred financing costs, (iii) any accrued and unpaid year-
end performance bonuses for employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
(iv) the payment of the Transaction Bonus Payments, (v) any cancellation of
outstanding options, restricted equity interests, or other equity or rights
convertible into equity (including any "phantom" equity or comparable awards
or arrangements), including the Incentive Units, any such options, restricted
equity units, other equity or rights with respect to Units, (vi) payments made
in connection with the settlement or resolution of any Action with respect to
the Company and AG LLC to the extent (A) paid prior to the Closing or (B) to
the extent not paid prior to the Closing, to the extent accrued or reflected
on the Company's balance sheet as of the Closing Date, and (vii) the payment
of the Closing Date Indebtedness, including any components thereof (the items
described in _clauses_ (i) through _(vii)_ , " _Specified Transaction
Expenses_ ") are each properly allocable to the portion of the Closing Date
preceding the Closing. The parties hereto agree that no ratable election shall
be made with respect to the transactions contemplated in this Agreement.

 



 

(f) Except as otherwise required by Law, Acquiror shall not, and shall
cause the Company and its Subsidiaries not (i) to take any action on the
Closing Date other than in the ordinary course of business or other than any
action permitted hereunder, or (ii) amend any Tax Return of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or make, change or revoke any Tax election, grant an
extension of any applicable statute of limitations or take any action, fail to
take any action, or enter into any transaction that would increase or effect
any Pre-Closing Tax Liability.

 



 

(g) For purposes of this Agreement, in the case of any Taxes that are
payable with respect to a taxable period that begins before the Closing Date
and ends after the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ "), the portion of any
Taxes that are payable for such Straddle Period and relate to the portion of
such Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall (i) in the case of ad
valorem or property Taxes, be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the
entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the
number of days in the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of days in the entire Straddle Period and
(ii) in the case of any other Tax, such as income, sales or use Tax, be deemed
equal to the amount which would be payable computed on closing of the books
basis as if the relevant Tax period ended as of the close of business on the
Closing Date.

 



 

(h) Any Tax refund (including any interest actually received with respect
thereto) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries relating to taxable periods
(or portions thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date that is received by
the Acquiror or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (a " _Pre-Closing Tax
Refund_ ") shall be the property of the Holders. Acquiror shall within ten
(10) days after the receipt of any Pre-Closing Tax Refund pay to the Tax
Matters Member (on behalf of the Pre-Closing Holders) the amount of such Pre-
Closing Tax Refund. The parties agree that Pre-Closing Tax Refunds for the
portion of a Straddle Period that ends on the Closing Date shall be determined
using the methodologies set forth in _Section_ ___7.2(g)_ _ _. For the
avoidance of doubt, Acquiror shall have no affirmative obligation to pursue
any potential Pre-Closing Tax Refund.

 



 

7.3 _Changes in Circumstances_. From the date of this Agreement until
seven (7) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company may from time
to time, by written notice to the Acquiror, supplement or amend a Schedule
with a corresponding reference to be added in this Agreement to disclose any
material change to such Schedule, _provided_ that (i) such material change
would cause one or more of the conditions in _Article 8_ not to be satisfied,
(ii) the matter or circumstance underlying such material change was not in
existence in any respect prior to the date of this Agreement, (iii) neither
the Company, AG LLC or any of their respective Representatives had any
knowledge (nor should any of them reasonably have been expected to have any
knowledge) of such matter or circumstance prior to the date of this Agreement
(each, a " _Schedule Supplement_ "), and each such Schedule Supplement shall
be deemed to be incorporated into and to supplement and amend the Schedule as
of the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date. If the matter which is the
subject of the Schedule Supplement constitutes or relates to something that
could provide Acquiror with a right to terminate this Agreement in accordance
with its express terms and Acquiror does not elect to terminate this Agreement
prior to the earlier of ten (10) Business Days of its receipt of such Schedule
Supplement and the Termination Date, then Acquiror shall be deemed to have
irrevocably waived any right to terminate this Agreement on account of such
matter.

this Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.1_, this Agreement shall forthwith
become void and have no effect, without any liability on the part of any party
hereto or its respective Affiliates, officers, directors or shareholders,
other than liability of the Company, Acquiror or Merger Sub, as the case may

neither Acquiror, Merger Sub nor any of their respective Affiliates shall,
directly or indirectly, recruit, solicit, hire or retain any person who is an

(a) In the event that this Agreement is terminated (i) by the Company
pursuant to _Section 10.1(d)_, or (ii) by the Company or Acquiror (if such
termination is permitted hereunder) and at the time of such termination all of
the conditions set forth in _Article 8_ shall have been satisfied or waived
(if legally permitted) by the appropriate party (other than those conditions
that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing) except for the
condition or conditions set forth in _Section 8.1(a)_ relating solely to HSR
Approval or Nevada Gaming Approvals in relation to the Merger or _Section

or the Nevada Gaming Authorities (such occurrence relating solely to HSR

Business Days after the date of such termination, pay, or cause to be paid, to
the Company or its designees the Termination Fee (an amount equal to
$30,000,000) (the " _Termination Fee_ ") by wire transfer of same day funds
(it being understood that in no event shall Acquiror be required to pay the
Termination Fee on more than one occasion). Solely for purposes of
establishing the basis for the amount thereof, and without in any way
increasing the amount of the Termination Fee or expanding the circumstances in
which the Termination Fee is to be paid, it is agreed that the Termination Fee
is a liquidated damage, and not a penalty.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the
event that this Agreement is terminated (x) by the Company pursuant to
_Section 10.1(d)_ or (y) pursuant to a Regulatory Failure, except in the case
of fraud by Acquiror or Merger Sub, the payment of the Termination Fee by
Acquiror pursuant to _Section 10.3(a)_, when paid as required under this
Agreement, and the payment of any amounts due pursuant to _Section 10.3(c)_,
when paid (if required under this Agreement), shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy of the Company against (i) Acquiror or Merger Sub, (ii) the former,
current and future holders of any equity, partnership or limited liability
company interest, controlling persons, directors, officers, employees, agents,
attorneys, Affiliates, members, managers, general or limited partners,
shareholders, or assignees of Acquiror or Merger Sub or any Affiliates of
either; and (iii) any future holders of any equity, partnership or limited
liability company interest, controlling persons, directors, officers,
employees, agents, attorneys, Affiliates, members, managers, general or
limited partners, shareholders, or assignees of any of the foregoing for any
Loss or other liability of any kind under this Agreement or otherwise relating
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including as a result of
the failure of the Merger to be consummated.

 



 

 



   



 

(c) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this _Section
10.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and that, without these agreements, the parties would not enter into this
Agreement. If Acquiror fails promptly to pay the Termination Fee, and, in
order to obtain such payment, the Company commences an action or proceeding
that results in a judgment against Acquiror for the Termination Fee, Acquiror
shall pay to the Company, together with the Termination Fee, (a) interest on
the Termination Fee from the date of termination of this Agreement at a rate
per annum equal to the prime rate as published in the Wall Street Journal,
Eastern Edition, in effect on the Closing Date and (b) any costs and expenses
(including legal fees) incurred by the Company in connection with any such
action or proceeding. If Acquiror fails to pay the Termination Fee in
accordance with _Section 10.3(a)_, then the Company's termination of this
Agreement shall, at the Company's option, be revoked and become null and void
_ab initio_ and the Company may exercise any and all remedies (whether at law
or equity) against the Acquiror, including by seeking specific performance in
accordance with _Section 11.14_.

Agreement in accordance with _Section 10.1_ or to cause the Company to enter
into an amendment to this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 11.10_.

 



 

11.11 _Publicity_. The Company, on the one hand, and Acquiror, on the other
hand, shall cooperate in good faith to agree on the form and content of the
initial press release regarding the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. All press releases or other public communications of any nature
whatsoever relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
the method of the release for publication thereof, shall (i) prior to the
Closing, except in the case that a party is required by the rules and
regulations of the SEC (other than as it relates to the Information Statement,
which shall be governed by _Section 5.4_ ) or any securities exchange on which
such party's securities are listed (in which case the party required to make
the release or announcement will use its reasonable efforts to permit the
other party to review such release or announcement prior to issuance, and
consider, in good faith, any comments thereto provided by the other party), be
subject to the prior written mutual approval of Acquiror and the Company,
which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned by
any party, and (ii) following the Closing, be subject to the prior written
approval of Acquiror, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned. For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of this
_Section_ _ 11.11_, the Information Statement shall not be deemed to be a
public communication and shall not be governed by this _Section_ _ 11.11_.
All matters related to the Information Statement, including the preparation
and filing thereof, as well as any communications regarding the Information
Statement and any amendments thereto shall be governed exclusively by _Section
5.4_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, prior to the Closing,
the Company or Acquiror may make any public statement in response to questions
by the press, analysts, investors or those attending industry conferences or
financial analysts conference calls or in connection with a financing, so long
as any such statements are not inconsistent with previous press releases,
public disclosures or public statements made jointly by the Company and
Acquiror or made by one party and reviewed by the other and do not reveal non-
public information regarding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

 



   



 

11.12 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or
unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, the other provisions of
this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. The parties further
agree that if any provision contained herein is, to any extent, held invalid
or unenforceable in any respect under the Laws governing this Agreement, they
shall take any actions necessary to render the remaining provisions of this
Agreement valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by Law and, to
the extent necessary, shall amend or otherwise modify this Agreement to
replace any provision contained herein that is held invalid or unenforceable
with a valid and enforceable provision giving effect to the intent of the
parties.

 



 

11.13 _Jurisdiction_. Any proceeding or action based upon, arising out of
or related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby may be
brought in the state and/or federal courts located in the City, County and
State of New York, and each of the parties irrevocably submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of each such court in any such proceeding or action,
waives any objection it may now or hereafter have to personal jurisdiction,
venue or to convenience of forum, agrees that all claims in respect of the
proceeding or action shall be heard and determined only in any such court, and
agrees not to bring any proceeding or action arising out of or relating to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby in any other court.
Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to affect the right of any party to
serve process in any manner permitted by Law or to commence legal proceedings
or otherwise proceed against any other party in any other jurisdiction, in
each case, to enforce judgments obtained in any action, suit or proceeding
brought pursuant to this _Section 11.13_.

 



 

11.14 _Enforcement_. The parties agree that irreparable damage for which
monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would
occur in the event that the parties do not perform their obligations under the
provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are
required of them hereunder to consummate this Agreement) in accordance with
its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. The parties
acknowledge and agree that (a) the parties (and, where applicable, permitted
third party beneficiaries of this Agreement) shall be entitled to an
injunction, specific performance, or other equitable relief, to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof, without proof of damages, prior to the valid termination of
this Agreement in accordance with _Section 10.1_, this being in addition to
any other remedy to which they are entitled under this Agreement, (b) the
provisions set forth in _Section 10.3_ (i) are not intended to and do not
adequately compensate for the harm that would result from a breach of this
Agreement and (ii) shall not be construed to diminish or otherwise impair in
any respect any party's right to specific enforcement and (c) the right of
specific enforcement is an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and without that right, neither the Company nor Acquiror would
have entered into this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that,
notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, this _Section
11.14_ (and the remedies available pursuant to this _Section 11.14_) shall
not apply, the parties and any third party beneficiaries shall have no such
entitlement, and _Section 10.3_ shall be the Company's sole and exclusive
remedy if this Agreement is properly terminated under circumstances where the
Termination Fee is due hereunder, and Acquiror pays the Termination Fee as
required hereby. Each party agrees that it will not oppose the granting of
specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that the other
parties have an adequate remedy at Law or that an award of specific
performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or equity. The
parties acknowledge and agree that any party seeking an injunction to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this _Section 11.14_ shall
not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any
such injunction.

 



 

 



   



 

11.15 _Waiver of Conflicts_. Acquiror, Merger Sub and the Company (on behalf
of itself and AG LLC) agree that, notwithstanding any current or prior
representation of the Company or AG LLC by Akin Gump Strauss Hauer and Feld LLP
(" _Akin Gump_ "), Akin Gump shall be allowed to represent any Holder or any
of their respective Affiliates in any matters and/or disputes adverse to
Acquiror, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Entity, any Subsidiaries of
Acquiror, the Surviving Entity or the Company, or any of their respective
Affiliates that relates to this Agreement or any of the other Transaction
Documents, or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (" _Post-
Closing Representation_ "), and Acquiror, Merger Sub, and the Company (on
behalf of itself and AG LLC) hereby (a) waive any claim they have or may have
that Akin Gump has a conflict of interest or is otherwise prohibited from
engaging in such representation and (b) agree that, in the event that a
dispute arises after the Closing between Acquiror, the Surviving Entity, any
Subsidiaries of Acquiror or the Surviving Entity or any of their respective
Affiliates (on the one hand) and any Holder or any of their respective
Affiliates (on the other hand), Akin Gump may represent such Holder or such
Affiliate in such dispute even though the interests of such Holder or such
Affiliate may be directly adverse to Acquiror, the Surviving Entity, any
Subsidiaries of Acquiror or the Surviving Entity or any of their respective
Affiliates and even though Akin Gump may have represented the Company and AG
LLC in a matter related to such dispute. Acquiror and the Company (on behalf
of itself and AG LLC) also further agree that, as to all attorney-client
privileged communications (that do not otherwise evidence or relate to fraud)
between or among Akin Gump and the Company, any of the Subsidiaries of the
Company, any Holder and/or any of their respective Affiliates that relate in
any way to the negotiation, preparation, execution and Closing of this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents
in connection with the Post-Closing Representation, the attorney-client
privilege and the expectation of client confidence belongs to the Holder and
may be controlled by the Holder and shall not pass to or be claimed by
Acquiror, Merger Sub, the Surviving Entity, the Company or any Subsidiary or
Affiliate of Acquiror, the Surviving Entity or the Company.

 



 

11.16 _No Recourse_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement
to the contrary, but without limiting _Article 9_, each party hereto
covenants, agrees and acknowledges that, except in the case of fraud, no
recourse under this Agreement, any Transaction Document or any documents or
instruments delivered in connection with this Agreement or any Transaction
Document shall be had against any Holder's, Acquiror's, the Company's or any
of their respective Affiliates' former, current or future direct or indirect
equity holders, controlling persons, shareholders, directors, officers,
employees, agents, members, managers, general or limited partners or assignees
(each a " _Related Party_ " and collectively, the " _Related Parties_ "), in
each case other than the Holders, Acquiror, the Company, or any of their
respective successors and permitted assignees under this Agreement, whether by
the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding, or
by virtue of any applicable Law, it being expressly agreed and acknowledged
that no personal liability whatsoever shall attach to, be imposed on or
otherwise be incurred by any of the Related Parties, as such, for any
obligation or liability of the Holders, Acquiror, the Company or any of their
respective Affiliates under this Agreement, any Transaction Document or any
documents or instruments delivered in connection herewith or therewith for any
claim based on, in respect of or by reason of such obligations or liabilities
or their creation; _provided_ , _however_ , nothing in this _Section _
_11.16_ shall relieve or otherwise limit the liability of any Related Party
for fraud or the Holders, Acquiror, the Company or any Affiliate, as such, for
any breach or violation of its obligations under such agreements, documents or
instruments. Following the Closing, except in the case of fraud, none of
Acquiror, Merger Sub, the Surviving Entity or any of their respective
Affiliates shall have any recourse against any Holder Party on account of this
Agreement or any of the transaction contemplated herein.
