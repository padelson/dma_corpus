(other than Dissenting Shares), shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of any Buyer Party, the Company, any Holder or any other
Person, be automatically cancelled, extinguished and no longer outstanding,
and automatically converted into the right to receive a cash payment equal to

Agreement. Any Shares held in the treasury of the Company shall be canceled
and extinguished without any conversion thereof.

the Company who did not deliver a Stockholder Written Consent in connection
with the Merger and who comply with all of the relevant provisions of Section
262 of the DGCL (the "Dissenting Shares"), shall not be converted into or
represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration unless and until such
stockholders shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn
or lost their rights to appraisal under the DGCL; and any such stockholder
shall have only such rights in respect of the Dissenting Shares owned by them
as are provided by Section 262 of the DGCL. If any such stockholder shall have
failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such right, each
of such stockholder's Dissenting Shares shall thereupon be deemed to have been
converted into and to have become exchangeable, as of the Effective Time, for
the right to receive the Merger Consideration without any interest thereon,
pursuant to the terms of Section 2.6. Before the Effective Time, the Company
shall not, except with the prior written consent of Acquiror, voluntarily make
any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any claim made by

sufficient to allow the Paying Agent to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration
that is payable in respect of all of the Shares represented by Certificates,
other than Dissenting Shares or Shares to be canceled or extinguished pursuant
to the last sentence of Section 2.6(a) (such cash being hereinafter referred
to as the "Payment Fund"). As promptly as practicable following the Closing,
but in no event later than ten (10) calendar days thereafter, Acquiror shall
cause the Paying Agent to mail to each Holder (i) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of all Certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration in respect of each Share represented by such Certificates
pursuant to Section 2.6 and (ii) a letter of transmittal in the form attached
hereto as Exhibit E (the "Letter of Transmittal"), which Letter of Transmittal
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss of title to
the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery or transfer, as
applicable, of the Certificates to the Paying Agent (duly endorsed in blank
for transfer with the signature guaranteed).

(c) As promptly as practicable (but in any event no later than three (3)
Business Days) after the Paying Agent's receipt of a Certificate (or Affidavit
of Loss and Indemnity Agreement in lieu thereof in accordance with Section
2.9(f)), together with a duly executed Letter of Transmittal and such other
customary documents that the Paying Agent may reasonably require (or receipt
of an "agent's message" by the Paying Agent (or such other evidence, if any,
of transfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably require) in the case of book-
entry shares (collectively, "Holder Documents"), the Paying Agent shall pay to
the Holder of such Certificate the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect
of the Shares represented by such Certificate pursuant to the terms of Section
2.6. All surrendered Certificates shall be cancelled upon their delivery to
the Paying Agent.

(d) The Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in the Payment Fund as
directed by Acquiror, provided that no such investment or losses thereon shall
affect the amount of Merger Consideration payable to the Holders. Except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement, no interest shall be paid or accrued on
the amounts payable upon the surrender of the Certificates. Following the
Effective Time, until surrendered in accordance with the provisions of this
Section 2.9, each Certificate shall represent for all purposes, only the right
to receive the Merger Consideration in respect of each Share represented by
such Certificate, pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

(e) If payment of cash in respect of a surrendered Certificate is to be made
to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is
registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that the Certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form
for transfer (in the case of a book-entry share, such Certificate shall be
properly transferred) and that the Person requesting such payment shall have
paid to the Paying Agent any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of
such payment in a name other than that



of the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or shall have
established to the reasonable satisfaction of the Paying Agent, if any, that
such Tax either has been paid or is not payable.

(f) In the event any Certificates representing Shares issued and outstanding
immediately before the Effective Time shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, Acquiror shall make such payment in accordance with Section 2.6 in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates upon the Holder
thereof delivering to the Paying Agent a duly executed affidavit of loss and
indemnity agreement (in a form reasonably acceptable to Acquiror) stating that
such Holder claims such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed
("Affidavit of Loss and Indemnity Agreement") and the posting by such Holder
of a bond in such amount as Acquiror may determine is reasonably necessary as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate.

(g) The Merger Consideration made available to the Paying Agent in respect of
any Dissenting Shares shall be returned to Acquiror, upon demand. Any portion
of the Payment Fund that remains unclaimed by Holders one (1) year after the
Effective Time shall be paid to the Surviving Corporation. Any former
stockholders of the Company who have not theretofore exchanged their
Certificates pursuant to, and in accordance with, this ARTICLE II shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Merger
Consideration, in each case, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, none of Acquiror, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or
any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of Company
Capital Stock for any amount delivered in good faith to a public official
pursuant to applicable Escheat Laws.

2.2 No Further Transfer of Shares. After the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers of Shares that were issued and outstanding immediately before the
Effective Time on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation. If,
after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation for transfer, they shall be canceled and exchanged for cash as
provided in this ARTICLE II. At the close of business on the day of the

ARTICLE IV 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

The Company hereby represents and warrants to the Buyer Parties as follows:

4.1 Organization and Standing. Each Target Company is duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the Laws of its respective jurisdiction of
organization, has full power and authority to carry on the Business as it has
been and is now being conducted and to own, lease and operate the Assets. Each
Target Company is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing in
every jurisdiction in which the Business or the character of the Assets
requires such qualification, except for those jurisdictions where failure to
be so qualified has not had and would not reasonably be expected to
constitute, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.
Except as set forth on Schedule 4.1 of the Company's disclosure schedules
delivered pursuant to this Agreement and incorporated herein by this reference
(the "Disclosure Schedules"), no Target Company has any Subsidiaries or has
any stock or other equity or ownership interest (whether controlling or not)
in any corporation, association, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
legal entity.

Equity Securities (the "Shares") and its Subsidiaries' authorized and
outstanding equity securities (the "Subsidiary Shares") are as set forth on
Schedule 4.2 of the Disclosure Schedules, and the Subsidiary Shares are owned
of record by the stockholders set forth on Schedule 4.2 of the Disclosure
Schedules in the respective amounts set forth thereon. The Company's
Subsidiaries are set forth on Schedule 4.2 of the Disclosure Schedules. All of
the Shares and the Subsidiary Shares have been duly authorized and validly
issued, are fully paid and nonassessable, were not issued in violation of the
terms of any Contract binding upon any Target Company and were issued in
compliance with all applicable Charter Documents of each Target Company and
all applicable securities or "blue sky" Laws. No Equity Securities or equity
securities of the Subsidiaries, other than the Shares and the Subsidiary
Shares, are issued or outstanding. There are no preemptive rights with respect
to the issuance of the Shares or the Subsidiary Shares. Each Target Company
has complied with all preemptive rights associated with the Shares and the
Subsidiary Shares. Except as set forth on Section 4.2 of the Disclosure
Schedules, there are: (a) no existing Contracts, stock appreciation rights,
subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, commitments or rights of any
character (including



under any shareholder rights plan or similar antitakeover agreement or plan)
to purchase or otherwise acquire from any Target Company stockholder or a
Target Company at any time, or upon the happening of any stated event, any
capital stock or other securities of any Target Company, whether or not
presently issued or outstanding; (b) no outstanding securities of any Target
Company that are convertible into or exchangeable for capital stock or other
securities of any Target Company; and (c) no Contracts, stock appreciation
rights, subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, phantom units, restricted
stock or other equity-based awards, commitments or rights of any character to
purchase or otherwise acquire from any Target Company any such convertible or
exchangeable securities.

4.3 Authority and Binding Effect. The Company has the full power and authority
to execute and deliver the Transaction Documents to which it is a party, to

Transactions and has taken all actions necessary to secure all corporate
approvals required in connection therewith. This Agreement constitutes, and
the other Transaction Documents to which the Company is a party will
constitute, legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable
against it in accordance with their respective terms, except to the extent
that their enforceability may be subject to the Enforceability Exceptions. The
Company Board has duly adopted and approved resolutions to the effect that:
(a) this Agreement and the Transactions, including the Merger, are fair to,
and in the best interests of, the Company and the Company's stockholders, (b)
the Company Board has approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the
consummation of the Transactions, including the Merger, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth herein, and (c) the Company Board has
directed that this Agreement be submitted to the Company's stockholders for
adoption thereby.

4.4 Validity of the Transactions. Neither the execution and delivery of this
Agreement by the Company nor the consummation of the Transactions will (a)
contravene the Charter Documents of any Target Company, (b) result in the
imposition of any Liens on the Assets of any Target Company, (c) contravene or
violate any Law or Court Order that is applicable to any Target Company, (d)
result in a Default under, or require the consent or approval of any party to,
any Contract relating to the Business or the Assets or to or by which any

the Company (together with its Subsidiaries), taken as a whole.

4.5 Financial Statements; Books of Account; Indebtedness.

consolidated balance sheet of the Target Companies (the "Audited Balance
Sheet") as of December 31, 2017 (the "Balance Sheet Date") and the related

position and results of operations of the Company (together with its

related records, the material amount of any unpaid Taxes not yet due and

against, or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened with respect to any
Target Company in respect of any Taxes material to the Company (together with

beneficiary of any extension of time within which to file any Tax Return. No
Target Company has waived any statute of limitations in respect of Taxes or

deficiency. No claim has ever been made by a Governmental Authority in a
jurisdiction where a Target Company does not file Tax Returns that it is or
may be subject to material taxation by that jurisdiction or that it must file
Tax Returns, nor is there any basis for such a claim. No Target Company has
ever had employees or agents, maintained an office or otherwise contracted
business, or maintained a permanent establishment in any country outside of
the U.S. or Canada. There are no Liens on any of the stock or Assets of any
Target Company with respect to Taxes, other than Permitted Liens.

Assets are currently used in the conduct of the Business.

4.10 Real Property.

(a) Schedule 4.10(a) of the Disclosure Schedules sets forth a true and
complete list of each parcel of real property owned by any Target Company
(together with all improvements thereon and appurtenances thereto, the "Owned

Target Company has good and valid fee simple title to all Owned Real Property,
free and clear of all Liens other than Permitted Liens.

Enforceability Exceptions.



(d) No Target Company has received written notice since January 1, 2015 that
(and since January 1, 2018, to the Knowledge of the Company, the Company has
not received any written or oral notice that) the uses and operations of the
Real Property by the Target Companies do not comply in all material respects
with all applicable Laws, covenants, conditions, restrictions, easements,
disposition agreements and similar matters affecting the Real Property.

(e) No material portion of the Real Properties are subject to any pending
condemnation or eminent domain Litigation by any Person, including without
limitation, a Governmental Authority and, to the Knowledge of the Company,
there is no threatened condemnation, eminent domain, or other Litigation with

right of way or other restriction affecting the Real Property. To the
Knowledge of the Company, the Real Property and its continued use, occupancy
and operation as used, occupied and operated in the conduct of the Business as

operations or condition of the Company (together with its Subsidiaries), taken
as a whole.

Companies are contractually obligated to pay any compensation (other than
licensing



fees and royalties set forth in the applicable license agreement and
referenced on Schedule 4.11(e) of the Disclosure Schedules (except licenses
for commercially available off-the-shelf Software licensed for less than
$15,000 (based on the fees paid for any such Software in fiscal year 2017)))
to any third party for the use thereof or the material covered thereby (such
agreements, the "IP Agreements"). To the Knowledge of the Company, Schedule
4.11(e) of the Disclosure Schedules sets forth a complete and accurate list
of, and the Company has made available to Acquiror true and complete copies
of, all IP Agreements pursuant to which a third party has licensed any of the
Company Intellectual Property to the Target Companies and includes the date
thereof and identity of all parties thereto (except licenses for commercially
available off-the-shelf Software sold for less than $15,000 (based on the fees
paid for any such Software in the fiscal year ended 2017)). No Person who has
licensed to the Target Companies any Intellectual Property Rights that are
included in the Company Intellectual Property has ownership rights or license
rights to improvements made by any Target Company in such Intellectual
Property Rights (except licenses for commercially available off-the-shelf
Software sold for less than $15,000 (based on the fees paid for any such
Software in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017)). None of the Company
Intellectual Property owned by the Target Companies has any software embedded
therein whose ownership has been retained by a third party except open source
software.

(f) To the Knowledge of the Company, all material Company Intellectual
Property written or created as of the date hereof and owned by the Target
Companies was written and created solely by either (i) employees of the Target
Companies acting within the scope of their employment or (ii) third parties
who have either validly and irrevocably assigned all of their rights,
including Intellectual Property Rights therein, to the Target Companies (or in
the case where any such Intellectual Property Rights are not owned by any of
the Target Companies, granted to the Target Companies a valid license
permitting the continued usage of such rights).

(g) The Target Companies have taken commercially reasonable steps to protect
their rights in the Company Intellectual Property owned or used by the Target
Companies, including without limitation the confidential information and Trade
Secrets that they wish to protect or any Trade Secrets or confidential
information of third parties provided to them.

(h) The Target Companies have not transferred ownership of, or granted any
exclusive license of or exclusive right to use, or authorized the retention of
any exclusive rights to use or joint ownership of, any material Company
Intellectual Property owned by the Target Companies, to any third party.

(i) To the Knowledge of the Company, the Company Intellectual Property
constitutes all the Intellectual Property Rights used in and/or necessary to
the conduct of the Business.

(j) To the Knowledge of the Company, since July 1, 2015, there have been no
acts or omissions by the Target Companies' officers, directors, employees,
contractors or licensees that have had, or would reasonably be expected to
have, a Material Adverse Effect Event on the ability of the Target Companies
to apply for or enforce legal protection for the Company Intellectual Property
owned by the Target Companies. Since July 1, 2015, the Target Companies have
not permitted the rights of the Target Companies in the Company Intellectual
Property owned by the



Target Companies to lapse or enter the public domain, and to the Knowledge of
the Company, there is no third party that has permitted any such rights from
lapsing or entering the public domain.

(k) Since January 1, 2015, except as set forth on Schedule 4.11(k) of the
Disclosure Schedules, no Target Company has been sued or charged as a
defendant in any Litigation that involves a claim of infringement of any
Intellectual Property Rights of any third party. To the Knowledge of the
Company, the operation of the Business up to and as of the Closing does not
infringe or misappropriate any Intellectual Property Right of any third party,
violate any right of any third party (including any right to privacy or
publicity) or constitute unfair competition or trade practices under the Laws
of any U.S. state or federal or any foreign jurisdiction, and, since January
1, 2015, except as set forth on Schedule 4.11(k) of the Disclosure Schedules,
no Target Company has received written notice from any third party claiming
that any Target Company or Company Intellectual Property or service (including
Technology or services currently under development) infringes or
misappropriates or otherwise violated any Intellectual Property Right of any
third party or constitutes unfair competition or trade practices under the
Laws of any jurisdiction (nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, is there any
basis therefor).

(l) To the Knowledge of the Company, no Person is infringing or
misappropriating any Company Intellectual Property.

(m) No Company Intellectual Property owned by any of the Target Companies (or
to the Knowledge of the Company, used by the Target Companies) is subject to
any Litigation or outstanding decree, order, judgment or settlement agreement
or stipulation that restricts in any manner the use, transfer or licensing
thereof by any of the Target Companies or may affect the validity, use or
enforceability of such Company Intellectual Property.

(n) Each Target Company is, and has been at all times since July 1, 2015, in
compliance in all material respects with all relevant requirements of any
applicable data protection and data privacy Law and Order and applicable
privacy policies, including without limitation compliance with such Target
Company's own data protection and privacy policies. Since July 1, 2015 except
as set forth on Schedule 4.11(n) of the Disclosure Schedules, no Target
Company has received any written notification from a Governmental Authority
regarding non-compliance or violation of any data protection or data privacy
Law. Since January 1, 2015, except as set forth on Schedule 4.11(n) of the
Disclosure Schedules, no Person has provided written notice to Target Company
claiming that such Person is due compensation from a Target Company for the
loss or unauthorized disclosure or transfer of personal data, and to the
Knowledge of the Company, no facts or circumstances exist that could
reasonably be expected to give rise to such a claim insofar as the same relate
to a Target Company.

(o) All Information Systems used by any of the Target Companies are sufficient
in all material respects for the conduct of their Business as currently
conducted. The Target Companies use commercially reasonable means to protect
the security and integrity of all Information Systems used by any of the
Target Companies.

(p) No Company Intellectual Property owned by the Target Companies is subject
to any Open Source License that would (i) require the divulgement to any
Person of any Source



Code or Trade Secret that is part of the Company Intellectual Property, (ii)
grant a license to any Company Intellectual Property for the purpose of
creating derivative works or (iii) grant a license to any Person to
redistribute any Company Intellectual Property.

(q) Schedule 4.11(q) of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and complete
list of all material Software owned by the Target Companies and licensed to
any third party(ies). No such Software ("Proprietary Software") contains any
coded instructions, anti-circumvention measures, routine, programming devices
(e.g., viruses, spyware, malware, trojan horses, key locks), backdoors or
other means that causes the Proprietary Software, other software or the
computer system (or computer systems) on which the Proprietary Software is
installed or cooperate(s) with to perform an unauthorized function, operate in
an unauthorized manner, disable, erase, or otherwise harm software, hardware
or data, or permits third parties to access the Proprietary Software or such
other software, or computer system (or computer systems) on which the
Proprietary Software is installed or cooperate(s) with, without authorization
from the owner of the computer system (or computer systems). To the Knowledge
of the Company, none of the Proprietary Software (i) contains any material
bug, defect or error (including any bug, defect or error relating to or
resulting from the display, manipulation, processing, storage, transmission or
use of data) that materially and adversely affects the use, functionality or
performance of such Proprietary Software or any product or system containing
or used in conjunction with such Proprietary Software or (ii) fails to
materially comply with any applicable warranty or other contractual commitment
relating to the use, functionality or performance of such Proprietary
Software.

(r) With respect to the Proprietary Software, no Source Code is currently held
by any escrow agent or other Person, and no Target Company is under any
obligation (conditional or otherwise) to do so.

in equity). None of the Target Companies nor, to the Knowledge of the Company,
any of the other parties thereto, is in Default under such Material Contracts,
and no written notice of any claim of Default has been received by any Target
Company, except as has not had and would not reasonably be expected to be,
individually or in the aggregate, material to the Company (together with its
Subsidiaries), taken as a whole. With respect to any of such Material
Contracts that are Leases, no Target Company has received any written notice
of cancellation or termination under any option or right reserved to the
lessor, or any written notice of an unresolved Default, thereunder. To the

Business as now conducted or to permit the ownership by the Target Companies
of the Assets free and clear of all Liens, except Permitted Liens, except

and will not be adversely affected by the completion of the Transactions; and

making power) of any Governmental Authority, agency, political party,
government-owned company or multilateral agency ("Government Official") for
purposes of (i) influencing any act or decision of any Government Official,
(ii) inducing such Government Official to do or omit to do any act in
violation of the lawful duty of such official or (iii) inducing such

individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material to the
Company (together with its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole: all such policies

thereon have been paid; the Target Companies are in compliance with the terms

exists no event, occurrence, condition or act that, with the giving of notice,
the lapse of time or the happening of any other event or condition, including

Company, no notice of cancellation, nonrenewal, or that any issuer of such
policy has filed for protection under applicable bankruptcy Laws or is
otherwise in the process of liquidating or has been liquidated has been

(including without limitation the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986),
wages, hours, collective bargaining, discrimination, civil rights, safety and

4.18 Employee Benefit Plans.

accurate list of all material Company Plans. True, correct and complete copies
of all of the following documents with respect to each material Company Plan,

administered, operated and maintained in all material respects in accordance
with their governing documents.

(c) The Company Plans marked on Schedule 4.18(a) of the Disclosure Schedules
as "Qualified Plans" are the only Company Plans that are intended to meet the
requirements of Section 401(a) of the Code (each, a "Qualified Plan"). The
Qualified Plans have received current determination, opinion or advisory
letters, and no such determination, opinion or advisory letter has been
revoked. Nothing has occurred with respect to the plan document, design or
operation of any Qualified Plan that would reasonably be expected to
materially and adversely affect the qualified status of such Qualified Plan.

(d) With respect to each Company Plan, there has occurred no nonexempt
"prohibited transaction" (within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code or
Section 406 of ERISA) that would result in any Liability material to the
Company (together with its Subsidiaries), taken as a whole, that has not
already been satisfied. No claim, lawsuit, arbitration or other action is



pending or to the Knowledge of the Company has been threatened, asserted or
instituted against or involving any of the Company Plans (other than those
made in the ordinary operation of such plans), in all cases, except as would
not result in material liability to any Target Company. No Company Plan has,

(e) No Target Company sponsors, maintains or contributes to, nor has any
Liability with respect to, any employee benefit plan subject to Section 302 of
ERISA, Section 412 of the Code or Title IV of ERISA. None of the Company Plans
is a multiemployer plan (as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA). No Target
Company contributes to, nor has any Liability (whether current or contingent)
with respect to, a multiemployer plan (as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA).

contribute to a multiple employer plan (as defined in Section 413 of the
Code).

(f) Except as set forth on Section 4.18(f) of the Disclosure Schedules,
neither the execution or delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of
the Transactions will give rise to any vesting or payment of benefits,
severance, termination pay, bonuses or other payments or the enhancement of
any benefits or payments, in any case, under any Company Plan. No Target
Company has entered into any agreement or arrangement to, and does not
otherwise have any obligation to, indemnify or hold harmless any individual
for any Liability that results from the failure to comply with the
requirements of Section 409A of the Code or for the excise tax under Code
Section 4999.

(g) With respect to any Company Plan that is an employee welfare benefit plan
(within the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA), (i) with respect to any welfare
benefit fund (within the meaning of Section 419 of the Code) there is no
disqualified benefit (within the meaning of Section 4976(b) of the Code) that
would result in the imposition of a material Tax under Section 4976(a) of the
Code, (ii) any Company Plan that is a group health plan (within the meaning of

the Public Health Service Act, the applicable provisions of the Social
Security Act, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996

health, medical, dental or vision benefits after an employee's or former
employee's retirement or other termination of employment except as required by
Section 4980B of the Code or other applicable Law. No Company Plan is a
"multiple employer welfare arrangement" (within the meaning of Section 3(40)
of ERISA) or any such Company Plan that is a multiple employer welfare
arrangement (within the meaning of Section 3(40) of ERISA) has complied in all
material respects with ERISA, the Code and all other applicable Laws.

(h) No Target Company has any legal obligation to create any additional
Company Plan or to modify or change any existing Company Plan.



(i) Each Target Company has paid all amounts material to the Company (together
with its Subsidiaries), taken as a whole, that such Target Company is required
to pay as contributions to the Company Plans as of the last day of the most
recent fiscal year of each of the Company Plans, and as required in accordance
with applicable Law. The Company and its Subsidiaries have, in all material
respects, satisfied all obligations to their respective employees, consultants
and directors with respect to overtime pay, vacation pay and any other amounts
that are due from them to such employees, consultants or directors, except for

Companies have no material Liability in the nature of retroactive rate
adjustment.

4.19 Employees/Independent Contractors.

(a) All individuals currently performing services for any Target Company as
independent contractors are properly classified and treated by such Target
Company as independent contractors and not as employees, except for any
failures to properly classify or treat that are not material to the Company
(together with its Subsidiaries), taken as a whole. Each Target Company has
reported the compensation actually paid to such independent contractors on IRS
Forms 1099 (or otherwise in accordance with applicable Law) when required to
do so, except for such failures to report that are not material to the Company
(together with its Subsidiaries), taken as a whole. No individual currently
performing services for any Target Company as an independent contractor has
ever brought or, to the Knowledge of the Company, is threatening to bring a
claim before any Governmental Authority for unpaid compensation or employee
benefits, including overtime amounts, against any Target Company, other than
any claim involving an amount in controversy of less than $100,000 and with
respect to which no injunctive or other non-monetary relief that would be (or
was) material to the Company (together with its Subsidiaries), taken as a
whole, is being (or was) sought. There has been no determination by any
Governmental Authority that any such independent contractor of any Target
Company (or any other individual who has previously rendered services to such
Target Company as an independent contractor) constitutes an employee of such
Target Company. At no time has any individual performing services for any
Target Company as an independent contractor brought a claim before any
Governmental Authority against any Target Company challenging his or her
status as an independent contractor or made a claim before any



Governmental Authority for additional compensation or any benefits under any
Company Plan, other than any claims involving an amount in controversy of less
than $100,000 and with respect to which no injunctive or other non-monetary
relief that would be (or was) material to the Company (together with its
Subsidiaries), taken as a whole, is being (or was) sought.

(b) As of the date hereof, to the Knowledge of the Company, no current
executive officer of the Target Companies nor any current employee thereof
that plays an essential role in a material aspect or functioning of the
Business has submitted his or her written resignation of employment with the
Target Companies.

there is no material workers' compensation Liability, experience or matter
outside the ordinary course of business.

subject to any affirmative action obligations under any Law, including
Executive Order 11246 (excluding in all cases any obligations arising under
any Contract with a Governmental Authority).

(e) Since January 1, 2015, the Target Companies have not implemented any plant
closing or employee layoff that required advance notice under the Worker

not to be satisfied.

In no event shall (x) the delivery of any notice by a party pursuant to this

representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties or the
conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement, or (y)

Governmental Authority, as applicable, for the Merger and the other
Transactions, and to obtain all consents, approvals, and waivers under any
Antitrust Law that may be required by any Governmental Authority to enable the
parties to close the Transactions as promptly as practicable; provided, that
neither Acquiror nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to consummate
or agree to consummate any divestiture, license, hold separate arrangement or
similar matter in order to obtain approval of the Transactions under
applicable Antitrust Laws if such divestiture, license, arrangement or similar
matter could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the
financial condition, assets or liabilities of, or the businesses of, Acquiror
and its Subsidiaries on a combined basis.



(c) In addition, if any action or Litigation is instituted (or threatened)
challenging the Transactions as violating any Antitrust Law or if any decree,
order, judgment, or injunction (whether temporary, preliminary, or permanent)
is entered, enforced, or attempted to be entered or enforced by any
Governmental Authority that would make the Transactions illegal or otherwise
delay or prohibit the consummation of the Transactions, each of Acquiror and
the Company shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts, and
shall cooperate in good faith with the other, in contesting and defending any
such claim, cause of action, or Litigation to avoid entry of, or to have
vacated, lifted, reversed, repealed, rescinded, or terminated, any decree,
order, judgment, or injunction (whether temporary, preliminary, or permanent)
that prohibits, prevents, or restricts consummation of the Transactions.

(d) Subject to applicable Law relating to the exchange of information, each
party shall permit counsel for the other parties reasonable opportunity to
review in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the other parties
in connection with, any proposed written communication to any Governmental
Authority with respect to the Transactions; not participate in any substantive
meeting or discussion, either in Person or by telephone, with any Governmental
Authority in connection with the proposed Transactions unless it consults with
the other parties in advance and, to the extent not prohibited by such
Governmental Authority, gives the other parties (including their respective
outside counsel) reasonable notice and the opportunity to attend and
participate; and promptly and fully inform the other parties of any written or
oral communication received from or given to the Federal Trade Commission, the
Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, or any other Governmental
Authority or any Person relating to any inquiry, investigation, or Litigation
relating to the Transactions or any filing submitted to any Governmental
Authority and promptly furnish the other parties with copies of all
correspondence, filings and other written communications between any party, on
the one hand, and any third party and/or any Governmental Authority or its
respective staff, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the
Transactions (subject to applicable Laws regarding privilege), provided that
no privileged information or information that is deemed to be competitively
sensitive is required to be shared.

(e) Acquiror shall not enter into any transaction, or any agreement to effect
any transaction (including any merger or acquisition), to acquire any business
or equity interest in a business that, in each case, competes with the
Business if such transaction could reasonably be expected to make it
materially more difficult, or to materially increase the time required, to (i)
obtain the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act,
or any other applicable antitrust, competition, or trade regulation Law,
applicable to the Transactions or (ii) avoid the entry of, avoid the
commencement of litigation seeking the entry of, or effect the dissolution of,
any injunction, temporary restraining order or other order that could
materially delay or prevent the consummation of the Transactions.

6.8 Public Announcements. Each of Acquiror and the Company may from time to
time issue any press release or make any public announcement relating to this
Agreement, the Merger and/or the Transactions so long as the issuing party
provides the other party with a copy of such proposed press release or public
announcement prior to the issuance or making thereof, considers in good faith
any comments such other party may provide and, except with respect to those
press releases or public announcements required by applicable Law or stock-
exchange regulations,



receives the consent of such other party (which such consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed prior to issuance). The
restrictions set forth in this Section 6.8 shall not apply to any release or
announcement made or proposed to be made by the Company in connection with an
Acquisition Proposal.

6.9 Nonsolicitation of Alternative Transactions.

(a) Subject to Sections 6.9(b) and 6.9(c), until the Effective Time or, if
earlier, the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 3.6, the
Company shall not, and shall cause each of the other Target Companies and
their respective Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (A) solicit,
initiate, knowingly facilitate or knowingly encourage (including by way of
furnishing confidential or non-public information) any inquiries regarding, or
the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or would reasonably be
expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, (B) enter into, continue or
otherwise knowingly participate in any discussions or negotiations with, or
furnish any confidential or nonpublic information to, any Person that is
seeking to make, has made or, to the Knowledge of the Company, is considering
making an Acquisition Proposal for the purpose of facilitating or knowingly
encouraging an Acquisition Proposal, (C) approve, endorse or recommend any
Acquisition Proposal or (D) enter into any Alternative Agreement with respect
to an Acquisition Proposal (including an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement).

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 6.9(a), if the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or their respective Representatives
receives an Acquisition Proposal (provided that such Acquisition Proposal has
not been withdrawn and does not result from any material breach of the
restrictions in this Section 6.9), by any Person or Group at any time prior to
the Written Consent Effective Time, the Company and its Representatives may
take the actions set forth in subsections (A) and/or (B) of this Section
6.9(b) if the Company Board, or a duly authorized committee thereof, has
determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel
and financial advisor, (i) that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or could
reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal and (ii) that the
failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors'
fiduciary duties under applicable Law (the determinations in clauses (i) and
(ii) being collectively defined as a "Potential Superior Proposal
Determination"): (A) furnish non-public information to and afford access to
the business, employees, officers, contracts, properties, assets, books and
records of the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person or Group making such
Acquisition Proposal, pursuant to the prior execution of (and the Company
and/or its Subsidiaries may enter into) an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement and (B) enter into and maintain discussions and negotiations with
the Person or Group making such Acquisition Proposal.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, at any time
prior to the Written Consent Effective Time, the Company Board may terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 3.6(g) to enter into (and substantially
concurrently with such termination enter into) an Alternative Agreement with
respect to a Superior Proposal (the "Superior Proposal Termination Action"),
if and only if, prior to taking the Superior Proposal Termination Action the
Company Board or a duly authorized committee thereof concludes in good faith,
after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, (x)
that failure to take the Superior Proposal Termination



Action would be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties under
applicable Law and (y) that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal; provided, further, that, prior to taking the Superior Proposal
Termination Action, (i) the Company Board has given Acquiror at least four (4)
Business Days' prior written notice (such period, the "Notice Period" and any
such notice with respect to a Superior Proposal, the "Initial Superior
Proposal Notice") of its intention to take the Superior Proposal Termination
Action (which notice shall include, as applicable, copies of the Superior
Proposal and any material transaction agreements relating thereto), (ii) after
providing the Initial Superior Proposal Notice, the Company shall have
negotiated, and shall have caused its Representatives to negotiate, with
Acquiror in good faith (in both cases if Acquiror desires to negotiate) during
the Notice Period to make adjustments in the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, (iii) following the end of the Notice Period, the Company Board or
a duly authorized committee thereof, shall have considered in good faith any
revisions to this Agreement proposed in writing by Acquiror in a form that
would constitute a binding agreement if accepted by the Company and shall have
determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel
and financial advisor, (x) that failure to take the Superior Proposal
Termination Action would be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties
under applicable Law and (y) that such Acquisition Proposal continues to
constitute a Superior Proposal even if such proposed revisions by Acquiror to
this Agreement were to be given effect, and (iv) in the event of any change to
the material terms of such Superior Proposal (or amendment thereof), the
Company shall have delivered to Acquiror an additional notice (each such
notice, a "Superior Proposal Change Notice") consistent with the terms
described in clause (i) above and the Notice Period in clause (i) shall have
recommenced and the condition in clauses (ii) and (iii) shall have occurred
again, except that the Notice Period shall be at least two (2) Business Days
(rather than the four (4) Business Days otherwise contemplated by clause (i)
above).

(d) As promptly as reasonably practicable following receipt by the Company of
(i) any written Acquisition Proposal, (ii) any written request for nonpublic
information or (iii) written inquiry that, in each case, would reasonably be
expected to lead to any Acquisition Proposal (but in no event more than one
Business Day following the first Business Day that the Company is in receipt
of such Acquisition Proposal, written request or written inquiry), the Company
shall advise Acquiror in writing of the receipt of such Acquisition Proposal,
request or inquiry, including a written summary of the material terms of any
such Acquisition Proposal not made in writing, request or inquiry (including
the identity of the Person or Group making the Acquisition Proposal, request
or inquiry) and shall keep Acquiror informed on a reasonably current basis of
(and, in any event within three (3) Business Days of the Company's knowledge
of) any material developments, discussions and negotiations relating thereto
(including providing Acquiror with a copy of all material written proposed
agreements relating thereto).

6.10 DandO Tail Policy and Indemnification.

(a) The Company shall, prior to the Closing, pay an amount not in excess of
that amount set forth on Schedule 6.10(a)(i), to put into effect policies of
directors' and officers' liability insurance providing aggregate coverage of
up to that amount set forth on Schedule 6.10(a)(ii) with respect to claims
against the present and former officers and directors of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries arising from facts or events which occurred at or before the
Effective Time, which



shall include a six year "tail" policy providing such coverage as of the
Closing; provided that Acquiror shall have the right to review any such policy
or policies prior to being put into effect.

(b) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and
Acquiror shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law fulfill and honor in all respects the
obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries pursuant to (i) each
indemnification, exculpation or expense reimbursement or advance agreement
that is identified on Schedules 4.12(a)(xv) or 4.12(a)(xvi) of the Disclosure
Schedules and that is in effect between the Company or its Subsidiaries and
any individual who at the Effective Time is, or at any time prior to the
Effective Time was, a director or officer of, or serving as a director or
officer of another Person at the request of, the Company or a Company
Subsidiary (each, an "Indemnified Party", and each such indemnification
agreement, a "DandO Indemnification Agreement"); and (ii) any indemnification or
expense reimbursement or advance provision and any exculpation provision set
forth in the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company or other
similar organizational documents of any Subsidiary of the Company as in effect
on the date of this Agreement. For a period of six (6) years from and after
the Effective Time, Acquiror and the Surviving Corporation shall not amend,
repeal or otherwise modify the certificate of incorporation and bylaws (and
other similar organizational documents) of the Surviving Corporation and the
Subsidiaries of the Company in any manner that would adversely affect the
rights thereunder of any Indemnified Party. Acquiror and the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the DandO Indemnification Agreements to continue in full
force and effect in accordance with their terms following the Effective Time.

(c) From and after the Effective Time, each of Acquiror and the Surviving
Corporation shall, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law,
indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnified Party against any costs or
expenses (including advancing reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses in
advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or
investigation to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
amounts paid in settlement (collectively, "Losses") in connection with any
actual or threatened Litigation, arising out of, relating to or in connection
with any action or omission occurring or alleged to have occurred whether
before or at the Effective Time (including the Transactions) in connection
with such Indemnified Party's service as a director or officer of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries (or acts or omissions in connection with such
Indemnified Party's service as officer, director, member, trustee or other
fiduciary in any other entity if such services were at the request, at the
direction or for the benefit of the Company); provided, that any Person to
whom any funds are advanced pursuant to the foregoing must, if required by
applicable Law, provide an undertaking to repay such advances if it is
ultimately determined the indemnification of such Person is not permitted
under applicable Law. In the event of any such Litigation, Acquiror and the
Surviving Corporation shall cooperate with the Indemnified Party in the
defense of any such Litigation.

(d) Acquiror shall or shall cause to be paid all reasonable expenses,
including reasonable attorneys' fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified
Party in enforcing the indemnity, advancement and other obligations provided
in this Section 6.10.



(e) If either of Acquiror or the Surviving Corporation or any of its
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that a creditworthy entity assumes or an
adequate credit support mechanism supports the obligations set forth in this
Section 6.10.

(f) The provisions of this Section 6.10 are (i) intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and
his or her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution
for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such
individual may have under the articles of organization or bylaws, by contract
or otherwise. The provisions of this Section 6.10 shall survive the Effective
Time and shall thereafter not be terminated or amended in any manner so as to
adversely affect any Indemnified Party.

ARTICLE VII 
MISCELLANEOUS

7.1 Contents of Agreement. This Agreement, together with the other Transaction
Documents and the Confidentiality Agreement, sets forth the entire
understanding of the parties with respect to the Transactions and supersedes
all prior agreements or understandings among the parties regarding those
matters.

7.2 Amendment, Parties in Interest, Assignment, Etc.. This Agreement may be
amended, modified or supplemented only by a written instrument duly executed
by the parties hereto; provided, however, that there may not be any amendment,
modification or supplement of this Agreement that requires further approval
under applicable Law without such approval having first been obtained. The
provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed severable. If any provision of
this Agreement shall for any reason be held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability
shall not affect any other provision hereof, and this Agreement shall be
reformed, construed and enforced such that a suitable and equitable provision
shall be substituted for that provision in order to carry out, so far as may
be valid, legal and enforceable, the intent and purpose of the invalid,
illegal or unenforceable provision. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the respective heirs, legal
representatives, successors and permitted assigns of the Parties. No Party may
assign this Agreement or any right, benefit or obligation hereunder; provided,
however, that Acquiror may assign its rights and obligations hereunder to any
direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Acquiror (in such capacity, the
"Assignee") so long as the Assignee executes and delivers to the Company a
document by which the Assignee agrees to be bound by the terms and conditions
applicable to Acquiror under this Agreement; provided further, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, no assignment shall relieve the assigning
party of any of its obligations hereunder. Any term or provision of this
Agreement may be waived at any time by the Party entitled to the benefit
thereof by a written instrument duly executed by such Party.

7.3 Interpretation. In this Agreement, (a) references to the plural include
the singular, the singular the plural and the part the whole, (b) references
to any gender include all genders, (c) "or" has the inclusive meaning
frequently identified with the phrase "and/or," (d) the words



"include," "includes" and "including" in this Agreement are deemed to be
followed by "without limitation" and (e) the words "herein," "hereof,"
"hereunder" and words of similar import refer to this Agreement as a whole and
not to a particular Section. The Article and Section headings in this
Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not control or affect the
construction of this Agreement or the interpretation thereof in any respect.
Any reference in this Agreement to any Article or Section refers to the
corresponding Article or Section of this Agreement. Any reference in this
Agreement to any Schedule or Exhibit refers to the corresponding Schedule or
Exhibit attached to this Agreement, and all such Schedules and Exhibits are
incorporated herein by reference. All accounting terms not specifically
defined in this Agreement shall be construed in accordance with GAAP as in
effect on the date hereof (unless another effective date is specified herein).
The Parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this
Agreement. In the event any ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation
arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by all
Parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this
Agreement. Unless the context requires otherwise, any reference to any Law
shall be deemed also to refer to all amendments and successor provisions
thereto and all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, in each case as
in effect as of the date hereof and the Closing Date. References in this
Agreement to time periods in terms of a certain number of days mean calendar
days unless expressly stated to be Business Days. In interpreting and

independent significance of fact and shall not be deemed superseded or
modified by any other representation or warranty. Any reference in this
Agreement to "writing" or comparable expressions includes a reference to
facsimile transmission or comparable means of communication (but excluding
e-mail communications).

7.4 Specific Performance. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur and that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at law in
the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that, notwithstanding any other provision in this
Agreement, any party shall have the right to specific performance or
injunctive relief to enforce another party's performance of any obligations
expressly set forth in this Agreement. The parties hereto agree that in any
Litigation for specific performance, each party waives the defense of adequacy
of a remedy at law and waives any requirement for the securing or posting of
any bond in connection with such remedy, this being in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity (subject to the
Enforceability Exceptions). The parties hereto further agree that (i) by
seeking the remedies provided for in this Section 7.4, a party shall not in
any respect waive its right to seek any other form of relief that may be
available to a party under this Agreement (including monetary damages) for
breach of any of the provisions of this Agreement, and (ii) nothing set forth
in this Section 7.4 shall require any party to institute any Litigation for
(or limit any party's right to institute any Litigation for) specific
performance under this Section 7.4 prior or as a condition to exercising any
termination right under Section 3.6 (and pursuing damages after such
termination), nor shall the commencement of any Litigation pursuant to this
Section 7.4 or anything set forth in this Section 7.4 restrict or limit any
party's right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms of
Section 3.6 or pursue any other remedies under this Agreement that may be
available at any time.

motion, as a defense or otherwise, in any such action, any claim that it is
not subject to the personal jurisdiction of the above-named courts, that its
property is exempt or immune from attachment or execution by reason of a lack
of personal jurisdiction, that any such Litigation brought in one of the

CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 7.8.

7.9 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts
(delivery of which may occur via facsimile or as an attachment to an
electronic mail message in "pdf" or similar format), each of which shall be
binding as of the date first written above, and, when delivered, all of which
shall constitute one and the same instrument. This Agreement and any documents
delivered pursuant hereto, and any amendments hereto or thereto, to the extent
signed and delivered by means of a facsimile machine or as an attachment to an
electronic mail message in "pdf" or similar format, shall be treated in all
manner and respects as an original agreement or instrument and shall be
considered to have the same binding legal effect as if it were the original
signed version thereof delivered in Person. No party to any such agreement or
instrument shall raise the use of a facsimile machine or electronic mail
attachment in "pdf" or similar format to



deliver a signature or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument
was transmitted or communicated through the use of a facsimile machine or as
an attachment to an electronic mail message as a defense to the formation of a

signature or electronically scanned copy of a signature shall constitute and

extent required under Section 228 of the DGCL

CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT



______________, 2018



[Address]



Re: Confidentiality Agreement

Dear _________________:

ELXSI Corporation (the "Company") proposes to make available to
________________________ ("you") and your Representatives (as defined below),
certain confidential, nonpublic, proprietary information and trade secrets
concerning the business and operations of the Company and its subsidiaries for
the sole purpose of, and for use by you, in the evaluation of the business and
operations of the Company and its subsidiaries in regard to a potential
merger, acquisition or other business combination between the Company and you
(a "Transaction"). As a condition to engaging in further discussions regarding
a Transaction, you agree, as set forth below, to keep confidential the
Confidential Information (as defined below) provided to any of you or your
Representatives with respect to this matter and otherwise act in accordance
with this agreement. As used in this agreement, a person's "Representatives"
shall mean, collectively, such person's directors, officers, employees,
affiliates, financing sources and advisors. Accordingly, the Company and you
hereby agree to the terms and conditions as set forth herein.

You will at all times keep confidential all oral, written and electronic
information furnished to any of you or your Representatives by or on behalf of
the Company or its Representatives, furnished after the date of this
agreement, and all notes, analyses, compilations, studies or other documents,
whether prepared by the Company or others, which contain or otherwise reflect
such information (collectively, "Confidential Information"). For purposes of
this agreement, Confidential Information does not include information which
(i) at the time of disclosure to you is in the public domain, (ii) after
disclosure to you becomes public knowledge other than as a result of an act or
omission by you or any of your Representatives to whom Confidential
Information is provided hereunder, (iii) was in your possession at the time of
disclosure to you and was not acquired, directly or indirectly, from the
Company or any of its subsidiaries, (iv) was furnished or made known to you by
a third party not bound by a confidentiality agreement with the Company or any
of its subsidiaries or otherwise restricted from disclosing such information
by a contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation; or (v) was developed by you
without reference to any Confidential Information.

You will use Confidential Information for the sole purpose of determining
whether you will enter into a Transaction. You will not disclose any
Confidential Information to any person, except (i) to those of your
Representatives who require such material for the purpose of determining
whether you will enter into a Transaction, and (ii) as and to the extent
otherwise expressly permitted by the terms of this agreement. Prior to
divulging any Confidential Information to any of your Representatives, you
will advise such recipient of the existence of this agreement and the
confidential nature of such information. You will be liable for any act or
omission by any of your Representatives to whom Confidential Information has
been provided hereunder that would have constituted a breach of this agreement
had such act or omission been taken by you. 

Without the prior written consent of the Company, neither you nor any of your
Representatives may, during the term of this agreement, disclose to any person
(i) the fact that Confidential Information has been made available to you or
any such Representative or that you or any such Representative have inspected
any portion of Confidential Information, (ii) the fact that any discussions or
negotiations are taking place concerning a possible Transaction, or (iii) any
of the terms, conditions or other facts with respect to any possible
Transaction, including the status thereof, unless and only to the extent that,
after advising and consulting with the Company about such proposed disclosure
and the proposed contents thereof, such disclosure is required to be made by
you in order to satisfy your obligations under United States securities laws
applicable to you.

If you or any of your Representatives are requested or required, whether by
oral questions, interrogatories, requests for information or documents,
subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process, to disclose any
Confidential Information, then you or such Representative, as the case may be,
will provide the Company with prompt notice of each such request so that the
Company may seek an appropriate protective order or other appropriate remedy
or waive your compliance with this agreement. In the event that such
protective order or other remedy is not obtained, or the Company grants such a
waiver hereunder, you may furnish that portion (and only that portion) of
Confidential Information which you are legally compelled to disclose and will
exercise your commercially reasonable efforts to obtain reliable assurance
that confidential treatment will be accorded any Confidential Information so
furnished.

You will not initiate any communication with any employee, contractor,
customer, supplier or vendor of the Company or any of its subsidiaries
concerning any Confidential Information or potential Transaction without the
prior written consent of the Company.

You acknowledge that you are aware, and that you will advise your
Representatives that, the federal securities laws prohibit any person who has
received from an issuer material, non-public information from purchasing or
selling securities of such issuer or from communicating such information to
any other person under circumstances in which it is reasonably foreseeable
that such person is likely to purchase or sell such securities.

Upon completing your consideration of Confidential Information, or upon the
request of the Company at any time, you will promptly destroy and cause your
Representatives to destroy all materials constituting or containing
Confidential Information; provided, however, that you may retain one copy of
the Confidential Information at the office of your general counsel for
evidentiary and records retention compliance purposes. In the event of such
request, all other documents or other matter constituting or containing
Confidential Information in the possession or under the control of you or any
of your Representatives will be destroyed, and you will certify the fact of
such return or destruction to the Company in writing. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no Confidential Information will be required to be destroyed if
doing so would violate law or internal records retention policies, and no
Confidential Information that is stored in automatic electronic archival data
bases (which are not readily accessible in the ordinary course of business)
shall be required to be destroyed.

You acknowledge that a breach of your and your Representatives' respective
obligations hereunder would cause irreparable harm to the Company for which
monetary damages alone would not be an adequate remedy. In the event of any
breach or threatened breach of this agreement, the Company shall be entitled
to seek appropriate equitable relief, including injunction and specific
performance without the requirement of posting a bond or other security, in
addition to any other rights and remedies that may be available to the Company
at law. 

You acknowledge and agree that neither the Company nor any of its
Representatives makes or has made any representation or warranty as to the
accuracy or completeness of any Confidential Information that may be furnished
hereunder, nor shall any of them have any liability to you or any of your
Representatives resulting from any person's use of any Confidential
Information. Only those representations and warranties that may be made in a
definitive written agreement for a proposed Transaction, if, when and as
executed and subject to such limitations and restrictions as may be specified
therein, shall have any legal effect, and you agree that if you determine to
engage in a Transaction, such determination will be based solely on the terms
of such definitive agreement and your own investigation, analysis and
assessment of the business of the Company and its subsidiaries.

Neither you nor the Company will have any obligation to enter into or
consummate a Transaction unless and until you and the Company shall have
executed and delivered a definitive written agreement with respect to such
Transaction, which this agreement is not, and then only on the terms and
conditions contained in such definitive agreement. You acknowledge that the
Company reserves the right to reject any and all offers to enter into a
Transaction.

This agreement constitutes the entire agreement of the parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof. This agreement may be amended or waived only by a
writing signed by a duly authorized officer of the Company and of you that
specifically references this agreement. Except as otherwise provided herein,
the rights and obligations provided by this agreement shall expire on the
third anniversary of the date hereof; provided that any materials that are
retained by you or any of your Representatives as permitted elsewhere by this
agreement shall remain subject to the obligations of this agreement
irrespective of any such expiration until such material has been returned or
destroyed in compliance with the terms of this agreement or ceases to
constitute or contain Confidential Information as defined herein, whichever
occurs first.

You further understand and agree that no failure or delay by the Company in
exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver
thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other
or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any right, power or privilege
hereunder.

As used in this agreement, "person" includes any individual, corporation,
partnership, limited liability company, trust, government or agency, or other
entity or association.

This agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws
of the State of Delaware without giving effect to the conflict of law
principles thereof.

Each party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consents to submit to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Delaware and of the
United States of America located in State of Delaware for any actions, suits
or proceedings arising out of or relating to this agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby (and you agree not to commence any action,
suit or proceeding relating thereto except in such courts), and further agree
that service of any process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered
mail to the address set forth herein shall be effective service of process for
any action, suit or proceeding brought in any such suit. Each party hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of venue of
any action, suit or proceeding arising out of this agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, in the courts of the State of Delaware or
the United States of America located in the State of Delaware, and hereby
further irrevocably and unconditionally waive and agree not to plead or claim
in any such court that any such action, suit or proceeding brought in any such
court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.



Please acknowledge your agreement with the foregoing by signing and returning
one copy of this agreement, which thereupon will constitute our agreement with
respect to the subject matter hereof.
