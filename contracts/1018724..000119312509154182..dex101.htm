Effective Time) to be deposited into the Indemnity Escrow Fund, and (ii) that
number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock to which such Shareholder is entitled pursuant to Sections
2.7(a)(i) through (a)(vii) multiplied by the Shareholders Representative
Expense Fund Ratio (plus any additional shares as may be issued after the
Effective Time with respect to the shares held in the Shareholder
Representative Expense Fund upon any stock split, stock dividend or
recapitalization effected by Parent after the Effective Time) to be deposited
into the Shareholder Representative Expense Fund. The shares of Parent Common
Stock under (i) and (ii) to be deposited with the Escrow Agent shall be
deducted from the shares of Parent Common Stock that such Shareholder
would otherwise have been entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.10(b)
without any act of any such Shareholder.



 

18 Section 2.8 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, shares of Capital Stock (other than any shares to be cancelled
pursuant to Sections 2.7(b)) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger
or consented thereto in writing and who has properly demanded that the
Company purchase such shares in accordance with Chapter 13 of the CGCL ("
_Dissenting Shares_ "), shall not be converted into or be exchangeable for the
right to receive a portion of the Common Merger Consideration or Preferred
Merger Consideration unless and until such holder fails to perfect or
withdraws or otherwise loses his right to appraisal and payment under the
CGCL. If, after the Effective Time, any such holder fails to perfect or
withdraws or loses his right to appraisal, such Dissenting Shares shall
thereupon be treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time
into the right to receive the portion of the Common Merger Consideration or
Preferred Merger Consideration, as applicable, if any, to which such holder
is entitled. The Company shall give Parent (a) prompt notice of any demands
received by the Company for appraisal of any shares of Capital Stock,
attempted written withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments
served pursuant to applicable Law and received by the Company relating to
stockholders rights to appraisal with respect to the Merger and (b) the
opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect
to any exercise of such appraisal rights under applicable Law. The Company
shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make
any payment with respect to any demands for payment of fair value for Capital
Stock, offer to settle or settle any such demands or approve any withdrawal of
any such demands. Any payments with respect to Dissenting Shares shall first
be made from cash on hand at the Company immediately before Closing.

Section 2.9 _Treatment of Options and Other Equity-Based Awards_.

(a) At the Effective Time, each option (each, a " _Company Option_ ") to
purchase shares of Company Common Stock granted under the Zappos.com, Inc.
2009 Stock Plan (formerly known as the Zappos.com, Inc. 1999 Stock Plan) (the
" _Company Stock Plan_ ") other than such Company Options set forth on
Schedule 2.9(a), whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall, at the Effective Time, cease to represent
a right to acquire shares of Company Common Stock and shall be assumed and
converted, at the Effective Time, into an option to purchase shares of Parent
Common Stock (each such converted option, a " _Parent Option_ "), on the same
terms and conditions (including any vesting or forfeiture provisions or
repurchase rights) as were applicable under such Company Option as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, except to the extent that such terms
were modified as a result of the Option Consent. The number of shares of
Parent Common Stock subject to each such Parent Option shall be equal to (i)
the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to each Company Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the Common
Exchange Ratio, rounded down, if necessary, to the nearest whole share of
Parent Common Stock, and such Parent Option shall have an exercise price per
share (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to (A) the exercise price
per share of Company Common Stock otherwise purchasable  



 

19  pursuant to such Company Option divided by (B) the Common Exchange Ratio;
_provided_ , that in the case of any Company Option to which Section 421 of
the Code applies as of the Effective Time by reason of its qualification under
Section 422 of the Code, the exercise price, the number of shares of Parent
Common Stock subject to such option and the terms and conditions of exercise
of such option shall be determined in a manner consistent with the
requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code; _provided_ _further_ , that in the
case of any Company Option to which an exemption to Section 409A of the Code
applies as of the Effective Time, the exercise price, the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock subject to such option and the terms and conditions of
exercise of such option shall be determined in a manner consistent with the
requirements of Section 409A of the Code. The Company shall take all action
necessary so that prior to the Effective Time each outstanding Common Stock
Option set forth on Schedule 2.9(a) shall be fully vested and exercisable. At
the Effective Time each outstanding Common Stock Option set forth on Schedule
2.9(a) (whether vested or unvested) shall be cancelled and not assumed by
Parent.

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all commercially
reasonable action necessary to enable the substitution of Parent Options for
the Company Options under this Section 2.9. The Company shall ensure that
following the Effective Time, no holder of a Company Option (or former holder
of a Company Option) or any participant in any Company Stock Plan shall have
any right thereunder to acquire any capital stock of the Company or the
Surviving Corporation or any other equity interest therein (including
"phantom" stock or stock appreciation rights).

(c) Parent shall reserve for issuance a number of shares of Parent Common
Stock at least equal to the number of shares of Parent Common Stock that will
be subject to Parent Options as a result of the actions contemplated by this
Section 2.9. As soon as practicable following the Effective Time, and in any
event within ten Business Days thereof, Parent shall file a registration
statement on Form S-8 (or any successor form, or if Form S-8 is not available,
other appropriate forms) with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock
subject to such Parent Options and shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement or
registration statements (and maintain the current status of the prospectus
or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as such Parent Options remain
outstanding and the exercise thereof or sales of such related shares of Parent
Common Stock requires such registration.

Section 2.10 _Exchange of Shares_.

(a) Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event within five Business
Days thereafter), Parent shall deposit (or cause to be deposited) with a bank
or trust company designated by Parent (the " _Exchange Agent_ "),
for exchange in accordance with this Article II, certificates representing
shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 2.7(a) or otherwise
make available book entry shares of Parent Common Stock, _provided_ that, on
behalf of the Shareholders, Parent shall withhold from such shares of Parent
Common Stock a number of such shares equal to the sum of (i) the Indemnity
Escrow Amount, and (ii) the Shareholder Representative Expense Fund  



 

20  Amount. The shares referred to in (i) shall be deposited by Parent in the
Indemnity Escrow Fund and the shares referred to in (ii) shall be deposited
by Parent with the Escrow Agent in the segregated Shareholder Representative
Expense Fund. In addition, Parent shall make available by depositing with the
Exchange Agent, as necessary from time to time after the Effective Time,
any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.10(c) and any
cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock payable pursuant to
Section 2.10(e). All certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock
and cash deposited with the Exchange Agent are hereinafter referred to as the
" _Exchange Fund_."

(b) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the Exchange Agent to mail, within five Business Days after
the Closing Date or such shorter period as is reasonably practicable, to each
holder of record of an outstanding certificate or outstanding certificates ("
_Certificates_ ") that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding shares of Capital Stock which were converted into the right to
receive the Parent Common Stock with respect thereto, any dividends or
distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.10(c) and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock payable pursuant to Section 2.10(e):
(i) a form of letter of transmittal in substantially the form attached hereto
as Exhibit F (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
held by such Person shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates
to the Exchange Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of Certificates in exchange for the shares of Parent Common Stock
payable with respect thereto, any dividends or distributions payable pursuant
to Section 2.10(c) and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock payable pursuant to Section 2.10(e). Upon surrender of a Certificate to
the Exchange Agent, together with such Letter of Transmittal, duly completed
and validly executed, and such other documents as the Exchange Agent may
reasonably require that are referenced in the Letter of Transmittal or which
are otherwise reasonably necessary due to the particular circumstances of the
submitting Shareholder, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor (A) a certificate representing that number of
whole shares of Parent Common Stock (after taking into account all shares of
Company Capital Stock then held by such holder under all Certificates so
surrendered) to which such holder of Company Capital Stock shall have become
entitled pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.7(a) net of any amounts
deposited with the Escrow Agent pursuant to Section 2.7(f) (which shall be in
uncertificated book-entry form unless a physical certificate is requested),
(B) any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.10(c) and (C)
any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock payable pursuant
to Section 2.10(e), and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of a Certificate
representing shares of Capital Stock that is not registered in the transfer
records of the Company, a certificate representing the proper number of shares
of Parent Common Stock may be issued to a Person other than the Person in
whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate
shall be properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for transfer and the
Person requesting such issuance shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required
by reason of the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock to a Person other
than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the
satisfaction of Parent and the  



 

21  Exchange Agent that such Taxes have been paid or are not applicable. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.10, each Certificate shall
be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon such surrender or transfer the shares of Parent Common Stock
payable in respect of shares of Capital Stock theretofore represented by such
Certificate, any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section
2.10(c) and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
payable pursuant to Section 2.10(e). No interest will be paid or accrued on
any unpaid dividends and distributions or cash in lieu of fractional shares,
if any, payable to holders of Certificates.

(c) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock
with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock
that the holder thereof has the right to receive upon the surrender thereof,
and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall
be paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 2.10(e), in each case until the
holder thereof shall surrender such Certificate in accordance with this
Article II. Promptly following the surrender of a Certificate in accordance
with this Article II, there shall be paid to the record holder thereof,
without interest, the amount of any dividends or other distributions with a
record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such
whole shares of Parent Common Stock and the amount of any cash payable in lieu
of a fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to Section 2.10(e).

(d) The shares of Parent Common Stock, any dividends or other distributions
payable pursuant to Section 2.10(c) and any cash in lieu of fractional shares
of Parent Common Stock payable pursuant to Section 2.10(e) issued and paid
upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates in accordance with the terms
of this Article II shall be deemed to have been issued and paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Capital Stock formerly
represented by such Certificates. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the
Surviving Corporation of the shares of Capital Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent
for transfer, such shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article
II.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no
certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, no dividends
or other distributions with respect to the Parent Common Stock shall be
payable on or with respect to any fractional share, and such fractional share
interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights
of a stockholder of Parent. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional
share, Parent shall pay to each former Shareholder who otherwise would be
entitled to receive a fractional share of Parent Common Stock an amount in
cash (without interest) determined by multiplying (i) the fraction of a share
of Parent Common Stock which such holder would otherwise be entitled to
receive (aggregating all shares of Capital Stock held at the Effective Time by
such holder and rounded to the nearest thousandth when expressed in
decimal form) pursuant to Section 2.7(a) and Section 2.7(f) by (ii) the
Parent Stock Price.



 

22 (f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders
of Certificates six (6) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to
Parent, upon demand, and any holders of Certificates who have not theretofore
complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent (subject to
abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws), as general creditors
thereof, for payment of the shares of Parent Common Stock, any unpaid
dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.10(c) and any
cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock payable pursuant to
Section 2.10(e).

(g) None of Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any
other Person shall be liable to any Person in respect of shares of Parent
Common Stock, dividends or other distributions with respect thereto or cash in
lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock properly delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.

(h) The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund
as directed by Parent on a daily basis. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent.

(i) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent,
of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Exchange Agent, the posting by
such Person of a bond in such amount as Parent or the Exchange Agent may
determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate shares of Parent Common Stock payable in respect
thereof, any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section
2.10(c) and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
payable pursuant to Section 2.10(e).

(j) Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or cause to be
deposited the Indemnity Escrow Amount and the Shareholder Representative
Expense Fund Amount with the Escrow Agent. The Indemnity Escrow Fund and the
Shareholder Representative Expense Fund shall be held and distributed as
provided in the Escrow Agreement and this Agreement.

(k) Three Business Days prior to the intended Closing Date, the Company will
provide to Parent an itemized schedule (the " _Schedule of Expenses_ ")
containing (i) a true and complete list of all Transaction Expenses that have
been paid (or for which bills have been received) or shall have, in the good
faith estimate of the Company, been paid as of the Closing Date, (ii) a good
faith estimate of all such additional Transaction Expenses that have been
incurred or shall have been incurred as of the Closing Date but are not
reflected in clause (i) hereof, and (iii) a good faith estimate of all
additional Transaction Expenses that are expected to be incurred after the
Closing  



 

23  Date, together with a certificate of an authorized officer of the Company
certifying the accuracy and completeness of the Schedule of Expenses (subject
to such good faith estimates). The Schedule of Expenses shall include a good
faith estimate of all fees and expenses of Fenwick and West LLP,
PricewaterhouseCoopers and Morgan Stanley and Co. for services rendered. Any
Transaction Expenses in excess of the amount estimated therefor in the
Schedule of Expenses shall be recoverable by Parent from the Indemnity Escrow
Fund and from Consenting Optionholders by forfeiture of Company Options
pursuant to the Option Consents. Fees and expenses fees incurred by or on
behalf of any Shareholder, other than Transaction Expenses, shall not be paid
by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Affiliate thereof.

Section 2.11 _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation
and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under the Code, or any provision of applicable Tax Law. To the
extent that such amounts are so withheld or paid over to or deposited with
the relevant Governmental Body by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the applicable Person in respect to
which such deduction and withholding was made.

Section 2.12 _Shareholder Representative_.

(a) Immediately upon the approval of this Agreement by the requisite vote or
written consent of the Shareholders, each Shareholder, and upon the execution
of an Option Consent, the Consenting Optionholder executing such Option
Consent, shall be deemed to have consented to the appointment of Alfred Lin as
such Shareholders and Consenting Optionholders, as applicable,
representative and attorney-in-fact (the " _Shareholder Representative_ "),
with full power of substitution to act on behalf of the Shareholders and
Consenting Optionholders to the extent and in the manner set forth in
this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. All decisions, actions, consents and
instructions by the Shareholder Representative shall be binding upon all of
the Shareholders and Consenting Optionholders, and no Shareholder or
Consenting Optionholder shall have the right to object to, dissent from,
protest or otherwise contest the same. Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled
to rely on any decision, action, consent or instruction of the Shareholder
Representative as being the decision, action, consent or instruction of the
Shareholders and Consenting Optionholders, and Parent and Merger Sub are
hereby relieved from any liability to any Person for acts done by them in
accordance with any such decision, act, consent or instruction. 

(b) The Shareholder Representative may resign at any time, and may be removed
for any reason or no reason by the vote or written consent of Shareholders
holding a majority of the aggregate shares of Capital Stock at the Effective
Time (the " _Majority Holders_ "). In the event of the death, incapacity,
resignation or removal of the Shareholder Representative, a new Shareholder
Representative, that was either a former holder of Capital Stock or is a
natural person who manages a Person that was a former holder of Capital Stock,
shall be appointed by the vote or written consent of the Majority  



 

24  Holders. Notice of such vote or a copy of the written consent appointing
such new Shareholder Representative shall be sent to Parent and, after the
Effective Time, to the Surviving Corporation, such appointment to be
effective upon the later of the date indicated in such consent or the date
such consent is received by Parent and, after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation; _provided_ , that until such notice is received,
Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall be
entitled to rely on the decisions, actions, consents and instructions of the
prior Shareholder Representative as described in Section 2.12(a). Any
expenses incurred by the Shareholder Representative in performing its duties
hereunder (including legal fees and expenses related thereto) and any
indemnification in favor of the Shareholder Representative shall be
payable out of the Shareholder Representative Expense Fund and, to the extent
such expenses exceed the amount available from such fund, shall be borne by
the Shareholders and Consenting Optionholders.

(c) The Shareholder Representative shall not be liable to the Shareholders or
Consenting Optionholders for actions taken pursuant to this Agreement or the
Escrow Agreement, except to the extent such actions shall have been determined
by a court of competent jurisdiction to have constituted willful misconduct or
fraud. Except in cases where a court of competent jurisdiction has made such a
finding, the Shareholders and Consenting Optionholders shall jointly and
severally indemnify and hold harmless the Shareholder Representative from and
against any and all losses, liabilities, claims, actions, damages and
expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements, arising out
of and in connection with his activities as Shareholder Representative under
this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or otherwise, to the extent that such
losses, liabilities, claims, actions, damages and expenses, including
reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements are not fully satisfied by the
Shareholder Representative Expense Fund.

(d) The approval of this Agreement by the requisite vote or written consent of
Shareholders required by the Charter and applicable Law and execution of the
Option Consents shall also be deemed to constitute approval of all
arrangements relating to the transactions contemplated under this Agreement
and to the provisions hereof binding upon the Shareholders and Consenting
Optionholders, including, without limitation, Article VIII.

Section 2.13 _Lock-Up_.

(a) Except as otherwise provided for herein, each Lock-Up Holder will be
prohibited during the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on date
of the one year anniversary of Closing Date (the " _Lock-Up Period_ ") from
directly or indirectly: (i) offering, pledging, selling or contracting to
sell any shares of Parent Common Stock acquired pursuant to Section 2.7(a) or
received upon the assumption or conversion of any Company Options (the "
_Locked-Up Shares_ "); (ii) offering, pledging, selling or contracting to
sell any option to purchase any shares of Parent Common Stock; (iii) granting
any option, right or warrant for the sale of any shares of Parent Common
Stock; (iv) lending or otherwise disposing of or transferring (or entering
into any transaction or device designed to, or that could be expected to,
result in the disposition by  



 

25  any Person at any time in the future of) any Locked-Up Shares, or securities
convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for Locked-Up Shares; (v)
entering into a swap or other derivatives transaction or agreement that
transfers, in whole or in part (directly or indirectly), the economic
consequences of ownership of any Locked-Up Shares, whether any such swap or
transaction described in clauses (i) through (v) is to be settled by delivery
of shares of Locked-Up Shares or other securities, in cash or otherwise, or
(vi) announcing his, her or its intention to do any of the foregoing (any of
the transactions described in clauses (i) through (vi), a " _Common Stock
Transaction_ "); _provided_ , that, subject to any other applicable
restrictions including Parents insider trading policy, during the period
commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the date of the one year
anniversary of Closing Date, a Lock-Up Holder may enter into a Common Stock
Transaction, or any other transaction, during each calendar quarter with
respect to the sum of (A) up to 25% of the Locked-Up Shares received by such
Lock-Up Holder (including with respect to any Parent Options received in
exchange for Company Options), and (B) any Locked Up Shares (including with
respect to any Parent Options received in exchange for Company Options) which
were eligible to be the subject of Common Stock Transactions during any prior
calendar quarter.

(b) For the avoidance of doubt, nothing contained in Section 2.13(a) shall
prevent a Lock-Up Holder from, or restrict the ability of a Lock-Up Holder to,
(i) purchase Parent Common Stock or other securities of Parent (ii) exercise
any options or other convertible securities granted under Parents incentive
plans or (iii) dispose of Locked-Up Shares which it beneficially owns (as such
concept is defined pursuant to Rule 13d-3 of the Exchange Act) in connection
with a transaction in which all other holders of Parent Common Stock are
entitled to receive the same consideration for their shares of Parent Common
Stock as would be received by the Lock-Up Holder.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Lock-Up Holder shall be permitted to
transfer Locked-Up Shares during the Lock-Up Period (i) as a bona fide gift
or gifts, (ii) to any trust for the direct or indirect benefit of such Lock-Up
Holder or the Immediate Family of such Lock-Up Holder, (iii) by will or
intestate succession, provided that, in each case, (A) each transferee
(or trustee, as applicable) execute a lock-up agreement with the terms of
this Section 2.13 pursuant to which these persons agree not to sell or
transfer the Locked-Up Shares for the remainder of the Lock-Up Period and (B)
any such transfer shall not involve a disposition for value.

(d) Each certificate representing Locked-Up Shares and any other securities
issued upon any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, merger,
consolidation or similar event, shall be stamped or otherwise imprinted with
legends in the following form (in addition to any other legends required under
applicable securities Laws): 

"THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE MAY BE TRANSFERRED ONLY IN
ACCORDANCE WITH CERTAIN TERMS AND RESTRICTIONS OF AN AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF
MERGER GOVERNING THE SHARES ACQUIRED BY THE STOCKHOLDER FROM THE COMPANY, A
COPY OF WHICH IS ON FILE WITH THE SECRETARY OF THE COMPANY."



 

26 (e) In furtherance of the foregoing, Parent, and any duly appointed transfer
agent for the registration or transfer of the Lock-Up Shares, are hereby
authorized to decline to make any transfer of the Lock-Up Shares if such
transfer would constitute a violation or breach of this Section 2.13.

nonsolicitation or exclusivity provision contained therein), nor is there any
event that with notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a breach,

renegotiation of any Material Contract. Further, there is not now and has not
been within the past 24 months any disagreement or dispute of any nature
whatsoever with any other party to any Contract having or reasonably likely
to have a Material Adverse Effect. True and complete copies of each such
written Material Contract (or written summaries of the terms of any such oral
Material Contract) have been delivered or been made available to Parent. The
Company has no reason to believe that any obligation that remains under any
Material Contract cannot be fulfilled by the Company or its Subsidiaries, as
the case may be, and has no notice or Knowledge that any party to a Material
Contract listed on Schedule 3.10(a) to the Disclosure Memorandum intends to

Schedule 3.11 to the Disclosure Memorandum unless such modification was
requested or specified by the Company, nor is there or has there been, as of

manner.

Claims for benefits) pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened

stop-loss policy), in the nature of a retroactive rate adjustment, a loss
sharing arrangement or any other actual or contingent liability arising from
any event occurring on or before the Closing Date.

Employee retention agreements with Parent or the Surviving Corporation in
connection with the Merger, neither the execution and delivery of this
Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this

any Subsidiary under such Intellectual Property Agreement, and (E) there is no
event or circumstance that with notice or lapse of time, or both, would
constitute a default or event of default on the part of the Company or any
Subsidiary thereof or, to the Knowledge of the Company, any other party
thereto, or give to any other party thereto the right to terminate or modify
any Intellectual Property Agreement. Except as set forth in Schedule
3.16(b)(vi) to the Disclosure Memorandum, neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary thereof has received notice or has any Knowledge that any party to
any Intellectual Property Agreement intends to cancel, terminate or refuse to
renew (if renewable) an Intellectual Property Agreement, or to exercise or
decline to exercise any option or right thereunder. Except as set forth in
Schedule 3.16(b)(vii) to the Disclosure Memorandum, neither the Company nor

Agreement or the performance of the Companys obligations hereunder, lose any
rights to Exploit Company IP pursuant to any Intellectual Property Agreement.



 

45 (c) _No Violation; No Impairment_. Neither the execution, delivery nor
performance of this Agreement or the other Operative Documents nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated herein and therein will (i)
cause the termination of, or give rise to a right of termination of, any

excess of $1,000 per seat) or (ii) impair the right of the Company and its
Subsidiaries to Exploit any Company-Owned IP.

(d) _Payments_. Schedule 3.16(d) to the Disclosure Memorandum accurately lists

business and the conduct of the business, in each case as previously conducted
and as currently conducted, (i) do not infringe, violate or misappropriate

contesting the right of the Company or any Subsidiary thereof to Exploit any
Company IP, or to conduct the business as previously conducted, or as
currently conducted, or contesting the ownership by the Company or any
Subsidiary thereof of any Company-Owned IP or the validity or enforceability
of any Company-Owned IP. Except as set forth in Schedule 3.16(f) to the

Disclosure Memorandum, there are no actions that must be taken by the Company
or any  



 

46  Subsidiary thereof within 180 days after the date of this Agreement for the

IP Registration. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary thereof has conducted
its business or used or enforced (or failed to use or enforce) the Company IP
in a manner that would result in the abandonment, cancellation or
unenforceability of any item of the Company IP or the Company IP
Registrations. Schedule 3.16(g) to the Disclosure Memorandum also lists all
material trademarks, trade names, brand names, service marks, logos or other
identifiers and domain names currently used by the Company or any Subsidiary
thereof but for which no registration has been sought and all material
software and other material works of authorship with respect to which the
Company or any Subsidiary thereof owns (solely or jointly with others), or

registration of such copyright has been granted or sought). The Company and
its Subsidiaries have the sole right to prosecute and maintain the Company IP
Registrations and to file applications and applications for registration with
respect to any Company-Owned IP.

(h) _Confidentiality_. The Company and its Subsidiaries have all taken
appropriate steps, which are, as a whole, not less protective and
comprehensive than the steps that would be taken by reasonably prudent
business persons operating in the Companys industry, to protect, preserve
and maintain the secrecy and confidentiality of their confidential and
proprietary information and data. Without limiting the foregoing, neither the
Company nor any Subsidiary thereof has (i) disclosed material confidential or
proprietary information to any Person other than an officer, director,
employee or consultant of the Company or any Subsidiary thereof, unless such
disclosure was under an appropriate written nondisclosure agreement or to a
person subject to a fiduciary duty to maintain the confidentiality thereof,
or (ii) except as set forth in Schedule 3.16(h) to the Disclosure Memorandum,
deposited, disclosed or delivered to any Person outside of the Company or its
Subsidiaries, or permitted the deposit, disclosure or delivery to any such
Person outside of the Company or its Subsidiaries of, any source code (e.g.,
human-readable computer programming code) included in the Company IP, other
than source code that is (i) licensed to the Company or any Subsidiary in
writing under an Open Source License or other nonexclusive license that
expressly authorizes such disclosure of such source code, (ii) not material to
the Company or its Subsidiaries, and (iii) not included, in whole or part, in
the Company-Owned IP (other than with respect to immaterial modifications to
such source code made by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries).

(i) _Agreements With Employees and Contractors_. Each director, officer,
employee and independent contractor of the Company or of any Subsidiary
thereof who has contributed to the creation or development of any Company IP
has executed and delivered to the Company (or a Subsidiary thereof if
employed by such Subsidiary) a valid and enforceable assignment of all right,
title and interest that such Person may have or may hereafter acquire in or to
such Company IP and a waiver of any and all moral rights that such Person may
have therein, except for Company IP (i) that was developed by an independent
contractor under a written Inbound License that expressly provided that such
Company IP would be owned by the independent contractor and licensed such
Company IP to the Company or applicable Subsidiary thereof or (ii) 



 

47  developed by an employee that is not covered by the assignment of
intellectual property provision of the Companys standard form of employee
assignment of inventions of agreement (a copy of which has been provided to
Parent) signed by such employee, such as music licensed by the employee to the
Company for public performance on a blog operated or maintained by the Company
that the employee composed entirely on the employees own time without using
the equipment, supplies, facilities, or trade secret information of the
Company or any Subsidiary and that neither relates to the business or actual
or demonstrably anticipated research or development of the Company or any
Subsidiary thereof nor results from any work performed by the employee for the
Company or any Subsidiary thereof. Complete and correct copies of the form of
each Contract effecting such assignment of Company IP and waiver of moral
rights have been delivered to Parent. No current or former director, officer,
employee, consultant or contractor has any right, license, Claim, moral right
(other than inalienable moral rights that arise under applicable law)
or interest whatsoever in or with respect to any Company IP that the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries owns or purports to own.

(j) _No Violation of Other Agreements_. To the Knowledge of the Company, no
current or former director, officer, employee or independent contractor of the
Company or of any Subsidiary thereof (i) is in violation of any provision or
covenant of any employment agreement, invention assignment agreement,
nondisclosure agreement, noncompetition agreement or any other Contract with
any third Person by virtue of such directors, officers, employees or
independent contractors being employed by, performing services for or
serving on the board of directors of the Company or any Subsidiary thereof,
(ii) is using or has used any trade secrets or other confidential or
proprietary information of any third Person in connection with performing any
services for the Company or for any Subsidiary thereof or the development or
creation of any Company-Owned IP without the permission of the Company and
such third Person, or (iii) has developed or created any Company-Owned IP
that is subject to any agreement under which such director, officer, employee,
or independent contractor has assigned or otherwise granted any third party
any rights in or to such Company-Owned IP. The employment of any current
or former employee of the Company or any Subsidiary thereof and the use by
the Company or any Subsidiary thereof of any services of any current or former
director, officer, or independent contractor have not subjected and do not
subject the Company or any Subsidiary thereof to any liability to any third

representatives (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") reasonable access
(including for inspection) at all reasonable times to the Representatives,
properties, offices, plants and other facilities, books and records of the
Company and each of its Subsidiaries, and shall furnish Parent (including
copies thereof) with financial, operating, Tax and other similar information
as Parent may reasonably request. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company
may restrict the foregoing access to the extent that (a) in the reasonable
judgment of the Company, any Law, treaty, rule or regulation of any
Governmental Body applicable to the Company requires the Company or its

60  information, (b) in the reasonable judgment of the Company, the information

Company, such disclosure would result in disclosure of any trade secrets of
third parties and such disclosure by the Company is not permitted, or (d) in
the reasonable judgment of the Company, disclosure of any such information or
document would result in the loss of the Companys attorney-client privilege;
provided, however, that in the case of each of (a), (b), (c) or (d), Parent
and the Company each agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to
establish a process that, through use of steps such as targeted redactions,
provision of information to counsel to review and summarize for Parent or use
of a clean room environment for analysis and review of information by joint
integration teams in coordination with counsel and the Company, will provide
Parent with timely access to the fullest extent possible to the substance of
the information described in this Section 5.2 in a manner that allows the
Company to comply with applicable law and its confidentiality obligations to
third parties or preserve the Companys attorney-client privilege, as the case
may be. All information furnished pursuant to this Section 5.2 shall be
subject to the Confidentiality Agreement.

Section 5.3 _Exclusivity_. The Company agrees that between the date of this
Agreement and the earlier of the Closing and the termination of this
Agreement, the Company shall not, and shall take all action necessary to

and Representatives shall, directly or indirectly (a) solicit, initiate,
facilitate, knowingly encourage or accept any proposal or offer that
constitutes an Acquisition Proposal or (b) participate in any discussions,
conversations, negotiations or other communications regarding, or furnish to
any other Person any information with respect to, or otherwise cooperate in
any way, assist or participate in, facilitate or knowingly encourage the
submission of, any proposal that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected
to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal. The Company immediately shall cease and
cause to be terminated all existing discussions, conversations, negotiations
and other communications with any Persons conducted heretofore with respect
to any of the foregoing. The Company shall notify Parent promptly, but in any
event within 24 hours, orally and in writing if any such Acquisition Proposal,
or any inquiry or other contact with any Person with respect thereto, is
made. Any such notice to Parent shall indicate in reasonable detail the
identity of the Person making such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or other
contact and the terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or
other contact, and Company shall provide Parent with a copy of any written
proposal. The Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to,
release any Person from, or waive any provision of, any confidentiality or
standstill agreement to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party, without the prior written consent of Parent. For purposes of this
Agreement, " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any offer or proposal for, or any
indication of interest in, any of the following (other than the Merger): (i)
any direct or indirect acquisition, purchase, sale, lease, exchange, mortgage,
pledge, transfer or other disposition of all or a portion of the capital stock
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any assets of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries (other than inventory to be sold in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice, sales of obsolete or worn out
equipment or sales of an immaterial amount of assets that are no longer used
in the conduct of the Companys business), (ii) any merger, share exchange,
consolidation or other business combination relating to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or (iii) any recapitalization, reorganization or any other
extraordinary business transaction involving or otherwise relating to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in
this Section 5.3 shall prohibit the Company from registering or
processing transfers or sales of the Companys Capital Stock unless such
transfers or sales are otherwise prohibited by any Operative Document.



 

61 Section 5.4 _Shareholder Meeting; Written Consent_. As promptly as practicable
after the Form S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act, the
Company shall take all action necessary in accordance with California Law and
the Companys Charter and Bylaws to (a) duly call, give notice of, convene and
hold a meeting of its Shareholders (the " _Shareholder Meeting_ ") for such
Shareholders to consider and vote upon the approval of the Merger and the
adoption and approval of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, including a vote by the holders of each of the Series A Preferred
Stock, the Series B Preferred Stock, the Series C Preferred Stock and the

Preferred Stock for the Preferred Stock Conversion via written consent. The
Company will, through its Board of Directors, recommend to the Shareholders
the adoption and approval of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, shall not withdraw, modify or change such recommendation, and shall
use its best efforts to obtain Company Shareholder Approval.

Section 5.5 _Proxy Statement/Form S-4_. As promptly as practicable following
the date of this Agreement, (a) the Company and Parent shall prepare and file
with the SEC a proxy statement in preliminary form and (b) Parent shall
prepare and file with the SEC a Registration Statement on Form S-4 (the "
_Form S-4_ "), in which the proxy statement will be included as a prospectus.
Each of the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable efforts to have the
Form S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as
practicable after such filing. The Company shall use reasonable best efforts
to cause the proxy statement to be mailed to the Shareholders as promptly as
practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective under the Securities
Act. Parent shall also take any action (other than qualifying to do business
in any jurisdiction in which it is not now so qualified or filing a general
consent to service of process) required to be taken under any applicable
state securities or "blue sky" laws in connection with the issuance and
reservation of shares of Parent Common Stock in the Merger, and the Company
shall furnish all information concerning the Company and the holders of
Company Capital Stock and rights to acquire Company Capital Stock as may be
reasonably requested in connection with any such action. No filing of, or
amendment or supplement to, the Form S-4 or the proxy statement will be made
by Parent or the Company, as applicable, without providing the other the
opportunity to review and comment thereon. If at any time prior to the
Effective Time any information relating to the Company or Parent, or any of
their respective Affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by
the Company or Parent that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement
to any of the Form S-4 or the proxy statement, so that any of such documents
would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party that
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and
an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall
promptly be filed with the SEC and, to the extent required under applicable
law, disseminated to the Shareholders.



 

62 Section 5.6 _Notification of Certain Matters; Supplements to Disclosure
Memorandum_. 

(a) Between the date of this Agreement and the earlier of the Closing and the
termination of this Agreement, the Company shall give prompt written notice
to Parent of (i) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any change, condition or
event the occurrence or non-occurrence of which would render any
representation or warranty of the Company contained in this Agreement or any
Operative Document, if made on or immediately following the date of such
event, untrue or inaccurate, (ii) the occurrence of any change, condition or
event that has had or is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect,
(iii) any failure of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any other
Affiliate of the Company to comply with or satisfy any covenant or agreement
to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder; (iv) the occurrence of any
event, or the existence of any condition, that creates a substantial risk of
the nonfulfillment of any of the conditions to Parents and Merger Subs
obligations hereunder, (v) any notice or other communication from any Person
alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection
with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
the Operative Documents or (vi) any Claim pending or, to the Companys
Knowledge, threatened against a party or the parties relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Operative Documents.

(b) At least three Business Days prior to the proposed Closing Date, the
Company shall supplement the information set forth on the Disclosure
Memorandum with respect to any matter now existing or hereafter arising that,
if existing or occurring at or prior to the date of this Agreement, would
have been required to be set forth or described in the Disclosure Memorandum
or that is necessary to correct any information in the Disclosure Memorandum
or in any representation or warranty of the Company which has been rendered
inaccurate thereby promptly following discovery thereof. Except as set forth
in Section 8.2(a) and Section 8.2(b), no such supplement shall be deemed to
cure any breach of any representation or warranty made in this Agreement or
any Operative Document or have any effect for purposes of determining the
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 7.3, the compliance by the
Company with any covenant set forth herein or the indemnification provided for
in Section 8.2. 

Section 5.7 _Takeover Statutes_. If any state takeover statute or similar Law
shall become applicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
the Operative Documents, the Company and its Board of Directors shall grant
such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable
on the terms contemplated hereby or thereby and otherwise act to eliminate the
effects of such statute or regulation on the transactions contemplated hereby
or thereby.

Section 5.8 _Options; Warrants_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall take all commercially reasonable actions to cause or ensure that (a)
all of the Companys warrants shall have been exercised prior to the Effective
Time, (b) each Optionholder shall have executed and delivered to Parent an
Option Consent in form and substance satisfactory to Parent, (c) Parents
Board of Directors or Compensation Committee shall be the administrator of the



 

63  Company Stock Plan, and (d) after the Effective Time, the Company is not
bound by any Stock Purchase Right or other equity-based right that
would entitle any Person, other than Parent or its Affiliates, to
beneficially own, or receive any consideration or other payments other than as
contemplated by Section 2.9 in respect of, any capital stock of the Company or
the Surviving Corporation. As soon as reasonably practicable following the
date of this Agreement and conditional upon the Closing, the Company (and its
board of directors) shall take all commercially reasonable actions and/or
adopt such resolutions as may be required in order to give effect to and
accomplish the transactions contemplated by Section 2.9 and this Section 5.8,
including, without limitation, amending the Company Stock Plan (i) if and to
the extent necessary and practicable, to reflect the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the acceleration and cancellation of
the Stock Options set forth on Schedule 2.9 as of the Effective Time, and (ii)
to preclude any discretionary, automatic or formulaic grant of any Company
Options, Stock Purchase Rights or other equity-based awards thereunder on or
after the Closing Date.

Section 5.9  _Confidentiality_. Each of the parties shall hold, and shall
cause its Representatives to hold, in confidence all documents and information
furnished to it by or on behalf of any other party to this Agreement in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby pursuant to the terms of
the confidentiality agreement dated March 19, 2009 between Parent and the
Company (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), which shall continue in full
force and effect until the Closing Date. If for any reason this Agreement is
terminated prior to the Closing Date, the Confidentiality Agreement shall
nonetheless continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.

Section 5.10 _Commercially Reasonable Efforts_.

(a) Each of the parties shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all appropriate action to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law or otherwise to
consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement

obtain from Governmental Bodies and other Persons all consents,
approvals, authorizations, qualifications and orders as are necessary for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Operative Documents, (ii) promptly make all necessary filings, and thereafter
promptly make any other required submissions, with respect to this Agreement
required under the HSR Act or any other applicable Law and (iii) contest and
have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any order, decree, ruling,
judgment, injunction or other action (whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent) that is in effect and that enjoins, restrains, conditions, makes
illegal or otherwise restricts or prohibits the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Operative Documents. In
furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the Company shall permit
Parent reasonably to participate in the defense and settlement of any claim,
suit or cause of action relating to this Agreement, the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated hereby, and the Company shall not settle or
compromise any such claim, suit or cause of action without Parents written
consent. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Parent shall not be
required by this Section to take or agree to undertake any action, including
entering into any consent decree, hold separate order or other arrangement,
that  



 

64  would (x) require the divestiture of any assets of Parent, the Company or
any of their respective Affiliates or (y) limit Parents freedom of action
with respect to, or its ability to consolidate and control, the Company and
its Subsidiaries or any of their assets or businesses or any of Parents or
its Affiliates other assets or businesses.

(b) Without limitation to the provisions of subsection (a) hereof, the Company
and its Subsidiaries shall give promptly such notice to third parties and use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such third party consents and
estoppel certificates as are set forth on Schedule 5.10(b). Parent and Merger
Sub shall cooperate with and assist the Company and its Subsidiaries in giving
such notices and obtaining such consents and estoppel certificates;
_provided_ , _however_ , that neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall have any
obligation to give any guarantee or other consideration of any nature in
connection with any such notice, consent or estoppel certificate or consent
to any material change in the terms of any agreement or arrangement that
Parent in its sole discretion may reasonably deem adverse to the interests of
Parent, Merger Sub or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

Section 5.11 _Public Announcements_. On and after the date hereof and through
the Closing Date (including in connection with any termination of this
Agreement), the parties shall consult with each other before issuing any press
release or otherwise making any public statements with respect to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and none of the parties
shall issue any press release or make any public statement prior to obtaining
the other parties written approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, except that no such approval shall be necessary to the
extent disclosure may be required by applicable Law, upon advice of counsel
or as required by any listing agreement of any party hereto.

Section 5.12 _Indemnification_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, the Charter, the Bylaws or
under any indemnification agreements binding on the Company as of the date of
this Agreement and furnished or made available to Parent, indemnify and hold
harmless the present and former directors and officers of the Company (each,
an " _Insured Party_ ") against all costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
settlement amounts paid in connection with any claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation based on the fact that such individual is or was a
director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and arising out
of or pertaining to any action or omission occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated hereby) (and shall pay
any expenses in advance of the final disposition of such action or proceeding
to each Insured Party to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law,
upon receipt from the Insured Party for whom expenses are paid of any
undertaking to repay such amounts required under applicable Law), and Parent
will not prohibit the Surviving Corporation from honoring such
indemnification obligations and agreements, subject to applicable Law. In the
event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, (i) the
Surviving Corporation shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel
selected by the Insured Parties, which counsel shall be reasonably
satisfactory to the Surviving Corporation, promptly after statements  



 

65  therefor are received and (ii) the Surviving Corporation shall cooperate in
the defense of any such matter; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Surviving
Corporation shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its prior
written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld); _provided_
_further_ , that the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated pursuant to
this Section 5.12 to pay the fees and expenses of more than one counsel for
all Insured Parties in any single action unless a conflict of interest
precludes the effective representation of more than one Insured Party with
respect to the applicable claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation.
Furthermore, and notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may, prior to or
in connection with the Closing, purchase a "tail" policy under the Companys
existing directors and officers insurance policy (the " _Tail Policy_ "),
with the cost of such Tail Policy included in the Transaction Expenses. If (x)
the Surviving Corporation consolidates with or merges into any other
Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger, (y) the Surviving Corporation transfers or conveys a
material portion of its properties and assets to any Person, or (z) Parent
transfers or conveys all or substantially all of the voting equity securities
of the Surviving Corporation to any Person, proper provision shall be made so
that the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation
or merger, or Person to whom such properties and assets or voting equity
securities are transferred or conveyed, expressly assumes the obligations set
forth in this Section 5.12.

(b) The articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall contain
provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification than are set
forth in the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Company, which
provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period
of four years from the Effective Time in any manner that would affect
adversely the rights thereunder of individuals who, prior to the Effective
Time, were directors, officers, employees, fiduciaries or agents of the
Company, with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective
Time, unless such modification shall be required by applicable Law.

Section 5.13 _Preferred Stock Conversion_. The Company shall take all
necessary action to enable the holders of each of the Series A
Preferred Stock, the Series B Preferred Stock, the Series C Preferred Stock
and the Series D Preferred Stock to vote for an automatic conversion of such
series of Preferred Stock into Shares immediately prior to the Merger pursuant
to Section 3(b)(ii) of the Charter (the " _Preferred Stock Conversion_ ").

Section 5.14 _Parent Equity Grants_. In order to retain the Companys
employees after consummation of the Merger, Parent is implementing a retention
program by which it will make grants of Parent restricted stock units or cash
payments equal to approximately $40 million (at least $20 million of
which will be broad based grants) to Persons employed by the Company as of
the Effective Time, including grants made to Key Employees pursuant to the
retention agreements as described in Recital C of this Agreement. Parent and
the chief executive officer of the Company will consult regarding the
allocation of such grants, but final determination of all such grants will be
in Parents sole discretion. All grants pursuant to such retention program
shall be made in exchange for services to be provided following the Closing
and not in exchange for Capital Stock or services provided prior to the
Closing.



 

66 Section 5.15 _Section 280G_ Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
ensure that (i) the receipt of any compensation, benefits or amounts that may
reasonably be deemed to result in an "excess parachute payment" (within the
meaning of Section 280G(c) of the Code) to each person who is a "disqualified
individual" with respect to the Company, within the meaning of Section 280G(c)
of the Code shall be subject to shareholder approval in accordance
with Section 280G(b)(5)(A)(ii) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
thereunder and that (ii) such compensation, benefits or amounts shall not be
payable or otherwise inure to the benefit of such person in a manner that will
result in such amount being treated as such an "excess parachute payment."
The Company shall have provided to Parent written evidence, in a form
reasonably satisfactory to Parent, that the Company has complied with its
obligations under this Section 5.15.

Section 5.16 _Consideration Spreadsheet_. Prior to the Closing the Company
shall prepare and deliver to Parent a spreadsheet (the " _Consideration
Spreadsheet_ "), certified by the Chief Financial Officer of the Company, that
includes the total issued and outstanding Capital Stock of the Company by each
class and series, and the total outstanding number of Company Options and any
other Stock Purchase Rights outstanding, each as of the Effective Time. Such
Consideration Spreadsheet shall set forth for each record and beneficial
holder of any shares of Capital Stock, Company Options or Stock Purchase
Rights, the number of shares of Capital Stock by series and class, and the
number of Company Options or other Stock Purchase Rights owned by each such
holder, the number of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable to each such
holder pursuant to Section 2.7, the number of shares of Parent Common Stock to
be delivered to the Escrow Agent on behalf of such holder pursuant to Section
2.7(f) (stating separately the number of shares to be held in the
Indemnity Escrow Fund and the number of shares to be held in the Shareholder
Representative Expense Fund), the amount of cash in lieu of fractional shares
payable to each such holder pursuant to Section 2.10(e) and the number of
Parent Options issuable to such holder upon conversion of Company Options
pursuant to Section 2.9.

Law, the Company shall take such actions as reasonably requested by Parent to
comply with or challenge such New Law.

ARTICLE VI

"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

thereto disclosed to Parent in the Companys virtual data-room on or before
the date of this Agreement shall be taken into account in determining whether
the condition in this Section 7.3(a)(i) is satisfied only to the extent such

reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect; and (ii)(A) the
representations and warranties made by the Company in Sections 3.1

INDEMNIFICATION

Section 8.1 _Survival of Representations and Warranties_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the representations and warranties of
the Company, Parent and Merger Sub contained in this Agreement and
the Operative Documents and any schedule, certificate or other similar
document delivered pursuant hereto or thereto by such parties in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall survive the Closing
until 5:00 p.m., Seattle, Washington time on February 28, 2011; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that: the representations and warranties set forth in Sections 3.2
and 4.2 relating to enforceability and authority, Section 3.3 relating
to capitalization, 3.4 relating to equity interests, Section 3.8 relating to
Taxes, and Sections 3.23 and 4.5 relating to brokers fees and finders fees
(Sections 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.8, 3.23, 4.2 and 4.5 are collectively referred to
herein as the " _Core Representations_ "), and any representation in the case
of fraud, intentional misrepresentation or intentional breach, shall survive
indefinitely.

(b) No party shall have any liability whatsoever with respect to any such
representations and warranties unless a claim is made hereunder prior to
the expiration of the survival period for such representation and warranty
and as set forth herein, in which case such representation and warranty shall
survive as to such claim until such claim has been finally resolved.



 

72 Section 8.2 _Indemnification by the Indemnifying Shareholders and Consenting
Optionholders_. From and after the Effective Time, the Indemnifying
Shareholders and the Consenting Optionholders, severally on a pro rata basis,
shall save, defend, indemnify and hold harmless Parent, Merger Sub, the
Surviving Corporation and their Affiliates, and the respective
Representatives and permitted successors and assigns of each of the foregoing
from and against any and all losses, damages, liabilities, deficiencies,
Claims, diminution of value, interest, awards, judgments, penalties, costs
and expenses (including reasonable outside attorneys fees, reasonable costs
and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred in investigating, preparing or
defending the foregoing) (hereinafter collectively, " _Losses_ "), asserted
against, incurred, sustained or suffered by any of the foregoing as a result
of, arising out of or relating to:

(a) any Breach of any representation or warranty made by the Company
contained in this Agreement or any Operative Document to which the Company is
a party or any schedule, certificate or other similar document delivered
pursuant hereto or thereto or any Third Party Claim that if meritorious would
have been a breach of any representation or warranty made by the Company
contained in this Agreement or any Operative Document to which the Company is
a party or any schedule, certificate or other similar document
delivered pursuant hereto or thereto (for purposes of determining Losses
under this Section 8.2(a), without giving effect to any limitations or
qualifications thereto relating to materiality, Material Adverse Effect, or
any supplements or updates to the Disclosure Memorandum made after the date
hereof other than inclusion in a supplement to the Disclosure Schedule of (i)
any of the items set forth on Schedule 8.2(a), and (ii) any matter to which
Parent provided its consent pursuant to Section 5.1) or any Breach of the
covenant contained in Section 5.6(b);

(b) any Breach of any covenant (other than contained in Section 5.6(b)) or
agreement by Company contained in this Agreement or any Operative Document to
which the Company is a party or any schedule, certificate or other similar
document delivered pursuant hereto or thereto (including as a result of the
action or failure to act of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) or the
taking of any action prohibited by Section 5.1 for which Parent did not
expressly consent, or any Breach of the Non-Compete by a Key Employee, but
only to the extent of shares of Parent Common Stock escrowed on behalf of
such breaching Key Employee (for purposes of clarity, such Key Employees
Breach to be the several obligation of such Key Employee);

(c)(i) any Transaction Expenses charged to Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation or the Company that were either not reflected on the Schedule
of Expenses or were in excess of $15,000,000, or (ii) any amounts required to
be paid to any Shareholder in excess of amounts set forth in the Consideration
Spreadsheet;

(d) any amounts required to be paid to holders of Dissenting Shares, including
any interest required to be paid thereon, that are in excess of what
such Shareholder would have received hereunder had such Shareholder not been
a holder of Dissenting Shares, or



 

73 (e) without duplication of any amounts indemnified pursuant to Section 8.2(a),
any Tax that is a Disclosed Tax (as hereinafter defined) and all Losses
related thereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that the indemnity obligation for a
Disclosed Tax shall be reduced (but not below zero) by the reserve for such
Disclosed Tax that is included as a liability for Taxes in the Interim
Balance Sheet, to the extent the reserve was established for the issue that
gave rise to such indemnity obligation. For purposes of this Section 8.2(e), a
" _Disclosed Tax_ " means a Tax (whether or not stated in terms of amount)
that is disclosed as a liability or potential liability, or that could result
from one or more issues or potential issues referred to, in Schedule 3.8 of
the Disclosure Memorandum, and (without duplication) any Tax that may be
imposed as a result of audits referred to in Schedule 3.8 of the Disclosure
Memorandum.

From and after the Effective Time, the Indemnifying Shareholders and the
Consenting Optionholders shall have no rights of contribution or otherwise
from the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company with respect to any
indemnification obligations such Indemnifying Shareholders and Consenting
Optionholders may have under this Article VIII. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
a Breach of a representation in Section 3.1 or Section 3.8 that would not have
occurred but for the enactment, following the date of this Agreement, of one
or more new Laws requiring the Company or a Subsidiary to collect and remit
sales and use Taxes in a jurisdiction in which the Company or a Subsidiary was
not registered to collect and remit sales and use Taxes prior to
the Effective Time, (" _New Law_ ") shall not give rise to a claim for
indemnity pursuant to Section 8.2(a) based on such Breach, it being understood
that any Breach of a representation in Section 3.1 or Section 3.8 that would
have occurred absent the enactment of such New Law shall continue to give rise
to a claim for indemnity pursuant to Section 8.2(a).



 

74 Section 8.3 _Indemnification by Parent and the Surviving Corporation_. From
and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
save, defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Indemnifying Shareholders, the
Consenting Optionholders and their Affiliates and the respective
Representatives, successors and assigns of each of the foregoing from and
against any and all Losses asserted against, incurred, sustained or suffered
by any of the foregoing as a result of, arising out of or relating to:

(a) any Breach of any representation or warranty made by Parent or Merger Sub
contained in this Agreement or any Operative Document or any
schedule, certificate or other similar document delivered pursuant hereto or
thereto (for purposes of determining Losses under this Section 8.3(a), without
giving effect to any limitations or qualifications as to materiality, or
Material Adverse Effect); and

(b) any Breach of any covenant or agreement by Parent or Merger Sub contained
in this Agreement or any Operative Document or any schedule, certificate or
other similar document delivered pursuant hereto or thereto.

Section 8.4 _Procedures_.

(a) In order for a party (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") to be entitled to any
indemnification provided for under this Article VIII of this Agreement in
respect of, arising out of or involving a Loss or a claim or demand made by
any person (including notice of the commencement of any legal proceeding,
threat, audit or examination) against the Indemnified Party (a " _Third
Party Claim_ "), such Indemnified Party shall deliver notice thereof (which
in the case of Parent shall be in the form of an Officers Certificate) to the
Shareholder Representative, on behalf of the Indemnifying Shareholders and
the Consenting Optionholders, or to Parent, as applicable (the "
_Indemnifying Party_ ", for avoidance of doubt, the Indemnifying Shareholders
and Consenting Optionholders are collectively the "Indemnifying Party" as such
term is used in this Agreement and not each individually the "Indemnifying
Party") and shall provide the Indemnifying Party with such information with
respect thereto as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request (but, at a
minimum, shall provide the following: (i) the amount of such Losses (which,
in the case of Losses not yet incurred or paid may be the maximum amount
reasonably likely to be incurred or paid), including a statement of the number
of shares of Parent Common Stock representing such claim, and identifying the
specific clause or clauses of this Agreement pursuant to which an Indemnified
Party is entitled to indemnification, and (ii) specifying in reasonable detail
(based upon the information then possessed) the facts and circumstances
related to the breach and the individual items of such Losses arising out of,
resulting from or in connection with such breach). The failure to provide such
notice or any delay in providing it, however, shall not release the
Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations under this Article VIII except
to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by such
failure or delay (other than in the event that such notice is provided after
the applicable time by which a claim must be made under this Agreement as
provided in Section 8.1(b)). If the Indemnifying Party acknowledges in writing
its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party against any and all Losses
that may result from a Third Party Claim pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement (and if such Third Party Claim does not attempt to impose  



 

75  equitable remedies or any obligation on the Indemnified Party other than
solely the payment of money damages for which the Indemnified Party will
be indemnified hereunder), the Indemnifying Party shall have the right, upon
written notice to the Indemnified Party within 15 days of receipt of notice
from the Indemnified Party of the commencement of such Third Party Claim, to
assume the defense thereof at the expense of the Indemnifying Party (which
expenses shall not be applied against any indemnity limitation herein) with
counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party and reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the fees and
expenses of counsel employed by the Indemnified Party for any period during
which the Indemnifying Party has failed to assume the defense thereof. If the
Indemnifying Party does not expressly elect to assume the defense of such
Third Party Claim within the time period and otherwise in accordance with the
first sentence of this Section 8.4(b), the Indemnified Party shall have the
sole right to assume the defense of and to settle such Third Party Claim. If
the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of such Third Party Claim at the
Indemnifying Partys sole cost and expense, the Indemnified Party shall have
the right to employ separate counsel and to participate in the defense
thereof, but the fees and expenses of such Indemnified Partys counsel shall
be at the expense of the Indemnified Party unless (i) the employment of such
counsel shall have been specifically authorized in writing by the Indemnifying
Party or (ii) the named parties to the Third Party Claim (including any
impleaded parties) include both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying
Party, and the Indemnified Party reasonably determines that representation by
counsel to the Indemnifying Party of both the Indemnifying Party and such
Indemnified Party may present such counsel with a conflict of interest. If the
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party shall, at the Indemnifying Partys expense, cooperate with
the Indemnifying Party in such defense and make available to the Indemnifying
Party all witnesses, pertinent records, materials and information in the
Indemnified Partys possession or under the Indemnified Partys control
relating thereto as is reasonably required by the Indemnifying Party. If the
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third Party Claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party, enter into any settlement or compromise or consent to the
entry of any judgment with respect to such Third Party Claim if such
settlement, compromise or judgment (A) involves a finding or admission of
wrongdoing, (B) does not include an unconditional written release by the
claimant or plaintiff of the Indemnified Party from all liability in respect
of such Third Party Claim, (C) imposes equitable remedies or any obligation on
the Indemnified Party other than solely the payment of money damages for
which the Indemnified Party will be indemnified hereunder, or (D) could affect
the liability of Parent, the Company or their Affiliates in periods not
specifically addressed in such Third Party Claim. The Indemnifying Party
shall not be entitled to require that any action be made or brought against
any other Person before action is brought or Claim is made against it
hereunder by the Indemnified Party.

(b) If any Indemnified Party should have a claim against any Indemnifying
Party hereunder that does not involve a Third Party Claim being
asserted against or sought to be collected from such Indemnified Party, the
Indemnified Party shall deliver notice of such claim with reasonable
promptness to the Indemnifying Party (which in the case of Parent shall be in
the form of an Officers Certificate) and shall  



 

76  provide the Indemnifying Party with such information with respect thereto as
the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request (but, at a minimum, shall
provide the following: (i) the amount of such Losses (which, in the case of
Losses not yet incurred or paid may be the maximum amount reasonably likely to
be incurred or paid), and identifying the specific clause or clauses of this
Agreement pursuant to which an Indemnified Party is entitled to
indemnification, (ii) specifying in reasonable detail (based upon the
information then possessed) the facts and circumstances related to the breach
and the individual items of such Losses arising out of, resulting from or in
connection with such breach). The failure to provide such notice, however,
shall not release the Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations under
this Article VIII except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party
is materially prejudiced by such failure and shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party from any other obligation or liability that it may have to
the Indemnified Party or otherwise than pursuant to this Article VIII (other
than in the event that such notice is provided after the applicable time by
which a claim must be made under this Agreement as provided in Section
8.1(b)). If the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party
within twenty days following its receipt of such notice that the Indemnifying
Party disputes its liability to the Indemnified Party hereunder, such claim
specified by the Indemnified Party in such notice shall be conclusively deemed
a liability of the Indemnifying Party hereunder and the Indemnifying Party
shall pay the amount of such liability to the Indemnified Party on demand. If
the Indemnifying Party agrees that it has an indemnification obligation but
asserts that it is obligated to pay a lesser amount than that claimed by
the Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party shall pay such lesser amount
promptly to the Indemnified Party, without prejudice to or waiver of the
Indemnified Partys claim for the difference, which payment in the case of
indemnification pursuant to Section 8.2 shall be made by pro rata and
severally by forfeiture of shares of Parent Common Stock held in the Indemnity
Escrow Fund and forfeiture of Parent Options by Consenting Optionholders.

(c) At any time on or before the termination of the Indemnity Escrow Fund,
upon receipt by the Escrow Agent of a certificate signed by any officer
of Parent (an " _Officer s Certificate_"): (A) stating that Parent has paid
or properly accrued or reasonably anticipates that it will have to pay or
accrue Losses, and (B) specifying in reasonable detail the individual items
of Losses included in the amount so stated, or the basis for such anticipated
Liability, and the nature of the misrepresentation, breach of warranty or
covenant to which such item is related and shall provide the Indemnifying
Party with such information with respect thereto as the Indemnifying Party
may reasonably request (but, at a minimum, shall provide the following: (i)
the amount of such Losses (which, in the case of Losses not yet incurred or
paid may be the maximum amount reasonably likely to be incurred or paid),
including a statement of the number of shares of Parent Common Stock
representing such claim, and identifying the specific clause or clauses of
this Agreement pursuant to which an Indemnified Party is entitled to
indemnification, and (ii) specifying in reasonable detail (based upon the
information then possessed) the facts and circumstances related to the breach
and the individual items of such Losses arising out of, resulting from or
in connection with such breach), the Escrow Agent shall, subject to the
provisions of Section 8.4(e) hereof, deliver to Parent out of the Indemnity
Escrow Fund, as promptly as practicable, shares of Parent Common Stock held in
the Indemnity Escrow Fund having a value, determined in accordance with  



 

77  Section 8.4(d), equal to the amount of such Losses (or in the case of each
Consenting Optionholder, to the extent such Consenting Optionholder has
not contributed shares into the Indemnity Escrow Fund to cover their
respective several obligation for such Losses, Parent shall be entitled to
offset such Losses against their respective Parent Options pursuant to the
Option Consent).

(d) For the purposes of determining the number of shares of Parent Common
Stock to be delivered to Parent out of the Indemnity Escrow Fund pursuant
to Section 8.4(c) hereof (or with respect to the Consenting Optionholders, in
connection with determining their respective pro rata share of the Losses),
the shares of Parent Common Stock shall be valued at Parent Stock Price.

(e) At the time of delivery of any Officers Certificate to the Escrow Agent
as described in Section 8.4(c), a duplicate copy of such Officers
Certificate shall be delivered to the Shareholder Representative, and for a
period of 20 days after such delivery the Escrow Agent shall make no delivery
to Parent of any of the Indemnity Escrow Fund pursuant to Section
8.4(c) hereof unless the Escrow Agent shall have received written
authorization from the Shareholder Representative to make such delivery. After
the expiration of such 20 day period, the Escrow Agent shall make delivery of
shares of Parent Common Stock from the Indemnity Escrow Fund in accordance
with Section 8.4(c) hereof, provided that no such payment or delivery may be
made if Shareholder Representative shall object in a written statement to the
claim made in the Officers Certificate, and such statement shall have been
delivered to the Escrow Agent and Parent prior to the expiration of such 20
day period.

(f) In case the Shareholder Representative shall timely object in writing to
any claim or claims made in any Officers Certificate, the Shareholder
Representative and Parent shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights
of the respective parties with respect to each of such claims. If the
Shareholder Representative and Parent should so agree, a memorandum setting
forth such agreement shall be prepared and signed by both parties and shall be
furnished to the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on
any such memorandum and distribute shares of Parent Common Stock from the
Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms thereof. If no such agreement can be
reached after good faith negotiation, the parties shall resolve any such
dispute as provided in Section 10.10.

(g) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 10.10, each Indemnifying Party
hereby consents to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of any court in which a Claim
in respect of a Third Party Claim is brought against any Indemnified Party for
purposes of any Claim that an Indemnified Party may have under this Agreement
with respect to such Claim or the matters alleged therein and agrees that
process may be served on each Indemnifying Party with respect to such Claim
anywhere.

  

 

78 Section 8.5 _Limits on Indemnification_.

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement:

(i) _Deductible_. An Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any claim for
indemnification pursuant to Section 8.2(a) or Section 8.3(a), as the case may
be, unless and until the aggregate amount of Losses which may be recovered
from the Indemnifying Party (other than with respect to Breaches of Core
Representations or Losses resulting therefrom which shall not be counted
towards the Deductible nor subject to the Deductible) equals or exceeds
$1,000,000, (the " _Deductible_ "), in which case the Indemnifying Party shall
be liable only for the Losses in excess of the Deductible.

maximum aggregate amount of Losses which may be recovered by an Indemnified
Party arising out of or relating to the causes set forth in Section 8.3(a)

fraud, intentional misrepresentation or intentional breach) shall be an amount
equal to ten percent (10%) of the Total Merger Consideration.

(iii) _Maximum Liability for Breach of Core Representation or Covenant by
Parent_. The maximum aggregate amount of Losses which may be recovered by an

(iv) _Maximum Liability for Breach of non-Core Representation or Certain Tax
Matters by the Company_. The maximum aggregate amount of Losses which may be

Subsidiary failed to pay prior to the Closing, shall be an amount equal to,
and consisting solely of, the value of:

limitations set forth in Section 8.5(a)(iv) with respect to state sales, use
and income Taxes, the maximum aggregate amount of Losses which may be
recovered by an Indemnified Party arising out of or relating to the Special
Matters (other than arising out of or relating to the untruth or breach of
any representation or warranty in the event of fraud or intentional
misrepresentation) shall be limited to an amount equal to the value of the
shares of Parent Common Stock (based on the Parent Stock Price) actually
received by all such Indemnifying Shareholders (including shares of Parent
Common Stock in the Indemnity Escrow Fund), and all of the Parent Options
issued to Consenting Optionholders pursuant to Section 2.9; _provided_ , that
with respect to Special Matters, the Indemnified Persons must first seek to
recover any Losses to which they are entitled from the Indemnity Escrow Fund
and exhaust all amounts in the Indemnity Escrow Fund (after taking into
account all other indemnification obligations recoverable from the Indemnity
Escrow Fund) before seeking recovery from any Indemnifying Shareholder
pursuant to this Agreement.

(vi) _Liability for Fraud, Etc_. The maximum aggregate amount of Losses which
may be recovered by an Indemnified Party arising out of or relating to the
untruth or breach of any representation or warranty in the event of fraud or
intentional misrepresentation shall not be subject to any limitation.

shall not apply to Losses arising out of or relating Breach of a Core
Representation under Section 8.3(a), any representation or warranty in the
event of fraud, intentional misrepresentation or intentional breach by Parent
or Merger Sub, or the matters arising under Section 8.3(b).

(viii) _Limits on Deductible for the Indemnifying Shareholders and Consenting
Optionholders._ The limits of Sections 8.5(a)(i), shall not apply to(A)

those items set forth in Sections 8.2(b), (c), (d), or (e) (Sections
8.5(a)(viii)(A), (B) and (C) are collectively, the " _Special Matters_ ").

(ix) _Limit on Parent and Surviving Corporation Indemnification to Preserve
Reorganization Status_. Parents indemnity obligations under this Agreement
and the Operative Documents shall be reduced to the extent necessary so that
the Merger will not to fail to qualify as a reorganization, as defined in
Section 368(a)(1)(A) of the Code by reason of Section 368(a)(2)(E) of the
Code, as a result of payments in cash to holders or former holders of
Dissenting Shares, if any, and the indemnity obligations of Parent and
the Company set forth herein or arising under any other of the Operative
Documents. Upon request by Parent following a final determination or agreement
that any cash  



 

80  amounts are owed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation to the former
shareholders of the Company (other than by reason of Section 2.8), the
Shareholder Representative and Parent shall agree in writing upon the amount
of the reduction, if any, in such obligation required under this Section
8.5(a)(ix), and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be deemed to have
satisfied their obligations under this Section 8.5(a)(ix), and shall not be
deemed to have breached Section 6.1, by paying such reduced amount.

(b) An Indemnified Party may not make a claim for indemnification under
Section 8.2(a) or Section 8.3(a), as the case may be, for breach by the
Indemnifying Party of a particular representation or warranty after the
expiration of the survival period thereof specified in Section 8.1, except as
otherwise provided in such Section.

(c) The amount of any Losses that are subject to indemnification under this
Article VIII shall be calculated net of the amount of any insurance proceeds,
indemnification payments or contribution payments actually received by Parent,
Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and their Affiliates, provided that
Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and/or their Affiliates shall be
under no obligation to seek any such insurance proceeds, indemnification
payments or contribution payments.

Section 8.6 _Remedies Not Affected by Investigation, Disclosure or Knowledge_.
Subject to the limitations set forth in this Article VIII, if the
transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, Parent expressly reserves
the right to seek indemnity or other remedy for any Losses arising out of or
relating to any breach of any representation, warranty or covenant contained
herein, notwithstanding any investigation by, disclosure to or Knowledge of
such party in respect of any fact or circumstance that reveals the occurrence
of any such breach, whether before or after the execution and delivery hereof.

Section 8.7 _Indemnity Escrow Fund; Shareholder Representative Expense Fund_.

(a) If the Merger is consummated, the indemnification provisions in this
Article VIII shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for any and all Claims
with respect to this Agreement other than in the case of fraud or intentional
misrepresentation.

(b) If the Indemnity Escrow Ratio used to calculate the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock contributed to the Indemnity Escrow Fund on behalf of the
Indemnifying Shareholders is greater than 10% as of the Closing Date, and if
between the Closing Date and the thirty day anniversary of the Closing Date
any Shareholder who was not an Indemnifying Shareholder as of the Closing Date
shall have withdrawn or relinquished his/her/its rights as dissenting
shareholders under Chapter 13 of the CGCL in connection with the Merger (a "
_Relinquishing Shareholder"_ ), Parent agrees that it shall, as soon as
commercially practicable after such thirty day anniversary of the Closing
Date, instruct the Escrow Agent to deliver to each Indemnifying Shareholder
(that was not a Relinquishing Shareholder), a pro rata portion of the shares
of Parent Common Stock placed in the Indemnity Escrow Fund by such
Relinquishing Shareholders to reflect an Indemnity Escrow Ratio as of the
Closing for each such Indemnifying Shareholder as of such thirty day
anniversary date of the Closing of: (x) 0.10 multiplied  



 

81  by the ratio of (y) the total number of outstanding shares of Capital Stock
of the Company as of immediately prior to the Effective Time on a
fully diluted basis (i.e., inclusive of Stock Purchase Rights) divided by
that number equal to (1) the total number of outstanding shares of Capital
Stock of the Company on a fully diluted basis (i.e., inclusive of Stock
Purchase Rights) minus (2) the total number of issued and outstanding shares
of Capital Stock that are dissenting shares in accordance with Chapter 13 of
the CGCL as of such thirty day anniversary of the Closing Date. Additionally,
as provided in the Option Consent, such Consenting Optionholders shall also
be subject to a pro rata reduction in their indemnity obligations under the
Option Consent in an amount consistent with the formulation described above to
account for any such shares of Parent Common Stock placed in the Indemnity
Escrow Fund by such Relinquishing Shareholders.

(c) Promptly, but in any event within five Business Days, after February 28,
2011, Parent shall instruct the Escrow Agent to release all amounts in the
Indemnity Escrow Fund in excess of (i) $40 million of Parent Common Stock
(valued at the Parent Stock Price), plus (ii) an amount of Parent
Common Stock (valued at the Parent Stock Price) equal to any unsatisfied
indemnification claims pending that were described in any Officers
Certificate delivered prior to February 28, 2011 to the Indemnifying
Shareholders pro rata in accordance with the contributions made to the Escrow
Fund by such Indemnifying Shareholders (as adjusted for any amounts delivered
to Parent with respect to a several Breach by any such Indemnifying
Shareholder).

(d) Upon the termination of the Indemnity Escrow Fund on the four year
anniversary of the Closing Date (or such later date to the extent of
pending claims) and otherwise pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement,
the Escrow Agent shall deliver any shares of Parent Common Stock remaining in
the Indemnity Escrow Fund to the Indemnifying Shareholders. Delivery of such
Parent Common Stock (and any amounts earned thereon) to Indemnifying
Shareholders shall be made pro rata in accordance with the contributions made
to the Escrow Fund by such Indemnifying Shareholders (as adjusted for any
amounts delivered to Parent with respect to a several Breach by any such
Indemnifying Shareholder). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Escrow Agent
shall make no distributions to Indemnifying Shareholders from the Indemnity
Escrow Fund to the extent necessary and shall retain an amount equal to
any unsatisfied indemnification claims pending that were described in any
Officers Certificate delivered prior to the four year anniversary of the
Closing Date.

(e) Each Indemnifying Shareholder shall have voting rights with respect to the
shares of Parent Common Stock deposited to the Indemnity Escrow Fund and the
Shareholder Representative Expense Fund by or on behalf of such Indemnifying
Shareholder (and any additional shares as may be issued after the Effective
Time with respect to the shares constituting the Indemnity Escrow Amount or
the Shareholder Representative Expense Fund Amount upon any stock
split, dividend or recapitalization effected by Parent after the Effective
Time) unless paid pursuant to an indemnification claim. Each Indemnifying
Shareholder shall have the right to receive any cash dividends or
distributions made with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock deposited to
the Indemnity Escrow Fund and the Shareholder Representative Expense Fund, but
any  



 

82  additional shares of Parent Common Stock as may be issued after the
Effective Time with respect to the shares constituting the Indemnity Escrow
Amount or the Shareholder Representative Expense Fund Amount, in either case,
upon any stock split, stock dividend or recapitalization effected by Parent
after the Effective Time shall be retained in the Indemnity Escrow Fund, or in
the case of the Shareholder Representative Expense Fund, in the Shareholder
Representative Expense Fund. For federal income Tax purposes, the Indemnifying
Shareholders on whose behalf the Shares of Parent Common Stock in the
Indemnity Escrow Fund were deposited will be treated as the owners of such
Shares unless and until such Shares are returned to Parent.

(f) Pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, the
shares of Parent Common Stock constituting the Shareholder Representative
Expense Fund shall be held in a segregated account by the Escrow Agent and
shall be solely available to reimburse the Shareholder Representative
for expenses incurred by the Shareholder Representative in performing its
duties hereunder (including legal fees and expenses related thereto) and in
connection therewith, the Shareholder Representative shall have the authority
to instruct the Escrow Agent to liquidate any shares of Parent Common Stock
then placed in the Shareholder Representative Expense Fund and to distribute
any amounts received upon such liquidation to either the Shareholder
Representative personally, or at the instruction of the Shareholder
Representative, to any third party providing services to the Shareholder
Representative in connection with his obligations hereunder (including legal
fees and expenses related thereto, and for purpose of clarity, relating to
the defense of third party claims against the Indemnifying Shareholders and
Consenting Optionholders). If any shares of Parent Common Stock remain in the
Shareholder Representative Expense Fund at such time as the Shareholder
Representative reasonably believes that all of his obligations have been
satisfied pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement,
such shares shall be distributed by the Escrow Agent to the Shareholders based
on their pro rata interest therein (as calculated based on the number of
shares of Parent Common Stock placed in the Shareholder Representative Expense
Fund by each such Indemnifying Shareholder). For federal income Tax purposes,
the Shareholders on whose behalf the shares of Parent Common Stock in the
Shareholder Representative Expense Fund were deposited will be treated as the
owners of such Shares and of any income thereon or proceeds therefrom unless
and until such amounts are distributed from the Shareholder
Representative Expense Fund to pay expenses as provided in this Agreement and
the Escrow Agreement.

(g) Upon any distribution of shares of Parent Common Stock to Indemnifying
Shareholders from the Indemnity Escrow Fund or the Shareholder Representative
Expense Fund, in lieu of any fractional shares, Indemnifying Shareholders who
would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent
Common Stock will be paid an amount in cash (without interest) equal to such
holders respective proportionate interest in the net proceeds from the sale
or sales in the open market by the Escrow Agent, on behalf of all such
Indemnifying Shareholder, of the aggregate fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock which would otherwise be released. Prior to any such release, the Escrow
Agent shall determine the excess of (i) the number of shares of Parent Common
Stock to be distributed to Indemnifying Shareholders  



 

83  (without excluding fractional shares), over (ii) the aggregate number of
whole shares of Parent Common Stock to be distributed to
Indemnifying Shareholders (excluding fractional shares) (such excess being
collectively called the " _Excess Parent Common Stock_ "). The Escrow Agent,
as agent and trustee for the Indemnifying Shareholders, shall as promptly as
reasonably practicable sell the Excess Parent Common Stock at the prevailing
prices on NASDAQ (or on the principal exchange on which the Parent Common
Stock is then traded or quoted). The sales of the Excess Parent Common Stock
by the Escrow Agent shall be executed on NASDAQ (or such other exchange)
through one or more member firms of NASDAQ (or such other exchange) and shall
be executed in round lots to the extent practicable. Until the net proceeds of
such sales have been distributed to the Indemnifying Shareholders to whom
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock otherwise would have been issued, the
Escrow Agent will hold such proceeds in trust for such former holders. As soon
as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash to be paid to
Indemnifying Shareholders in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock, the Escrow Agent shall distribute such amounts to such Indemnifying
Shareholders.
