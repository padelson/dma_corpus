total amount of such remaining disputed amounts so submitted by Buyer to the
Independent Accounting Firm. Payment of the disputed amount shall be made by the

                           (xv) not make any material change in its certificate

                           (xix) not assign or consent to any assignment of any

Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.3 to the contrary, the Parties agree
that (i) the Company may, in its sole discretion, make or incur an obligation to
the extent relating to Required Nuclear Expenditures or any repairs or
modifications to any Facility reasonably required in the normal course of
business and in accordance with Good Utility Practices (a "Required
Expenditure"), and (ii) the Company shall retain exclusive control over all
aspects of the operation, maintenance, refueling, shutdown or other matters
relating to the operation of the Facilities and to the Company during the
Interim Period, all in accordance with Good Utility Practices.

                  (b) During the Interim Period, in the interest of facilitating
an orderly transition of the upstream ownership of the Company and permitting
informed action by the Buyer regarding its rights under Section 5.3(a), the
Parties shall, as promptly as is practicable after the date hereof, establish a
committee comprised of at least five (5) persons, two (2) persons to be

                                       40

<PAGE>

designated by the Seller and two persons to be designated by the Buyer, and such
additional persons as may be appointed by the persons originally appointed to
such committee (the "Transition Executive Committee"). From time to time, the
Transition Executive Committee shall report to the senior management of Seller
and Buyer. The Transition Executive Committee shall meet periodically and shall
oversee and manage the transition process during the Interim Period. The Seller
shall consult with Buyer's representatives on the Transition Executive
Committee, on a regular and timely basis, with respect to the refueling
outage(s) occurring during the Interim Period, to any repairs to the Facilities
and to the Required Nuclear Expenditures and Required Expenditures. The
Transition Executive Committee shall have no authority to bind or make
agreements on behalf of Seller or the Buyer or to issue instructions to or
direct or exercise authority over Seller or Buyer or any of their respective
officers, employees, advisors or agents or to waive or modify any provision
thereof. Seller shall refrain from voting on any material matter presented at
Company Management Committee meetings (as defined in the LLC Agreement) and

Buyer prior to such meeting, and shall consult with Buyer prior to voting on any
such matter.

         SECTION 5.4 Access and Investigations During Interim Period. During the
Interim Period, British Energy will permit, and will use Commercially Reasonable
Efforts to cause the Company to permit, Buyer to have reasonable access to each
Facility, subject to any restrictions and procedures set forth in this Section
5.4 or otherwise reasonably imposed by the Company, to conduct environmental
studies and inspections (such as the review of existing environmental records
and related material but, for the avoidance of doubt, not including any
environmental testing of soil samples or other invasive procedures with respect
to any Facility), and to observe and inspect all premises, properties,
management, personnel, books, records, (including tax records), and other
information, including without limitation all information necessary to enable
Buyer to verify the representations and warranties as set forth in Article 3 and
to confirm that British Energy has complied with the covenants set forth herein,
and any other information or documents associated with or pertaining to the
Assets. All access and inspections by Buyer are subject to the following
provisions:

                  (a) Costs. All costs of such investigations and observations,
including the compensation paid to the Persons involved and their expenses, and
other discrete incremental costs incurred by the Company or British Energy in
connection with such investigation and observation, shall be borne by Buyer.

                  (b) Escorted Physical Access to Facilities. The Buyer shall,
with respect to each Person designated by the Buyer to have escorted access to
the Facilities for purposes of this Section 5.4, provide the following
information for each such Person to the contact designated by British Energy for
the Facility (or his designee) no later than twenty-four (24) hours prior to the
proposed time of access by such Person: name, date of birth social security
number and the name of each nuclear power plant at which such Person has a
current badge for access. British Energy shall be permitted where necessary in
its sole discretion to limit the number of Persons to whom escorted access is
provided at any one time on account of reasonable logistical considerations.

                  Subject to the immediately succeeding sentence, the Buyer
shall, with respect to each Person designated by the Buyer to have escorted
access to the Facilities, provide reasonable notice to the contact designated by
British Energy for the Facilities (or his designee), so as not to interfere with
the normal business operations of the Facilities, and such Person shall comply

                                       41

<PAGE>

with all existing requirements of the Facility and NRC for escorted access,
including, but not limited to, background investigation, training requirements,
fitness-for-duty requirements, a psychological assessment and behavioral
observation.

                  The Buyer may request that any Person subject to the
fitness-for-duty program of the Buyer be excused from compliance with the
fitness-for-duty program of the Company for up to ninety (90) days, in which
event the provisions of 10 C.F.R. Section 26.23 shall be applicable to such
Person designated by the Buyer to have access to the Facilities.

                  (c) Access to Records and Information. (i) Under no
circumstances shall the Company be required by British Energy to provide access
to any documents or information constituting or containing "Classified National
Security Information" or "Restricted Data", as defined in 10 C.F.R. Part 73. The
Company shall not be required by British Energy to provide access to any
documents or information constituting or containing "Safeguards Information", as
defined in 10 C.F.R. Part 73, except to any Person designated by Buyer to have
access to such information and Buyer shall have first obtained authorization or
concurrence from the NRC for the disclosure of such information to such Person.

                  (ii) Except as provided in clause (i) above, the Buyer shall
have the right to receive copies of all documentary information and records
associated with the Assets, subject to the provisions of Section 5.8.

                  (d) Limitations. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Section 5.4, British Energy shall not be required to assist Buyer in
obtaining from the Company: (i) access to confidential personnel records and
medical records except as allowed by applicable Laws, (ii) any information that
British Energy, the Company or the Company's or British Energy's counsel
reasonably believes constitutes or could reasonably be deemed to constitute a
waiver of the attorney-client privilege, or (iii) any information that British
Energy or the Company is under a legal obligation not to supply; provided that
British Energy shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to obtain the consent
to disclose all material information otherwise described in this Section 5.4.

                  (e) Contact with Company Related Persons. Prior to the Closing
Date, Buyer shall not contact any vendors, suppliers, contractors, customers or
employees of British Energy regarding the Facilities, the Assets or the
transactions contemplated in this Agreement without prior written consent of
British Energy, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, and any
such permitted contacts shall be conducted in a manner which will not materially
adversely interfere with the operations or business relationships of the Company
or British Energy with such Persons.

         SECTION 5.5 Certain Notices.

                  (a) British Energy shall notify Buyer of the existence of any
information or matter that becomes known to British Energy, which if in
existence on the date hereof or the Closing Date, would cause or would have a
reasonable likelihood of causing any of the representations or warranties in
Article 3 to be materially untrue or incorrect. In particular, but without
limitation, British Energy shall notify Buyer of (i) information regarding any
actual or asserted Nuclear Liability, Environmental Liability or Environmental
Claim, or (ii) communications from the NRC or any other Governmental Authority
regarding any Permit, Nuclear Law or Environmental Law, in each case with

                                       42

<PAGE>

respect to the Company Group or the Assets. Unless Buyer terminates this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(f), the written notice pursuant to this
Section 5.5(a) shall be deemed to amend the original Schedule or Schedules as of
the date hereof and the Closing Date, to have qualified the representations and
warranties contained in Article 3 as of the date hereof and the Closing Date and
to have cured any misrepresentation or breach of warranty that otherwise might
have existed hereunder by reason of the existence of such matter.

                   (b) Buyer shall notify British Energy of the existence of any
matter that becomes known to Buyer, which if in existence on the date hereof or
the Closing Date, would cause or would have a reasonable likelihood of causing
any of the representations or warranties in Article 4 to be untrue or incorrect.
Unless British Energy terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(g), the
written notice pursuant to this Section 5.5(b) shall be deemed to amend the
original Schedule or Schedules as of the date hereof and the Closing Date, to
have qualified the representations and warranties contained in Article 4 as of
the date hereof and the Closing Date and to have cured any misrepresentation or
breach of warranty that otherwise might have existed hereunder by reason of the
existence of such matter.

                  (c) Buyer shall notify British Energy if any information or
matter comes to its attention which would cause or would have a reasonable
likelihood of causing any of the representations or warranties of British Energy
in Article 3 above to be materially untrue or incorrect. British Energy shall
then comply with Section 5.5(a) with respect to such information.

                  (d) British Energy shall notify the Buyer if any information
or matter comes to its attention which would cause or would have a reasonable
likelihood of causing any of the representations and warranties of Buyer in
Article 4 above to be materially untrue or incorrect. Buyer shall then comply
with Section 5.5(b) with respect to such information.

         SECTION 5.6 Further Assurances; Post-Closing Cooperation.

                  (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
each of the Parties will use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, all action, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including using Commercially Reasonable Efforts
to ensure satisfaction of the conditions precedent to each Party's obligations
hereunder. Notwithstanding anything in the previous sentence to the contrary,
British Energy and Buyer shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to obtain all
Permits necessary for Buyer to acquire the BEUSH Shares.

                  (b) From time to time after the Closing Date, without further
consideration, British Energy will, at its own expense, execute and deliver such
documents to Buyer as Buyer may reasonably request in order to more effectively
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. From time to time
after the Closing Date, without further consideration, Buyer will, at its own
expense, execute and deliver such documents to British Energy as British Energy
may reasonably request in order to more effectively consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

                  (c) After the Closing Date, each Party shall have reasonable
access to the employees of the other Party, for purposes of consultation or
otherwise, to the extent that such access may reasonably be required in

                                       43

<PAGE>

connection with matters relating to or affected by the operations of the Seller
or the Company Group prior to the Closing Date. The Parties agree to cooperate
in connection with any audit, investigation, hearing or inquiry by any
Governmental Authority, litigation or regulatory or other proceeding which may
arise following the Closing Date and which relates to the ownership of the
Company Group or operation of the Assets by the Seller or the Company Group
prior to the Closing Date. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement
to the contrary, each Party shall bear its own expenses, including fees of
attorneys or other representatives, in connection with any such matter described
in this Section 5.6(c) in which the Seller and the Buyer are subjects or parties
or in which they have a material interest.

         SECTION 5.7 Guarantees. Schedule 5.7 identifies each financial or
performance guarantee by British Energy, and by any of its Affiliates, of any
obligations of or related to BEUSH and its Subsidiaries (including without
limitation, the Company) (the "Guarantees"). Buyer shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain promptly the release of the obligations of any
guarantor, or Buyer's substitution for such guarantor, with respect to all
Guarantees identified on Schedule 5.7. Buyer agrees to indemnify, defend and
hold harmless British Energy and its Affiliates, and their respective
Representatives, from and against any and all losses, costs, damages,
obligations, claims, liabilities, expenses and causes of action relating to
resulting from, or arising out of any Guarantee with respect to acts, omissions
or occurrences arising on or after the Closing Date.

         SECTION 5.8 Confidentiality. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, British Energy and Buyer agree that prior to the Closing Date and
after any termination of this Agreement, each will observe the confidentiality
requirements of Section 6.7 of the LLC Agreement; provided, however, that any
party to this Agreement (and any employee, representative, or other agent of any
party to this Agreement) may disclose to any and all persons, without limitation
of any kind, the tax treatment and tax structure of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and all materials of any kind (including opinions
or other tax analyses) that are provided to it relating to such tax treatment
and tax structure; provided, however, that neither party (nor any employee,
representative or other agent thereof) shall disclose (A) any information that
is not relevant to an understanding of the tax treatment of the

transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the identity of any Party
to this Agreement (or its employees, representatives or agents) or other
information that could lead any person to determine such identity or (B) any
information to the extent such disclosure could result in a violation of any
federal or state securities laws.

         SECTION 5.9 Public Announcements. Prior to the Closing Date, the
Parties shall consult with each other before issuing any public announcement,
statement or other disclosure with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby and shall not issue any such public announcement, statement
or other disclosure prior to such consultation and the approval of the other
Party, except as may be required by Law or stock exchange rules. For the
avoidance of doubt, this Section 5.9 shall not restrict Seller from making
private disclosures with respect to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby to members, officials and instrumentalities of the
government of the United Kingdom or to Exelon pursuant to the LLC Agreement.

         SECTION 5.10 Tax Matters.

                  (a) Preparation. The following provisions shall govern the
allocation of responsibility as between Buyer and Seller for certain Tax matters
following the Closing Date:

                  (i) Tax Periods Ending on or Before the Closing Date. Seller
shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed all Tax
Returns for all members of the Company Group other than the Company for all
periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date that are due after the Closing
Date. Seller shall permit Buyer to review and comment on such Tax Returns prior
to filing. If Seller fails to file such Tax Returns prior to the date on which
such Tax Returns are due, Buyer shall be required to file such Tax Returns on
behalf of the Company Group. Seller shall pay or cause to be paid the Taxes of
all members of the Company Group other than the Company with respect to such
periods except to the extent such Taxes are included as current liabilities in
Working Capital, which Buyer shall pay.

                   (ii) Tax Periods Beginning Before and Ending After the
Closing Date. Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to
be filed any Tax Returns of all members of the Company Group other than the
Company for Tax periods which begin before the Closing Date and end after the
Closing Date. Buyer shall permit Seller to review and comment on such Tax
Returns prior to filing and shall consider in good faith any changes reasonably
suggested by Seller. Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid the Taxes of all
members of the Company Group other than the Company with respect to such
periods. Seller shall pay to Buyer within fifteen (15) days after the date on
which Taxes are paid with respect to such periods an amount equal to the portion
of such Taxes that relates to the portion of such Tax period ending on the
Closing Date except to the extent such Taxes are included as current liabilities
in Working Capital, which Buyer shall pay. In the case of Taxes that are payable
with respect to a taxable period that begins before the Closing Date and ends
after the Closing Date, the portion of any such Tax that is allocable to the
portion of the period ending on the Closing Date shall be (A) in the case of
Taxes that are based upon or related to income or gross receipts or sales or use
Tax, determined based on an interim closing of the books as of the close of
business on the day immediately prior to the Closing Date (and for such
purposes, the taxable period of any member of the Company Group other than the
Company shall be deemed to terminate at such time); and (B) in the case of any
Taxes other than gross receipts, sale or use Tax and Taxes based upon or related
to income, deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire period,
multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of calendar days
in the period ending on the day immediately prior to the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire period.

                 (iii) Allocation of Items from Company. The allocation of
British Energy LP's share of all items of the Company's income gain, loss,
deduction or credit for the Company's taxable year which includes the Closing
Date between (x) the portion of the taxable year of BEUSH ending on the day
immediately prior to the Closing Date, and (y) the portion of the taxable year
of BEUSH beginning on the Closing Date, shall be made as if the Company's
taxable year ended on the day immediately prior to the Closing Date.

                 (b) Adjustment for Indemnity Payments. The Parties agree to
treat any indemnity payment made pursuant to this Agreement as an adjustment to
the Purchase Price, unless otherwise required pursuant to a "determination"
within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code.

                                       45

<PAGE>

                   (c) Transfer Taxes. Buyer shall pay fifty percent (50%) and
Seller shall pay fifty percent (50%) of all transfer Taxes resulting from the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Buyer shall prepare and timely file
all Tax Returns or other documentation relating to such transfer Taxes;
provided, however, that to the extent required by Applicable Law, Seller will
join in the execution of any such Tax Returns or other documents relating to
such Taxes. Buyer shall provide Seller with copies of each such Tax Return or
other document at least thirty (30) days prior to the date on which such Tax
Return or other document is required to be filed.

                  (d) Tax Sharing Agreements. On or before the Closing Date,
Seller shall ensure that no Tax indemnity agreement, Tax allocation agreement or
Tax sharing agreement with respect to the Company Group (other than with respect
to the Company or including only members of the Company Group) is in force or
effect and that no member of the Company Group other than the Company shall have
any Liability after the Closing Date under any such agreement.

                   (e) Assistance and Cooperation. Seller and Buyer shall
reasonably cooperate, and shall cause their respective Affiliates, employees and
agents reasonably to cooperate, in preparing and filing all Tax Returns,
including maintaining and making available to each other all records that are
necessary for the preparation of any Tax Returns that each Party is required to
file under this Section 5.10, and in resolving all disputes and audits with
respect to such Tax Returns.

                  (f) Tax Indemnity. Notwithstanding any other provisions of
this Agreement, Sections 5.10(f), 5.10(g) and 7.6 hereof set forth the sole
remedy of Buyer with respect to Losses of the nature described in this Section
5.10(f). Seller shall indemnify and hold the Company Group (other than the
Company) and Buyer harmless from and against (i) any income Taxes imposed on
Seller resulting from the sale of the BEUSH Shares to Buyer and any other
transaction herein contemplated, and (ii) any Liability for Taxes for any period
or portion thereof that ends on or prior to the Closing Date which is imposed on
any member of the Company Group (other than the Company) under Treas. Reg.
Section 1.1502-6 (or under any comparable provision of state or local law
imposing several liability upon members of a consolidated, combined, affiliated
or unitary group).

                  (g) Tax Indemnity Claims. Buyer shall notify Seller within
thirty (30) days of receipt of written notice of any pending or threatened Tax
examination, audit or other administrative or judicial proceeding relating to
any member of the Company Group that could reasonably be expected to result in
an indemnification obligation of Seller arising under Section 5.10(f) or under
Section 7.1 as a result of the breach of any representation or warranty
contained in Sections 3.16, 3.17 or 3.23 ("Contested Taxes"). If Buyer fails to
provide such notice to Seller, Buyer shall not be entitled to indemnification
for such Contested Taxes if the failure shall preclude Seller from contesting
the Tax. Seller shall, at its own expense, control the defense and settlement of
such Tax contest. Buyer shall have the right to participate in the conduct of
any Tax contest relating to the Contested Taxes at its own expense, including
through its own counsel and other professional experts and shall be entitled to
control such Tax contest in the event that Seller fails to do so. Seller shall
consult with Buyer prior to the settlement of any such Tax contest and Seller
shall not settle any such Tax contest if the settlement would have an adverse
tax effect in a taxable period ending after the Closing Date without the consent
of Buyer, which shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided however, that
Seller shall not settle any Tax contest without the consent of Buyer relating to

                                       46

<PAGE>

a determination that the initial Tax Basis of the assets of the Company should
not be increased by the amount of the nonqualified decommissioning liability.

                   (h) Refunds. Seller shall be entitled to all refunds of Taxes
with respect to the Company Group (other than the Company) relating to taxable
periods or portions thereof ending on or before the Closing Date except to the
extent included in the Working Capital adjustment pursuant to Section 2.2 or
attributable to an increase in the initial Tax Basis of the assets of the
Company as a result of a redetermination of the initial purchase price of such
assets attributable to the nonqualified decommissioning liability. Buyer shall,
upon receipt of any refund by Buyer or the Company Group (other than the
Company), pay over to the Seller any such refund or the amount of any such
benefit within five (5) Business Days of the earlier of receipt or entitlement
thereto. Buyer shall, if Seller so requests and at Seller's expense, cause the
relevant entity to file for and obtain any refunds or equivalent amounts to
which Seller is entitled under this Section 5.10(h). Buyer shall permit Seller
to control (at Seller's expense) the prosecution of any such refund claimed and
shall cause the relevant entity to authorize by appropriate power of attorney
such persons as the Seller shall designate to represent such entity with respect
to such refund claimed.

         SECTION 5.11 Intercompany Loans. Schedule 5.11 identifies all loans
between BEUSH and its Subsidiaries (other than the Company) and British Energy
or its affiliates (other than BEUSH and its Subsidiaries) as of the date of this
Agreement (the "Intercompany Loans"). On or prior to the Closing Date, (i) Buyer
shall loan, or caused to be loaned to British Energy LP an amount sufficient to
repay in full to British Energy or its affiliates, and (ii) British Energy LP
shall repay, or cause to be repaid, in full to British Energy or its affiliates,
the net amount of all Intercompany Loans (including any unpaid, accrued interest
and other fees as of the Closing Date) to BEUSH and its Subsidiaries as
identified on Schedule 5.11; provided that, in determining the net amount of
Intercompany Loans to be repaid under this Section 5.11, Buyer may discharge its
obligation to loan or caused to be loaned an amount sufficient to repay or cause
repayment of any Intercompany Loan to British Energy and its affiliates (other
than BEUSH and its Subsidiaries) through netting the amount of any Intercompany
Loans due from British Energy and its affiliates (other than BEUSH and its
Subsidiaries). British Energy shall deliver or make available to Buyer proof of
repayment in full of Intercompany Loans at the Closing.

         SECTION 5.12 Corporate Names.

                   (a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date,
but in any event no later than thirty (30) days from the Closing Date, Buyer
shall cause BEUSH and each of its Subsidiaries to remove or cover the name
"British Energy" and any trademarks, trade names brandmarks, brand names, trade
dress or logos relating to such name from all signs, telephone listings, labels,
stationery, office forms, packaging or other materials of BEUSH or its
Subsidiaries. Thereafter, the Buyer shall neither use nor permit any of BEUSH or
its Subsidiaries to use such names or any trademark, trade name, brandmark,
brand name, trade dress or logo relating or confusingly similar to such names in
connection with the businesses of BEUSH or its Subsidiaries or otherwise. As
soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing, but in any event no later than
ninety (90) days thereafter, the Buyer shall cause each of BEUSH and its
Subsidiaries to amend its certificate of incorporation, partnership agreement,
LLC Agreement, limited liability company agreement and other applicable
documents, subject to any required consent or approval of any other partner or

                                       47

<PAGE>

member, which Buyer shall use its reasonable efforts to obtain, so as to delete
any reference to "British Energy" in its legal name and, within such ninety (90)
day period, to make all required filings with Governmental Authorities to effect
such amendments.

                  (b) Each of the Parties hereto acknowledges and agrees that
the remedy at Law for any breach of the requirements of this Section 5.12 would
be inadequate, and agrees and consents that without intending to limit any
additional remedies that may be available, temporary and permanent injunctive
and other equitable relief may be granted without proof of actual damage or
inadequacy of legal remedy in any proceeding which may be brought to enforce any
of the provisions of this Section 5.12.

         SECTION 5.13 ISRA Clearance. Seller shall obtain at its sole expense
(and deliver a copy to Buyer), pursuant to the New Jersey Industrial Site
Recovery Act, N.J.S.A. 13: lK-6 et seq. and the regulations promulgated
thereunder ("ISRA"), one of the following as required to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement: (i) a letter of non-applicability
of ISRA from the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection ("NJDEP");
(ii) a no further action letter under ISRA; (iii) a remediation agreement
pursuant to ISRA reasonably acceptable to Buyer and Seller, under which the
Buyer will perform or cause to be performed such remediation, subject to any
indemnification from Seller available hereunder with respect to environmental
matters and in connection with which Buyer shall provide or cause to be provided
all necessary financial assurance required by NJDEP (except to the extent NJDEP
affirmatively requires that Seller (x) be so designated as the party responsible
for performance of such remediation and/or (y) provide such financial
assurance); (iv) approval of an application for one of the following exemptions
from ISRA: (A) a "de minimis quantity" exemption, (B) an underground storage
tank exemption, (C) a minimal environmental concern exemption, (D) a
"remediation in progress waiver"; or (v) any other approval or authorization of
the NJDEP reasonably acceptable to Buyer and Seller.

         SECTION 5.14 Reimbursement of Nonqualified Decommissioning Funds. The
NQDF Tax Reimbursement Share of any payments made to the Company for NQDF Tax
Reimbursement shall be for the account of Seller, provided that (i) on or prior
to the Closing Date, Seller shall be permitted to distribute to itself any or
all of the NQDF Tax Reimbursement Share distributed to British Energy LP
(provided that Exelon shall have received an equal distribution to the amount
distributed to British Energy LP), and (ii) with respect to any NQDF Tax
Reimbursement Share not distributed to Seller in accordance with subsection (i)
of this Section 5.14 or received after the Closing Date, and to the extent not
included as an asset in either the Company's Working Capital Adjustment
Statement or BEUSH's Working Capital Adjustment Statement, Buyer shall pay to
Seller an amount equal to such NQDF Tax Reimbursement Share in immediately
available funds, within sixty (60) days of receipt of such payments by the
Company.

         SECTION 5.15 Documents Relating to Liability for Payment of One-Time
Fee for Spent Fuel Disposal. Prior to Closing, Seller shall use Commercially
Reasonable Efforts to obtain all documents from the files of the Company Group
and their counsel that relate to the retained liability of the previous owners
of TMI-1 and Oyster Creek for the payment to DOE of the deferred one-time fee
for spent fuel discharged from TMI-1 and Oyster Creek pursuant to the DOE
Standard Spent Fuel Contracts for those Facilities, including, but not limited

                                       48

<PAGE>

to, the relevant documents from the Company's and its counsel's files from the
negotiations leading to the purchase and sale agreements for the acquisition of
TMI-1 and Oyster Creek and any correspondence with DOE relating to the payment
of the deferred one-time fee for TMI-1 and Oyster Creek. Seller shall promptly
provide Buyer with a copy of any documents obtained pursuant to the immediately
preceding sentence, provided that Seller shall not be required to provide Buyer
with documents or portions of documents containing: (i) any information that the
Company or the Company's counsel reasonably believes constitutes or could
reasonably be deemed to constitute a waiver of the attorney-client privilege as
to the Company, or (ii) any information that Seller or the Company is under a
legal obligation not to disclose to third parties. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, to the extent that documents are withheld from Buyer as a result of
asserting (x) attorney-client privilege or (y) nondisclosure contractual
obligations, Seller shall provide Buyer with a list of such documents citing the
basis upon which each document is withheld (except to the extent such disclosure
itself would violate such privilege or obligations) and, if the basis for
withholding is attorney-client privilege, the name of the party asserting the
privilege; provided that, the assertion of the privilege by the Company or a
third party, including Exelon or its affiliates, shall in no event be deemed to
constitute a breach by Seller of its obligations under this Section 5.15. In
addition, Seller shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to seek waiver of any
attorney-client privilege and to protect against, or cause to be protected
against, such documents from being destroyed or lost during the Interim Period.

         SECTION 5.16 Prohibited Transactions. From and after the date hereof,
none of the Seller nor any member of the Company Group, nor their respective
officers, directors, employees, affiliates, stockholders, representatives or
agents, nor anyone acting on behalf of any of them, shall, directly or
indirectly, encourage, solicit, engage in discussions or negotiations with, or
provide any non-public information to, any person or entity (other than Buyer
and its representatives) concerning any sale of BEUSH Shares or similar
transaction involving the Company or the Assets (collectively "Prohibited
Transactions") unless this Agreement is terminated pursuant to and in accordance
with Article 8 hereof; provided that, Seller may provide FPL with a copy of this
Agreement, the Waiver Letter, dated as of the date of this Agreement, from Buyer
to Seller relating to the Agreement, and the notice from Buyer referred to in
the Recitals, subject to the requirements of the Confidentiality Agreement.

         SECTION 5.17 Financial Statements. (a) Within thirty (30) days after
the end of each calendar month during the Interim Period, the Seller shall
provide to the Buyer consolidated financial statements of the Company Group,
including a consolidated balance sheet as of the end of such calendar month and
income and cash-flow statements for the one-month period then ending. Except as
set forth on Schedule 5.17, such financial statements shall (a) be in accordance
with the books and records of the Company Group, (b) be prepared in accordance
with GAAP consistently applied throughout the periods covered thereby (except
for the absence of footnotes and normal year-end adjustments), and (c) present
fairly and accurately in accordance with GAAP the assets, liabilities
(including, without limitation, all reserves) and financial condition of the
Company Group as of the respective dates thereof and the results of operations
for the periods covered thereby.

                  (b) Seller shall deliver to Buyer, as soon as practicable
after they become available to Seller, the audited consolidated balance sheets
of each of BEUSH, BEUILLC and British Energy, LP, in each case as of December

                                       49

<PAGE>

31, 2002 and the related audited consolidated statements of income and cash
flows for the year ended December 31, 2002.

         SECTION 5.18 Transmission. During the Interim Period, Seller shall use
Commercially Reasonable Efforts to cause the Company to obtain and/or maintain
any and all necessary transmission rights and services required in order to
deliver the energy and capacity output of the Facilities to the purchasers of
such output.

         SECTION 5.19 Risk of Loss. Except as otherwise provided in this Section
5.19 and Article 7, during the Interim Period all risk of loss or damage to the
property included in the Assets shall be borne by the Seller. If during the
Interim Period the Assets are damaged by fire or other casualty (each such
event, an "Event of Loss") or are taken by a Governmental Authority by exercise
of the power of eminent domain (each, a "Taking"), the following provisions
shall apply:

                  (a) Upon the occurrence of (i) any one or more Events of Loss,
as a result of which the aggregate costs to restore, repair or replace, less any
insurance proceeds received or payable to the Company in connection with such
Event or Events of Loss (provided that any insurance proceeds received or
payable in connection with the Event or Events of Loss are either used to
restore, repair or replace such Event or Events of Loss) are reasonably
estimated to be equal to or less than $10,000,000, and/or (ii) any one or more
Takings, as a result of which the aggregate condemnation proceeds equal an
amount reasonably estimated to be equal to or less than $10,000,000, shall have
no effect on the transactions contemplated hereby; provided that any
condemnation proceeds received or payable in connection with the Taking or
Takings shall be excluded from the calculation of Company Working Capital at
Closing;

                  (b) Upon the occurrence of (i) any one or more Events of Loss,
as a result of which the aggregate costs to restore, repair or replace, less any
insurance proceeds received or payable to the Company in connection with such
Event or Events of Loss (provided that any insurance proceeds received or
payable in connection with the Event or Events of Loss are used to restore,
repair or replace such Event or Events of Loss) are reasonably estimated to be
greater than $10,000,000, and/or (ii) any one or more Takings, as a result of
which the aggregate condemnation proceeds are reasonably estimated to be greater
than $10,000,000 (a "Major Loss"), Seller shall have, in the case of a Major
Loss relating to one or more Events of Loss, the option, exercised by notice to
the Buyer, to cause the Company to restore, repair or replace the affected
Assets. If the Seller elects not to cause the Company to restore, repair or
replace the Assets affected by a Major Loss, or such Major Loss is the result of
one or more Takings, the provisions of Section 5.19(c) will apply;

                 (c) In the event that the Seller elects not to cause the
Company to restore, repair or replace a Major Loss, or in the event that the
Seller, having elected to cause the Company to repair, replace or restore the
Major Loss, fails to cause the Company to complete such repair, replacement or
restoration prior to the Closing Date, or in the event that a Major Loss is the
result of one or more Takings, then the Parties shall, within thirty (30) days
following the Seller's election not to cause the Company to restore, repair or
replace, failure to complete, or the occurrence of such Takings, as the case may
be, negotiate in good faith an equitable adjustment in the Purchase Price to
reflect the impact of the Major Loss, as mitigated by any repair, replacement or
restoration work actually completed by the Company, on the Assets, and proceed

                                       50

<PAGE>

to the Closing at a Purchase Price so adjusted. To assist the Buyer in its
evaluation of any and all Events of Loss, the Seller shall provide the Buyer
such access to the Assets and such information as the Buyer may reasonably
request in connection therewith; and

                  (d) In the event that the Parties fail to reach agreement on
an equitable adjustment of the Purchase Price within the thirty (30) days
provided in Section 5.19(c), then the Buyer shall have the right to elect,
exercisable by notice to the Seller within fifteen (15) days immediately
following the expiration of the thirty (30) day period, to (i) proceed with the
consummation of the transaction at the Closing, with a reduction in the Purchase
Price, consistent with the Seller's last offer of equitable adjustment thereto
as contemplated by the penultimate sentence of Section 5.19(c) communicated to
the Buyer, in which event the Seller shall assign over or deliver to the Buyer
at the Closing all condemnation proceeds or insurance proceeds that the Seller
receives, or to which the Seller become entitled by virtue of the Event of Loss
or Taking with respect to the Assets, less any costs and expenses reasonably
incurred by the Seller in connection with such Events of Loss or Taking or in
obtaining such condemnation proceeds or insurance proceeds, and less the
reduction in the Purchase Price made pursuant to this clause (i), or (ii) submit
the matter to dispute resolution pursuant to Section 9.16 to determine the
adjustment, if any, in the Purchase Price, which determination shall be binding
on all Parties. If the Buyer fails to make the election within the fifteen (15)
day period described in the preceding sentence, the Buyer will be deemed to have
made the election to proceed with the Closing under clause (i) hereof.

                  (e) For the avoidance of doubt, any Event of Loss which has
been repaired, replaced or restored by Seller pursuant to Section 5.19(b) or any
Taking or Event of Loss which has been the subject of a purchase price reduction
pursuant to Section 5.19(c) or 5.19(d) shall be disregarded for purposes of
determining whether Seller has breached any representation or warranty
hereunder, including for purposes of Section 6.2(a) and Section 7.1(i).

                                   ARTICLE 6

                                 Indemnification

         SECTION 7.1 Indemnification by Seller. From and after the Closing,
subject to the other terms and limitations set forth in this Agreement, Seller
shall, indemnify, defend, reimburse and hold harmless Buyer, its Affiliates
(including the Company Group) and their respective directors, officers, partners
and employees (each such Person, a "Buyer Indemnified Party" and, collectively,
the "Buyer Indemnified Parties"), from and against any and all Losses actually
incurred by any Buyer Indemnified Party (i) for any breach of the
representations and warranties contained in Article 3 or in any certificate
delivered by Seller at the Closing with respect to such representations and
warranties, (ii) for any breach of the covenants or obligations of Seller under
this Agreement, (iii) for any Seller Ownership Period Environmental Liability,
or (iv) for any Pre-Closing ERISA Liability.

         SECTION 7.2 Indemnification by Buyer. From and after the Closing,
subject to the other terms and limitations set forth in this Agreement, Buyer
shall indemnify, defend, reimburse and hold harmless Seller, its Affiliates and
their respective directors, officers, partners and employees (each such Person,
a "Seller Indemnified Party" and, collectively, the "Seller Indemnified
Parties"), from and against any and all Losses actually incurred by any Seller
Indemnified Party (i) for any breach of Buyer's representations or warranties
made in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered by Buyer at the Closing
with respect to such representations and warranties, or (ii) for any breach of
the covenants or obligations of Buyer under this Agreement.

         SECTION 7.3 Limitations on Indemnity.

                  (a) Except for the specific indemnity provided in Section 7.7
of this Agreement, anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding,
in no event shall Seller ever be required to indemnify any Buyer Indemnified

                                       54

<PAGE>

Party for Losses pursuant to Section 7.1 or any of the other provisions of this
Agreement, including Section 5.10 (or to pay any other amount in connection with
or with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement) (i) until the aggregate amount of all such Losses shall have exceeded
$5 million (the "Deductible"), whereupon only Losses in excess of the Deductible
shall be subject to indemnification hereunder; provided, however, that any
individual Loss of less than $100,000 that is otherwise subject to
indemnification hereunder shall be disregarded in determining whether any Buyer
Indemnified Party has incurred Losses up to or exceeding the Deductible, or (ii)
in an amount exceeding, in the aggregate, 75% of the Adjusted Purchase Price.

                  (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, Seller and Buyer agree that the recovery by any Indemnified Party of
any damages suffered or incurred by such Indemnified Party as a result of any
breach by another Party of any of its obligations under this Agreement shall be
limited to the actual damages suffered or incurred by an Indemnified Party as a
result of the breach by the breaching Party of its obligations hereunder, and in
no event shall the breaching Party be liable to an Indemnified Party for any
indirect, consequential, special, exemplary or punitive damages (including any
damages on account of lost profits or opportunities or lost or delayed
generation) suffered or incurred by an Indemnified Party as a result of the
breach by the breaching Party of any of its obligations hereunder.

         SECTION 7.4 Indemnity Procedures.

                  (a) If a claim by a third party is made against a Seller
Indemnified Party or a Buyer Indemnified Party (any such person, an "Indemnified
Party") or an Indemnified Party shall otherwise learn of an assertion or of a
potential claim, and if such Indemnified Party intends to seek indemnity with
respect thereto under this Article 7 (other than with respect to an indemnity
arising out of the breach of any representation or warranty contained in
Sections 3.16, 3.17 or 3.23, which shall be governed by Section 5.10(g)), such
Indemnified Party shall promptly furnish written notice of such claim (in
reasonable detail and including the factual basis for such claim and, to the
extent known, the amount thereof) to the Party against whom indemnity is sought
(such Party, in such capacity, the "Indemnifying Party"). Thereafter, the
Indemnified Party will deliver to the Indemnifying Party, promptly after the
Indemnified Party's receipt thereof, copies of all material notices and
documents (including court papers) received or transmitted by the Indemnified
Party relating to such claim. The failure of the Indemnified Party to deliver
prompt written notice of a claim shall not affect the indemnity obligations of
the Indemnifying Party hereunder, except to the extent the Indemnifying Party
was actually disadvantaged by such delay in delivery of notice of such claim.
The Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice
to provide written notice to the Indemnified Party acknowledging unconditionally
its obligations to indemnify the Indemnified Party with respect to such claim
(an "Acceptance Notice") and if it delivers an Acceptance Notice, to elect to
undertake, conduct and control (through counsel of its own choosing and at its
own expense), the settlement or defense of such claim, and the Indemnified Party
shall cooperate with it in connection therewith. If the Indemnifying Party does
not assume the conduct and control of such settlement and defense, it shall have
the right to participate in the settlement or defense of such claim, and the
Indemnified Party shall cooperate with it in connection therewith. If the
Indemnifying Party elects to undertake, conduct and control the settlement or
defense of such claim, the Indemnifying Party shall permit the Indemnified Party
to participate in such settlement or defense through counsel chosen by such
Indemnified Party (but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be borne by
such Indemnified Party). So long as the Indemnifying Party, at the Indemnifying
Party's cost and expense, (i) has undertaken the defense of, and assumed full

                                       55

<PAGE>

responsibility for all indemnified liabilities with respect to, such claim, (ii)
is reasonably contesting such claim in good faith through appropriate
proceedings, and (iii) has taken such action (including the posting of a bond,
deposit or other security) as may be necessary to prevent any action to
foreclose a lien against or attachment of the property of the Indemnified Party
for payment of such claim, the Indemnified Party shall not pay or settle any
such claim; provided, however, that, the Indemnified Party shall have the right
to pay or settle any such claim if it has waived in writing any right to
indemnity by the Indemnifying Party for such claim; and, provided, further,
that, if within thirty (30) days after the receipt of the Indemnified Party's
notice of a claim of indemnity under this Section 7.4(a), the Indemnifying Party
does not notify the Indemnified Party that it elects (at the Indemnifying
Party's cost and expense) to undertake the defense thereof and assume full
responsibility for all indemnified liabilities with respect thereto, or gives
such notice and thereafter fails to contest such claim in good faith or to
prevent action to foreclose a lien against or attachment of the Indemnified
Party's property as contemplated above, the Indemnified Party shall have the
right to contest, settle or compromise such claim and the Indemnified Party
shall not thereby waive any right to indemnity for such claim under this
Agreement.

                  (b) Any claim on account of Losses for which indemnification
is provided under this Agreement which does not involve a claim of a third party
will be asserted by prompt written notice (setting forth in reasonable detail
the facts or circumstances that allegedly give rise to such claim and, to the
extent known, the amount thereof) given by the Indemnified Party to the
Indemnifying Party from whom such indemnification is sought. The failure or
delay by any Indemnified Party to so notify the Indemnifying Party will not
relieve the Indemnifying Party from any liability which it may have to such
Indemnified Party under this Agreement, except to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party is actually disadvantaged by such delay in delivery of notice
of such claim.

                 (c) In the event of payment in full by an Indemnifying Party to
any Indemnified Party in connection with any claim (an "Indemnified Claim"),
such Indemnifying Party will be subrogated to and will stand in the place of
such Indemnified Party as to any events or circumstances in respect of which
such Indemnified Party may have any right or claim relating to such Indemnified
Claim against any claimant or plaintiff asserting such Indemnified Claim or
against any other Person. Such Indemnified Party will cooperate with such
Indemnifying Party in a reasonable manner, and at the cost and expense of such
Indemnifying Party, in prosecuting any subrogated right or claim.

         SECTION 7.5 Procedural Requirements for Environmental Claims by Buyer.
The provisions of this Section 7.5 are in addition to, and not in limitation of,
the procedures set forth in Section 7.4 (which shall be deemed superseded to the
extent inconsistent with this Section 7.5). Buyer will provide Seller with
prompt notice describing in reasonable detail any condition or claim in respect
of which Losses arising out of a breach of the representations and warranties in
Section 3.20 or any Seller Ownership Period Environmental Liability are or may
be incurred by any Buyer Indemnified Party; provided, however, that if such
notice is not given within a sufficient period of time or in sufficient detail
to apprise Seller of the nature of any such condition or claim (in each instance
taking into account the facts and circumstances with respect thereto), the costs
and expenses incurred by such Buyer Indemnified Party in connection with such
condition or claim shall not constitute Losses to the extent that Seller's
position is actually prejudiced as a result thereof. Seller will have the option
to participate, at their own expense, in the resolution of any such conditions

                                       56

or claims (and, in any event, Buyer will consult in good faith with Seller in
respect of the resolution of any such conditions or claims). Buyer will keep
Seller apprised of the status of and any action by or on behalf of Buyer or any
member of the Company Group or their respective Affiliates with respect to all
such conditions or claims. If Seller is not given, within a sufficient period of
time or in sufficient detail, information necessary to reasonably apprise Seller
of the status of and any action by or on behalf of Buyer, any member of the
Company Group or their respective Affiliates with respect to any such conditions
or claims (in each instance taking into account the facts and circumstances with
respect thereto), the costs and expenses incurred by Buyer or any member of the
Company Group in connection with such condition or claim shall not constitute
Losses to the extent that Seller's position is actually prejudiced as a result
thereof.

         SECTION 7.6 Survival and Time Limitation. The terms and provisions of
this Agreement shall survive the Closing of the transactions contemplated
hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, after Closing, any claim by any Buyer
Indemnified Party that Seller is liable to such Buyer Indemnified Party under
the terms of this Agreement for breach of any representations and warranties of
Seller must be given to Seller on or prior to the date that is twelve (12)
months after the Closing Date, except for (i) any claims for breach of the
representations and warranties of Seller in Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.10, 3.11,
3.12, 3.16, 3.17 and 3.23, and any claims made by Buyer pursuant to Section
5.10, which must be given to Seller (or not at all) on or prior to the date that
is ninety (90) days after the expiration of all applicable statutes of
limitations with respect to the matters covered thereby, (ii) any claim for
breach of the representations and warranties of Seller in Sections 3.7, 3.8, 3.9
and 3.36, which shall survive indefinitely, (iii) except as described in clause
(iv) of this Section 7.6, any claim for breach of the representations and
warranties of Seller in Section 3.20, which must be given to Seller on or prior
to the date that is twenty-four (24) months after the Closing Date, (iv) any
claim for breach of Section 3.20 relating to the matters described in Section
7.7 hereof, which shall survive until the later of the complete and conclusive
resolution of any such matters with any applicable Governmental Authority or the
payment in full of any amounts owed to each Buyer Indemnified Party under
Section 7.7, and (v) any claim for breach of Section 3.37, which shall survive
for the initial license term of each respective Facility. Notwithstanding the
initial sentence of this Section 7.6, after Closing, any claim by any Seller
Indemnified Party that Buyer is liable to such Seller Indemnified Party for a
breach of any representations and warranties of Buyer must be given to Buyer on
or prior to the date that is twelve (12) months after the Closing Date. All
covenants and other agreements of Seller and Buyer contained in this Agreement
that by their terms are to be performed after the Closing shall survive until
the expiration of all applicable statutes of limitations with respect to the
matters covered thereby.

         SECTION 7.7 Specific Indemnity by Seller. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, from and after the Closing, Seller shall indemnify, defend, reimburse
and hold harmless each Buyer Indemnified Party from and against any and all
Losses actually incurred by any Buyer Indemnified Party that were incurred by
such Buyer Indemnified Party as a result of the "Fish Kill" described in
Schedule 3.20 hereof (including without limitation any and all Losses actually
incurred in connection with the allegations set forth in Schwartz v. AmerGen
Energy Company, Exelon Generation Company, British Energy Company et al.,
Superior Court of New Jersey, Docket L-2075-03 as filed on July 25, 2003, and
any subsequent amendments to the allegations related to the "Fish Kill", as

                                       57

<PAGE>

described in Schedule 3.20 hereof). In connection with making an Indemnified
Claim, the Parties shall follow the Indemnification Procedures described in
Sections 7.4 and 7.5 above.

         SECTION 7.8 Further Indemnity Limitations. The amount of any
indemnifiable Loss shall be reduced (i) to the extent any Indemnified Party
actually receives any insurance proceeds with respect to such Loss, (ii) to take
into account any net Tax benefit arising from the recognition of the Loss, (iii)
to take into account any payment actually received by an Indemnified Party from
a third party with respect to such Loss, and (iv) to the extent of any Loss that
is attributable to a determination that the initial Tax Basis of the assets of
the Company should not be increased by the amount of the nonqualified
decommissioning liability.

         SECTION 7.9 Sole and Exclusive Remedy. From and after the Closing,
except as provided in Section 5.10 of this Agreement for any claim in respect of
Taxes, the indemnification provisions of this Article 7 shall be the sole and
exclusive post-Closing remedy of each Party (including the Seller Indemnified
Parties and the Buyer Indemnified Parties) (i) for any breach of any Party's
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement, or (ii) otherwise with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby. In furtherance of the foregoing, each Party hereby waives,
to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, any and all other rights,
claims and causes of action it or any of its Affiliates may have against another
Party hereunder with respect thereto.

                                     Termination

         SECTION 8.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time
prior to the Closing:

                  (a) by mutual written agreement of British Energy and Buyer;

                  (b) by British Energy or Buyer if the Closing shall not have
been consummated on or before the day that is six (6) months after the date
hereof, unless the reason that the Closing has not occurred shall be the failure
of the Party seeking to terminate this Agreement to fulfill its obligations
hereunder; provided, however, (i) that if the reason the Closing has not
occurred is because Buyer Regulatory Approvals or British Energy Regulatory
Approvals have not been obtained and Commercially Reasonable Efforts are being
undertaken to obtain such regulatory approvals by the Party responsible for
obtaining such regulatory approvals, the reference to "the day that is six (6)
months after the date hereof' in this Section 8.1(b) shall be extended for an
additional six (6) months and neither British Energy nor Buyer may terminate
this Agreement during such extended period so long as such Commercially
Reasonable Efforts continue, or (ii) that if the reason the Closing has not
occurred is because FPL Energy Nuclear Mid-Atlantic, LLC or its Affiliates
(collectively "FPL") is attempting to prevent the transfer of the Seller's
indirect interest in the Company and Seller has timely commenced arbitration
proceedings or other legal action with FPL regarding FPL's action or inaction
with respect to such transfer, the reference to "the day that is six (6) months
after the date hereof" in this Section 8.1(b) shall be extended for an

                                       58

<PAGE>

additional six (6) months and neither British Energy nor Buyer may terminate
this Agreement during such extended period;

                  (c) by British Energy or Buyer if consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby would violate any nonappealable final order,
decree or judgment of any court or governmental body having competent
jurisdiction;

                  (d) by Buyer if any Buyer Regulatory Approvals shall have been
denied (and a petition for rehearing, a petition for review or refiling of an
application initially denied without prejudice shall also have been denied) or
shall have been granted subject to terms and conditions that would likely have a
Material Adverse Effect, and all appeals of any such actions shall have been
taken and been unsuccessful;

                  (e) by British Energy if any British Energy Regulatory
Approvals shall have been denied (and a petition for rehearing, a petition for
review or refiling of an application initially denied without prejudice shall
also have been denied) or shall have been granted subject to terms and
conditions that would likely have a Material Adverse Effect, and all appeals of
any such actions shall have been taken and been unsuccessful;

                  (f) by Buyer if there has been a material violation or breach
by British Energy of any covenant, representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement and such violation or breach is not cured by the earlier of the
Closing Date or the date thirty (30) days after receipt by British Energy of
written notice specifying particularly such violation or breach, and such
violation or breach has not been waived by Buyer;

                  (g) by British Energy if there has been a material violation
or breach by Buyer of any covenant, representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement and such violation or breach is not cured by the earlier of the
Closing Date or the date thirty (30) days after receipt by Buyer of written
notice specifying particularly such violation or breach, and such violation or
breach has not been waived by British Energy;

         The Party desiring to terminate this Agreement shall give notice of
such termination to the other Party in the manner set forth in Section 8.2.

         SECTION 8.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of this
Agreement by Seller or Buyer pursuant to Section 8.1, written notice thereof
shall promptly be given by the terminating Party to the other Parties, and this
Agreement shall thereupon terminate provided, however, the termination of this
Agreement shall not release any party from liability for any breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant contained herein prior to the date of
termination. Following any such termination, Buyer and Seller will continue to
be bound by the obligations set forth in Sections 5.8 and 5.9 and Article 7. If
this Agreement is terminated as provided herein, all filings, applications and
other submissions made to any Governmental Authority shall, to the extent
practicable, be withdrawn from the Governmental Authority to which they were
made.

         SECTION 8.3 Remedies.

                  (a) Seller's Remedies. (i) Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, upon the failure by Buyer to fulfill any undertaking or commitment
provided for herein on the part of Buyer that is required to be fulfilled on or

                                       59

<PAGE>

prior to the Closing Date, Seller, at its sole option, may enforce specific
performance of this Agreement or pursue any rights or remedies available at law
or in equity.

                  (b) Seller's Remedy for Termination Pursuant to Section
8.1(b), 8.l(c), 8.1(d) or 8.1(e). In the event that (i) this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to any of Section 8.1(b) through 8.1(e), (ii) such
termination resulted from a failure to obtain applicable regulatory approvals,
and (iii) such failure is attributable to the announcement or consummation after
the date hereof of any transaction pursuant to which Buyer or any of its
Affiliates would acquire any electric generation facilities or uncommitted
electric generating capacity, Buyer shall pay to Seller, no later than five (5)
days after any such termination, by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to an account designated in writing by Seller, an amount equal to $8,295,000.

                  (c) Buyer's Remedies. Except as set forth in Section 8.3(d)
hereof, notwithstanding anything herein provided to the contrary, upon failure
of Seller to fulfill any undertaking or commitment provided for herein on the
part of Seller that is required to be fulfilled on or prior to the Closing Date,
Buyer, at its sole option, may enforce specific performance of this Agreement or
pursue any rights or remedies available at law or in equity.

                  (d) Buyer's Remedy for Termination Pursuant to Section 8.1(b).
In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Buyer or Seller pursuant to
Section 8.1(b) and the Closing shall not have been consummated as a result of
FPL's material interference with the transactions contemplated hereby, Buyer's
sole and exclusive remedy for such termination shall be a termination payment in
the amount of $8,295,000 (the "Break Up Fee"), payable by Seller to Buyer by
wire transfer no later than five (5) days after the consummation of any sale of
the BEUSH Shares which directly or indirectly transfers the Company Group's
ownership interest in the Company to FPL or an Affiliate thereof; provided that,
in the event that, following such a termination of this Agreement, Seller has
not consummated such a sale of its direct or indirect ownership interests in the
Company within one (1) year of the date of this Agreement, Seller shall make a
payment to Buyer, within three (3) Business Days after the first anniversary of
the date hereof, in the amount of $1,000,000, such amount to be deducted from
any payment of the Break Up Fee upon consummation of such a sale within three
(3) years from the date of this Agreement. In the event such a sale of Seller's
direct or indirect ownership interests in the Company is not consummated within
three (3) years from the date of this Agreement, Seller shall have no further
liability to Buyer for termination pursuant to Section 8.1(b). The Parties agree
that Buyer's actual damages as a result of such termination would be extremely
difficult to calculate, and that such payment constitutes liquidated damages for
the consequences of such termination and is not a penalty.

                   (e) Election of Remedies. (i) Except as set forth in Section
8.3(d) hereof, if any Party elects to pursue singularly any right or remedy
available to it under this Section 8.3, then such Party may at any time
thereafter cease pursuing that right or remedy and elect to pursue any other
right or remedy available to it under this Section 8.3. All rights and remedies
hereunder (except those set forth in Section 8.3(d)) shall be cumulative. Except
as otherwise provided by Applicable Law, no delay or forbearance by a Party in
the exercise or enforcement of any right or remedy hereunder shall be deemed a
waiver by such party of its right hereunder to exercise or enforce such right or
remedy.

                  (a) Any provisions of this Agreement may be amended or waived
prior to the Closing Date if, and only if, such amendment or waiver is in
writing and signed, in the case of an amendment, by Buyer and British Energy or

                   (b) No failure or delay by either Party in exercising any

         SECTION 9.4 Successors and Assigns. The rights and obligations of the

respective successors and permitted assigns.

         SECTION 9.6 Counterparts; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be signed

possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated

or, to the extent permitted by Law, in such Federal court. Each of the Parties
agree that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive
and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any
other manner provided by Law.

                  (b) Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any
objection which may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit,
action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the

OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT.

                  (c) EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO

         SECTION 9.17 Change in Law. If and to the extent that any Laws or
regulations that govern any aspect of this Agreement shall change, so as to make
any aspect of this transaction unlawful or unpracticable, then the Parties shall
endeavor, to the extent reasonably possible, to enter into such amendments to
this Agreement as may be reasonably necessary for this Agreement to accommodate
any such legal or regulatory changes, without materially changing the overall
benefits or consideration expected hereunder by either Party.

         SECTION 9.18 Time is of the Essence; Action on a Business Day. Time is
