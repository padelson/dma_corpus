                     ARTICLE II -- THE CLOSING TRANSACTIONS

         SECTION 2.1       PRE-CLOSING ESTIMATES OF CERTAIN AMOUNTS. Not later
than three days before the Closing, the Seller and the Purchaser will in good
faith jointly estimate, on a reasonable basis using the Company's then available
financial information, the Cash Amount (such estimate is referred to as the
"ESTIMATED CASH AMOUNT"), the Indebtedness Amount (such estimate is referred to
as the "ESTIMATED INDEBTEDNESS AMOUNT") and the Net Working Capital Amount (such
estimate is referred to as the "ESTIMATED NET WORKING CAPITAL AMOUNT) each as of
the close of business on the day before Closing Date; provided, however, that if
the Seller and the Purchaser cannot agree on an estimate of any of the foregoing
amounts, such estimate will be deemed to be equal to the average of the Seller's
and the Purchaser's good faith determinations thereof. The "ESTIMATED CLOSING
COMMON VALUE" means an amount equal to (A) $121.0 million, (B) plus the amount
by which the Estimated Cash Amount exceeds $8.0 million or minus the amount by
which $8.0 million exceeds the Estimated Cash Amount, (C) less the Estimated
Indebtedness Amount, and (D) plus the amount by which the Estimated Net Working
Capital Amount exceeds the Top Collar Amount or minus the amount by which the
Bottom Collar Amount exceeds the Estimated Net Working Capital Amount or zero if
the Estimated Net Working Capital Amount is between the Top Collar Amount and
the Bottom Collar Amount.

         SECTION 2.2       STOCK PURCHASE. On the basis of the representations,
warranties, covenants, and agreements herein, and subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions set forth herein and the terms hereof, at the Closing,
the Purchaser shall purchase from the Seller, and the Seller shall sell and
transfer to the Purchaser, the Acquired Stock, free and clear of any Liens, for
a purchase price equal to the Estimated Closing Common Value (the "PURCHASE
PRICE") by delivery to the Seller of (A) a subordinated promissory note issued
by the Purchaser in the form of EXHIBIT A attached hereto in a principal amount
equal to $10 million (the "SELLER NOTE A"), (B) if the Seller Note B Amount is
greater than zero, a subordinated promissory note issued by the Purchaser in the
form of EXHIBIT I attached hereto in a principal amount equal to the Seller Note
B Amount (the "SELLER NOTE B") and (C) cash for the balance of the Purchase
Price by wire transfer or other delivery of immediately available funds (the
"ESTIMATED CASH PORTION").

         SECTION 2.3       CLOSING TRANSACTIONS.

                  (a)      CLOSING. The closing of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (the "CLOSING") shall take place at the offices of Kirkland &
Ellis, 200 East Randolph Drive, Chicago, Illinois 60601, commencing at 10:00
a.m. on the third business day following the satisfaction or waiver of all
conditions to the obligations of the Parties to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby (other than conditions with respect to actions the
respective Parties will take at the Closing itself), or at such other place or
on such other date as may be mutually agreeable to the


                                       10
<PAGE>


Purchaser and the Seller; provided that in any event, if the Purchaser's senior
lenders require that the Closing take place at the offices of their attorneys,
the Parties agree that the Closing shall take place at such offices. The date
and time of the Closing are herein referred to as the "CLOSING DATE."

                  (b)      CLOSING TRANSACTIONS.  At the Closing:

                           (i)      the Seller shall deliver to the Purchaser,
         free and clear of any Liens, one or more certificates representing the
         Acquired Stock, duly endorsed in blank or accompanied by stock powers
         or other instruments of transfer duly executed in blank, and bearing
         or accompanied by all requisite stock transfer stamps;

                           (ii)     the Purchaser shall deliver to the Seller
         the Estimated Cash Portion in immediately available funds;

                           (iii)    the Purchaser shall deliver to the Seller
         the Seller Notes;

                           (iv)     the Purchaser shall cause the Company to
         repay all Indebtedness outstanding as of the close of business on the
         day before the Closing Date owed to the Seller or the Parent or their
         Affiliates (other than the Acquired Companies), as the case may be;
         and

                           (v)      each Party shall deliver the opinions,
         certificates and other documents and instruments required to be
         delivered by or on behalf of such Party under Article III.

         SECTION 2.4       POST-CLOSING ADJUSTMENTS.

                  (a)      POST-CLOSING DETERMINATION. Within 90 days after the
Closing Date, the Purchaser and its auditors will conduct a review (the "CLOSING
REVIEW") of the Cash Amount, the Indebtedness Amount and the Net Working Capital
Amount and will prepare and deliver to the Seller a computation of such amounts
(the "DRAFT COMPUTATIONS"). The Draft Computation shall be prepared from the
Company's books and records, which in return shall be prepared in accordance
with GAAP, consistently applied. The Purchaser and its auditors will make
available to the Seller and its auditors all records and work papers used in
preparing the Draft Computations. If the Seller disagrees with the computation
of the Cash Amount, the Indebtedness Amount or the Net Working Capital Amount
reflected in the Draft Computations, the Seller may, within 30 days after
receipt of the Draft Computations, deliver a notice (an "OBJECTION NOTICE") to
the Purchaser setting forth the Seller's calculation of the Cash Amount, the
Indebtedness Amount and the Net Working Capital Amount. The Purchaser and the
Seller will use reasonable best efforts to resolve any disagreements as to the
computation of the Cash Amount, the Indebtedness Amount and the Net Working
Capital Amount, but if they do not obtain a final resolution within 30 days
after the Purchaser has received the Objection Notice, the Purchaser and the
Seller will jointly retain an independent accounting firm of recognized national
standing (the "FIRM") to resolve any remaining disagreements. If the Purchaser
and the Seller are unable to agree on the choice of the Firm, then the Firm will
be a "big-five" accounting firm (or a successor) selected by lot (after
excluding one firm designated by the Purchaser and one firm designated by the
Seller). The Purchaser and the Seller will direct the Firm


                                       11
<PAGE>


to render a determination within 30 days of its retention and the Purchaser, the
Seller, and their respective agents will cooperate with the Firm during its
engagement. The Firm will consider only those items and amounts in the Draft
Computations set forth in the Objection Notice which the Purchaser and the
Seller are unable to resolve. The Purchaser and the Seller shall each make a
submission to the Firm promptly (and in any event within 20 days after the
Firm's engagement), which submission shall contain such Party's computation of
the Cash Amount, the Indebtedness Amount and the Net Working Capital Amount and
information, arguments, and support for such Party's position. The Firm shall
review such submissions and base its determination solely on them. In resolving
any disputed item, the Firm may not assign a value to any item greater than the
greatest value for such item claimed by either party or less than the smallest
value for such item claimed by either party. The Firm's determination will be
based on the definition of the Cash Amount, the Indebtedness Amount and the Net
Working Capital Amount included herein. The determination of the Firm will be
conclusive and binding upon the Parties. The Seller and the Purchaser shall each
bear 50% of the costs and expenses of the Firm. The Cash Amount, the
Indebtedness Amount and the Net Working Capital Amount, as finally determined
pursuant to this Section 2.4(a), is referred to herein as the "ACTUAL CASH
AMOUNT," the "ACTUAL INDEBTEDNESS AMOUNT" and the "ACTUAL NET WORKING CAPITAL
AMOUNT," respectively. The "ACTUAL CLOSING COMMON VALUE" means an amount equal
to (A) $121.0 million, (B) plus the amount by which the Actual Cash Amount
exceeds $8.0 million or minus the amount by which $8.0 million exceeds the
Actual Cash Amount, (C) less the Actual Indebtedness Amount, and (D) plus the
amount by which the Actual Net Working Capital Amount exceeds the Top Collar
Amount or minus the amount by which the Bottom Collar Amount exceeds the Actual
Net Working Capital Amount or zero if the Actual Net Working Capital Amount is
between the Top Collar Amount and the Bottom Collar Amount.

                  (b)      POST-CLOSING ADJUSTMENT.


                           (i)      PAYMENT BY THE PURCHASER. If the Actual
         Closing Common Value is greater than the Estimated Closing Common
         Value, the Purchaser will, within five (5) business days after the
         determination thereof, pay to the Seller an amount equal to the sum of
         (A) the Actual Closing Common Value MINUS the Estimated Closing Common
         Value PLUS (B) a fee on such difference from the Closing Date to the
         date of payment calculated using a rate equal to the "Prime Rate" as
         listed in THE WALL STREET JOURNAL (Midwest Edition) on the Closing
         Date (the "PRIME RATE"). Such payment will be made by wire transfer or
         delivery of other immediately available funds.

                           (ii)     PAYMENT BY THE SELLER. If the Actual
         Closing Common Value is less than the Estimated Closing Common Value,
         the Seller will, within five (5) business days after the determination
         thereof, pay to the Purchaser an amount equal to the sum of (A) the
         Estimated Closing Common Value MINUS the Actual Closing Common Value
         PLUS (B) a fee on such difference from the Closing Date to the date of
         payment calculated using a rate equal to the Prime Rate. Such payment
         will be made by wire transfer or delivery of other immediately
         available funds.

                           (iii)    DISPUTE. If, pursuant to Section 2.4(a)
         above, there is a dispute as to the final determination of the Actual
         Cash Amount, the Actual Indebtedness Amount, or the Actual Net Working
         Capital Amount, the Purchaser and the Seller shall promptly pay to the
         other, as appropriate, such amounts as are not in dispute, pending
         final determination of such dispute pursuant to Section 2.4(a).

Any adjustments pursuant to this Section 2.4 shall constitute adjustments to the
Purchase Price for Tax purposes.

agency of any federal, state, local, or foreign jurisdiction or before any
arbitrator wherein an unfavorable judgment, decree, injunction, order, or ruling
would prevent the performance of this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby, declare unlawful the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, cause such transactions to be rescinded, or materially and adversely
affect the right of the Purchaser to own, operate, or control any Acquired

entered which has any of the foregoing effects;

                  (h)      Since September 30, 2000, there shall have been no

                  ARTICLE V -- REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES
                             OF THE SELLER ENTITIES


                  As a material inducement to the Purchaser to enter into this
Agreement, the Parent and the Seller hereby jointly and severally represent and
warrant that:

         SECTION 5.1       ORGANIZATION AND CORPORATE POWER.

                  (a)      The "ORGANIZATION SCHEDULE" attached hereto contains
a complete and accurate list for each Acquired Company of its name, its
jurisdiction of incorporation or organization, other jurisdictions in which it
is authorized to do business, and its capitalization (including the identity of
each stockholder or equity holder and the number of shares or other equity
interests held by each). Except as set forth on the ORGANIZATION SCHEDULE, no
Acquired Company owns or holds the right to acquire any Capital Stock in any
other Person.

                  (b)      Each Acquired Company is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing, and in good standing under the laws of its
jurisdiction of organization, with full organizational power


                                       22
<PAGE>


and authority to conduct its business as it is now being conducted, to own or
use the properties and assets that it purports to own or use, and to perform all
its obligations under the contracts to which it is party. Each Acquired Company
is duly qualified to do business as a foreign organization and is in good
standing under the laws of each state or other jurisdiction in which either the
ownership or use of the properties owned or used by it, or the nature of the
activities conducted by it, requires such qualification, except where the
failure to be so duly qualified or licensed and in good standing would not
individually or in the aggregate have a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (c)      The Seller has delivered to the Purchaser correct and
complete copies of the certificate of incorporation and by-laws (or equivalent
governing documents) for each Acquired Company, which documents reflect all
amendments made thereto at any time before the Closing Date. Correct and
complete copies of the minute books containing the records of meetings of the
stockholders and board of directors (or equivalent parties), the stock
certificate books, and the stock record books of the Acquired Companies have
been furnished to the Purchaser. No Acquired Company is in default under or in
violation of any provision of its certificate of incorporation or by-laws (or
equivalent governing documents).

                  (d)      Each Seller Entity is a corporation duly organized,
validly existing, and in good standing under the laws of such Seller Entity's
jurisdiction of incorporation.

         SECTION 5.2       AUTHORIZATION OF TRANSACTIONS. The Company and the
Seller Entities have all requisite corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver the Transaction Documents to which they are a party and to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The board of directors of each
of the Company and the Seller Entities have duly approved the Transaction
Documents to which they are a party and have duly authorized the execution and
delivery of the Transaction Documents to which they are a party and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby. No other corporate
proceedings on the part of the Company or the Seller Entities are necessary to
approve and authorize the execution and delivery of the Transaction Documents to
which they are a party and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
thereby. All Transaction Documents to which the Company or any Seller Entity is
a party have been duly executed and delivered by the Company or such Seller
Entity and constitute the valid and binding agreements of the Company or such
Seller Entity, enforceable against the Company or such Seller Entity in
accordance with their terms, except as limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other laws of general application
affecting enforcement of creditors' rights, and as limited by general principles
of equity that restrict the availability of equitable remedies.

         SECTION 5.3       ABSENCE OF CONFLICTS. Except as set forth on the
"CONFLICTS SCHEDULE" or on the REQUIRED CONSENTS SCHEDULE attached hereto, the
execution, delivery, and performance of the Transaction Documents and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby by the Company and the
Seller Entities do not and shall not (a) conflict with or result in any breach
of any of the terms, conditions, or provisions of, (b) constitute a material
default under, (c) result in a material violation of, (d) give any third party
the right to modify, terminate, or accelerate any obligation under, (e) result
in the creation of any Lien upon the Capital Stock or assets of any of the


                                       23
<PAGE>


Acquired Companies under, or (f) require any authorization, consent, approval,
exemption, or other action by or notice or declaration to, or filing with, any
court or administrative or other governmental body or agency (except in
connection with the HSR Act) under, the provisions of the articles of
incorporation, by-laws or similar organizational document of either of the
Seller Entities or any Acquired Company or any material indenture, mortgage,
lease, loan agreement, or other material agreement or instrument to which either
of the Seller Entities, any Acquired Company or, to the knowledge of the
Company, any Contracted Nonprofit is bound or affected, or any material law,
statute, rule, or regulation to which either of the Seller Entities, any
Acquired Company or, to the knowledge of the Company, any Contracted Nonprofit
is subject (except in connection with the HSR Act) or any material judgment,
order, or decree to which either of the Seller Entities, any Acquired Company
or, to the knowledge of the Company, any Contracted Nonprofit is subject.

         SECTION 5.4       CAPITALIZATION. The authorized Capital Stock of the
Company consists of 100 shares of common stock, $1.00 par value per share, of
which 100 shares are issued and outstanding, and all of which are owned by the
Seller. All of the issued and outstanding Capital Stock of the Acquired
Companies have been duly authorized, are validly issued, fully paid, and
nonassessable, and are held of record and owned beneficially by the Persons and
in the manner described on the ORGANIZATION SCHEDULE, free and clear of all
Liens, except for Liens arising under the Parent Credit Agreement which shall be
released at Closing, and are not subject to, nor were they issued in violation
of, any preemptive rights or rights of first refusal. Except as set forth on the
ORGANIZATION SCHEDULE, there are no outstanding or authorized options, warrants,
rights, contracts, calls, puts, rights to subscribe, conversion rights, or other
agreements or commitments to which any Acquired Company is a party or which are
binding upon any Acquired Company providing for the issuance, disposition, or
acquisition of any Acquired Company's Capital Stock (other than this Agreement).
Other than as set forth on the ORGANIZATION SCHEDULE, there are no outstanding
or authorized stock appreciation, phantom stock, or similar rights with respect
to any Acquired Company. There are no voting trusts, proxies, or any other
agreements or understandings with respect to the voting of the Capital Stock of
any Acquired Company. No Acquired Company is subject to any obligation
(contingent or otherwise) to repurchase or otherwise acquire or retire any
shares of any Acquired Company's Capital Stock.

         SECTION 5.5       FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED MATTERS.

                  (a)      FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. Attached hereto as the
"FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SCHEDULE" are the following financial statements: (i) the
unaudited consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of September 30, 1999
and 2000, and the related statements of income and cash flows (or the
equivalent) for the respective twelve-month periods then ended; and (ii) the
unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of October 31, 2000 (the
"LATEST BALANCE SHEET"), and the related statements of income and cash flows (or
the equivalent) for the one-month period then ended. Each of the foregoing
financial statements (the "FINANCIAL STATEMENTS") presents fairly the Company's
consolidated financial condition and results of operations and cash flows as of
the times and for the periods referred to therein, and has been prepared in
accordance with GAAP, subject in the case of unaudited consolidated financial
statements to the absence of footnote disclosure.

<PAGE>


                  (b)      RECEIVABLES. All accounts receivable of the Acquired
Companies that are reflected on the Latest Balance Sheet or on the accounting
records of the Acquired Companies as of the Closing Date (collectively, the
"ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE") represent or will represent valid obligations arising
from bona fide sales actually made or services actually performed in the
Ordinary Course of Business with unaffiliated third parties, and the goods and
services involved have been sold, delivered and performed to the account
obligors, and no further goods are required to be provided and no further
services are required to be rendered in order to complete the sales and fully
render the services and to entitle the Acquired Companies to collect such
accounts receivable in full. Such accounts receivable have not been assigned or
pledged to any other Person. The reserves for Accounts Receivable shown on the
Latest Balance Sheet are adequate in the Company's reasonable judgment and have
been calculated consistently in accordance with ordinary business practices. The
reserves for Accounts Receivable on the accounting records of the Acquired
Companies as of the Closing Date will be calculated consistent with ordinary and
prudent business practices.

         SECTION 5.6       ABSENCE OF UNDISCLOSED LIABILITIES. To the Seller's
knowledge, no Acquired Company has any material obligations or liabilities
(whether accrued, absolute, contingent, unliquidated, or otherwise, whether due
or to become due, and regardless of when asserted) arising out of or relating to
the operation of the Acquired Companies at or before the Closing, except (i)
obligations under contracts or commitments described on the CONTRACTS SCHEDULE
attached hereto or under contracts and commitments which are not required to be
disclosed thereon, (ii) liabilities reflected on the liabilities side of the
Latest Balance Sheet, (iii) liabilities which have arisen after the date of the
Latest Balance Sheet in the Ordinary Course of Business or otherwise in
accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and (iv) liabilities
disclosed as such elsewhere in this Agreement or the Schedules hereto.

         SECTION 5.7       ABSENCE OF CERTAIN DEVELOPMENTS. Except as set forth
on the attached "DEVELOPMENTS SCHEDULE" and except as expressly contemplated by
this Agreement, since September 30, 2000, the Acquired Companies, individually
or collectively, have not:

                  (a)      suffered any change that has had or could reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
or suffered any theft, damage, destruction, or casualty loss in excess of
$100,000, to their assets, whether or not covered by insurance, or suffered any
substantial destruction of books and records;

Companies have been indemnified pursuant to Section 8.2(a)(vi), the "BENEFIT

Acquired Company have any actual or potential withdrawal liability with respect
to any multiemployer plan or any liability in connection with the termination or
reorganization of any multiemployer plan.

                  (b)      Except as set forth in the BENEFIT PLANS SCHEDULE,
each such Plan is in all material respects in compliance, and has been
administered in all material respects in accordance, with its terms and the
applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code and all other Applicable Laws,
including, but not limited to, medical continuation under Code Section 4980B.
Except as set forth in the BENEFIT PLANS SCHEDULE, no Acquired Company has (i)

premiums or payments under or with respect to each Plan which are due on or
before the Closing Date have been paid, or to the extent such payments are not
yet due, have been accrued to the extent such accrual is required.

                  (d)      Except as set forth in the BENEFIT PLANS SCHEDULE,
each Plan which is intended to be qualified under section 401(a) of the Code (i)
has been amended to reflect all requirements of


                                       34
<PAGE>


the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and all subsequent legislation which is required to
be adopted prior to the end of the applicable remedial amendment period and (ii)
has received from the Internal Revenue Service a favorable determination letter
which considers the terms of the Plan as amended for such changes in law.

                  (e)      Except as set forth in the BENEFIT PLANS SCHEDULE
and except with respect to employer contributions obligations under the Plans,
each Acquired Company has not incurred and has no reason to expect that it will
incur, any liability to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (other than
non-delinquent premium payments) or otherwise under Title IV of ERISA (including
any withdrawal liability) or under the Code with respect to any employee pension
benefit plan that any Acquired Company or any other entity, that together with
any Acquired Company is treated as a single employer under Section 414 of the
Code, maintains or ever has maintained or to which any of them contributes, ever
has contributed, or ever has been required to contribute.

                  (f)      Each individual who has received compensation for
the performance of services on behalf of any Acquired Company has been properly

coverage, type of insurance, retroactive date, expiration date, risks insured
and any pending claims thereunder) and a list of all claims made under any
insurance policies and binders since January 1, 1998 (specifying the nature and
amount of the claim, current status and resolution, if any), and each such
policy will be in full force and effect as of the Closing. No Acquired Company
is in default in any material respect with respect to its obligations under any
insurance policy maintained by it, and no Acquired Company has been denied
insurance coverage. Except as set forth on the INSURANCE SCHEDULE, no Acquired
Company has any self-insurance or co-insurance programs, and the reserves set
forth on its Latest Balance Sheet are adequate to cover all anticipated
liabilities with respect to any such self-insurance or co-insurance programs.
Except as set forth on the Insurance Schedule, there are no outstanding unpaid
premiums or claims, and there are no provisions for retroactive or retrospective
premium adjustments. Except as set forth on the INSURANCE SCHEDULE, no notice of

                  (c)      The Acquired Companies have not claimed or received

         referencing the terms "materiality," "Material Adverse Effect," or
         other terms of similar import or effect);

                           (ii)     the breach of any covenant or agreement

         such entity, together with an Acquired Company, is treated as a single
         employer under Section 414 of the Code;

                           (vii)    any improper exclusion of employees from
         participation under the Magellan Health Services, Inc. Cash

                           (viii)   any Guaranty Obligation of any Acquired
         Company (other than Guaranty Obligations in respect of Indebtedness of
         other Acquired Companies) including any Guaranty Obligation required
         to be listed on the CONTRACTS SCHEDULE but only if such Guaranty
         Obligation was in effect on or before the Closing Date;

                           (ix)     telephone services provided by AT&T or an

         Actual Net Working Capital Amount;

                           (x)      cost reports or other similar reports filed
         by an Acquired Company with the State of Maryland or an agency or
         instrumentality thereof prior to the Closing Date, including, without

                                       43
<PAGE>


         rates or amounts for periods after the Closing Date directly as a
         result of such cost reports or other similar reports;

                           (xi)     any failure by an Acquired Company to file
         a Form 5500 annual report, including, without limitation, costs
         relating to the preparation and filing of any delinquent Form 5500
         annual report and taxes and penalties assessed by the Internal Revenue
         Service or Department of Labor; or

                           (xii)    each Incident occurring on or prior to the
         Closing Date.

The Seller and the Parent hereby acknowledge that they and their Affiliates will
have no claims or rights to contribution or indemnity from the Acquired
Companies or their officers and directors with respect to any amounts paid by
any of them pursuant to this Section 8.2(a); provided, however, that this
acknowledgment shall not affect the Seller's or the Parent's rights under
Section 8.2(b)(vi).

                  (b)      LIMITATIONS ON INDEMNIFICATION BY THE SELLER AND THE
PARENT. The indemnification provided for in Section 8.2(a) above is subject to
the following limitations:

                           (i)      The Seller and the Parent will be liable to
         the Purchaser Parties with respect to claims referred to in Section
         8.2(a)(i), Section 8.2(a)(ii) (but only to the extent the related Loss
         relates to the breach of a covenant that by its terms does not
         continue after the Closing Date) and Section 8.2(a)(iii) (but only to
         the extent the related Loss relates to the breach of a covenant that
         by its terms does not continue after the Closing Date) only if a
         Purchaser Party gives a Seller Entity written notice thereof no later
         than the Applicable Limitation Date; provided that so long as the
         Purchaser delivers written notice of a good faith claim to a Seller
         Entity no later than the Applicable Limitation Date, the Seller
         Entities shall be required to indemnify the Purchaser Parties for all
         Losses (subject to the other limitations contained herein) which the
         Purchaser Parties may incur in respect of the matters which are the
         subject of such claim, regardless of when incurred.

                           (ii)     The aggregate amount of all payments made
         by the Seller and the Parent in satisfaction of claims for
         indemnification pursuant to Section 8.2(a)(i), Section 8.2(a)(ii) (but
         only to the extent the related Loss relates to the breach of a
         covenant that by its terms does not continue after the Closing Date)
         and Section 8.2(a)(iii) (but only to the extent the related Loss
         relates to the breach of a covenant that by its terms does not
         continue after the Closing Date) shall not exceed $18,000,000 (the
         "CAP"); provided, however, that the Cap shall not apply with respect
         to any Losses resulting from or relating to breaches of any
         Fundamental Representations and Warranties and such Losses shall not
         count towards satisfaction of the Cap; provided further, however, that
         the liability of the Seller Entities pursuant to Section 8.2 for all
         Losses, including those relating to breaches of Fundamental
         Representations and Warranties, shall not exceed, in the aggregate the
         sum of the Purchase Price and the portion of the Actual Indebtedness
         Amount that was owed to the Seller or the Parent or their respective
         Affiliates as of the close of business on the day before the Closing
         Date. No party shall be liable to indemnify any other party for any
         consequential or punitive


                                       44
<PAGE>


          damages, other than those owing to third parties, if any. The
          aggregate amount of all payments made by the Seller and the Parent in
          satisfaction of claims for indemnification pursuant to Section
          8.2(a)(x) shall not exceed $636,000.

                           (iii)    The Seller and the Parent shall not be
          liable to indemnify any Purchaser Parties pursuant to Section
          8.2(a)(i), Section 8.2(a)(ii) (but only to the extent the related Loss
          relates to the breach of a covenant that by its terms does not
          continue after the Closing Date) and Section 8.2(a)(iii) (but only to
          the extent the related Loss relates to the breach of a covenant that
          by its terms does not continue after the Closing Date) unless and
          until the Purchaser Parties have collectively suffered Losses by such
          breaches or pursuant to such Section in excess of a $1,500,000
          aggregate basket ("BASKET") (at which point, subject to the other
          limitations herein, the Seller and the Parent will be liable to the
          Purchaser Parties for all Losses in excess of such Basket); provided,
          however, that the Basket shall not apply with respect to any Losses
          resulting from or relating to breaches of any Fundamental
          Representations and Warranties and such Losses shall not count towards
          satisfaction of the Basket.

                           (iv)     The Seller Entities' indemnification
          obligations under Section 8.2(a)(xii) shall be reduced as follows. To
          the extent the Seller Entities are not entitled to reimbursement
          pursuant to insurance policies (or loss portfolio transfer agreements,
          indemnification agreements or the like) in respect of Losses for which
          the Purchaser Parties would otherwise be entitled to indemnification
          from the Seller Entities under Section 8.2(a)(xii) but for the
          application of this clause (iv) (the "UNCOVERED INCIDENT CLAIMS"),
          then for the first $1.0 million of Uncovered Incident Claims, the
          Seller Entities and the Purchaser shall share responsibility, on an
          80% and 20% pro rata basis respectively, for the Losses in respect of
          such claims, after which point the Seller Entities shall be liable for
          100% of all further Uncovered Incident Claims. Nothing in this clause
          (iv) shall be deemed to limit or modify the parties' rights and
          obligations under Section 9.11.

                           (v)      If the Seller's or the Parent's
          indemnification obligation under this Section 8.2 arises in respect of
          any indemnifiable event (A) which a Purchaser Party receives
          indemnification from the Seller or the Parent and (B) which results in
          any Tax benefit to such Purchaser Party for any taxable period (or
          portion thereof) beginning and ending after the Closing Date which
          would not, but for such indemnifiable event, be available, such
          Purchaser Party shall pay, or shall cause to be paid, to the Seller or
          the Parent an amount equal to the actual Tax saving produced by such
          Tax benefit reduced by the amount of any Tax detriment to such
          Purchaser Party as a result of the receipt of such indemnification.
          Tax benefits and detriments shall be taken into account as and when
          actually realized. The amount of any such Tax saving for any taxable
          period shall be the amount of the reduction in Taxes payable to a Tax
          authority by such Purchaser Party with respect to such Tax period (net
          of any Tax detriment resulting from the receipt of the indemnity
          payment) as compared to the Taxes that would have been payable to a
          Tax authority by such Purchaser Party with respect to such Tax period
          in the absence of such Tax benefit. The Purchaser Party realizing such
          tax benefits shall notify the Seller or the Parent upon realizing such
          tax benefits.


                                       45

                           (vi)    Any payment made by the Seller or the
         Parent to a Purchaser Party pursuant to this Section 8.2 in respect of
         any indemnifiable event shall be net of any insurance proceeds
         realized by and paid to such Purchaser Party in respect of such claim.
         Such Purchaser Party shall use its reasonable efforts to make
         insurance claims relating to any indemnifiable event for which it is
         seeking indemnification pursuant to this Section 8.2; provided that
         such Purchaser Party shall not be obligated to make such an insurance
         claim if the cost of pursuing such an insurance claim together with
         any corresponding increase in insurance premiums or other chargebacks
         to such Purchaser Party, as the case may be, would exceed the value of
         the claim for which such Purchaser Party is seeking indemnification.

                           (vii)    The indemnification rights provided
         hereunder shall be the exclusive remedy of the Purchaser Parties with
         respect to any dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement,
         except for the right to seek specific performance of any of the
         agreements contained herein.

Notwithstanding any implication to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
limits on indemnification set forth in this Agreement shall not apply to claims
in the case of fraud by either of the Seller Entities.

                  (c)      INDEMNIFICATION BY THE PURCHASER. The Purchaser
shall indemnify the Seller Entities and hold the Seller Entities and the Seller
Entities' respective officers, directors, stockholders, employees, agents,
representatives, affiliates, successors, and assigns (collectively, the "SELLER
PARTIES") harmless from and against and pay on behalf of or reimburse such
Seller Parties in respect of any Loss which such Seller Party may suffer,
sustain, or become subject to, as a result of or relating to:

                           (i)      the breach of any representation or
         warranty made by the Purchaser contained in this Agreement or in any
         certificate delivered by the Purchaser with respect thereto in
         connection with the Closing (in each case, determined without regard
         to any qualifications therein referencing the terms "materiality,"
         "Material Adverse Effect," or other terms of similar import or
         effect); or

                           (ii)     the breach of any covenant or agreement
         made by the Purchaser contained in this Agreement.

                  (d)      LIMITATIONS ON INDEMNIFICATION BY THE PURCHASER. The
indemnification  provided for in SECTION 8.2(c) above is subject to the
following limitations:

                           (i)      The Purchaser will be liable to the Seller
         Parties with respect to claims referred to in SECTION 8.2(c)(i) and
         SECTION 8.2(c)(ii) (but only to the extent the related Loss relates to
         the breach of a covenant that by its terms does not continue after the
         Closing Date) only if the Seller gives the Purchaser written notice
         thereof within the Applicable Limitation Date; provided that so long
         as the Seller delivers written notice of a good faith claim to the


                                       47
<PAGE>


         Purchaser no later than the Applicable Limitation Date, the Purchaser
         shall be required to indemnify the Seller Parties for all Losses
         (subject to the other limitations contained herein) which the Seller
         Parties may incur in respect of the matters which are the subject of
         such claim, regardless of when incurred;

                           (ii)     If the Purchaser's indemnification
         obligation under this SECTION 8.2 arises in respect of any
         indemnifiable event (A) for which a Seller Party receives
         indemnification from the Purchaser and (B) which results in any Tax
         benefit to such Seller Party for any taxable period (or portion
         thereof) beginning and ending after the Closing Date which would not,
         but for such indemnifiable event, be available, such Seller Party
         shall pay, or shall cause to be paid, to the Purchaser an amount equal
         to the actual Tax saving produced by such Tax benefit reduced by the
         amount of any Tax detriment to such Seller Party as a result of the
         receipt of such indemnification. Tax benefits and detriments shall be
         taken into account as and when actually realized. The amount of any
         such Tax saving for any taxable period shall be the amount of the
         reduction in Taxes payable to a Tax authority by such Seller Party
         with respect to such Tax period (net of any Tax detriment resulting
         from the receipt of the indemnity payment) as compared to the Taxes
         that would have been payable to a Tax authority by such Seller Party
         with respect to such Tax period in the absence of such Tax benefit and
         the Seller Party realizing such Tax benefits shall notify the
         Purchaser upon realizing such Tax benefits;

                           (iii)    Any payment made by the Purchaser to a
         Seller Party pursuant to this SECTION 8.2 in respect of any
         indemnifiable event shall be net of any insurance proceeds realized by
         and paid to such Seller Party in respect of such claim. Such Seller
         Party shall use its reasonable efforts to make insurance claims
         relating to any indemnifiable event for which it is seeking
         indemnification pursuant to this SECTION 8.2; provided that such
         Seller Party shall not be obligated to make such an insurance claim if
         such Seller Party in its reasonable judgment believes the cost of
         pursuing such an insurance claim together with any corresponding
         increase in insurance premiums or other chargebacks to such Seller
         Party, as the case may be, would exceed the value of the claim for
         which such Seller Party is seeking indemnification; and

                           (iv)     The indemnification rights provided
         hereunder shall be the exclusive remedy of the Seller Parties with
         respect to any dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement,
         except for the right to seek specific performance of any of the
         agreements contained herein.

Notwithstanding any implication to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
limits on indemnification set forth in this Agreement shall not apply to claims
in the case of fraud by the Purchaser.

In the event a Purchaser Party has a claim for indemnification pursuant to
Section 8.2(a) for which (A)(i) the Parent agrees in writing that the Purchaser
Party is entitled to indemnification or (ii) a final non-appealable order of a
court of competent jurisdiction is rendered in favor of the Purchaser Party


                                       48
<PAGE>


and (B) the Parent has failed to satisfy such claim in full within ten business
days of notice of the issuance of such final, non-appealable court order or the
date of the written agreement with respect thereto, then the Purchaser may, at
its option, cause the Parent and Seller to satisfy such indemnification
obligation by notifying the Seller that the Purchaser is reducing the amount
owing, without duplication, under either or both Seller Notes; provided,
however, that the Purchaser shall not reduce the amount owing under any Seller
Note at any time when such Seller Note is owned and held by a Person other than
the Seller Entities and their Affiliates; provided, however, that the Seller
shall (and shall cause its Affiliates to) give to the Purchaser not less than 30
days prior written notice before transferring any Seller Note to a Person other
than the Seller Entities and their Affiliates. This shall affect the timing and
amount of payments required under each Seller Note in the same manner as if the
Purchaser has made a permitted prepayment thereunder.

                  (e)      PROCEDURES. If a party hereto seeks indemnification
under this Article VIII, such party (the "INDEMNIFIED PARTY") shall promptly
give written notice to the other party (the "INDEMNIFYING PARTY") after
receiving written notice of any action, lawsuit, proceeding, investigation, or
other claim against it (if by a third party) or discovering the liability,
obligation, or facts giving rise to such claim for indemnification, describing
the claim, the amount thereof (if known and quantifiable), and the basis
thereof; provided that the failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not
relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder except to the extent
such failure shall have prejudiced the Indemnifying Party. In that regard, if
any action, lawsuit, proceeding, investigation, or other claim shall be brought
or asserted by any third party which, if adversely determined, would entitle the
Indemnified Party to indemnity pursuant to this Article VIII, the Indemnified
Party shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party of the same in writing,
specifying in detail the basis of such claim and the facts pertaining thereto
and the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of
such action, lawsuit, proceeding, investigation, or other claim giving rise to
the Indemnified Party's claim for indemnification at the Indemnifying Party's
expense and option and (subject to the limitations set forth below) shall be
entitled to control and appoint lead counsel of such defense (including the
defense of a particular claim in a proceeding involving multi-party claims) with
reputable counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party; provided that,
as a condition precedent to the Indemnifying Party's right to assume control of
such defense, it must first agree in writing to be fully responsible for all
Losses relating to such claims and to provide full indemnification to the
Indemnified Party for all Losses relating to such claim; and provided further
that the Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to assume control of such
defense (but shall have the right to participate) and shall pay the reasonable
fees and expenses of counsel reasonably acceptable to the Seller retained by the
Indemnified Party, if the claim which the Indemnifying Party seeks to assume
control (each, an "INDEMNIFIED PARTY CONTROLLED PROCEEDING") (i) involves or
relates to abuse, neglect, mistreatment or other misconduct relating to a client
managed or served, directly or indirectly, by any Acquired Company, (ii)
involves a claim to which the Indemnified Party reasonably believes could be
detrimental to or injure the Indemnified Party's reputation, customer or
supplier relations or future business prospects, (iii) seeks non-monetary relief
(except where non-monetary relief is merely incidental to a primary claim or
claims for monetary damages), (iv) involves criminal allegations, (v) is one in
which the Indemnifying Party is also a party and joint representation would be
inappropriate or there may be legal defenses available to the Indemnified Party
which are different from or additional to those available to the Indemnifying
Party, or (vi)


                                       48
<PAGE>


involves a claim which, upon petition by the Indemnified Party, the appropriate
court rules that the Indemnifying Party failed or is failing to vigorously
prosecute or defend. With respect to actions, lawsuits, proceedings and
investigations or other claims asserted by a third party which are outstanding
as of the Closing Date, if the Seller Entities are currently defending such
action, lawsuit, proceeding, investigation or other claim, the Seller Entities
shall have the right to control such defense subject to the right of the
Purchaser Parties to divest the Seller Entities of such right if such action,
lawsuit, proceeding, investigation or other claim would be an Indemnified Party
Controlled Proceeding hereunder. Similarly, notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, the Seller Entities shall have the right to control the
disposition of the matter referred to in Section 8.2(a)(vii). Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, the Purchaser shall have the right to control
the disposition of the matter referred to in Section 8.2(a)(x); provided,
however, that the Purchaser shall use its reasonable efforts to mitigate the
amount of any Losses suffered by the Purchaser Parties in connection with such
matter.

                  If the Indemnifying Party is permitted to assume and control
the defense and elects to do so, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to
employ counsel separate from counsel employed by the Indemnifying Party in any
such action and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses
of such counsel employed by the Indemnified Party shall be at the expense of the
Indemnified Party unless the employment thereof has been specifically authorized
by the Indemnifying Party in writing.

                  If the Indemnifying Party shall control the defense of any
such claim, the Indemnifying Party shall obtain the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld) before entering
into any settlement of a claim or ceasing to defend such claim, if pursuant to
or as a result of such settlement or cessation, injunction, or other equitable
relief will be imposed against the Indemnified Party or if such settlement does
not expressly unconditionally release the Indemnified Party from all liabilities
and obligations with respect to such claim.

                  (f)      TAX  TREATMENT. Amounts paid to or on behalf of a
Seller Entity or the Purchaser as indemnification shall be treated as
adjustments to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes.

                      ARTICLE IX -- ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

         SECTION 9.1       PRESS RELEASES AND ANNOUNCEMENTS. Before the Closing
Date, no press releases related to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated herein, or other announcements to the employees, customers, or
suppliers of any Acquired Company shall be issued by any Party without the
mutual approval of all Parties, except for any public disclosure which any Party
in good faith believes is required by law or regulation (in which case the
disclosure shall be prepared jointly by the Seller and the Purchaser). After the
Closing Date, no press releases related to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated herein, or other announcements to the employees, customers, or
suppliers of any Acquired Company shall be issued by the Parent, the Seller or
their respective Affiliates without the prior approval of the Purchaser, except
for any public disclosure which the


                                       49

Seller in good faith believes is required by law or regulation (in which case
the disclosure shall be prepared jointly by the Seller and the Purchaser).

         SECTION 9.2       FURTHER TRANSFERS. Each Party shall execute and
deliver such further instruments of conveyance and transfer and take such
additional action as any other Party may reasonably request to effect,
consummate, confirm, or evidence the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

         SECTION 9.3       SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE. The Seller Entities
acknowledge that the Acquired Companies' businesses are unique and recognize and
affirm that in the event of a breach of this Agreement by the Seller Entities,
money damages may be inadequate and the Purchaser may have no adequate remedy at
law. Accordingly, the Seller Entities agree that the Purchaser shall have the
right, in addition to any other rights and remedies existing in its favor, to
enforce its rights and the Seller Entities' obligations hereunder not only by an
action or actions for damages but also by an action or actions for specific
performance, injunctive, and/or other equitable relief, in each case without the
requirement of posting a bond or proving actual damages.

         SECTION 9.4       EXPENSES. The Parties shall pay all of their own
fees, costs, and expenses (including, without limitation, fees, costs and
expenses of legal counsel, accountants, investment bankers, brokers, or other
representatives and consultants and appraisal fees, costs, and expenses)
incurred in connection with the negotiation of this Agreement and the other
agreements contemplated hereby, the performance of its obligations hereunder and
thereunder, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby (collectively, the "TRANSACTION EXPENSES"); it being understood that if
the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, the Company shall
reimburse the Purchaser and its investors for all of their Transaction Expenses;
it being further understood that no such Transaction Expenses of the Purchaser
shall be recorded on the books of the Company prior to the Closing or taken into
account in the Cash Amount or the Net Working Capital Amount. At the request of
the Seller, the Transaction Expenses for which the Seller is liable pursuant to
this SECTION 9.4 may be deducted from the Purchase Price and paid directly to
the Seller's legal counsel, investment bankers and other agents and
representatives. To the extent that any Acquired Company pays or becomes liable
with respect to any Transaction Expenses of the Seller Entities or any Acquired
Company, the Purchase Price shall be reduced dollar-for-dollar.

         SECTION 9.5       NONCOMPETITION, NONSOLICITATION, AND CONFIDENTIALITY.
From and after the Closing:

                  (a)      NONCOMPETITION. In consideration of the mutual
covenants provided for herein to the Seller Entities at the Closing, during the
period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the third anniversary of the
Closing Date (the "NONCOMPETE PERIOD"), the Seller Entities shall not, and the
Seller Entities shall cause their Affiliates to not, engage (whether as an
owner, operator, manager, employee, officer, director, consultant, advisor,
representative, or otherwise) directly or indirectly in any Acquired Company's
business as presently conducted which is the business that provides home or
community based services to (i) at-risk children and youth who are behaviorally


                                       50
<PAGE>


and/or medically involved, (ii) individuals with mental retardation and/or
development disabilities, (iii) individuals with acquired brain injury or (iv)
the elderly, in each case, anywhere within the United States; provided, that
engaging in the existing business of the Seller Entities and their other
Affiliates (including, without limitation, participation in joint ventures) as
currently conducted on the date hereof shall not be deemed a violation of the
foregoing; provided further that ownership of less than 5% of the outstanding
stock of any publicly traded corporation shall not be deemed to be engaging
solely by reason thereof in any of its businesses. The Parties hereto agree that
the covenant set forth in this SECTION 9.5 is reasonable with respect to its
duration, geographical area, and scope. If the final judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision of this SECTION 9.5
is invalid or unenforceable, the Parties agree that the court making the
determination of invalidity or unenforceability shall have the power to reduce
the scope, duration, or area of the term or provision, to delete specific words
or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a
term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to
expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and
this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified after the expiration of the
time within which the judgment may be appealed.

                  (b)      NONSOLICITATION. The Seller Entities agree that,
during the Noncompete Period, they will not (and will cause their Affiliates to
not) directly or indirectly contact, approach, or solicit (other than a
generally public solicitation such as a newspaper advertisement) for the purpose
of offering employment to or hiring (whether as an employee, consultant, agent,
independent contractor, or otherwise) any Person employed by, or under contract
with, any Acquired Company, the Purchaser or any of their Affiliates, at any
time before the Closing Date or during the Noncompete Period, without the prior
written consent of the Purchaser.

                  (c)      CONFIDENTIALITY. The Seller Entities shall treat and
hold as confidential any information concerning the business and affairs of the
Acquired Companies (including, without limitation, all Proprietary Rights) that
is not already generally available to the public (the "CONFIDENTIAL
INFORMATION"), refrain from using or disclosing any of the Confidential
Information (i) except in connection with this Agreement or (ii) unless and only
to the extent that such disclosure (after making reasonable efforts to avoid
such disclosure and after advising and consulting with the Purchaser about
possibly making, and the proposed contents of, such disclosure) is, in the
opinion of the Seller Entities' legal counsel, required by applicable law, and
at any time upon the reasonable request of the Purchaser deliver promptly to the
Purchaser or destroy, at the request and option of the Purchaser, all tangible
embodiments (and all copies) of the Confidential Information which are in its
possession or under its control other than any information the Seller Entities
are required by law or regulation to maintain. In the event that either of the
Seller Entities is requested or required (by oral question or request for
information or documents in any legal proceeding, interrogatory, subpoena, civil
investigative demand, or similar process) to disclose any Confidential
Information, it shall notify the Purchaser promptly of the request or
requirement so that the Purchaser may seek an appropriate protective order or
waive compliance with the provisions of this SECTION 9.5(c).

                  (d)      TRADE NAMES. The Seller Entities shall not use or
permit any of their Affiliates to use the "National Mentor," "Mentor Network,"
or "Mentor" name (or any other


                                       51
<PAGE>


trademarks, service marks, trade dress, trade names, logos or names used by any
Acquired Company) or any names or symbols likely to be confusingly similar
thereto in any manner anywhere in the world after Closing.

                  (e)      REMEDY FOR BREACH. Each Seller Entity acknowledges
and agrees that in the event of a breach of any of the provisions of this
SECTION 9.5, monetary damages shall not constitute a sufficient remedy.
Consequently, in the event of any such breach, the Company, the Purchaser,
and/or their respective successors or assigns may, in addition to other rights
and remedies existing in their favor, apply to any court of law or equity of
competent jurisdiction for specific performance and/or injunctive or other
relief in order to enforce or prevent any violations of the provisions hereof,
in each case without the requirement of posting a bond or proving actual
damages.

         SECTION 9.6       TAX MATTERS.

                  (a)      CERTAIN DEFINITIONS.  As used in this Agreement:

                           "STRADDLE PERIOD" means any taxable period beginning
         before and ending after the Closing Date.


                  (b)      RETURN FILING, REFUNDS, CREDITS AND TRANSFER TAXES.

                           (i)      (A) The Seller Entities shall prepare, or
         cause to be prepared, all Tax Returns of or including each of the
         Acquired Companies for all Pre-Closing Periods (the "PRE-CLOSING
         PERIOD RETURNS"). The Seller Entities shall pay, or cause to be paid,
         all Taxes with respect to Pre-Closing Period Returns. The Seller
         Entities shall timely file, or cause to be timely filed, all such
         Pre-Closing Period Returns of or including the Acquired Companies that
         are due on or before the Closing Date (giving effect to any extensions
         thereto), and shall pay, or cause to be paid, all Taxes with respect
         to all such Pre-Closing Period Returns.


                                    (B) The Seller Entities shall prepare and
         provide the Purchaser with Pre-Closing Period Returns, other than
         Pre-Closing Period Returns that are described in Section 9.6(b)(ii),
         that are due after the Closing Date (giving effect to any extensions
         thereto) at least ten (10) business days prior to the due date
         thereof. In connection with the Seller Entities preparation of such
         Pre-Closing Period Returns, at the request of the Parent, the
         Consolidated Subsidiaries (as defined below) will timely furnish Tax
         information to the Parent for inclusion in such Tax Returns in
         accordance with the Consolidated Subsidiaries' past custom and
         practice. The Purchaser shall have the right to review and comment on
         such


                                       52
<PAGE>


         Tax Returns (including any amended returns) prior to filing, and the
         parties shall resolve in good faith, and make any appropriate changes
         to such Tax Returns with respect to, any issues arising as a result of
         such review and comment process. Promptly upon the finalization of
         such Tax Returns and in any case prior to the time such Tax Return is
         required to be filed, the Seller shall deliver to the Purchaser (i) an
         original of such Tax Return and (ii) a check payable to the
         appropriate taxing authority in the amount of any Taxes shown as due
         thereon. If the Seller timely delivers such Tax Return and check
         payable to the appropriate tax authority as provided in the previous
         sentence, the Purchaser shall cause such Pre-Closing Period Returns to
         be executed by the appropriate officer and shall file such Returns,
         together with the appropriate payment, on a timely basis.

                           (ii)     The Parent will include the income of each
         of the Acquired Companies which is a member of the Parent Tax Group
         (the "CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES") (including any deferred income
         triggered into income by Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-13 and
         Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-14 and any excess loss accounts
         taken into income under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-19 or any
         similar provisions of state, local or foreign law) on the Parent
         consolidated federal income Tax Returns and any consolidated,
         combined, or unitary (or similar) state, local or foreign income Tax
         Returns for all periods through the Closing Date in accordance with
         the Parent's and Consolidated Subsidiaries' past custom and practice
         and pay any income Taxes attributable to such income. At the request
         of the Parent, the Consolidated Subsidiaries will timely furnish Tax
         information to the Parent for inclusion in such Tax Returns in
         accordance with the Consolidated Subsidiaries' past custom and
         practice. The Parent will provide to Purchaser with copies of such Tax
         Returns at least ten (10) business days prior to the due date thereof
         (giving effect to any extensions thereto) and will allow the Purchaser
         an opportunity to review and comment upon such Tax Returns (including
         any amended returns) to the extent that they relate to the
         Consolidated Subsidiaries, and the parties shall resolve in good faith
         any issues arising as a result of such review. The income of the
         Consolidated Subsidiaries will be apportioned to the period up to and
         including the Closing Date and the period after the Closing Date by
         closing the books of the Consolidated Subsidiaries as of the end of
         the Closing Date.

                           (iii)    The Purchaser shall prepare, or cause to be
         prepared, and shall file, or cause to be filed, on a timely basis all
         Tax Returns of or including each Acquired Company for the Straddle
         Period (the "STRADDLE PERIOD RETURNS"). The Purchaser shall pay, or
         cause to be paid, all Taxes shown to be due on such Tax Returns.

                           (iv)     Any Tax refunds that are received by the
         Purchaser (or to the extent such refund is payable but not paid due to
         such refund being offset against other Taxes of the Purchaser, any
         amounts credited against Taxes of the Purchaser with respect to such
         refunds) arising from taxable periods of the Acquired Companies ending
         on or before the Closing Date shall be for the account of the Seller,
         and the Purchaser shall pay over to the Seller any such refund (or
         credit against, as the case may be) within 15 days after receipt
         thereof.

<PAGE>


                           (v)      The Purchaser shall provide the Parent with
          copies of any Straddle Period Returns at least ten (10) business days
          prior to the due date thereof (giving effect to any extensions
          thereto), accompanied by a statement calculating in reasonable detail
          the Parent's indemnification obligation pursuant to SECTION 9.6(c)
          hereof (the "INDEMNIFICATION STATEMENT"). The Parent shall have the
          right to review such Straddle Period Returns and Indemnification
          Statement prior to the filing of such Straddle Period Returns. If the
          Parent disputes any amounts shown due on such Tax Returns or the
          amount calculated in the Indemnification Statement, the Parent and the
          Purchaser shall consult and resolve in good faith any issues arising
          as a result of the review of such Straddle Period Return and
          Indemnification Statement. If the Parent agrees to the Indemnification
          Statement amount, the Parent shall pay to the Purchaser an amount
          equal to the Taxes shown on the Indemnification Statement not later
          than three days before the due date (including any extensions thereof)
          for payment of Taxes with respect to such Straddle Period Return. If
          the Parties are unable to resolve any dispute within five (5) business
          days after the Parent's receipt of such Straddle Period Return and
          Indemnification Statement, the Purchaser and the Parent will jointly
          retain the Firm as selected pursuant to Section 2.4(a) to resolve any
          such disputes and the Firm shall resolve any such issues in dispute as
          promptly as practicable. If the Firm is unable to make a determination
          with respect to any disputed issue prior to the due date (including
          any extensions) for the filing of the Straddle Period Return in
          question, (A) the Purchaser shall file, or shall cause to be filed,
          such Straddle Period Return without such determination having been
          made and (B) the Parent shall pay to the Purchaser, not later than
          three days before the due date (including any extensions thereof) for
          the payment of Taxes with respect to such Straddle Period Return, an
          amount determined by the Parent as the proper amount chargeable to the
          Parent pursuant to this SECTION 9.6. Upon delivery to the Parent and
          the Purchaser by the Firm of its determination, appropriate
          adjustments shall be made to the amount paid by the Parent in
          accordance with the immediately preceding sentence in order to reflect
          the decision of the Firm. The determination by the Firm shall be
          final, conclusive and binding on the parties.

                           (vi)     If a notice of deficiency, proposed
          adjustment, assessment, audit, examination or other administrative or
          court proceeding, suit, dispute or other claim (a "TAX CLAIM") shall
          be delivered, sent, commenced, or initiated to or against Purchaser or
          any of the Acquired Companies by any Taxing authority with respect to
          Taxes that results in or may result in a loss for which
          indemnification may be claimed from the Seller Entities under this
          Agreement, Purchaser shall promptly (but in any event within 15 days
          after receipt of such Tax Claim) notify Parent of such Tax Claim.
          Parent shall have the sole right to represent the Acquired Companies'
          interests and to employ counsel of its choice at its expense with
          respect to any such Tax Claim; PROVIDED THAT in the case of any Tax
          Claim relating to any Tax for any Straddle Period Return which each of
          Purchaser and Parent may be liable, Purchaser and Parent shall each be
          entitled to participate at their own expense in such Tax Claim to the
          extent it relates to a Tax for which such party bears liability
          pursuant to this Section 9.6. No party may settle or otherwise dispose
          of any Tax Claim for which another party may have a liability under
          Section 9.6 without the prior written consent of such other party,
          which consent may not be unreasonably withheld.

<PAGE>


                           (vii)    The Parent will not elect to retain any net
          operating loss carryovers or capital loss carryovers of the
          Consolidated Subsidiaries under Treasury Regulation Section
          1.1502-20(g). The Purchaser shall not carryback any post-acquisition
          Tax attribute of any of the Consolidated Subsidiaries into any of the
          Parent's consolidated, combined, or unitary (or similar) Tax Return.

                           (viii)   The Seller Entities and the Purchaser shall
          reasonably cooperate, and shall cause their respective Affiliates,
          officers, employees, agents, auditors and representatives reasonably
          to cooperate, in preparing and filing all Tax Returns (including
          amended returns and claims for refund), including maintaining and
          making available to each other employees and all records necessary in
          connection with Taxes and in resolving all disputes and audits with
          respect to all taxable periods relating to Taxes.

                           (ix)     Notwithstanding any other provisions of
          this Agreement to the contrary, all sales, use, transfer, gains,
          stamp, duties, recording and similar Taxes incurred in connection with
          the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid equally
          by the Seller and the Purchaser. The Seller shall file or cause to be
          filed all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect
          to such Taxes and the Seller and the Purchaser shall share equally the
          expense of such filings. If required by applicable law, the Purchaser
          will join in the execution of any such Tax Returns or such other
          documentation.

                           (x)      All Tax allocation, Tax sharing or similar
          agreements to which any of the Acquired Companies are bound shall be
          terminated as of the time of the Closing and, after such time, neither
          of the Purchaser nor any of Acquired Companies shall be bound thereby
          or have any liability thereunder.

                  (c)      TAX INDEMNIFICATION.

                           (i)      From and after the Closing Date, the Seller
          Entities shall protect, defend, indemnify and hold harmless the
          Purchaser, the Acquired Companies and their Affiliates from any and
          all Taxes imposed on the Purchaser or any of the Acquired Companies
          and any Loss resulting from (A) for all taxable periods (or portions
          thereof) beginning before and ending on or prior to the Closing Date,
          including, without limitation, any Taxes imposed as a result of the
          Section 338(h)(10) Election, (B) the several liability of any of the
          Acquired Companies pursuant to Treas. Reg. Section 1.1502-6 or any
          analogous state, local or foreign law or regulation or by reason of
          its having been a member of any consolidated, combined or unitary
          group on or prior to the Closing Date, (C) its ceasing to be a member
          of the Parent Tax Group, (D) the breach of any of the Parent Tax
          Group's covenants set forth in this Section 9.6, (E) breaches of
          representations and warranties in Section 5.10, or (F) any Tax
          allocation or Tax sharing or similar agreement, as a transferee or
          successor, by contract or otherwise. The indemnification under this
          Section 9.6(c) and the indemnification for Taxes set forth elsewhere
          in Section 9.6 hereof shall not be subject to the indemnification
          Basket and Cap forth in Section 8.2(b).

                           (ii)     For purposes of SECTION 9.6(c)(i), in the
         case of any Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis and are payable
         for a Straddle Period, the portion of such Tax which relates to the
         portion of such Tax period beginning before and ending on the Closing
         Date shall (A) in the case of any Taxes other than Taxes based upon or
         related to income or receipts, be deemed to be the amount of such Tax
         for the entire Tax period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of
         which is the number of days in the Tax period ending on the Closing
         Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire
         Tax period and (B) in the case of any Tax based upon or related to
         income or receipts, be deemed equal to the amount which would be
         payable if the relevant Tax period ended on the Closing Date.

                  (d)      SECTION 338(h)(10) ELECTION. The Parent, at the
request of the Purchaser, will join with the Purchaser in making a timely

state, local, or foreign tax law) (collectively, the "SECTION 338(h)(10)
ELECTION") with respect to the purchase and sale or deemed purchase and sale of
the stock of any or all of the Acquired Companies hereunder. The Parent will pay

to make or perfect such Section 338(h)(10) Election.

                  (e)      ALLOCATION OF PURCHASE PRICE. The Parties agree that
the purchase price for and the liabilities of the Consolidated Subsidiaries
(plus other relevant items) will be allocated to the assets of the Consolidated
Subsidiaries for all Tax purposes in accordance with Section 338 of the Code and
the regulations thereunder and the procedures set forth on the "ALLOCATION

rules then in force) if such rule is available and (iii) subject to the
conditions specified in Section 9.7(b) below, any other legally available means
of transfer.

                  (b)      In connection with the transfer of any Restricted
Securities (other than a transfer described in clauses (i) or (ii) of Section
9.7(a) above), the holder thereof shall deliver written notice to the Purchaser
describing in reasonable detail the transfer or proposed transfer, together with
an opinion of counsel which (to the reasonable satisfaction of the Purchaser) is
knowledgeable in securities law matters to the effect that such transfer of
Restricted Securities may be


                                       56
<PAGE>


effected without registration of such Restricted Securities under the Securities
Act. In addition, if the holder of the Restricted Securities delivers to the
Purchaser an opinion of counsel that no subsequent transfer of such Restricted
Securities shall require registration under the Securities Act, the Purchaser
shall promptly upon such contemplated transfer deliver new certificates for such
Restricted Securities which do not bear the Securities Act legend set forth in
Section 9.7(d). If the Purchaser is not required to deliver new certificates for
such Restricted Securities not bearing such legend, the holder thereof shall not
transfer the same until the prospective transferee has confirmed to the
Purchaser in writing its agreement to be bound by the conditions contained in
this Section 9.7(b) and Section 9.7(d) below.

                  (c)      If any Restricted Securities become eligible for
sale pursuant to Rule 144(k), the Purchaser shall, upon the request of the
holder of such Restricted Securities, remove the legend set forth in
Section 9.7(d) below from the certificates for such Restricted Securities.

                  (d)      Each certificate or instrument representing
Restricted Securities shall be imprinted with a legend in substantially the
following form:

         "THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN
         REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED OR ANY STATE
         SECURITIES LAWS. THE TRANSFER OF THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS
         CERTIFICATE IS SUBJECT TO THE CONDITIONS RELATING TO SECURITIES LAWS
         SPECIFIED IN THE STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT, DATED AS OF JANUARY 18,
         2001, AS AMENDED AND MODIFIED FROM TIME TO TIME, BY AND AMONG THE
         ISSUER AND CERTAIN INVESTORS, AND THE ISSUER RESERVES THE RIGHT TO
         REFUSE THE TRANSFER OF SUCH SECURITIES UNTIL SUCH CONDITIONS HAVE BEEN
         FULFILLED WITH RESPECT TO SUCH TRANSFER. A COPY OF SUCH CONDITIONS
         SHALL BE FURNISHED BY THE ISSUER TO THE HOLDER HEREOF UPON WRITTEN
         REQUEST AND WITHOUT CHARGE."

Notwithstanding any of the foregoing in this Section 9.7, the Purchaser
acknowledges and agrees that the Restricted Securities owned by the Seller
Entities will be pledged as collateral under the Parent Credit Agreement or any
replacements or refinancings thereof and that no further action, permission or
opinions are required to be given by the Seller Entities to the Purchaser to
pledge the Restricted Securities under the Parent Credit Agreement or any
replacements or refinancings thereof.

         SECTION 9.8       COMPANY EMPLOYEES. As of the Closing Date, the
Company shall continue to maintain the Company's group health plan for the
benefit of its employees. Employees of the Company who participate in such plan
will continue to be eligible to participate in such plan and all payments made
by such employees toward deductible, out-of-pocket and co-payment obligation
limits under such plan for the plan year which includes the Closing Date will
continue to be recognized under such plan. The Company will also recognize past
service with the Company for eligibility and vesting purposes under the
Company's benefit plans.


                                       57

         SECTION 9.9       SELLER NOTE MATTERS. If (i) the Seller Note B Amount
is greater than zero and (ii) the Senior Credit Facility is further syndicated
during the twelve month period following the Closing Date such that the Senior
Debt Financing Amount after such further syndication exceeds the Senior Debt
Financing Amount on the Closing Date, then the Company shall make a prepayment
on the Seller Note B (such prepayment to be applied first in payment of accrued
and unpaid interest and second in repayment of outstanding principal) in an
amount equal to the lesser of (A) the outstanding principal balance and accrued
and unpaid interest on the Seller Note B and (B) the product of (i) the Senior
Debt Financing Amount after such further syndication MINUS the Senior Debt
Financing Amount on the Closing Date and (ii) the quotient of five divided by
nine; provided, however, that the Company shall not be obligated to make such
prepayment at any time when the Company is in default under the Senior Credit
Facility or any replacement thereof. Any repayment of a Seller Note required to
be made by the Company pursuant to this Section 9.9 shall be made within three
business days of the time when the Company has increased the Senior Credit
Facility as contemplated above in an amount to make such payment.
Notwithstanding any rights the Seller (or other holders of the Seller Notes) may
have to receive payments in priority over the Purchaser's other subordinated
lenders and investors, the Seller hereby agrees that the Company may grant to
its other investors and subordinated lenders the right to be paid the portion of
any increase in the Senior Debt Financing Amount referred to above that is not
required to be paid to the holder of the Seller Note B pursuant to this SECTION
9.9; provided, however, that the Seller (or other holders of the Seller Note B)
shall be paid pursuant to this Section on a pari passu basis with such other
investors and subordinated lenders.

         SECTION 9.10      USE OF MAGELLAN NAME. The Purchaser agrees and
acknowledges that the Acquired Companies have no rights to use the "Magellan"
name. From and after the Closing, the Purchaser shall not use or permit any of
the Acquired Companies to use in any manner whatsoever the "Magellan" name (or
any variation thereof) and shall promptly remove all trade dress, physical
characteristics, color combinations and other indications of operation under the
Magellan name, including, without limitation, signage, from any premises from or
at which the businesses of the Acquired Companies are operated.

         SECTION 9.11      INSURANCE MATTERS. The Seller Entities covenant and
agree as follows:

                  (a)      the Seller Entities will continue to maintain the
insurance policies that are required to be set forth on the INSURANCE SCHEDULE
(the "INSURANCE POLICIES") (or if such policies are terminated, substantially
equivalent policies) for the benefit of the Acquired Companies, with respect to
occurrences prior to the Closing Date, regardless of whether claims are brought
prior to or after the Closing Date;

                  (b)      except to the extent after the Closing that the
Acquired Companies do not comply with the terms of the Insurance Policies which
are applicable to them, the Acquired Companies will continue to enjoy
substantially the same rights and benefits under the Insurance Policies after
the Closing, with respect to occurrences prior to the Closing, regardless of
whether claims are brought prior to or after the Closing;


                                       58
<PAGE>


                  (c)      except to the extent after the Closing that the
Acquired Companies do not comply with the terms of the Insurance Policies which
are applicable to them, the Acquired Companies will have the right to tender all
claims for all occurrences that occur prior to the Closing Date to the Insurance
Policies regardless of when the claim is brought;

                  (d)      the Seller Entities will use their reasonable best
efforts to assist the Acquired Companies in tendering claims to the applicable
insurers under the Insurance Policies and to provide the Acquired Companies with
proceeds in a timely fashion of all claims made by or with respect to the
Acquired Companies under the Insurance Policies;

                  (e)      the Acquired Companies will use their reasonable
best efforts to assist the Seller Entities in tendering claims to the applicable
insurers under the Insurance Policies;

                  (f)      the Seller Entities will be responsible for
satisfying any deductibles, retentions and other retained amounts on insurance
coverage with respect to all claims made under the Insurance Policies; and

                  (g)      the Parent shall purchase, at its own cost and
expense, prior to the Closing Date, for the benefit of the Acquired Companies,
an insurance policy (or an extension of an existing policy) that has the effect
of making the general and professional liability insurance of the Acquired
Companies an occurrence based policy for all dates prior to the Closing Date
(e.g., the Parent shall purchase a "tail" to the claims made based professional
liability policy that began in June 2000) and the Acquired Companies shall have
the right to make claims under such newly purchased insurance policy as provided
in this Section 9.11 as if such insurance policy were an Insurance Policy for
purposes of this Section 9.11.

                           ARTICLE X -- MISCELLANEOUS

         SECTION 10.1      AMENDMENT AND WAIVER. This Agreement may be amended

         SECTION 10.3      BINDING AGREEMENT; ASSIGNMENT. This Agreement and
all of the provisions hereof shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of
the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns; provided that
neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests, or obligations
hereunder may be assigned by any Party without the prior written consent of the
other Parties; provided that

                  (a)      the Purchaser may assign, in whole or in part, its
rights and obligations pursuant to this Agreement to one or more of its
Affiliates; provided that the Purchaser will nonetheless remain liable for all
of its obligations hereunder;

                  (b)      the Purchaser and the Company may each assign its
rights under this Agreement for collateral security purposes to any lender
providing financing to the Purchaser, the Company, or any of their Affiliates
and any such lender may exercise all of the rights and remedies of the Purchaser
and the Company hereunder; and

                  (c)      the Purchaser and the Company may assign its rights
under this Agreement, in whole or in part, to any subsequent purchaser of the
Purchaser or any Acquired Company or any material portion of its assets (whether
such sale is structured as a sale of stock, a sales of assets, a merger, or
otherwise); provided that the Purchaser and the Company will nonetheless remain
liable for all of its obligations hereunder.

         SECTION 10.4      SEVERABILITY. Except as otherwise provided in
SECTION 9.5(a), whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement shall be
interpreted in such a manner as to be effective and valid under Applicable Law,
but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be prohibited by or invalid
under Applicable Law, such provision shall be ineffective only to the extent of
such


                                       60
<PAGE>


prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of such provisions
or the remaining provisions of this Agreement.

         SECTION 10.5      NO STRICT CONSTRUCTION. The language used in this
Agreement shall be deemed to be the language chosen by the Parties to express
their mutual intent, and no rule of strict construction shall be applied against
any Person. The Parties hereto have participated jointly in the negotiation and
drafting of this Agreement. In the event of an ambiguity or question of intent
or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted
jointly by the Parties hereto, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise
favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any of the
provisions of this Agreement.

         SECTION 10.6      CAPTIONS. The captions used in this Agreement are
for convenience of reference only and do not constitute a part of this Agreement
and shall not be deemed to limit, characterize, or in any way affect any
provision of this Agreement, and all provisions of this Agreement shall be
enforced and construed as if no caption had been used in this Agreement.

         SECTION 10.7      ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This Agreement and the documents
referred to herein contain the entire agreement between the Parties and
supersede any prior understandings, agreements, or representations by or between
the Parties, written or oral, which may have related to the subject matter
hereof in any way.

         SECTION 10.8      COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in
multiple counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of
which taken together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

         SECTION 10.9      GOVERNING LAW. All questions concerning the
construction, validity, and interpretation of this Agreement shall be governed
by and construed in accordance with the domestic laws of the State of Illinois,
without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law provision (whether
of the State of Illinois or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the
application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the Illinois.

         SECTION 10.10     JURISDICTION AND CONSENT TO SERVICE. Without
limiting the jurisdiction or venue of any other court, each of Parties (a)

consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of each such court in any suit, action or
proceeding relating to or arising out of this Agreement; (c) waives any
objection which it may have to the laying of venue in any such suit, action or
proceeding in any such court; and (d) agrees that service of any court paper may
be made in such manner as may be provided under applicable laws or court rules
governing service of process.

         SECTION 10.11     PARTIES IN INTEREST. Nothing in this Agreement,
express or implied, is intended to confer on any Person, other than the Parties
and their respective successors and assigns, any rights or remedies under or by
virtue of this Agreement.
