SECTION 2.1 PRE-CLOSING ESTIMATES OF CERTAIN AMOUNTS. Not later than three
days before the Closing, the Seller and the Purchaser will in good faith
jointly estimate, on a reasonable basis using the Company\'s then
available financial information, the Cash Amount (such estimate is referred
to as the "ESTIMATED CASH AMOUNT"), the Indebtedness Amount (such estimate is
referred to as the "ESTIMATED INDEBTEDNESS AMOUNT") and the Net Working
Capital Amount (such estimate is referred to as the "ESTIMATED NET WORKING
CAPITAL AMOUNT) each as of the close of business on the day before Closing
Date; provided, however, that if the Seller and the Purchaser cannot agree on
an estimate of any of the foregoing amounts, such estimate will be deemed to
be equal to the average of the Seller\'s and the Purchaser\'s good faith
determinations thereof. The "ESTIMATED CLOSING COMMON VALUE" means an amount
equal to (A) $121.0 million, (B) plus the amount by which the Estimated Cash
Amount exceeds $8.0 million or minus the amount by which $8.0 million exceeds
the Estimated Cash Amount, (C) less the Estimated Indebtedness Amount, and
(D) plus the amount by which the Estimated Net Working Capital Amount exceeds
the Top Collar Amount or minus the amount by which the Bottom Collar Amount
exceeds the Estimated Net Working Capital Amount or zero if the Estimated Net
Working Capital Amount is between the Top Collar Amount and the Bottom Collar
Amount.   SECTION 2.2 STOCK PURCHASE. On the basis of the
representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements herein, and subject to
the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth herein and the terms
hereof, at the Closing, the Purchaser shall purchase from the Seller, and the
Seller shall sell and transfer to the Purchaser, the Acquired Stock, free and
clear of any Liens, for a purchase price equal to the Estimated Closing
Common Value (the "PURCHASE PRICE") by delivery to the Seller of (A) a
subordinated promissory note issued by the Purchaser in the form of EXHIBIT A
attached hereto in a principal amount equal to $10 million (the "SELLER NOTE
A"), (B) if the Seller Note B Amount is greater than zero, a subordinated
promissory note issued by the Purchaser in the form of EXHIBIT I attached
hereto in a principal amount equal to the Seller Note B Amount (the "SELLER
NOTE B") and (C) cash for the balance of the Purchase Price by wire transfer
or other delivery of immediately available funds (the "ESTIMATED CASH
PORTION").   SECTION 2.3 CLOSING TRANSACTIONS.   (a) CLOSING. The closing
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "CLOSING") shall take
place at the offices of Kirkland and Ellis, 200 East Randolph Drive, Chicago,
Illinois 60601, commencing at 10:00 a.m. on the third business day following
the satisfaction or waiver of all conditions to the obligations of the
Parties to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby (other than
conditions with respect to actions the respective Parties will take at the
Closing itself), or at such other place or on such other date as may be
mutually agreeable to the    10    Purchaser and the Seller; provided
that in any event, if the Purchaser\'s senior lenders require that the
Closing take place at the offices of their attorneys, the Parties agree that
the Closing shall take place at such offices. The date and time of the
Closing are herein referred to as the "CLOSING DATE."   (b) CLOSING
TRANSACTIONS. At the Closing:   (i) the Seller shall deliver to the
Purchaser,  free and clear of any Liens, one or more certificates
representing the  Acquired Stock, duly endorsed in blank or accompanied by
stock powers  or other instruments of transfer duly executed in blank, and
bearing  or accompanied by all requisite stock transfer stamps;   (ii) the
Purchaser shall deliver to the Seller  the Estimated Cash Portion in
immediately available funds;   (iii) the Purchaser shall deliver to the
Seller  the Seller Notes;   (iv) the Purchaser shall cause the Company to 
repay all Indebtedness outstanding as of the close of business on the  day
before the Closing Date owed to the Seller or the Parent or their  Affiliates
(other than the Acquired Companies), as the case may be;  and   (v) each
Party shall deliver the opinions,  certificates and other documents and
instruments required to be  delivered by or on behalf of such Party under
Article III.   SECTION 2.4 POST-CLOSING ADJUSTMENTS.   (a) POST-CLOSING
DETERMINATION. Within 90 days after the Closing Date, the Purchaser and its
auditors will conduct a review (the "CLOSING REVIEW") of the Cash Amount, the
Indebtedness Amount and the Net Working Capital Amount and will prepare and
deliver to the Seller a computation of such amounts (the "DRAFT
COMPUTATIONS"). The Draft Computation shall be prepared from the Company\'s
books and records, which in return shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP,
consistently applied. The Purchaser and its auditors will make available to
the Seller and its auditors all records and work papers used in preparing the
Draft Computations. If the Seller disagrees with the computation of the Cash
Amount, the Indebtedness Amount or the Net Working Capital Amount reflected
in the Draft Computations, the Seller may, within 30 days after receipt of
the Draft Computations, deliver a notice (an "OBJECTION NOTICE") to the
Purchaser setting forth the Seller\'s calculation of the Cash Amount,
the Indebtedness Amount and the Net Working Capital Amount. The Purchaser and
the Seller will use reasonable best efforts to resolve any disagreements as
to the computation of the Cash Amount, the Indebtedness Amount and the Net
Working Capital Amount, but if they do not obtain a final resolution within
30 days after the Purchaser has received the Objection Notice, the Purchaser
and the Seller will jointly retain an independent accounting firm of
recognized national standing (the "FIRM") to resolve any remaining
disagreements. If the Purchaser and the Seller are unable to agree on the
choice of the Firm, then the Firm will be a "big-five" accounting firm (or a
successor) selected by lot (after excluding one firm designated by the
Purchaser and one firm designated by the Seller). The Purchaser and the
Seller will direct the Firm    11    to render a determination within
30 days of its retention and the Purchaser, the Seller, and their respective
agents will cooperate with the Firm during its engagement. The Firm will
consider only those items and amounts in the Draft Computations set forth in
the Objection Notice which the Purchaser and the Seller are unable to
resolve. The Purchaser and the Seller shall each make a submission to the
Firm promptly (and in any event within 20 days after the Firm\'s engagement),
which submission shall contain such Party\'s computation of the Cash Amount,
the Indebtedness Amount and the Net Working Capital Amount and information,
arguments, and support for such Party\'s position. The Firm shall review such
submissions and base its determination solely on them. In resolving any
disputed item, the Firm may not assign a value to any item greater than
the greatest value for such item claimed by either party or less than the
smallest value for such item claimed by either party. The Firm\'s
determination will be based on the definition of the Cash Amount, the
Indebtedness Amount and the Net Working Capital Amount included herein. The
determination of the Firm will be conclusive and binding upon the Parties.
The Seller and the Purchaser shall each bear 50% of the costs and expenses of
the Firm. The Cash Amount, the Indebtedness Amount and the Net Working
Capital Amount, as finally determined pursuant to this Section 2.4(a), is
referred to herein as the "ACTUAL CASH AMOUNT," the "ACTUAL INDEBTEDNESS
AMOUNT" and the "ACTUAL NET WORKING CAPITAL AMOUNT," respectively. The
"ACTUAL CLOSING COMMON VALUE" means an amount equal to (A) $121.0 million,
(B) plus the amount by which the Actual Cash Amount exceeds $8.0 million or
minus the amount by which $8.0 million exceeds the Actual Cash Amount, (C)
less the Actual Indebtedness Amount, and (D) plus the amount by which the
Actual Net Working Capital Amount exceeds the Top Collar Amount or minus the
amount by which the Bottom Collar Amount exceeds the Actual Net Working
Capital Amount or zero if the Actual Net Working Capital Amount is between
the Top Collar Amount and the Bottom Collar Amount.   (b) POST-CLOSING
ADJUSTMENT.    (i) PAYMENT BY THE PURCHASER. If the Actual  Closing Common
Value is greater than the Estimated Closing Common  Value, the Purchaser
will, within five (5) business days after the  determination thereof, pay to
the Seller an amount equal to the sum of  (A) the Actual Closing Common Value
MINUS the Estimated Closing Common  Value PLUS (B) a fee on such difference
from the Closing Date to the  date of payment calculated using a rate equal
to the "Prime Rate" as  listed in THE WALL STREET JOURNAL (Midwest Edition)
on the Closing  Date (the "PRIME RATE"). Such payment will be made by wire
transfer or  delivery of other immediately available funds.   (ii) PAYMENT
BY THE SELLER. If the Actual  Closing Common Value is less than the Estimated
Closing Common Value,  the Seller will, within five (5) business days after
the determination  thereof, pay to the Purchaser an amount equal to the sum
of (A) the  Estimated Closing Common Value MINUS the Actual Closing Common
Value  PLUS (B) a fee on such difference from the Closing Date to the date
of  payment calculated using a rate equal to the Prime Rate. Such payment 
will be made by wire transfer or delivery of other immediately  available
funds.    12     (iii) DISPUTE. If, pursuant to Section 2.4(a)  above,
there is a dispute as to the final determination of the Actual  Cash Amount,
the Actual Indebtedness Amount, or the Actual Net Working  Capital Amount,
the Purchaser and the Seller shall promptly pay to the  other, as
appropriate, such amounts as are not in dispute, pending  final determination
of such dispute pursuant to Section 2.4(a).  Any adjustments pursuant to
this Section 2.4 shall constitute adjustments to the Purchase Price for Tax
purposes.   ARTICLE III -- CONDITIONS TO CLOSING   SECTION 3.1 CONDITIONS

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES  OF THE SELLER ENTITIES    As a material
inducement to the Purchaser to enter into this Agreement, the Parent and the
Seller hereby jointly and severally represent and warrant that:   SECTION
5.1 ORGANIZATION AND CORPORATE POWER.   (a) The "ORGANIZATION SCHEDULE"
attached hereto contains a complete and accurate list for each Acquired
Company of its name, its jurisdiction of incorporation or organization, other
jurisdictions in which it is authorized to do business, and its
capitalization (including the identity of each stockholder or equity holder
and the number of shares or other equity interests held by each). Except as
set forth on the ORGANIZATION SCHEDULE, no Acquired Company owns or holds the
right to acquire any Capital Stock in any other Person.   (b) Each Acquired
Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing, and in good
standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization, with full
organizational power    22    and authority to conduct its business as
it is now being conducted, to own or use the properties and assets that it
purports to own or use, and to perform all its obligations under the
contracts to which it is party. Each Acquired Company is duly qualified to do
business as a foreign organization and is in good standing under the laws of
each state or other jurisdiction in which either the ownership or use of the
properties owned or used by it, or the nature of the activities conducted by
it, requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so duly
qualified or licensed and in good standing would not individually or in the
aggregate have a Material Adverse Effect.   (c) The Seller has delivered to
the Purchaser correct and complete copies of the certificate of incorporation
and by-laws (or equivalent governing documents) for each Acquired Company,

Closing Date. Correct and complete copies of the minute books containing the
records of meetings of the stockholders and board of directors (or equivalent
parties), the stock certificate books, and the stock record books of the
Acquired Companies have been furnished to the Purchaser. No Acquired Company
is in default under or in violation of any provision of its certificate of
incorporation or by-laws (or equivalent governing documents).   (d) Each
Seller Entity is a corporation duly organized, validly existing, and in good

the Transaction Documents to which they are a party and have duly authorized

party and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby. No other
corporate proceedings on the part of the Company or the Seller Entities are

Transaction Documents to which they are a party and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated thereby. All Transaction Documents to which the
Company or any Seller Entity is a party have been duly executed and delivered
by the Company or such Seller Entity and constitute the valid and binding
agreements of the Company or such Seller Entity, enforceable against the
Company or such Seller Entity in accordance with their terms, except as

other laws of general application affecting enforcement of creditors\'
rights, and as limited by general principles of equity that restrict the
availability of equitable remedies.   SECTION 5.3 ABSENCE OF CONFLICTS.
Except as set forth on the "CONFLICTS SCHEDULE" or on the REQUIRED CONSENTS

the Seller Entities or any Acquired Company or any material indenture,

which either of the Seller Entities, any Acquired Company or, to the
knowledge of the Company, any Contracted Nonprofit is bound or affected, or
any material law, statute, rule, or regulation to which either of the Seller
Entities, any Acquired Company or, to the knowledge of the Company, any
Contracted Nonprofit is subject (except in connection with the HSR Act) or
any material judgment, order, or decree to which either of the Seller
Entities, any Acquired Company or, to the knowledge of the Company, any
Contracted Nonprofit is subject.   SECTION 5.4 CAPITALIZATION. The
authorized Capital Stock of the Company consists of 100 shares of common

balance sheets of the Company as of September 30, 1999 and 2000, and the
related statements of income and cash flows (or the equivalent) for the
respective twelve-month periods then ended; and (ii) the unaudited
consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of October 31, 2000 (the "LATEST

obligations arising from bona fide sales actually made or services actually
performed in the Ordinary Course of Business with unaffiliated third parties,
and the goods and services involved have been sold, delivered and performed
to the account obligors, and no further goods are required to be provided and
no further services are required to be rendered in order to complete the
sales and fully render the services and to entitle the Acquired Companies to
collect such accounts receivable in full. Such accounts receivable have not
been assigned or pledged to any other Person. The reserves for Accounts
Receivable shown on the Latest Balance Sheet are adequate in the Company\'s
reasonable judgment and have been calculated consistently in accordance with
ordinary business practices. The reserves for Accounts Receivable on the
accounting records of the Acquired Companies as of the Closing Date will be
calculated consistent with ordinary and prudent business practices.

Guaranty  Obligation was in effect on or before the Closing Date;   (ix)

the Closing Date directly as a  result of such cost reports or other similar
reports;   (xi) any failure by an Acquired Company to file  a Form 5500
annual report, including, without limitation, costs  relating to the
preparation and filing of any delinquent Form 5500  annual report and taxes
and penalties assessed by the Internal Revenue  Service or Department of
Labor; or   (xii) each Incident occurring on or prior to the  Closing
Date.  The Seller and the Parent hereby acknowledge that they and their
Affiliates will have no claims or rights to contribution or indemnity from
the Acquired Companies or their officers and directors with respect to any
amounts paid by any of them pursuant to this Section 8.2(a); provided,
however, that this acknowledgment shall not affect the Seller\'s or the
Parent\'s rights under Section 8.2(b)(vi).   (b) LIMITATIONS ON
INDEMNIFICATION BY THE SELLER AND THE PARENT. The indemnification provided
for in Section 8.2(a) above is subject to the following limitations:   (i)
The Seller and the Parent will be liable to  the Purchaser Parties with
respect to claims referred to in Section  8.2(a)(i), Section 8.2(a)(ii) (but
only to the extent the related Loss  relates to the breach of a covenant that
by its terms does not  continue after the Closing Date) and Section
8.2(a)(iii) (but only to  the extent the related Loss relates to the breach
of a covenant that  by its terms does not continue after the Closing Date)
only if a  Purchaser Party gives a Seller Entity written notice thereof no
later  than the Applicable Limitation Date; provided that so long as the 
Purchaser delivers written notice of a good faith claim to a Seller  Entity
no later than the Applicable Limitation Date, the Seller  Entities shall be
required to indemnify the Purchaser Parties for all  Losses (subject to the
other limitations contained herein) which the  Purchaser Parties may incur in
respect of the matters which are the  subject of such claim, regardless of
when incurred.   (ii) The aggregate amount of all payments made  by the
Seller and the Parent in satisfaction of claims for  indemnification pursuant
to Section 8.2(a)(i), Section 8.2(a)(ii) (but  only to the extent the related
Loss relates to the breach of a  covenant that by its terms does not continue
after the Closing Date)  and Section 8.2(a)(iii) (but only to the extent the
related Loss  relates to the breach of a covenant that by its terms does
not  continue after the Closing Date) shall not exceed $18,000,000 (the 
"CAP"); provided, however, that the Cap shall not apply with respect  to any
Losses resulting from or relating to breaches of any  Fundamental
Representations and Warranties and such Losses shall not  count towards
satisfaction of the Cap; provided further, however, that  the liability of
the Seller Entities pursuant to Section 8.2 for all  Losses, including those
relating to breaches of Fundamental  Representations and Warranties, shall
not exceed, in the aggregate the  sum of the Purchase Price and the portion
of the Actual Indebtedness  Amount that was owed to the Seller or the Parent
or their respective  Affiliates as of the close of business on the day before
the Closing  Date. No party shall be liable to indemnify any other party for
any  consequential or punitive    44     damages, other than those
owing to third parties, if any. The  aggregate amount of all payments made by
the Seller and the Parent in  satisfaction of claims for indemnification
pursuant to Section  8.2(a)(x) shall not exceed $636,000.   (iii) The
Seller and the Parent shall not be  liable to indemnify any Purchaser Parties
pursuant to Section  8.2(a)(i), Section 8.2(a)(ii) (but only to the extent
the related Loss  relates to the breach of a covenant that by its terms does
not  continue after the Closing Date) and Section 8.2(a)(iii) (but only to 
the extent the related Loss relates to the breach of a covenant that  by its
terms does not continue after the Closing Date) unless and  until the
Purchaser Parties have collectively suffered Losses by such  breaches or
pursuant to such Section in excess of a $1,500,000  aggregate basket
("BASKET") (at which point, subject to the other  limitations herein, the
Seller and the Parent will be liable to the  Purchaser Parties for all Losses
in excess of such Basket); provided,  however, that the Basket shall not
apply with respect to any Losses  resulting from or relating to breaches of
any Fundamental  Representations and Warranties and such Losses shall not
count towards  satisfaction of the Basket.   (iv) The Seller Entities\'
indemnification  obligations under Section 8.2(a)(xii) shall be reduced as
follows. To  the extent the Seller Entities are not entitled to
reimbursement  pursuant to insurance policies (or loss portfolio transfer
agreements,  indemnification agreements or the like) in respect of Losses for
which  the Purchaser Parties would otherwise be entitled to indemnification 
from the Seller Entities under Section 8.2(a)(xii) but for the  application
of this clause (iv) (the "UNCOVERED INCIDENT CLAIMS"),  then for the first
$1.0 million of Uncovered Incident Claims, the  Seller Entities and the
Purchaser shall share responsibility, on an  80% and 20% pro rata basis
respectively, for the Losses in respect of  such claims, after which point
the Seller Entities shall be liable for  100% of all further Uncovered
Incident Claims. Nothing in this clause  (iv) shall be deemed to limit or
modify the parties\' rights and  obligations under Section 9.11.   (v) If
the Seller\'s or the Parent\'s  indemnification obligation under this Section
8.2 arises in respect of  any indemnifiable event (A) which a Purchaser Party
receives  indemnification from the Seller or the Parent and (B) which results
in  any Tax benefit to such Purchaser Party for any taxable period (or 
portion thereof) beginning and ending after the Closing Date which  would
not, but for such indemnifiable event, be available, such  Purchaser Party
shall pay, or shall cause to be paid, to the Seller or  the Parent an amount
equal to the actual Tax saving produced by such  Tax benefit reduced by the
amount of any Tax detriment to such  Purchaser Party as a result of the
receipt of such indemnification.  Tax benefits and detriments shall be taken
into account as and when  actually realized. The amount of any such Tax
saving for any taxable  period shall be the amount of the reduction in Taxes
payable to a Tax  authority by such Purchaser Party with respect to such Tax
period (net  of any Tax detriment resulting from the receipt of the
indemnity  payment) as compared to the Taxes that would have been payable to
a  Tax authority by such Purchaser Party with respect to such Tax period  in
the absence of such Tax benefit. The Purchaser Party realizing such  tax
benefits shall notify the Seller or the Parent upon realizing such  tax
benefits.    45     (vi) Any payment made by the Seller or the  Parent
to a Purchaser Party pursuant to this Section 8.2 in respect of  any
indemnifiable event shall be net of any insurance proceeds  realized by and
paid to such Purchaser Party in respect of such claim.  Such Purchaser Party
shall use its reasonable efforts to make  insurance claims relating to any
indemnifiable event for which it is  seeking indemnification pursuant to this
Section 8.2; provided that  such Purchaser Party shall not be obligated to
make such an insurance  claim if the cost of pursuing such an insurance claim
together with  any corresponding increase in insurance premiums or other
chargebacks  to such Purchaser Party, as the case may be, would exceed the
value of  the claim for which such Purchaser Party is seeking
indemnification.   (vii) The indemnification rights provided  hereunder
shall be the exclusive remedy of the Purchaser Parties with  respect to any
dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement,  except for the right to
seek specific performance of any of the  agreements contained
herein.  Notwithstanding any implication to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, the limits on indemnification set forth in this Agreement shall
not apply to claims in the case of fraud by either of the Seller
Entities.   (c) INDEMNIFICATION BY THE PURCHASER. The Purchaser shall
indemnify the Seller Entities and hold the Seller Entities and the
Seller Entities\' respective officers, directors, stockholders, employees,
agents, representatives, affiliates, successors, and assigns (collectively,
the "SELLER PARTIES") harmless from and against and pay on behalf of or
reimburse such Seller Parties in respect of any Loss which such Seller Party
may suffer, sustain, or become subject to, as a result of or relating to:  
(i) the breach of any representation or  warranty made by the Purchaser
contained in this Agreement or in any  certificate delivered by the Purchaser
with respect thereto in  connection with the Closing (in each case,
determined without regard  to any qualifications therein referencing the
terms "materiality,"  "Material Adverse Effect," or other terms of similar
import or  effect); or   (ii) the breach of any covenant or agreement 
made by the Purchaser contained in this Agreement.   (d) LIMITATIONS ON
INDEMNIFICATION BY THE PURCHASER. The indemnification provided for in SECTION
8.2(c) above is subject to the following limitations:   (i) The Purchaser
will be liable to the Seller  Parties with respect to claims referred to in
SECTION 8.2(c)(i) and  SECTION 8.2(c)(ii) (but only to the extent the related
Loss relates to  the breach of a covenant that by its terms does not continue
after the  Closing Date) only if the Seller gives the Purchaser written
notice  thereof within the Applicable Limitation Date; provided that so
long  as the Seller delivers written notice of a good faith claim to
the    47     Purchaser no later than the Applicable Limitation Date,
the Purchaser  shall be required to indemnify the Seller Parties for all
Losses  (subject to the other limitations contained herein) which the
Seller  Parties may incur in respect of the matters which are the subject
of  such claim, regardless of when incurred;   (ii) If the Purchaser\'s
indemnification  obligation under this SECTION 8.2 arises in respect of any 
indemnifiable event (A) for which a Seller Party receives  indemnification
from the Purchaser and (B) which results in any Tax  benefit to such Seller
Party for any taxable period (or portion  thereof) beginning and ending after
the Closing Date which would not,  but for such indemnifiable event, be
available, such Seller Party  shall pay, or shall cause to be paid, to the
Purchaser an amount equal  to the actual Tax saving produced by such Tax
benefit reduced by the  amount of any Tax detriment to such Seller Party as a
result of the  receipt of such indemnification. Tax benefits and detriments
shall be  taken into account as and when actually realized. The amount of
any  such Tax saving for any taxable period shall be the amount of the 
reduction in Taxes payable to a Tax authority by such Seller Party  with
respect to such Tax period (net of any Tax detriment resulting  from the
receipt of the indemnity payment) as compared to the Taxes  that would have
been payable to a Tax authority by such Seller Party  with respect to such
Tax period in the absence of such Tax benefit and  the Seller Party realizing
such Tax benefits shall notify the  Purchaser upon realizing such Tax
benefits;   (iii) Any payment made by the Purchaser to a  Seller Party
pursuant to this SECTION 8.2 in respect of any  indemnifiable event shall be
net of any insurance proceeds realized by  and paid to such Seller Party in
respect of such claim. Such Seller  Party shall use its reasonable efforts to
make insurance claims  relating to any indemnifiable event for which it is
seeking  indemnification pursuant to this SECTION 8.2; provided that such 
Seller Party shall not be obligated to make such an insurance claim if  such
Seller Party in its reasonable judgment believes the cost of  pursuing such
an insurance claim together with any corresponding  increase in insurance
premiums or other chargebacks to such Seller  Party, as the case may be,
would exceed the value of the claim for  which such Seller Party is seeking
indemnification; and   (iv) The indemnification rights provided  hereunder
shall be the exclusive remedy of the Seller Parties with  respect to any
dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement,  except for the right to
seek specific performance of any of the  agreements contained
herein.  Notwithstanding any implication to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, the limits on indemnification set forth in this Agreement shall
not apply to claims in the case of fraud by the Purchaser.  In the event a
Purchaser Party has a claim for indemnification pursuant to Section 8.2(a)
for which (A)(i) the Parent agrees in writing that the Purchaser Party is
entitled to indemnification or (ii) a final non-appealable order of a court
of competent jurisdiction is rendered in favor of the Purchaser Party   
48    and (B) the Parent has failed to satisfy such claim in full within
ten business days of notice of the issuance of such final, non-appealable
court order or the date of the written agreement with respect thereto, then
the Purchaser may, at its option, cause the Parent and Seller to satisfy such
indemnification obligation by notifying the Seller that the Purchaser is
reducing the amount owing, without duplication, under either or both Seller
Notes; provided, however, that the Purchaser shall not reduce the amount
owing under any Seller Note at any time when such Seller Note is owned and
held by a Person other than the Seller Entities and their Affiliates;
provided, however, that the Seller shall (and shall cause its Affiliates to)
give to the Purchaser not less than 30 days prior written notice before
transferring any Seller Note to a Person other than the Seller Entities and
their Affiliates. This shall affect the timing and amount of payments
required under each Seller Note in the same manner as if the Purchaser has
made a permitted prepayment thereunder.   (e) PROCEDURES. If a party hereto
seeks indemnification under this Article VIII, such party (the "INDEMNIFIED
PARTY") shall promptly give written notice to the other party (the
"INDEMNIFYING PARTY") after receiving written notice of any action, lawsuit,
proceeding, investigation, or other claim against it (if by a third party) or
discovering the liability, obligation, or facts giving rise to such claim for
indemnification, describing the claim, the amount thereof (if known and
quantifiable), and the basis thereof; provided that the failure to so notify
the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
obligations hereunder except to the extent such failure shall have prejudiced
the Indemnifying Party. In that regard, if any action, lawsuit, proceeding,
investigation, or other claim shall be brought or asserted by any third party
which, if adversely determined, would entitle the Indemnified Party to
indemnity pursuant to this Article VIII, the Indemnified Party shall promptly
notify the Indemnifying Party of the same in writing, specifying in detail
the basis of such claim and the facts pertaining thereto and the Indemnifying
Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such action,
lawsuit, proceeding, investigation, or other claim giving rise to the
Indemnified Party\'s claim for indemnification at the Indemnifying
Party\'s expense and option and (subject to the limitations set forth below)
shall be entitled to control and appoint lead counsel of such defense
(including the defense of a particular claim in a proceeding involving multi-
party claims) with reputable counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified
Party; provided that, as a condition precedent to the Indemnifying Party\'s
right to assume control of such defense, it must first agree in writing to be
fully responsible for all Losses relating to such claims and to provide full
indemnification to the Indemnified Party for all Losses relating to such
claim; and provided further that the Indemnifying Party shall not have the
right to assume control of such defense (but shall have the right to
participate) and shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel
reasonably acceptable to the Seller retained by the Indemnified Party, if the
claim which the Indemnifying Party seeks to assume control (each, an
"INDEMNIFIED PARTY CONTROLLED PROCEEDING") (i) involves or relates to abuse,
neglect, mistreatment or other misconduct relating to a client managed or
served, directly or indirectly, by any Acquired Company, (ii) involves a
claim to which the Indemnified Party reasonably believes could be detrimental
to or injure the Indemnified Party\'s reputation, customer or supplier
relations or future business prospects, (iii) seeks non-monetary
relief (except where non-monetary relief is merely incidental to a primary
claim or claims for monetary damages), (iv) involves criminal allegations,
(v) is one in which the Indemnifying Party is also a party and joint
representation would be inappropriate or there may be legal defenses
available to the Indemnified Party which are different from or additional to
those available to the Indemnifying Party, or (vi)    48    involves a
claim which, upon petition by the Indemnified Party, the appropriate court
rules that the Indemnifying Party failed or is failing to
vigorously prosecute or defend. With respect to actions, lawsuits,
proceedings and investigations or other claims asserted by a third party
which are outstanding as of the Closing Date, if the Seller Entities are
currently defending such action, lawsuit, proceeding, investigation or other
claim, the Seller Entities shall have the right to control such defense
subject to the right of the Purchaser Parties to divest the Seller Entities
of such right if such action, lawsuit, proceeding, investigation or other
claim would be an Indemnified Party Controlled Proceeding hereunder.
Similarly, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Seller
Entities shall have the right to control the disposition of the matter
referred to in Section 8.2(a)(vii). Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, the Purchaser shall have the right to control the disposition of
the matter referred to in Section 8.2(a)(x); provided, however, that the
Purchaser shall use its reasonable efforts to mitigate the amount of any
Losses suffered by the Purchaser Parties in connection with such matter.  
If the Indemnifying Party is permitted to assume and control the defense and
elects to do so, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ counsel
separate from counsel employed by the Indemnifying Party in any such action
and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such
counsel employed by the Indemnified Party shall be at the expense of
the Indemnified Party unless the employment thereof has been specifically
authorized by the Indemnifying Party in writing.   If the Indemnifying
Party shall control the defense of any such claim, the Indemnifying Party
shall obtain the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which shall
not be unreasonably withheld) before entering into any settlement of a claim
or ceasing to defend such claim, if pursuant to or as a result of such
settlement or cessation, injunction, or other equitable relief will be
imposed against the Indemnified Party or if such settlement does not
expressly unconditionally release the Indemnified Party from all
liabilities and obligations with respect to such claim.   (f) TAX
TREATMENT. Amounts paid to or on behalf of a Seller Entity or the Purchaser
as indemnification shall be treated as adjustments to the Purchase Price for
Tax purposes.   ARTICLE IX -- ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS   SECTION 9.1 PRESS
RELEASES AND ANNOUNCEMENTS. Before the Closing Date, no press releases
related to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated herein, or other
announcements to the employees, customers, or suppliers of any Acquired
Company shall be issued by any Party without the mutual approval of all
Parties, except for any public disclosure which any Party in good faith
believes is required by law or regulation (in which case the disclosure shall
be prepared jointly by the Seller and the Purchaser). After the Closing Date,
no press releases related to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
herein, or other announcements to the employees, customers, or suppliers of
any Acquired Company shall be issued by the Parent, the Seller or their
respective Affiliates without the prior approval of the Purchaser, except for
any public disclosure which the    49    Seller in good faith believes
is required by law or regulation (in which case the disclosure shall be
prepared jointly by the Seller and the Purchaser).   SECTION 9.2 FURTHER
TRANSFERS. Each Party shall execute and deliver such further instruments of
conveyance and transfer and take such additional action as any other Party
may reasonably request to effect, consummate, confirm, or evidence the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.   SECTION 9.3
SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE. The Seller Entities acknowledge that the Acquired
Companies\' businesses are unique and recognize and affirm that in the event
of a breach of this Agreement by the Seller Entities, money damages may be
inadequate and the Purchaser may have no adequate remedy at law. Accordingly,
the Seller Entities agree that the Purchaser shall have the right, in
addition to any other rights and remedies existing in its favor, to enforce
its rights and the Seller Entities\' obligations hereunder not only by
an action or actions for damages but also by an action or actions for
specific performance, injunctive, and/or other equitable relief, in each case
without the requirement of posting a bond or proving actual damages.  
SECTION 9.4 EXPENSES. The Parties shall pay all of their own fees, costs, and
expenses (including, without limitation, fees, costs and expenses of legal
counsel, accountants, investment bankers, brokers, or other representatives
and consultants and appraisal fees, costs, and expenses) incurred in
connection with the negotiation of this Agreement and the other agreements
contemplated hereby, the performance of its obligations hereunder
and thereunder, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby (collectively, the "TRANSACTION EXPENSES"); it being understood
that if the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, the Company
shall reimburse the Purchaser and its investors for all of their Transaction
Expenses; it being further understood that no such Transaction Expenses of
the Purchaser shall be recorded on the books of the Company prior to the
Closing or taken into account in the Cash Amount or the Net Working Capital
Amount. At the request of the Seller, the Transaction Expenses for which the
Seller is liable pursuant to this SECTION 9.4 may be deducted from the
Purchase Price and paid directly to the Seller\'s legal counsel, investment
bankers and other agents and representatives. To the extent that any Acquired
Company pays or becomes liable with respect to any Transaction Expenses of
the Seller Entities or any Acquired Company, the Purchase Price shall be
reduced dollar-for-dollar.   SECTION 9.5 NONCOMPETITION, NONSOLICITATION,
AND CONFIDENTIALITY. From and after the Closing:   (a) NONCOMPETITION. In
consideration of the mutual covenants provided for herein to the Seller
Entities at the Closing, during the period beginning on the Closing Date and
ending on the third anniversary of the Closing Date (the "NONCOMPETE
PERIOD"), the Seller Entities shall not, and the Seller Entities shall cause
their Affiliates to not, engage (whether as an owner, operator, manager,
employee, officer, director, consultant, advisor, representative, or
otherwise) directly or indirectly in any Acquired Company\'s business as
presently conducted which is the business that provides home or community
based services to (i) at-risk children and youth who are behaviorally   
50    and/or medically involved, (ii) individuals with mental retardation
and/or development disabilities, (iii) individuals with acquired brain injury
or (iv) the elderly, in each case, anywhere within the United States;
provided, that engaging in the existing business of the Seller Entities and
their other Affiliates (including, without limitation, participation in joint
ventures) as currently conducted on the date hereof shall not be deemed a
violation of the foregoing; provided further that ownership of less than 5%
of the outstanding stock of any publicly traded corporation shall not be
deemed to be engaging solely by reason thereof in any of its businesses. The
Parties hereto agree that the covenant set forth in this SECTION 9.5 is
reasonable with respect to its duration, geographical area, and scope. If the
final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or
provision of this SECTION 9.5 is invalid or unenforceable, the Parties agree
that the court making the determination of invalidity or unenforceability
shall have the power to reduce the scope, duration, or area of the term or
provision, to delete specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or
unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and
enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid
or unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable
as so modified after the expiration of the time within which the judgment may
be appealed.   (b) NONSOLICITATION. The Seller Entities agree that, during
the Noncompete Period, they will not (and will cause their Affiliates to not)
directly or indirectly contact, approach, or solicit (other than a generally
public solicitation such as a newspaper advertisement) for the purpose of
offering employment to or hiring (whether as an employee, consultant,
agent, independent contractor, or otherwise) any Person employed by, or under
contract with, any Acquired Company, the Purchaser or any of their
Affiliates, at any time before the Closing Date or during the Noncompete
Period, without the prior written consent of the Purchaser.   (c)
CONFIDENTIALITY. The Seller Entities shall treat and hold as confidential any
information concerning the business and affairs of the Acquired Companies
(including, without limitation, all Proprietary Rights) that is not already
generally available to the public (the "CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION"), refrain
from using or disclosing any of the Confidential Information (i) except in
connection with this Agreement or (ii) unless and only to the extent that
such disclosure (after making reasonable efforts to avoid such disclosure and
after advising and consulting with the Purchaser about possibly making, and
the proposed contents of, such disclosure) is, in the opinion of the Seller
Entities\' legal counsel, required by applicable law, and at any time upon
the reasonable request of the Purchaser deliver promptly to the Purchaser or
destroy, at the request and option of the Purchaser, all tangible embodiments
(and all copies) of the Confidential Information which are in its possession
or under its control other than any information the Seller Entities are
required by law or regulation to maintain. In the event that either of
the Seller Entities is requested or required (by oral question or request
for information or documents in any legal proceeding, interrogatory,
subpoena, civil investigative demand, or similar process) to disclose any
Confidential Information, it shall notify the Purchaser promptly of the
request or requirement so that the Purchaser may seek an appropriate
protective order or waive compliance with the provisions of this SECTION
9.5(c).   (d) TRADE NAMES. The Seller Entities shall not use or permit any
of their Affiliates to use the "National Mentor," "Mentor Network," or
"Mentor" name (or any other    51    trademarks, service marks, trade
dress, trade names, logos or names used by any Acquired Company) or any names
or symbols likely to be confusingly similar thereto in any manner anywhere in
the world after Closing.   (e) REMEDY FOR BREACH. Each Seller Entity
acknowledges and agrees that in the event of a breach of any of the
provisions of this SECTION 9.5, monetary damages shall not constitute a
sufficient remedy. Consequently, in the event of any such breach, the
Company, the Purchaser, and/or their respective successors or assigns may, in
addition to other rights and remedies existing in their favor, apply to any
court of law or equity of competent jurisdiction for specific performance
and/or injunctive or other relief in order to enforce or prevent any
violations of the provisions hereof, in each case without the requirement of
posting a bond or proving actual damages.   SECTION 9.6 TAX MATTERS.  
(a) CERTAIN DEFINITIONS. As used in this Agreement:    "PARENT TAX GROUP"
means the Affiliated Group of  which the Parent is the common parent.

REFUNDS, CREDITS AND TRANSFER TAXES.   (i) (A) The Seller Entities shall
prepare, or  cause to be prepared, all Tax Returns of or including each of
the  Acquired Companies for all Pre-Closing Periods (the "PRE-CLOSING

Taxes with respect to Pre-Closing Period Returns. The Seller  Entities shall
timely file, or cause to be timely filed, all such  Pre-Closing Period
Returns of or including the Acquired Companies that  are due on or before the

Returns.    (B) The Seller Entities shall prepare and  provide the
Purchaser with Pre-Closing Period Returns, other than  Pre-Closing Period

the Parent, the  Consolidated Subsidiaries (as defined below) will timely

The Purchaser shall have the right to review and comment on  such   
52     Tax Returns (including any amended returns) prior to filing, and
the  parties shall resolve in good faith, and make any appropriate changes 
to such Tax Returns with respect to, any issues arising as a result of  such
review and comment process. Promptly upon the finalization of  such Tax
Returns and in any case prior to the time such Tax Return is  required to be
filed, the Seller shall deliver to the Purchaser (i) an  original of such Tax
Return and (ii) a check payable to the  appropriate taxing authority in the
amount of any Taxes shown as due  thereon. If the Seller timely delivers such
Tax Return and check  payable to the appropriate tax authority as provided in

Returns to  be executed by the appropriate officer and shall file such
Returns,  together with the appropriate payment, on a timely basis.   (ii)
The Parent will include the income of each  of the Acquired Companies which
is a member of the Parent Tax Group  (the "CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES")

loss accounts  taken into income under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-19
or any  similar provisions of state, local or foreign law) on the Parent

unitary (or similar) state, local or foreign income Tax  Returns for all
periods through the Closing Date in accordance with  the Parent\'s and
Consolidated Subsidiaries\' past custom and practice  and pay any income
Taxes attributable to such income. At the request  of the Parent, the

for inclusion in such Tax Returns in  accordance with the Consolidated

Purchaser with copies of such Tax  Returns at least ten (10) business days
prior to the due date thereof  (giving effect to any extensions thereto) and
will allow the Purchaser  an opportunity to review and comment upon such Tax
Returns (including  any amended returns) to the extent that they relate to
the  Consolidated Subsidiaries, and the parties shall resolve in good faith 
any issues arising as a result of such review. The income of the 
Consolidated Subsidiaries will be apportioned to the period up to and 
including the Closing Date and the period after the Closing Date by  closing
the books of the Consolidated Subsidiaries as of the end of  the Closing
Date.   (iii) The Purchaser shall prepare, or cause to be  prepared, and
shall file, or cause to be filed, on a timely basis all  Tax Returns of or
including each Acquired Company for the Straddle  Period (the "STRADDLE
PERIOD RETURNS"). The Purchaser shall pay, or  cause to be paid, all Taxes
shown to be due on such Tax Returns.   (iv) Any Tax refunds that are
received by the  Purchaser (or to the extent such refund is payable but not
paid due to  such refund being offset against other Taxes of the Purchaser,
any  amounts credited against Taxes of the Purchaser with respect to such 
refunds) arising from taxable periods of the Acquired Companies ending  on or
before the Closing Date shall be for the account of the Seller,  and the
Purchaser shall pay over to the Seller any such refund (or  credit against,
as the case may be) within 15 days after receipt  thereof.    53    
(v) The Purchaser shall provide the Parent with  copies of any Straddle
Period Returns at least ten (10) business days  prior to the due date thereof
(giving effect to any extensions  thereto), accompanied by a statement
calculating in reasonable detail  the Parent\'s indemnification obligation
pursuant to SECTION 9.6(c)  hereof (the "INDEMNIFICATION STATEMENT"). The
Parent shall have the  right to review such Straddle Period Returns and
Indemnification  Statement prior to the filing of such Straddle Period
Returns. If the  Parent disputes any amounts shown due on such Tax Returns or
the  amount calculated in the Indemnification Statement, the Parent and the 
Purchaser shall consult and resolve in good faith any issues arising  as a
result of the review of such Straddle Period Return and  Indemnification
Statement. If the Parent agrees to the Indemnification  Statement amount, the
Parent shall pay to the Purchaser an amount  equal to the Taxes shown on the
Indemnification Statement not later  than three days before the due date
(including any extensions thereof)  for payment of Taxes with respect to such
Straddle Period Return. If  the Parties are unable to resolve any dispute
within five (5) business  days after the Parent\'s receipt of such Straddle
Period Return and  Indemnification Statement, the Purchaser and the Parent
will jointly  retain the Firm as selected pursuant to Section 2.4(a) to
resolve any  such disputes and the Firm shall resolve any such issues in
dispute as  promptly as practicable. If the Firm is unable to make a
determination  with respect to any disputed issue prior to the due date
(including  any extensions) for the filing of the Straddle Period Return in 
question, (A) the Purchaser shall file, or shall cause to be filed,  such
Straddle Period Return without such determination having been  made and (B)
the Parent shall pay to the Purchaser, not later than  three days before the
due date (including any extensions thereof) for  the payment of Taxes with
respect to such Straddle Period Return, an  amount determined by the Parent
as the proper amount chargeable to the  Parent pursuant to this SECTION 9.6.
Upon delivery to the Parent and  the Purchaser by the Firm of its
determination, appropriate  adjustments shall be made to the amount paid by
the Parent in  accordance with the immediately preceding sentence in order to
reflect  the decision of the Firm. The determination by the Firm shall be 
final, conclusive and binding on the parties.   (vi) If a notice of
deficiency, proposed  adjustment, assessment, audit, examination or other
administrative or  court proceeding, suit, dispute or other claim (a "TAX
CLAIM") shall  be delivered, sent, commenced, or initiated to or against
Purchaser or  any of the Acquired Companies by any Taxing authority with
respect to  Taxes that results in or may result in a loss for which 
indemnification may be claimed from the Seller Entities under this 
Agreement, Purchaser shall promptly (but in any event within 15 days  after
receipt of such Tax Claim) notify Parent of such Tax Claim.  Parent shall
have the sole right to represent the Acquired Companies\'  interests and to
employ counsel of its choice at its expense with  respect to any such Tax
Claim; PROVIDED THAT in the case of any Tax  Claim relating to any Tax for
any Straddle Period Return which each of  Purchaser and Parent may be liable,
Purchaser and Parent shall each be  entitled to participate at their own
expense in such Tax Claim to the  extent it relates to a Tax for which such
party bears liability  pursuant to this Section 9.6. No party may settle or
otherwise dispose  of any Tax Claim for which another party may have a
liability under  Section 9.6 without the prior written consent of such other
party,  which consent may not be unreasonably withheld.    54    
(vii) The Parent will not elect to retain any net  operating loss carryovers
or capital loss carryovers of the  Consolidated Subsidiaries under Treasury
Regulation Section  1.1502-20(g). The Purchaser shall not carryback any post-
acquisition  Tax attribute of any of the Consolidated Subsidiaries into any
of the  Parent\'s consolidated, combined, or unitary (or similar) Tax
Return.   (viii) The Seller Entities and the Purchaser shall  reasonably
cooperate, and shall cause their respective Affiliates,  officers, employees,
agents, auditors and representatives reasonably  to cooperate, in preparing
and filing all Tax Returns (including  amended returns and claims for
refund), including maintaining and  making available to each other employees
and all records necessary in  connection with Taxes and in resolving all
disputes and audits with  respect to all taxable periods relating to
Taxes.   (ix) Notwithstanding any other provisions of  this Agreement to
the contrary, all sales, use, transfer, gains,  stamp, duties, recording and
similar Taxes incurred in connection with  the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement shall be paid equally  by the Seller and the Purchaser. The
Seller shall file or cause to be  filed all necessary Tax Returns and other
documentation with respect  to such Taxes and the Seller and the Purchaser
shall share equally the  expense of such filings. If required by applicable
law, the Purchaser  will join in the execution of any such Tax Returns or
such other  documentation.   (x) All Tax allocation, Tax sharing or
similar  agreements to which any of the Acquired Companies are bound shall
be  terminated as of the time of the Closing and, after such time, neither 
of the Purchaser nor any of Acquired Companies shall be bound thereby  or
have any liability thereunder.   (c) TAX INDEMNIFICATION.   (i) From and
after the Closing Date, the Seller  Entities shall protect, defend, indemnify
and hold harmless the  Purchaser, the Acquired Companies and their Affiliates
from any and  all Taxes imposed on the Purchaser or any of the Acquired
Companies  and any Loss resulting from (A) for all taxable periods (or
portions  thereof) beginning before and ending on or prior to the Closing
Date,  including, without limitation, any Taxes imposed as a result of the 
Section 338(h)(10) Election, (B) the several liability of any of the 
Acquired Companies pursuant to Treas. Reg. Section 1.1502-6 or any  analogous
state, local or foreign law or regulation or by reason of  its having been a
member of any consolidated, combined or unitary  group on or prior to the
Closing Date, (C) its ceasing to be a member  of the Parent Tax Group, (D)
the breach of any of the Parent Tax  Group\'s covenants set forth in this
Section 9.6, (E) breaches of  representations and warranties in Section 5.10,
or (F) any Tax  allocation or Tax sharing or similar agreement, as a
transferee or  successor, by contract or otherwise. The indemnification under
this  Section 9.6(c) and the indemnification for Taxes set forth elsewhere 
in Section 9.6 hereof shall not be subject to the indemnification  Basket and
Cap forth in Section 8.2(b).    55     (ii) For purposes of SECTION
9.6(c)(i), in the  case of any Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis and
are payable  for a Straddle Period, the portion of such Tax which relates to
the  portion of such Tax period beginning before and ending on the Closing 
Date shall (A) in the case of any Taxes other than Taxes based upon or 
related to income or receipts, be deemed to be the amount of such Tax  for
the entire Tax period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of  which is
the number of days in the Tax period ending on the Closing  Date and the
denominator of which is the number of days in the entire  Tax period and (B)
in the case of any Tax based upon or related to  income or receipts, be
deemed equal to the amount which would be  payable if the relevant Tax period
ended on the Closing Date.   (d) SECTION 338(h)(10) ELECTION. The Parent, at
the request of the Purchaser, will join with the Purchaser in making a
timely election under Code Section 338(h)(10) (and any corresponding
elections under state, local, or foreign tax law) (collectively, the "SECTION
338(h)(10) ELECTION") with respect to the purchase and sale or deemed
purchase and sale of the stock of any or all of the Acquired Companies
hereunder. The Parent will pay any Tax attributable to the making of the
Section 338(h)(10) Election and will indemnify the Purchaser and the Acquired
Companies against any Losses arising out of any failure to pay such Tax. The
Purchaser shall prepare Internal Revenue Service Form 8023 with respect to
the Acquired Companies and such other forms and schedules as are necessary or
required to the make the Section 338(h)(10) Election, and, subject to the
Parent\'s approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, the Parent and
the Purchaser shall execute such Form 8023 and such other forms and
schedules, and shall take all such other acts as are necessary to make or
perfect such Section 338(h)(10) Election.   (e) ALLOCATION OF PURCHASE
PRICE. The Parties agree that the purchase price for and the liabilities of
the Consolidated Subsidiaries (plus other relevant items) will be allocated
to the assets of the Consolidated Subsidiaries for all Tax purposes in
accordance with Section 338 of the Code and the regulations thereunder and
the procedures set forth on the "ALLOCATION SCHEDULE" attached hereto. The
Purchaser, the Consolidated Subsidiaries, the Parent and their Affiliates
shall file all Tax Returns (including, but not limited to Internal Revenue
Service Form 8594 and any other corresponding state and local forms) required
by applicable law in connection with such allocation.   SECTION 9.7 LEGEND
FOR THE RESTRICTED SECURITIES.   (a) Restricted Securities are transferable
only pursuant to (i) public offerings registered under the Securities Act,
(ii) Rule 144 or Rule 144A of the Securities and Exchange Commission (or any
similar rule or rules then in force) if such rule is available and (iii)
subject to the conditions specified in Section 9.7(b) below, any other
legally available means of transfer.   (b) In connection with the transfer
of any Restricted Securities (other than a transfer described in clauses (i)
or (ii) of Section 9.7(a) above), the holder thereof shall deliver written
notice to the Purchaser describing in reasonable detail the transfer or
proposed transfer, together with an opinion of counsel which (to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Purchaser) is knowledgeable in securities law
matters to the effect that such transfer of Restricted Securities may
be    56    effected without registration of such Restricted Securities
under the Securities Act. In addition, if the holder of the Restricted
Securities delivers to the Purchaser an opinion of counsel that no subsequent
transfer of such Restricted Securities shall require registration under the
Securities Act, the Purchaser shall promptly upon such contemplated transfer
deliver new certificates for such Restricted Securities which do not bear the
Securities Act legend set forth in Section 9.7(d). If the Purchaser is not
required to deliver new certificates for such Restricted Securities not
bearing such legend, the holder thereof shall not transfer the same until the
prospective transferee has confirmed to the Purchaser in writing its
agreement to be bound by the conditions contained in this Section 9.7(b) and
Section 9.7(d) below.   (c) If any Restricted Securities become eligible
for sale pursuant to Rule 144(k), the Purchaser shall, upon the request of
the holder of such Restricted Securities, remove the legend set forth
in Section 9.7(d) below from the certificates for such Restricted
Securities.   (d) Each certificate or instrument representing Restricted
Securities shall be imprinted with a legend in substantially the following
form:   "THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN 
REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED OR ANY STATE 
SECURITIES LAWS. THE TRANSFER OF THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS 
CERTIFICATE IS SUBJECT TO THE CONDITIONS RELATING TO SECURITIES LAWS 
SPECIFIED IN THE STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT, DATED AS OF JANUARY 18,  2001, AS
AMENDED AND MODIFIED FROM TIME TO TIME, BY AND AMONG THE  ISSUER AND CERTAIN
INVESTORS, AND THE ISSUER RESERVES THE RIGHT TO  REFUSE THE TRANSFER OF SUCH
SECURITIES UNTIL SUCH CONDITIONS HAVE BEEN  FULFILLED WITH RESPECT TO SUCH
TRANSFER. A COPY OF SUCH CONDITIONS  SHALL BE FURNISHED BY THE ISSUER TO THE
HOLDER HEREOF UPON WRITTEN  REQUEST AND WITHOUT CHARGE."  Notwithstanding
any of the foregoing in this Section 9.7, the Purchaser acknowledges and
agrees that the Restricted Securities owned by the Seller Entities will be
pledged as collateral under the Parent Credit Agreement or any replacements
or refinancings thereof and that no further action, permission or opinions
are required to be given by the Seller Entities to the Purchaser to pledge
the Restricted Securities under the Parent Credit Agreement or
any replacements or refinancings thereof.   SECTION 9.8 COMPANY EMPLOYEES.
As of the Closing Date, the Company shall continue to maintain the Company\'s
group health plan for the benefit of its employees. Employees of the Company
who participate in such plan will continue to be eligible to participate in
such plan and all payments made by such employees toward deductible, out-of-
pocket and co-payment obligation limits under such plan for the plan year
which includes the Closing Date will continue to be recognized under such
plan. The Company will also recognize past service with the Company for
eligibility and vesting purposes under the Company\'s benefit plans.   
57     SECTION 9.9 SELLER NOTE MATTERS. If (i) the Seller Note B
Amount is greater than zero and (ii) the Senior Credit Facility is further
syndicated during the twelve month period following the Closing Date such
that the Senior Debt Financing Amount after such further syndication exceeds
the Senior Debt Financing Amount on the Closing Date, then the Company shall
make a prepayment on the Seller Note B (such prepayment to be applied first
in payment of accrued and unpaid interest and second in repayment of
outstanding principal) in an amount equal to the lesser of (A) the
outstanding principal balance and accrued and unpaid interest on the Seller
Note B and (B) the product of (i) the Senior Debt Financing Amount after such
further syndication MINUS the Senior Debt Financing Amount on the Closing
Date and (ii) the quotient of five divided by nine; provided, however, that
the Company shall not be obligated to make such prepayment at any time when
the Company is in default under the Senior Credit Facility or any replacement
thereof. Any repayment of a Seller Note required to be made by the Company
pursuant to this Section 9.9 shall be made within three business days of the
time when the Company has increased the Senior Credit Facility as
contemplated above in an amount to make such payment. Notwithstanding any
rights the Seller (or other holders of the Seller Notes) may have to receive
payments in priority over the Purchaser\'s other subordinated lenders and
investors, the Seller hereby agrees that the Company may grant to its other
investors and subordinated lenders the right to be paid the portion of any
increase in the Senior Debt Financing Amount referred to above that is
not required to be paid to the holder of the Seller Note B pursuant to this
SECTION 9.9; provided, however, that the Seller (or other holders of the
Seller Note B) shall be paid pursuant to this Section on a pari passu basis
with such other investors and subordinated lenders.   SECTION 9.10 USE OF
MAGELLAN NAME. The Purchaser agrees and acknowledges that the Acquired
Companies have no rights to use the "Magellan" name. From and after the
Closing, the Purchaser shall not use or permit any of the Acquired Companies
to use in any manner whatsoever the "Magellan" name (or any variation
thereof) and shall promptly remove all trade dress, physical characteristics,
color combinations and other indications of operation under the Magellan
name, including, without limitation, signage, from any premises from or at
which the businesses of the Acquired Companies are operated.   SECTION 9.11
INSURANCE MATTERS. The Seller Entities covenant and agree as follows:   (a)
the Seller Entities will continue to maintain the insurance policies that are
required to be set forth on the INSURANCE SCHEDULE (the "INSURANCE POLICIES")
(or if such policies are terminated, substantially equivalent policies) for
the benefit of the Acquired Companies, with respect to occurrences prior to
the Closing Date, regardless of whether claims are brought prior to or after
the Closing Date;   (b) except to the extent after the Closing that
the Acquired Companies do not comply with the terms of the Insurance Policies
which are applicable to them, the Acquired Companies will continue to
enjoy substantially the same rights and benefits under the Insurance Policies
after the Closing, with respect to occurrences prior to the Closing,
regardless of whether claims are brought prior to or after the Closing;   
58     (c) except to the extent after the Closing that the Acquired
Companies do not comply with the terms of the Insurance Policies which are
applicable to them, the Acquired Companies will have the right to tender
all claims for all occurrences that occur prior to the Closing Date to the
Insurance Policies regardless of when the claim is brought;   (d) the
Seller Entities will use their reasonable best efforts to assist the Acquired
Companies in tendering claims to the applicable insurers under the Insurance
Policies and to provide the Acquired Companies with proceeds in a timely
fashion of all claims made by or with respect to the Acquired Companies under
the Insurance Policies;   (e) the Acquired Companies will use their
reasonable best efforts to assist the Seller Entities in tendering claims to
the applicable insurers under the Insurance Policies;   (f) the Seller
Entities will be responsible for satisfying any deductibles, retentions and
other retained amounts on insurance coverage with respect to all claims made
under the Insurance Policies; and   (g) the Parent shall purchase, at its
own cost and expense, prior to the Closing Date, for the benefit of the
Acquired Companies, an insurance policy (or an extension of an existing
policy) that has the effect of making the general and professional liability
insurance of the Acquired Companies an occurrence based policy for all dates
prior to the Closing Date (e.g., the Parent shall purchase a "tail" to the
claims made based professional liability policy that began in June 2000) and
the Acquired Companies shall have the right to make claims under such newly
purchased insurance policy as provided in this Section 9.11 as if such
insurance policy were an Insurance Policy for purposes of this Section
9.11.   ARTICLE X -- MISCELLANEOUS   SECTION 10.1 AMENDMENT AND WAIVER.
