days after the Closing Date, Buyer will deliver to the Seller Representative
a reasonably detailed statement (the " _Closing Statement_ ") setting forth
Buyers good faith calculations of (i) Cash on Hand, (ii) the Indebtedness

4  For all purposes of this _Section 1.04_, Cash on Hand, the Indebtedness
Payoff Amount and the Net Working Capital shall be determined in accordance
with the respective definitions thereof. After delivery of the Closing
Statement by Buyer to the Seller Representative hereunder (including, without
limitation, during the period of any dispute hereunder with respect to the
Closing Statement and/or any of the calculations set forth thereon), Buyer
shall, and shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to, (I) assist the
Seller Representative and its representatives in their review of the Closing
Statement and the calculations set forth thereon and provide the Seller
Representative and its representatives reasonable access to the books, work
papers (including the work papers of Buyers and/or the Companys accountants)
and other records (including schedules, memoranda and other
documents), supporting data, facilities, accountants and employees of Buyer,
the Company and its Subsidiaries for purposes of their review of the Closing
Statement and the calculations set forth thereon, and (II) cooperate with the
Seller Representative and its representatives in connection with such review,
including by providing on a timely basis all other information that the Seller
Representative (in good faith) reasonably believes is necessary and/or useful

set forth thereon. If the Seller Representative has any objections to the
Closing Statement and/or any of Buyers calculations of Cash on Hand, the
Indebtedness Payoff Amount and/or the Net Working Capital Amount set forth
thereon, the Seller Representative may deliver to Buyer a statement setting
forth the Seller Representatives objections thereto (an " _Objections
Statement_ "). If an Objections Statement is not delivered to Buyer within 45
days after delivery by Buyer of the Closing Statement to the Seller
Representative, the Closing Statement shall be final and binding upon, and
non-appealable by, the parties hereto.

 

(ii) If an Objections Statement is delivered to Buyer, then the Closing
Statement and the calculations of Cash on Hand, the Indebtedness Payoff
Amount and the Net Working Capital Amount set forth thereon, each as revised
in accordance with this _Section 1.04(a)(ii)_, shall become final and binding
upon the parties on the earlier of (a) the date any and all matters specified
in the Objections Statement are finally resolved in writing by the Seller
Representative and Buyer and (b) the date any and all matters specified in the
Objections Statement not resolved by the Seller Representative and Buyer are
finally resolved in writing by the Independent Auditor (as defined below). The
Closing Statement and the calculations of Cash on Hand, the Indebtedness
Payoff Amount and the Net Working Capital Amount set forth thereon (as
applicable) shall be revised to the extent necessary to reflect any
resolution by the Seller Representative and Buyer and any final resolution
made by the Independent Auditor in accordance with this _Section
1.04(a)(ii)_. During the 30 day period immediately following the delivery of
an Objections Statement (or such longer period as the Seller Representative
and Buyer may agree in writing), the Seller Representative and Buyer shall
negotiate in good faith to resolve any objections set forth in the Objections
Statement (and all such discussions related thereto shall, unless otherwise
agreed by Buyer and the Seller Representative, be governed by Rule 408 of the
Federal Rules of Evidence (and any applicable similar state rule)). At
the end of such 30-day period, the Seller Representative and Buyer shall
submit to Grant Thornton LLP (the " _Independent Auditor_ ") for review and
resolution in accordance with the terms and provisions hereof, any and all
matters (but only such matters) which remain in dispute with respect to the
Objections Statement, the Closing Statement and/or any of the calculations set
forth thereon; _provided_ that, if Grant Thornton LLP is unable or unwilling
to act as the Independent Auditor for any reason, then Buyer and the Seller
Representative will, by mutual agreement, promptly select another accounting
firm to act as the "Independent Auditor" and such firm shall be deemed to be
the "Independent Auditor" for purposes hereof. The Seller Representative and
Buyer shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Independent
Auditor to resolve all such disagreements as soon as practicable (which final
resolution by the Independent Auditor shall be requested by Buyer and the
Seller Representative to be delivered not more than 30 days following

 



5  submission of such disputed matters to the Independent Auditor), and Buyer
and the Seller Representative shall cooperate with the Independent Auditor
during its engagement. The Independent Auditor may consider only those items
and amounts in the Closing Statement and/or Objection Notice which Buyer and
the Seller Representative are unable to resolve. In resolving any disputed
item, the Independent Auditor may not assign a value to any item greater than
the greatest value for such item claimed by either of Buyer or the Seller
Representative or less than the smallest value for such item claimed by either
of Buyer or the Seller Representative. The Independent
Auditors determination shall be based solely on written submissions by Buyer
and the Seller Representative that are in accordance with the applicable
guidelines and procedures set forth herein (i.e., not on the basis of
independent review) and on the definitions included herein. The resolution of
the dispute by the Independent Auditor shall be final, binding and non-
appealable by the parties hereto. As noted above, the Closing Statement and
the calculations of Cash on Hand, the Indebtedness Payoff Amount and the Net
Working Capital Amount set forth thereon (as applicable) shall be modified if
necessary to reflect such determination(s). The fees and expenses of the
Independent Auditor shall be allocated to be paid by Buyer, on the one hand,
and/or the Sellers, on the other hand, based upon the percentage which the
portion of the contested amount not awarded to each party bears to the amount
actually contested by such party, as determined by the Independent Auditor.
For example, if the Seller Representative claims the Net Working Capital
Amount is $2,000 greater than the amount determined by Buyer, and Buyer
contests only $1,000 of the amount claimed by the Seller Representative, and
if the Independent Auditor ultimately resolves the dispute by awarding the
Sellers $600 of the $1,000 contested, then the costs and expenses of
arbitration will be allocated 60% (i.e., 600 ÷ 1,000) to Buyer and 40% (i.e.,
400 ÷ 1,000) to the Sellers. The obligation of any Seller to pay such amount
of the Independent Auditors fees and expenses determined by the Independent
Auditors to be paid by the Sellers shall be several and not joint and shall be
limited to such Sellers Percentage Share of such amount. 

(b) _Post-Closing Adjustments_.

(i) _Cash On Hand Adjustment_. If the Cash on Hand as finally determined
pursuant to _Section 1.04(a)_ above is greater than the Estimated Cash on
Hand, Buyer shall pay to each Seller such Sellers Percentage Share of such
excess in accordance with _Section 1.04(c)_. If the Cash on Hand as finally
determined pursuant to _Section 1.04(a)_ above is less than the Estimated
Cash on Hand, the Sellers shall pay to Buyer an amount equal to such
shortfall in accordance with _Section 1.04(c)_, with each Seller being
required to pay such Sellers Percentage Share of such shortfall in accordance
with _Section 1.04(c)_.

 

(ii) _Net Working Capital Adjustment_. If the Net Working Capital Amount as
finally determined pursuant to  _Section 1.04(a)_ above is greater than the
Estimated Net Working Capital Amount, Buyer shall pay to each Seller such
Sellers Percentage Share of such excess in accordance with _Section
1.04(c)_. If the Net Working Capital Amount as finally determined pursuant to
_Section 1.04(a)_ above is less than the Estimated Net Working Capital
Amount, the Sellers shall pay to Buyer an amount equal to such shortfall in
accordance with _Section 1.04(c)_, with each Seller being required to pay
such Sellers Percentage Share of such shortfall in accordance with _Section
1.04(c)_.

(iii) _Indebtedness Payoff Amount Adjustment_. If the Indebtedness Payoff
Amount as finally determined pursuant to _Section 1.04(a)_ above is less than
the Estimated Indebtedness Payoff Amount, Buyer shall pay to each Seller such
Sellers Percentage Share of such shortfall in accordance with _Section
1.04(c)_. If the Indebtedness Payoff Amount as finally determined pursuant to
_Section 1.04(a)_ above is greater than the Estimated Indebtedness Payoff
Amount, the Sellers shall pay to Buyer an amount equal to such excess in
accordance with _Section 1.04(c)_, with each Seller being required to pay
such Sellers Percentage Share of such excess in accordance with _Section
1.04(c)_.

 



6 (c) _Final Adjustment Amount_. Without duplication, all amounts owed pursuant
to  _Section 1.04(b)(i)_, ( _ii_ ) and ( _iii_ ) shall be aggregated, and
the net amount (if any) owed by Buyer to the Sellers, on the one hand, or the
Sellers to Buyer, on the other hand, is referred to as the "
_Final Adjustment Amount_ "; it being understood and agreed that if the net
effect pursuant to this _Section 1.04(c)_ is an increase in the Common
Purchase Price, then Buyer shall make a cash payment to each Seller in an
amount equal to such Sellers Percentage Share of the Final Adjustment
Amount, and if the net effect pursuant to this _Section 1.04(c)_ is a
decrease in the Common Purchase Price, then each Seller shall pay to Buyer an
amount equal to such Sellers Percentage Share of such Final Adjustment
Amount. Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 1.04_ to the contrary, if
the Final Adjustment Amount is to be paid by the Sellers to Buyer, then the
Sellers obligation to pay such Final Adjustment Amount shall be first
satisfied from any then remaining balance in the Escrow Account, and in the
event that the then remaining balance in the Escrow Account is insufficient to
pay the Final Adjustment Amount in full, then the remaining unpaid portion of
the Final Adjustment Amount (i.e., the portion of the Final Adjustment Amount
that is not paid to Buyer from the Escrow Account) shall be paid directly by
the Sellers, with each Seller being required to pay such Sellers Percentage
Share of such remaining unpaid portion of the Final Adjustment Amount to Buyer
directly. The Final Adjustment Amount shall be calculated as an adjustment to
the Common Purchase Price and the Common Purchase Price, as so adjusted, is
referred to herein as the " _Final Common Purchase Price_." Payment of the
Final Adjustment Amount shall be paid by delivery of immediately available
funds to an account designated by the recipient party(ies) within
five business days after the date of final determination.

each Real Property Lease, except as set forth on  _Section 2.08(a)_ of the

the Companys knowledge, any of the other counterparties thereto is in

respects that: (i) records are maintained in reasonable detail that

report financial information. Except as set forth in  _Section 2.28_ of the
Disclosure Schedule, to the Companys knowledge, there have been no instances

where the Company or any of its Subsidiaries does business and (ii) all
applicable Laws relating to export control and trade sanctions or embargoes
(including the antiboycott prohibitions contained in 50 U.S.C. Sections 2401
et seq. and any applicable provisions of Section 999 of the Code).

_COVENANTS OF BUYER_

6.01 _Access to Books and Records_. From and after the Closing, Buyer shall,
and shall cause the Company to, provide the Seller Representative, the Sellers
and their authorized representatives with reasonable access, during normal
business hours, to the books, records (including accountants work papers),

respect to periods prior to the Closing Date and/or in connection with any
matter relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby. Unless otherwise consented to in writing by the Seller
Representative, Buyer shall not permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
for a period of seven years following the Closing Date, to destroy, alter
or otherwise dispose of any of its books and records, or any portions
thereof, relating to periods prior to the Closing Date and/or matters relating

giving at least thirty days prior written notice to the Seller Representative
and offering to surrender to the Seller Representative such books and records
or such portions thereof.

(a) After the Closing, Buyer shall, and shall cause the Company to continue

(and similar functionary) of the Company and its Subsidiaries (each a "
_Covered Person_ ") against any costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities of
any nature whatsoever, incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of or pertaining to matters existing or occurring
at or prior to Closing (excluding fraudulent, willful and criminal misconduct,
and excluding any claims under this Agreement against a Covered Person solely
in the Covered Persons capacity as a Seller party to this Agreement), whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Closing, to the fullest extent
that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries would have been required under
applicable law and/or any of the certificates of incorporation, by-laws and/or
other organizational documents of any of the Company and its Subsidiaries
(collectively, the " _Constitutive Documents_ ") in effect on the date hereof
(including the advancing of expenses as incurred to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable law); _provided_ , _however_ , the person to whom
such expenses are advanced provides an unsecured undertaking to the Company
to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such person is not
entitled to indemnification.

(b) During the period from the Closing until the six year anniversary of the
Closing Date, (x) Buyer shall cause the Constitutive Documents of the Company
and each of its Subsidiaries to contain the provisions with respect to
indemnification and exculpation set forth in the Constitutive Documents of
the Company and its Subsidiaries on the date of this Agreement, and (y) Buyer
shall not, and shall not permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
amend, repeal or modify any provision in the Constitutive Documents of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries relating to the exculpation or
indemnification of any Covered Person (unless required by law), it being the
intent of the parties that the Covered Persons shall continue to be
entitled to such exculpation and indemnification to the full extent of the
law.

 



29 (c) At the Closing, Buyer shall purchase a fully-paid up extended reporting
period endorsement under the Companys existing directors and officers
liability insurance coverage covering the Covered Persons who are presently
covered by the Companys and its Subsidiaries officers and
directors liability insurance policies with respect to actions and omissions
occurring at or prior to the Closing in a form reasonably acceptable to the
Seller Representative that shall provide such Covered Persons for six (6)
years following the Closing with coverage no less extensive than the existing
directors and officers liability insurance coverage maintained by the
Company and its Subsidiaries and having other terms no less favorable to the
Covered Persons covered thereby than the existing coverage.

(d) In the event that after the Closing Date, Buyer or the Company, or their
respective successors or assigns, (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Buyer or
the Company, as the case may be, honor the indemnification and other
obligations of such Persons, including under this Section 6.02.

(e) The provisions of this _Section 6.02_ are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each Covered Person.

6.03 _Conditions_. From the date hereof until the earlier to occur of the
Closing Date and the date that this Agreement is terminated in accordance
with its terms, on and subject to the terms and conditions hereof, Buyer shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the conditions set forth in

contemplated herein, in each case as promptly as practicable after the date
hereof.

6.04 _Contact with Customers, Suppliers, Etc_. Prior to the Closing, Buyer
shall not contact and/or communicate with, and shall cause its Affiliates,
representatives, agents and other advisors not to, contact and/or communicate
with any employee, officer, director, customer, supplier or other material
business relation of the Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby or otherwise with respect to
matters pertaining to the Company, any of its Subsidiaries and/or any of their
respective businesses, except those individuals identified on _Section 6.04_
of the Disclosure Schedule or with the prior written consent of the Seller
Representative or the Company.

6.05 _Employee Benefits_. For eligibility and vesting purposes under the
employee benefit plans of Buyer and its Affiliates providing benefits after
the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause each employee who is as of the Closing
Date an employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to be credited with
his or her years of service with the Company or such Subsidiary, as
applicable, before the Closing Date, to the same extent as such employee was
entitled, before the Closing Date, to credit for such service under any
similar Plans, except to the extent such credit would result in a duplication
of benefits. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the
foregoing: (i) Buyer shall provide that each employee shall be immediately
eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all employee
benefit plans sponsored by Buyer and its Affiliates for the benefit of
employees (such plans, collectively, the " _New Plans_ ") to the extent
coverage under such New Plan replaces coverage under a comparable employee
benefit plan in which such employee participated immediately before the
Closing Date (such Plans, collectively, the " _Old Plans_ "), unless such
waiting time applied under the Old Plans; and (ii) for purposes of each New
Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical or vision benefits to any
employee, Buyer shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and
actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such employee
and his or her covered dependents (unless such exclusions or requirements
applied under the Old Plans), and Buyer shall cause any eligible expenses
incurred by such employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion
of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such
employees participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken
into

 



30  account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible,
coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee
and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such
amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

6.06 _Confidentiality_. Buyer hereby agrees to be bound by the
Confidentiality Agreement, dated October 11, 2010, between Boise Inc. and
Houlihan Lokey Capital, Inc. (on behalf of the Company) (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "), with and to the same extent as Boise Inc., as
though originally party thereto, and Buyer acknowledges that it and its
representatives and advisors remain bound by the Confidentiality Agreement.
Without limiting the foregoing, prior to the Closing Date and after any
termination of this Agreement, Buyer shall hold and shall cause its
Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, accountants, counsel, consultants,
advisors and agents to hold, in confidence, all documents and information
concerning the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company or any Seller
furnished to Buyer or any of its Affiliates, officers, directors, employees,
accountants, counsel, consultants, advisors and/or agents in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in the manner and for the
term specified in the Confidentiality Agreement.

6.07 _WARN Act Notice_. For a period of ninety days after the Closing Date,
Buyer shall not, and shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries not to, take
any action as would trigger any liability under the WARN Act or any similar
Laws. Buyer shall be solely responsible for providing any notice or other
filing required under the WARN Act or any similar Laws in respect of the
termination after the Closing of the employment of any employee of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, and shall indemnify and hold the Sellers harmless
from any liability arising from any failure of Buyer to comply fully with

_ARTICLE VII_

 

 _ADDITIONAL COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS_

7.01 _Acknowledgment by Buyer_.

(a) Buyer acknowledges that it has conducted an independent investigation,
review and analysis of the financial condition, results of operations, assets,
liabilities and properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries and, in making
its determination to proceed with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, Buyer has relied on the results of its own independent
investigation and the representations and warranties of the Company and the
Sellers expressly and specifically set forth in this Agreement (as qualified
by the Disclosure Schedule). BUYER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES SUCH
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES BY THE COMPANY AND SELLERS CONSTITUTE THE SOLE
AND EXCLUSIVE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY AND SELLERS TO
BUYER IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

(b) In connection with Buyers investigation of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, Buyer has received from or on behalf of the Company, its
Subsidiaries or the Sellers certain estimates, projections and other forecasts
and plans. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that there are uncertainties inherent
in attempting to make such estimates, projections and other forecasts and
plans and that actual results may vary. Accordingly, Buyer acknowledges that
it has relied solely upon its own independent

 



31  investigation and the representations and warranties of the Company and the
Sellers expressly and specifically set forth in this Agreement (as
specifically qualified by the Disclosure Schedule). Buyer further
acknowledges and agrees that neither the Company, nor any of its Subsidiaries
nor any of the Sellers make any representations or warranties whatsoever with
respect to such estimates, projections and other forecasts and plans
(including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates,
projections, plans and forecasts).

7.02 _Tax Matters_. 

(a) _Responsibility for Filing Tax Returns_.

 

(i) The Company and its Subsidiaries shall, at their sole cost and expense,
timely prepare and timely file all Tax Returns of the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company due (after taking into account all appropriate
extensions) on or prior to the Closing Date. Such Tax Returns shall be
prepared on a basis consistent with existing procedures and practices
and accounting methods of the Company and its Subsidiaries. At least thirty
(30) days prior to the due date (after taking into account all appropriate
extensions) of any material income Tax Return that is to be filed by the
Company or any Subsidiary of the Company after the date hereof but prior to
the Closing Date, the Company shall submit a draft of such Tax Return to the
Buyer for its review and comment. The Company and its Subsidiaries shall
incorporate any reasonable comments made by the Buyer prior to the filing of
such Tax Return.

(ii) Buyer, at its sole cost and expense, shall timely prepare or cause to be
timely prepared and timely file or cause to be timely filed all Tax Returns
for the Company and its Subsidiaries for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle
Period that are due (after taking into account all appropriate extensions)
after the Closing Date. Such Tax Returns shall be prepared on a basis
consistent with existing procedures and practices and accounting methods of
the Company and its Subsidiaries and, to the extent applicable, the
conventions provided in  _Section 7.02(a)(iii)_. At least thirty (30) days
prior to the due date (after taking into account all appropriate extensions)
of any material income Tax Return of the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company for a Pre-Closing Tax Period (or any Tax Return that shows a Tax that
is payable that the Buyer believes is any Sellers obligation to pay or
indemnify under this Agreement), or the filing of any amended Tax Return as
permitted under _Section 7.02(a)(iv)_, Buyer shall submit a draft of such
Tax Return to the Seller Representative for its review and comment. Buyer
shall cause the Company or applicable Subsidiary to incorporate any reasonable
comments made by the Seller Representative prior to the filing of such Tax
Return.

(iii) For purposes of preparing all Tax Returns, and for purposes of
determining whether to make (or not to make) certain Tax elections, the
Sellers, the Seller Representative and Buyer agree to use the following
conventions (and to cause the Company and each Subsidiary of the Company and
Buyers other Affiliates to use the following conventions):

(A) Any Transaction Deductions resulting from the payment or accrual of an
amount in a Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be treated as occurring on the
Closing Date and no party hereto shall make any election under Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B) (or any similar provision of state,
local, or non-U.S. applicable Law) to apply the "next day rule" to such
deductions.

 



32 (B) Any gains, income, deductions, losses, or other items resulting
from transactions outside of the ordinary course of business and not
contemplated by this Agreement occurring on the Closing Date at the direction
of the Buyer, but after the Closing, shall be treated as occurring on the day
after the Closing Date and each party hereto shall utilize the "next day
rule" in Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B) (or any similar
provision of state, local, or non-U.S. applicable Law) for purposes of
reporting such items on applicable Tax Returns.

(C) No party shall make an election under Treasury Regulation Section
1.1502-76(b)(2)(ii) (or any similar provision of state, local, or non-U.S.
applicable Law) to ratably allocate items incurred by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries.

(D) All elections and decisions permitted under applicable Tax Law with
respect to whether or not to carryback a net operating loss or other Tax
attribute or Tax credit recognized in a Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be made
so that the net operating loss, Tax attribute or Tax credit is first carried
back to the extent permitted under applicable Tax laws prior to being carried
forward into a Post-Closing Tax Period; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that this
_Section 7.02(a)(iii)(D)_ shall only apply if such election or decision will
result in a refund of, or a reduction in, Taxes for such Pre-Closing Tax
Period exceeding $50,000.

 

(E) To the extent permissible under applicable Laws, to elect to have each Tax
year of the Company and its Subsidiaries end on the Closing Date and, if such
election is not permitted or required in a jurisdiction such that the Company
or any Subsidiary of the Company is required to file a Tax Return for Straddle
Period, the parties agree to use the following conventions for determining
the amount of Taxes attributable to the portion of the Straddle Period ending
on the Closing Date: (a) in the case of Income Taxes, Taxes imposed on sales
or receipts and Taxes imposed on payments, the amount attributable to such
portion shall be determined as if the Company or Subsidiary of the Company
filed a separate Tax Return with respect to such Taxes for the portion of the
Straddle Period ending as of the end of the day on the Closing Date using
a "closing of the books methodology"; and (b) in the case of all other Taxes,
the amount attributable to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the
Closing Date shall be determined by multiplying the Taxes for the entire
Straddle Period by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of
calendar days in the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date
and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire
Straddle Period. For purposes of clause (a), any item determined on an annual
or periodic basis (including amortization and depreciation deductions) shall
be allocated to the portion of the Straddle Period that ends on the Closing
Date based on the relative number of days in such portion as compared to the
number of days in the entire Straddle Period.

(F) No election under Code Section 338(g) shall be made with respect to the
acquisition (or deemed acquisition) of the Company or any domestic Subsidiary
of the Company.

(G) Each party shall treat the interest and other earnings on the Escrow
Agreement as interest and other earnings of the Buyer in accordance with the
transition rules set forth in Proposed Treasury Regulation Section
1.468-8(h)(2) and ensure that the Escrow Agreement includes provisions
consistent with such treatment.

 



33 (iv) Unless required under applicable Tax Law or as a result of
a determination of a Governmental Authority that is final, Buyer shall not,
and shall not allow the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company, to amend a
Tax Return for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period (or claim a refund
for Taxes for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period) without the prior
written permission of the Seller Representative.

(b)  _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. Buyer, the Company and its Subsidiaries,
the Seller Representative and the Sellers shall cooperate fully, as and to the
extent reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the filing
of Tax Returns pursuant to this _Section 7.02_ and any audit, litigation or
other proceeding with respect to Taxes (including Tax Contests). Such
cooperation shall include the retention for the full period of any statute of
limitations and (upon the other partys request) the provision of records and
information that are reasonably relevant to any such Tax Return, audit,
litigation or other proceeding and making employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder. The Company and its Subsidiaries, and the Sellers
agree (A) to retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters
pertinent to the Company and its Subsidiaries relating to any Taxable period
beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of
limitations (and, to the extent notified by Buyer or the Sellers, any
extensions thereof) of the respective Taxable periods, and to abide by all
record retention agreements relating to Taxes entered into with any
Governmental Authority, and (B) to give the other party reasonable written
notice prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and
records and, if the other party so requests, the Company and its
Subsidiaries, or the Sellers, as the case may be, shall allow the other party
to take possession of such books and records.

(c) _Transfer Taxes_. The Sellers, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other
hand, will each pay one-half of any documentary, stamp, stock transfer,
registration, recording or similar Tax or charge imposed on the Company and
its Subsidiaries or one or more of the Sellers as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, " _Transfer Taxes_ "), and any
penalties or interest with respect to the Transfer Taxes. The parties agree
to cooperate with each other in the filing of any returns with respect to the
Transfer Taxes, including promptly supplying any information in their
possession reasonably requested by the other party that is
reasonably necessary to complete such returns.

(d) _Tax Contest_.

 

(i) If any Governmental Authority issues to the Company or any Subsidiary of
the Company (1) a notice of its intent to audit or conduct another legal
proceeding with respect to a Tax Return or Taxes of the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period or
(2) a notice of deficiency for Taxes for any such period, Buyer or the
Company shall notify the Seller Representative of its receipt of such
communication from the Governmental Entity within twenty (20) days of receipt.
The Company or applicable Subsidiary of the Company shall control any audit
or other legal proceeding in respect of any Taxes or Tax Returns of the
Company or any Subsidiary of the Company (a " _Tax Contest_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , (1) the Seller Representative, at the Sellers sole cost
and expense, shall have the right to participate in any Tax Contest to the
extent it relates to a Pre-Closing Tax Period and (2) Buyer shall not, and
shall not allow the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company to settle,
resolve or abandon a Tax Contest (whether or not the Seller Representative
participates) for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or a Straddle Period without the
prior written consent of the Seller Representative (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed, or conditioned); _provided_ , _however_ , if
there is a settlement proposal that the Buyer believes is reasonably
acceptable (and is

 



34  acceptable to the Governmental Authority) and the Seller Representative has
not consented to such settlement in accordance with this _Section 7.02(d)_,
the Buyer can settle, or cause the Company or the applicable Subsidiary of
the Company to settle, the Tax Contest on such terms if the Sellers have not
provided collateral equal to 125% of the Taxes that would have been payable
under the proposed settlement or otherwise provided Buyer with assurances
(deemed adequate by the Buyer in its commercially reasonable judgment) that
the Sellers will ultimately pay the Taxes with respect to such Tax Contest and
all costs and expenses of the Buyer, the Company and any Subsidiary of the
Company with respect to the continuation of such Tax Contest.

(ii) If the Seller Representative elects to participate in a Tax Contest, (1)
the Seller Representative shall notify Buyer of such intent (2) Buyer shall
control, or cause the Company or applicable Subsidiary of the Company to
control, such Tax Contest in a commercially reasonable manner (3) Buyer shall
(and shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to) take all actions
necessary to allow the Seller Representative (and its counsel) to fully
participate in such Tax Contest and (4) if requested by the
Seller Representative, Buyer shall settle (or cause the Company or applicable
Subsidiary of the Company to settle) any such Tax Contest on terms acceptable
to the Governmental Authority and the Seller Representative, _provided_ that
(x) such settlement will not result in the Buyer or any Affiliate of the
Buyer incurring any Tax in a Post-Closing Tax Period (or portion of a Straddle
Period ending after the Closing Date) and (y) if the funds are not available
in the Escrow Account, the Sellers have provided to the Company or the Buyer
all of the funds that Sellers are obligated to pay under this Agreement with
respect to the settlement. The Seller Representatives right to participate
shall include: (a) consulting with Buyer or the Company or any Subsidiary of
the Company (and their counsel) regarding the conduct of such Tax Contest; (b)
timely receiving from Buyer, the Company, or any Subsidiary of the Company all
correspondence and other documents received regarding the Tax Contest from
the applicable Governmental Authority; (c) reviewing or commenting on any
correspondence and other documents that will be provided to the Governmental
Authority with respect to such Tax Contest; and (d) participating in any
conferences or meetings with any Governmental Authority (or counsel for Buyer,
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) that are with respect to the Tax
Contest.

 

(iii) If the Seller Representative does not participate in a Tax Contest, (1)
Buyer shall control, or cause the Company or applicable Subsidiary of the
Company to control, such Tax Contest in a commercially reasonable manner, (2)
Buyer shall keep the Seller Representative reasonably informed regarding the
status of such Tax Contest and (3) if requested by the Seller Representative,
Buyer shall settle (or cause the Company or applicable Subsidiary of the
Company to settle) any such Tax Contest on terms acceptable to the
Governmental Authority and the Seller Representative, _provided_  that (x)
such settlement will not result in the Buyer or any Affiliate of the Buyer
incurring any Tax in a Post-Closing Tax Period (or portion of a Straddle
Period ending after the Closing Date) and (y) if the funds are not available
in the Escrow Account, the Sellers have provided to the Company or the Buyer
all of the funds that Sellers are obligated to pay under this Agreement with
respect to the settlement.

 

(e) _Tax-Sharing Agreements_. All tax-sharing agreements or similar agreements
between the Company and its Subsidiaries and any Seller shall automatically
be deemed terminated as of the Closing Date such that none of the Sellers, the
Company and its Subsidiaries shall be bound thereby or have any liability
thereunder.

 



35 (f) _Tax Refunds_.

 

(i) All refunds of Taxes of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company for
any Pre-Closing Tax Period (or portion of a Straddle Period ending on the
Closing Date as determined in accordance with the same principles provided for
in _Section 7.02(a)(iii)(E)_ (whether in the form of cash received or a
credit against Taxes otherwise payable) shall be property of the Sellers to
the extent not included as a current asset in the computation of the Net
Working Capital. To the extent that Buyer, the Company and/or any Subsidiary
of the Company receives a refund that is the property of the Sellers, Buyer
shall pay to the Seller Representative for distribution to the Sellers in
accordance with their respective Percentage Shares the amount of such refund
(and interest received from the Governmental Authority). The amount due to, or
on behalf of, the Sellers shall be payable ten (10) days after the receipt of
the refund from the applicable Governmental Authority (or, if the refund is in
the form of a credit, ten (10) days after the due date of the Tax Return
claiming the credit).

 

(ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall not be required to make any
payment under this  _Section 7.02(f)_ (1) prior to the 30th day following
the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations for the collection of
the Tax being refunded or (2) with respect to any refund for Taxes if the
Sellers are not, at the time the refund is required to be paid to the
Sellers, required to indemnify the Buyer for any Taxes as a result of the
application of the Cap (or to the extent the Sellers would not at the time the
refund is received be required under this Agreement to indemnify the Buyer for
the loss or reduction in the refund).

(iii) Provided that such actions will result in a refund of, or a reduction
in, Taxes for such Pre-Closing Tax Period exceeding $50,000 and provided that
Sellers reimburse Buyer for its costs and expenses of taking such actions,
Buyer shall (and shall cause the Company and any Subsidiary of the Company or
other Affiliates of the Buyer to) take all commercially reasonable actions
necessary, or requested by the Seller Representative, to timely claim a refund
for Taxes (or timely claim a Tax Benefit) that would result in a payment to
(or reduction in a Loss payable by) the Sellers under this Agreement. Such
actions shall include, as applicable, timely filing an IRS Form 1139 (and
comparable form for state or local or non U.S. Tax purposes) to claim a refund
from the carrying back of any net operating loss incurred in the year ending
on the Closing Date and an IRS Form 4466 (and comparable form for state or
local or non-U.S. Tax purposes) claiming a refund for the overpayment of an
estimated Taxes paid on or prior to the Closing Date).

 

7.03 _Further Assurances_. From time to time, as and when requested by any
party hereto and at such requesting partys expense, any other party hereto
shall execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, all such
documents and instruments and shall take, or cause to be taken, all such
further or other actions as the requesting party may reasonably deem
necessary or desirable to evidence and effectuate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement on and subject to the terms and conditions
hereof.

7.04 _Litigation Support_. In the event and for so long as any party hereto
actively is contesting or defending against any action, suit, proceeding,
hearing, investigation, charge, complaint, claim or demand in connection with
(a) any transaction contemplated by this Agreement or (b) any fact, situation,
circumstance, status, condition, activity, practice, plan, occurrence, event,
incident, action, failure to act or transaction on or prior to the Closing
Date involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, at the reasonable
request of the contesting or defending party, each of the other parties hereto
will use their commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with
the contesting or defending party and its counsel in the contest or defense,
to provide reasonable access to its personnel upon reasonable notice and at
reasonable times and to provide reasonable access to its books and records as
shall be reasonably necessary in connection with the contest or defense, in
each case, all at the sole cost and expense of the contesting or defending
party (unless the contesting or defending party is entitled to indemnification
therefor under _Article X_ below). 

 



36 7.05 _Transition_. During the period from the date hereof to the earlier of
immediately prior to the Closing and the date that this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with its terms, no Seller listed on _Section 7.05_
of the Disclosure Schedule (solely for itself, himself or herself and not for
any other Person) shall knowingly take any action that is primarily designed
or intended to have the effect of discouraging any lessor, licensor, customer,
supplier or other material business associate of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries from maintaining substantially the same business relationships
with the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately following the Closing as it
maintained with the Company and its Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to
the date hereof; it being understood and agreed, for the avoidance of doubt,
that any action taken by any such Seller in complying with the terms of this
Agreement shall not be deemed to be a breach of this _Section 7.05_.

 

7.06 _Confidentiality_.

(a) During the two (2) year period immediately following the Closing, each
Seller will treat and hold the Confidential Information as confidential in
accordance with the terms of this  _Section 7.06(a)_. Nothing in this
_Section 7.06(a)_, however, shall prohibit or otherwise limit any Seller (i)
from using or disclosing Confidential Information in connection with this
Agreement and/or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, including in
connection with enforcing the terms of this Agreement or any other agreement
or instrument executed and delivered in connection herewith and/or in
connection with defending any claim, action, proceeding or inquiry against or
involving the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, any Seller or any Affiliate of
any such Seller, (ii) if such person is then an employee of the Company, any
of its Affiliates or Buyer or any of its Affiliates, from using or disclosing
Confidential Information in furtherance of such persons work for any such
entities, (iii) from using or disclosing Confidential Information to the
extent required by law or regulatory process, (iv) from disclosing
any Confidential Information to any of its Affiliates, direct or indirect
equityholders or partners and/or any of their respective lenders, auditors,
accountants or other advisors on a confidential basis, (v) from using or
disclosing Confidential Information consisting of the Companys and its
Subsidiaries pre-Closing financial performance (and similar information) in
connection with any direct or indirect fundraising or marketing efforts by any
such Seller or any of such Sellers Affiliates and/or in connection with any
reporting obligations to such Sellers direct or indirect equityholders or
partners provided that any recipients of such information are obligated to
treat it as confidential and/or (vi) from disclosing or using any of the
information described on _Section 7.06(a)_ of the Disclosure Schedule
(whether or not any such information would be considered "Confidential
Information"). In the event that any Seller is requested or required pursuant
to oral or written question or request for information or documents in any
legal proceeding, interrogatory, subpoena, civil investigative demand or
similar process (in each case which is unrelated to this Agreement and/or the
transactions contemplated hereby) to disclose any Confidential Information,
that Seller will notify Buyer promptly of the request or requirement so that
Buyer may seek an appropriate protective order or waive compliance with
the provisions of this _Section 7.06(a)_. If, in the absence of a protective
order or the receipt of a waiver hereunder, any Seller is, on the advice of
counsel, legally compelled to disclose any such Confidential Information
described in the preceding sentence, that Seller may disclose the
Confidential Information to the tribunal without liability; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the disclosing Seller shall use his, her, or its commercially
reasonable efforts to assist Buyer in seeking to obtain, at the reasonable
request of Buyer (and at Buyers cost and expense), an order or other
assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to such portion of the
Confidential Information required to be disclosed as Buyer shall designate.

 



37 (b) Reference is hereby made to that certain Confidentiality Agreement
dated December 7, 2010 between Boise Inc. and the Company (the " _Buyer
Confidentiality Agreement_ "). Effective as of the earlier to occur of (i) the
Closing Date and (ii) the first date on which a public announcement or
press release is issued concerning or relating to this Agreement, Buyer (on
behalf of itself and its Affiliates, including Boise Inc.) and the Company
acknowledge and agree that the Buyer Confidentiality Agreement is hereby
terminated and cancelled, in each case with no liability or obligation on the
part of the Company or any Tharco Company (as such term is used in the Buyer
Confidentiality Agreement) or any of their respective Representatives (as such
term is used in the Buyer Confidentiality Agreement) and Buyer shall cause
Boise Inc. to deliver to the Seller Representative an acknowledgement of such
termination and cancellation in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
the Seller Representative.

 

7.07 _Regulatory Compliance_. Buyer and the Company shall each make or cause
to be made, promptly (but in any event within five business days) after the
date hereof, any filings and submissions required of such Person under the HSR
Act and any other Anti-Trust Laws in respect of this Agreement and/or the
transactions contemplated hereby, and Buyer shall pay all filing and similar
fees payable by any Person in connection therewith. With respect to any
filings required under the HSR Act, Buyer and the Company shall seek early
termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act. Buyer and the Company
shall each use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to promptly
respond and comply as expeditiously as possible with any additional requests
made by Antitrust Authorities for information from such Person in respect of
any such filing or submission, including requests for production of documents
and production of witnesses for interviews or depositions by any Antitrust
Authorities, and to use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to
cause any applicable waiting periods or other requirements under the HSR Act
or such other applicable antitrust regulation to terminate or expire at the
earliest possible date. Buyer and the Company shall promptly inform the other
party of any material communication received by such party from any
Governmental Authority in respect of any such submission or filing with any
Antitrust Authority. In addition, each of Buyer and the Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with the other party in
exchanging such information and providing such reasonable assistance as the
requesting party may reasonably request in connection with all of the
foregoing. Each of Buyer and the Company shall (i) consult with the other
prior to any meetings, by telephone or in person, with the staff of the
Federal Trade Commission, the United States Department of Justice or any other
Antitrust Authority, (ii) have the right to have a representative present at
any such meeting and (iii) not (x) extend any waiting period under the HSR
Act or any other applicable Anti-Trust Law, or (y) enter into any agreement
with any Governmental Authority not to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, except, in each case, with the prior consent
of the other party. Buyer and Company shall each make or cause to be made,
promptly (but in no event beyond the applicable regulatory deadline) after the
date hereof, all filings and submissions, if any, set forth on _Section
7.07_ of the Disclosure Schedule that are required of such Persons to be made
prior to the Closing under applicable Environmental Laws. Buyer shall pay all
filing and similar fees payable by any person in connection therewith.

 

7.08 _Other Matters_.

any of the rights and remedies of any of the Sellers and/or, prior to the
Closing, the Company under this Agreement or otherwise), Buyer acknowledges
and agrees (on behalf of itself and the other Buyer Indemnified Parties) that
(i) none of the events, changes, actions and/or developments described on
_Section 7.08_ of the Disclosure Schedule (collectively, such events,
changes, actions and developments, the " _Excluded Events_ ") shall be taken
into account in determining whether there has been or will be a Material
Adverse Effect and, for the avoidance of doubt, none of the Excluded Events
shall be deemed in themselves, either alone or in combination, to constitute a
Material Adverse Effect, (ii) neither the Company nor any of the Sellers shall
be deemed to be in breach of any representation, warranty, covenant and/or
agreement hereunder to the extent reasonably attributable to any of the
Excluded Events (including for purposes of _Section 8.01_) and (iii) and no
Seller shall have any liability of any nature under _Article X_  or otherwise
under this Agreement with respect to any Excluded Event.

 



38 (b) Reference is hereby made to that certain Amended and Restated Shareholders
Agreement, dated September 17, 2009 (as amended, modified and/or supplemented

hereby (i) waives the application of any applicable notice provisions set
forth therein with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii)
agrees that, upon consummation of the Closing, all rights and obligations of
the parties to the Shareholders Agreement thereunder shall terminate without
obligation or liability to any party thereunder and the Shareholders Agreement
shall be deemed terminated, null and void and of no further effect. Reference

Registration Rights Agreement thereunder shall terminate without obligation or
liability to any party thereunder and the Registration Rights Agreement shall
be deemed terminated, null and void and of no further effect. In addition, the

be true and correct as of such particular dates), except (i) for changes or
developments contemplated by this Agreement and/or (ii) where the failure of

Closing only as follows:

(a) by the mutual written consent of the Seller Representative and Buyer;

(b) by Buyer, if there has been a material breach by the Company or the
Sellers of any covenant, representation or warranty contained in this

obligations of the Sellers and the Company at the Closing and such breach has
not been waived by the Seller Representative or cured by Buyer within ten
days after Buyers receipt of written notice thereof from the Seller
Representative, the Company or any Seller (provided that the failure of Buyer
to deliver the consideration pursuant to _Section 1.03_ at the Closing

agreed to in writing by the Seller Representative);

 

(d) by Buyer if the Closing has not occurred on or before March 31, 2011;
_provided_ that Buyer shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section 9.01(d)_ if Buyers breach of this Agreement has

(e) by the Seller Representative if the Closing has not occurred on or before
March 31, 2011; _provided_ that the Seller Representative shall not be

herein to the contrary, if the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
shall be terminated for any reason, (i) Buyer shall return all documents and
other material received from any of the Company, any of its Affiliates, any of
the Sellers and/or any of their respective businesses and/or any of the

 



42  transactions contemplated hereby, whether so obtained before or after the

10.01 _Survival Period_. The representations and warranties, covenants and
agreements set forth in this Agreement shall survive the Closing for a period
beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the fifteen (15) month
anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _Survival Period_ ") and shall
thereafter be of no further force or effect; _provided_ that (i) the
applicable Survival Period for the representations and warranties contained
in _Section 2.09_ (Tax Matters) and the obligations of the Sellers under
_Section 10.02(b)(iv)_ shall be the period beginning on the Closing Date and
ending on the 30th day following the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations for the collection of the applicable Tax, (ii) the applicable
Survival Period for the representations and warranties contained in _Section
3.07_ (Ownership of Shares) shall be the period beginning on the Closing Date
and ending on the expiration of the statutory limitations period applicable
thereto, (iii) the applicable Survival Period for the Fundamental
Representations (other than the representations and warranties contained in 
_Section 3.07_) shall be the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending
on the twenty-seven (27) month anniversary of the Closing Date, (iv) the
applicable Survival Period for the obligations of the Sellers under  _Section

the three (3) year anniversary of the Closing Date and (v) with respect to any
covenant or agreement contained herein that contemplates performance or
observance, as the case may be, after the fifteen (15) month anniversary of
the Closing Date, the Survival Period for such covenant or agreement shall,
except as otherwise provided herein in the case of _Sections 10.02(b)(iii)_
and _10.02(b)(iv)_ (which covenants shall survive for the periods specified in
clauses (iv) and (iii) above, respectively), continue through the period of
such contemplated performance or observance, as the case may be; _provided_
_further_ that, for the avoidance of doubt, that the applicable Survival
Period for any such covenant or agreement described in clause (v) of the
preceding proviso shall end upon the expiration of the period of
such contemplated performance or observance, as the case may be, for such
particular covenant or agreement, at which time such covenant or agreement
shall expire and be of no further force and effect.

 

10.02 _Indemnification by the Sellers for the Benefit of Buyer_.

 

(a) Subject to the applicable provisions and limitations of this _Article X_ ,
after the Closing, each Seller, severally as to itself, herself or himself
only and not jointly as to or with any other Seller, shall indemnify Buyer,
the Company, the Subsidiaries of the Company (in the case of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, after the Closing, if the Closing occurs) and each of
their respective successors and permitted assigns (collectively, the " _Buyer
Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against any actual loss, fine, liability,
damage, cost or expense (including reasonable legal fees and expenses, but
excluding consequential, special, exemplary and punitive damages)
(collectively, " _Losses_ " and individually, a " _Loss_ ") which the Buyer
Indemnified Parties actually suffer, sustain or incur arising out of or as a
result of: (i) any breach of any representation or warranty of such Seller
contained in _Article III_ of this Agreement; or (ii) any breach of any
covenant or agreement of such Seller contained in this Agreement. For the
avoidance of doubt, the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
contained in this Agreement that are made specifically and solely by a
particular Seller are the obligations of that particular Seller only (subject,
in any such case, to the applicable provisions and limitations of this
_Article X_ ) and the other Sellers shall not be responsible therefor
(including with respect to such Sellers

 



43  Percentage Share of the Escrow Amount). For the avoidance of doubt, the term
"Buyer Indemnified Parties" as used in this Agreement shall not be deemed to
include the Company and its Subsidiaries and any of their respective
successors or assigns unless and until the Closing shall have occurred under
this Agreement.

(b) Subject to the applicable provisions and limitations of this _Article X_ ,
after the Closing, each Seller, severally as to itself, herself or himself
only and not jointly as to or with any other Seller, shall indemnify the
Buyer Indemnified Parties from and against such Sellers Percentage Share of
any Loss which the Buyer Indemnified Parties actually suffer, sustain or incur
arising out of or as a result of: (i) any breach of any representation and
warranty of the Company contained in _Article II_ of this Agreement; (ii) any
breach of any covenant or agreement of the Company contained in this Agreement
to be performed or complied with by the Company prior to the Closing; (iii)
the matters set forth on _Section 10.11(a)_ of the Disclosure Schedule (such
matters, the " _Post-Closing Items_ "); or (iv) the following Taxes: (1) any
Taxes of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for a Pre-Closing Tax Period
(or portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date as determined
under _Section 7.02(a)(iii)(E)_); (2) any Taxes that the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries are liable for (including pursuant to Treasury Regulation
section 1.1502-6 or an analogous provision of state, local, or foreign Law) as
a result of being a member of an affiliated, consolidated, combined, or
unitary Tax group before the Closing Date; (3) any Taxes for a Pre-Closing
Tax Period (or portion of a Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date as
determined under _Section 7.02(a)(iii)(E)_) of any Person that the Company or
any Subsidiary of the Company are liable for as a transferee or successor or
pursuant to a contract in effect as of prior to the Closing; and (4) the
applicable portion of Transfer Taxes (and related interest and penalties) that
the Sellers are obligated to pay under _Section 7.02(c)_. For the avoidance
of doubt, each Seller shall be responsible solely and only for paying such
Sellers Percentage Share of any such Losses described in this _Section
10.02(b)_ actually suffered by any Buyer Indemnified Party, subject, in
any event, to the applicable provisions and limitations of this _Article X_ ,
and provided that the foregoing statement that each Seller shall be
responsible solely and only for paying such Sellers Percentage Share of any
such Losses described in this _Section 10.02(b)_ shall not limit any Buyer
Indemnified Partys ability to recover from the Escrow Account any amounts
finally determined hereunder to be owed to such Buyer Indemnified Party
pursuant to this  _Section 10.02(b)_ to the extent of the then remaining
balance of the Escrow Account.

(c) Any amount finally determined hereunder to be owed by any of the Sellers
to any Buyer Indemnified Party pursuant to _Section 10.02(a)_, _Section
10.02(b)_ (except as otherwise provided with respect to certain Losses under 
_Section 10.02(b)(iii)_ as provided in the last sentence hereof) or _Section
1.04_ shall first be satisfied from any then remaining balance of the Escrow
Amount held in escrow in the Escrow Account by the Escrow Agent, and
such amount so finally determined hereunder to be owed shall be released to
Buyer (for the benefit of the Buyer Indemnified Parties) from the then
remaining balance of the Escrow Amount held by the Escrow Agent in the Escrow
Account in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement and this
Agreement; _provided_ that with respect to any amount(s) owed by any
particular Seller with respect to any Losses described in _Section 10.02(a)_
or with respect to which any individual Seller is otherwise solely
responsible, Buyers recourse to the Escrow Amount with respect to such
amounts shall be limited solely to an amount not to exceed (on a cumulative
basis) such Sellers Percentage Share of the Escrow Amount. Any amount
finally determined hereunder to be owed by the Sellers to any Buyer
Indemnified Party pursuant to _Section 10.02(b)(iii)_ shall first be
satisfied from any then remaining balance of the Post-Closing Items Holdback
Amount held in escrow in the Escrow Account by the Escrow Agent, and such
amount so finally determined hereunder to be owed shall be released to Buyer
(for the benefit of the Buyer Indemnified Parties) from the then remaining
balance of the Post-Closing Items Holdback Amount held by the Escrow Agent in
the Escrow Account in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement and
this Agreement, and if the then remaining balance of the Post-Closing Items
Holdback Amount is insufficient to satisfy such amount, such unpaid portion
of such amount shall then be satisfied from the then remaining balance (if
any) of the Escrow Amount in accordance with the first sentence of this
_Section 10.02(c)_.

 



44 (d) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary (but
subject to the other applicable limitations on indemnification recovery set
forth in this _Article X_ ), the Sellers shall have no liability under
_Section 10.02(a)_ and/or _Section 10.02(b)_ above, unless the aggregate of
all Losses relating thereto for which the Sellers would be liable, but for
this _Section 10.02(d)_, exceeds on a cumulative basis $900,000 (the "
_Deductible_ "), and then only to the extent such Losses exceed the
Deductible, up to the Cap; _provided_ that the Sellers aggregate liability
under this _Section 10.02_ shall in no event exceed an amount equal to
$15,000,000 (the " _Cap_ "); _provided_ _further_ that no claim
for indemnification by the Buyer Indemnified Parties under this _Section
10.02_ may be asserted with respect to any individual Loss (or aggregated
Losses arising out of the same facts, events or circumstances) where the
amount that would otherwise be payable by the Sellers hereunder relating to
such claim with respect to any such individual Loss (or aggregated Losses
arising out of the same facts, events or circumstances) is less than $50,000
(the " _Mini-Basket_ "), and, for the avoidance of doubt, if such claim does
not exceed such amount of the Mini-Basket, the amount of such claim shall not
be taken into account in determining whether or not or the extent to which the
Deductible has been exceeded or reached;  _provided_ , _however_ , that (1)
the Deductible and the Mini-Basket shall not apply to any Losses for which the
Buyer Indemnified Parties are entitled to be indemnified under _Section
10.02(b)(iii)_, (2) the first $4.0 million of Losses (on a cumulative basis)
for which the Buyer Indemnified Parties are entitled to be indemnified under
_Section 10.02(b)(iii)_ shall not be included in the computation of Losses
subject to the Cap but any and all Losses in excess of such first $4.0
million of Losses for which the Buyer Indemnified Parties are entitled to be
indemnified under _Section 10.02(b)(iii)_ shall be included in the
computation of Losses subject to the Cap and such Losses shall be taken into
account in determining whether or not or the extent to which the Cap has been
exceeded or reached (for example, if the Buyer Indemnified Parties are
indemnified in the first year following the Closing for $5,000,000 of
Losses under _Section 10.02(b)(iii) _and $2,000,000 of Losses under
_Section 10.02(b)(i)_ (after taking into account certain other Losses which
were subject to the Deductible) and for no other Losses through such time,
then the first $4.0 million of such Losses indemnified under _Section
10.02(b)(iii)_ (determined on a cumulative basis) would not count towards the
Cap, but the next $1.0 million of Losses thereunder (as well as any other
Losses for which the Buyer Indemnified Parties may thereafter be entitled to
indemnification under _Section 10.02(b)(iii)_) and the $2.0 million of Losses
for which the Buyer Indemnified Parties were indemnified under _Section
10.02(b)(i)_ (as well as any other Losses for which the Buyer Indemnified
Parties may thereafter be entitled to indemnification under _Section 10.02_)
would count towards the Cap, with the result that the $3.0 million of such
Losses would be applied against the Cap, reducing the availability thereunder
to $12,000,000), (3) the Deductible, the Cap and the Mini-Basket shall not
apply to (x) any Losses for which the Buyer Indemnified Parties are entitled
to be indemnified under  _Section 10.02(a)_ or _Section 10.02(b)_ resulting
from any breach of any representation or warranty or covenant that constitutes
an act of fraud, (y) if it is finally determined under _Section 1.04_ that
the Final Adjustment Amount is owed from the Sellers to Buyer, the payment by
the Sellers (either directly or through the Escrow Amount) of the Final
Adjustment Amount to Buyer, meaning that any Final Adjustment Amount so owed
shall be paid in full, and any such payment shall not reduce the Cap, or (z)
with respect to any particular Seller, any Losses for which the Buyer
Indemnified Parties are entitled to be indemnified under _Section 10.02(a)_
by such Seller as a result of a breach by such Seller of any of such Sellers
representations and warranties contained in _Section 3.01_ (Organization of
Certain Sellers), _Section 3.02_ (Authority; Execution and Delivery; Valid
and Binding Agreement) or  _Section 3.07_ (Ownership of Shares) and (4) the
Deductible and the Mini-Basket shall not apply to Losses for which the Buyer
Indemnified Parties are entitled to be indemnified under _Section
10.02(b)(iv)_. Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary (but
subject to the other applicable limitations on indemnification recovery set
forth in this _Article X_ ), (A) in no event shall the aggregate liability of
any Seller for all Losses claimed by the Buyer Indemnified Parties against
such Seller under this Agreement and/or in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby (other than to

 



45  the extent expressly provided in the last proviso in the immediately
preceding sentence (including with respect to the first $4.0 million of Losses
(on a cumulative basis) for which the Buyer Indemnified Parties are entitled
to be indemnified under _Section 10.02(b)(iii)_ not counting towards the
Cap), but in any event subject to clause (B) hereof) exceed in the aggregate
such Sellers Percentage Share of the Cap, and (B) in no event shall the
aggregate liability of any Seller for all Losses claimed by the Buyer
Indemnified Parties against such Seller under this Agreement and/or in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby for any reason exceed
in the aggregate the proceeds received by such Seller from Buyer pursuant to
this Agreement in exchange for such Sellers Shares. For the avoidance of
doubt, amounts paid out of the Escrow Amount on behalf of a Seller (as
determined by the Seller Representative) shall, for all purposes hereof, be
deemed to have been paid by such Seller.

(e) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary,
none of the Sellers shall be liable to, or have any obligation to indemnify,
the Buyer Indemnified Parties for any Losses (i) to the extent that an accrual
for or reserve against any such Losses was or is included in the Financial
Statements and/or Closing Statement (as finally determined pursuant to
_Section 1.04_), and/or (ii) to the extent that such Losses result from or
are increased by a failure of any Buyer Indemnified Party to mitigate damages
in accordance with _Section 10.03_ below. Subject to the proviso at the end
of this sentence, Buyer acknowledges and agrees (on behalf of itself and the
other Buyer Indemnified Parties) that the indemnification provided by
_Section 10.02(a)_ and _Section 10.02(b)_ constitutes the Buyer Indemnified
Parties sole and exclusive remedy for any and all Losses or other claims
relating to or arising from this Agreement or in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby or any exhibit, schedule (including the
Disclosure Schedule) or certificate delivered hereunder or otherwise with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ that this sentence
shall not limit any rights Buyer may have (y) under _Section 13.14_ or (z)
under _Article IX_ , including any right Buyer may have thereunder to pursue a
claim for willful or knowing breaches of this Agreement as set forth in 
_Section 9.02_.

10.03 _Mitigation; Related Matters_.

 

(a) The Buyer Indemnified Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
mitigate all losses, costs, damages and expenses upon and after becoming
aware of any event which could reasonably be expected to give rise to losses,
costs, damages and expenses that are or may be indemnifiable under this
_Article X_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that this paragraph (a) shall not
apply to Losses for which the Buyer Indemnified Parties are entitled to be
indemnified under _Section 10.02(b)(iv)_.

(b) The Buyer Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to recover any Losses
under _Section 10.02_ relating to any matter (i) arising under one provision
of this Agreement to the extent that the Buyer Indemnified Parties had
already recovered Losses with respect to such matter pursuant to any other
provisions of this Agreement or (ii) to the extent such matter has been
included in the calculation of (or otherwise taken into account in
determining) the Common Purchase Price or the Final Common Purchase Price
(including, without limitation, by virtue of being included in the calculation
of the Cash Amount, the Net Working Capital Amount and the Indebtedness Payoff
Amount as determined pursuant to _Section 1.04_ hereof).

(c) Unless otherwise required by applicable Tax Law, each party shall treat
any indemnification payment made pursuant to this Agreement as an adjustment
to the Final Common Purchase Price for Tax purposes.

 



46 10.04 _Indemnification by Buyer for the Benefit of Sellers_.

 

(a) Subject to the applicable provisions of this _Article X_ , after the
Closing, Buyer shall indemnify the Seller Representative, each of the Sellers
and each of their respective officers, directors, partners, members,
employees, agents, representatives, successors and permitted assigns
(collectively, the " _Seller Indemnified Parties_ ") against any Losses
which any of the Seller Indemnified Parties actually suffer, sustain or incur
arising out of or as a result of: (i) any breach of any representation or
warranty of Buyer contained in this Agreement and/or (ii) any breach of any
covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement to be performed by Buyer
and/or, from and after the Closing, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary (but
subject to the other applicable limitations on indemnification recovery set
forth in this _Article X_ ), Buyer shall have no liability under _Section
10.04(a)(i)_ above, unless the aggregate of all Losses relating thereto for
which Buyer would be liable, but for this _Section 10.04(b)_, exceeds on a
cumulative basis $900,000 (the " _Buyer Deductible_ "), and then only to the
extent such Losses exceed the Buyer Deductible, up to the Buyer Cap;
_provided_ that Buyers aggregate liability under _Section 10.04(a)(i)_ shall
in no event exceed an amount equal to $15,000,000 (the " _Buyer Cap_ "); and
_provided_ _further_ that no claim for indemnification by the Seller
Indemnified Parties under _Section 10.04(a)(i)_ may be asserted with respect
to any individual Loss (or aggregated Losses arising out of the same or
similar facts, events or circumstances) where the amount that would otherwise
be payable by Buyer hereunder relating to such claim with respect to any such
individual Loss (or aggregated Losses arising out of the same or similar
facts, events or circumstances) is less than $50,000 (the " _Buyer Mini-
Basket_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the limitations set forth in this
_Section 10.04(b)_, including the Buyer Deductible, the Buyer Cap and the
Buyer Mini-Basket, shall not apply to any Losses based upon, arising out of or
as a result of (i) any breach of or inaccuracy in any of the representations
and warranties contained in _Section 4.01_ (Organization and Authority),
_Section 4.02_ (Authorization; Valid and Binding Agreement) and _Section
4.05_ (Brokerage), (ii) any act of fraud or willful misrepresentation or (iii)
any breach or non-fulfillment of a covenant or agreement.

10.05 _Manner of Payment_. Unless required to be made earlier by any provision
of this Agreement, any indemnification payment pursuant to this _Article X_
shall be effected by wire transfer of immediately available funds from (or on
behalf of) the applicable indemnifying party to an account designated by each
applicable indemnified party within 21 days after the determination thereof.

10.06 _Defense of Third Party Claims_. Promptly after the assertion by any
third party of any claim (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") against any Person
entitled to seek indemnification under _Section 10.02_ or _Section 10.04_
(an " _Indemnitee_ ") that results or may result in the incurrence by such
Indemnitee of any Loss for which such Indemnitee desires to seek
indemnification under this _Article X_ , such Indemnitee shall notify each of
the parties from whom such indemnification could be sought hereunder
with respect to such claim (collectively, the " _Indemnitor_ ") of such claim
in writing promptly after receiving notice of such claim, describing the
claim, the amount thereof (if known and quantifiable) and the basis thereof in
reasonable detail (such written notice, an " _Indemnification Notice_ ");
_provided_ that the failure to so notify an Indemnitor shall not relieve the
Indemnitor of its obligations hereunder except to the extent that such failure
shall have caused the damages for which the Indemnitor is obligated to be
greater than such damages would have been had the Indemnitee given the
Indemnitor prompt notice hereunder. Any Indemnitor shall be entitled to
participate in the defense of such action, lawsuit, proceeding, investigation
or other claim giving rise to an Indemnitees claim for indemnification at
such Indemnitors expense, and at its option shall be entitled to assume the
defense thereof by appointing a reputable counsel reasonably acceptable to
the Indemnitee to be the lead counsel in connection with such defense;
_provided_ that the Indemnitee shall be entitled to participate in the defense
of such claim and to employ counsel of its choice for such purpose; 
_provided_ _however_ , that the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be
borne by the Indemnitee and shall not be recoverable from such Indemnitor(s)
under this _Article X_. With respect to any Third Party Claim with respect to
which indemnification is sought against any of the Sellers hereunder, the
Seller Representative may, at its option, on behalf of such Sellers, assume
the defense of such Third Party Claim. If the Indemnitor shall control the
defense of any such claim, the Indemnitor

 



47  shall be entitled to settle such claims; _provided_ that the Indemnitor
shall obtain the prior written consent of the Indemnitee (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld) before entering into any settlement of a claim
or ceasing to defend such claim if, pursuant to or as a result of such
settlement, material injunctive or other equitable relief will be imposed
against the Indemnitee or if such settlement does not expressly and
unconditionally release the Indemnitee from all liabilities and obligations
with respect to such claim. In all cases, the Indemnitee shall provide, and
the Indemnitee shall cause its Affiliates to provide, their reasonable
cooperation with the Indemnitor in defense of claims or litigation, including
by making employees, information and documentation reasonably available. In no
event will an Indemnitee consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into
any settlement with respect to any Third Party Claim without the written
consent of the Indemnitor (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld)
if any Indemnitee is seeking or will seek indemnification hereunder with
respect to such matter; it being understood and agreed, for the avoidance of
doubt, that any such consent of the Indemnitor to any such consent to the
entry of judgment or settlement shall not be deemed to be an admission or
acknowledgement that any Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification hereunder
with respect to any such Third Party Claim. The provisions of _Section
7.02(d)_ shall govern with respect to the contest of any Tax Claim, and this
_Section 10.06_ shall have no application to any Tax Claim.

 

10.07 _Determination of Loss Amount_. The amount of any Loss subject to
indemnification under _Section 10.02(a)_ or  _Section 10.02(b)_ shall be
calculated net of (i) any Tax Benefit realized by Buyer, the Company, any of
their respective Subsidiaries and/or any of their respective Affiliates on
account of such Loss, and (ii) any insurance proceeds or other third party
indemnification or reimbursement proceeds received by any of them on account
of such Loss. If Buyer, the Company, any of their respective Subsidiaries
and/or any of their respective Affiliates realizes a Tax Benefit and such Tax
Benefit was not included in the computation of the Loss, Buyer shall within
ten (10) days of filing the Tax Return claiming the Tax Benefit (or, if the
Tax Benefit is in the form of a refund, within ten (10) days or receiving
the refund from the Governmental Authority) pay to the Seller Representative
(for distribution to the applicable Sellers) the amount of such Tax Benefit.
Buyer shall, and shall cause the Company, their respective Subsidiaries and
their respective Affiliates to, seek full recovery under all insurance
policies and other third party agreements covering any Loss to the same extent
as they would if such Loss were not subject to indemnification hereunder. In
the event that an insurance recovery or a recovery under any other third
party agreement or arrangement is made by Buyer, the Company, any of their
respective Subsidiaries and/or any of their respective Affiliates with respect
to any Loss for which any Buyer Indemnified Party has been indemnified
hereunder, then a refund equal to the aggregate amount of the recovery (net of
any costs of obtaining such recovery) shall be made promptly by Buyer to the
Seller Representative (on behalf of the Person or Persons that provided
such indemnity payments hereunder to the Buyer Indemnified Parties). The
Sellers shall be subrogated to all rights of Buyer, the Company and its
Subsidiaries in respect of any Losses indemnified by the Sellers.

 

10.08 _Expiration of Indemnification_. No Person shall be liable for any claim
for indemnification under  _Section 10.02(a)_, _Section 10.02(b)_, or
_Section 10.04_ unless written notice (stating in reasonable detail the
nature of, and factual and legal basis for, any such claim for
indemnification, and the provisions of this Agreement upon which such claim
for indemnification is made) is delivered by the Person seeking
indemnification to the Person from whom indemnification is sought prior to the
expiration of the applicable Survival Period (which written notice must be
accompanied by, in the case such claim for indemnification is being made by
reason of a Third Party Claim, a copy of the written notice of the third party
claimant), in which case the representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
which is the subject of such claim for indemnification shall survive, to the
extent of such claim only, until such claim is resolved, whether or not the
amount of the Losses resulting from such breach has been finally ascertained
or finally determined at the time the notice is given.

 



48 10.09 _Limitation on Recourse_.

 

No claim shall be brought or maintained by any Buyer Indemnified Party, any of
their Subsidiaries or any of their respective successors or permitted assigns
against any present or former officer, partner, director, employee or
Affiliate of any party hereto which is not otherwise expressly identified as a
party hereto, and no recourse shall be brought or granted against any of them,
by virtue of or based upon any alleged misrepresentation or inaccuracy in or
breach of any of the representations, warranties, agreements or covenants of
any party hereto set forth or contained in this Agreement or any exhibit or
schedule hereto (including the Disclosure Schedule) or any certificate
delivered hereunder. After the consummation of the Closing, no party may seek
the rescission of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

10.10 _Tax Matters_.

In addition to the other limitations under this _Article X_ applicable to the
Sellers obligation to pay or indemnify for Taxes, no Seller shall be required
under any applicable provision of this Agreement to pay or indemnify any
Buyer Indemnified Party for the following: (1) any Tax (or related Loss) to
the extent such Tax relates to a Post-Closing Tax Period (or portion of a
Straddle Period beginning on the day after the Closing Date as determined
under _Section 7.02(a)(iii)(E)_); (2) any Tax (or related Loss) to the extent
such Tax is accrued as a current liability (or offset to a current asset) in
the Net Working Capital; (3) Buyers allocable share of any Transfer Tax (and
related interest and penalties) as determined pursuant to _Section 7.02(c)_;
and (4) any Tax (or related Loss) to the extent such Tax resulted from any
breach by Buyer of any covenant or other agreement in  _Section 7.02_.

10.11 _Certain Post-Closing Items_.

 

From and after the Closing, Buyer and Sellers acknowledge and agree, for the
avoidance of doubt, that (subject to the applicable limitations and
provisions set forth in this _Article X_ ) _Section 10.11(b)_ of the
Disclosure Schedule (and the provisions and procedures contained therein)
shall apply with respect to the administration, handling and resolution
of the Post-Closing Items as if fully set forth in this _Article X_. Without
limiting the foregoing, Buyer agrees to cause the Company and its Subsidiaries
to comply with the applicable provisions of _Section 10.11(b)_ of the
Disclosure Schedule.

11.01 _Designation; Authorization_. Each of the Sellers, by the execution of
this Agreement, hereby irrevocably appoints the Seller Representative as the
agent, proxy and attorney in fact for such Seller for all purposes of this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement (including the full power and authority on
such Sellers behalf (i) to consummate the transactions contemplated herein;
(ii) to pay such Sellers expenses incurred in connection with the negotiation
and performance of this Agreement (whether incurred on or after the date
hereof); (iii) to disburse any funds received hereunder or pursuant to the
Escrow Agreement to such Seller and each other Seller; (iv) to endorse and
deliver any certificates or instruments representing the Shares and execute
such further instruments of assignment as Buyer shall reasonably request; (v)
to take all actions and make all determinations on behalf of any of the
Sellers with respect to the negotiation, defense and/or settlement of
any indemnification claims by any Person against such Seller pursuant to
_Article X_ hereof; (vi) to engage attorneys, accountants, agents or
consultants on behalf of the Sellers in connection with this Agreement or any
other agreement contemplated hereby and paying any fees and expenses related
thereto; (vii) to negotiate, settle, compromise and otherwise handle any
claims for, or disputes involving, any purchase price adjustment under
_Section 1.04_ hereof; (viii) to take actions the Seller Representative is
authorized or permitted to take pursuant to the provisions of this

 



49  Agreement and the Escrow Agreement; (ix) to take any other actions
incidental to any of the foregoing; and (x) with the consent of the Required
Sellers, to do each and every other act and exercise any and all other rights
which such Seller is, or the Sellers collectively are, permitted or required
to do or exercise under this Agreement (it being understood and agreed that
the consent of the Required Sellers is not required with respect to any of
the actions described in the foregoing clauses (i) through (ix)). Each of the
Sellers agrees that such agency and proxy are coupled with an interest, are
therefore irrevocable without the consent of the Seller Representative and
shall survive the death, incapacity, bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation of
any Seller. All decisions and actions by the Seller Representative shall be
binding upon all of the Sellers, and no Seller shall have the right to object,
dissent, protest or otherwise contest the same; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Seller Representative shall not take any such action where any single
Seller would be held liable for a Loss under _Section 10.02(a)_ (without
such Sellers written consent). At the Closing, Buyer shall deliver the
Seller Representative Reserve Amount to the Seller Representative in
accordance with _Section 1.03(b)(v)_ hereof, which amount, the Sellers
authorize and agree, may be used by the Seller Representative to (i) cover,
reimburse and pay fees and expenses incurred by the Seller Representative in
its capacity as the Seller Representative in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby and/or (ii) serve as an initial
source of funds to satisfy certain obligations of the Sellers under this
Agreement (to the extent amounts are available in the Seller Representative
Reserve Amount to pay any such obligations and the Seller Representative has
determined to have such obligations paid out of the Seller Representative
Reserve Amount rather than by the Sellers directly); it being understood and
agreed that the aforementioned Seller Representative Reserve Amount shall in
no way limit any of the obligations of the Sellers under this Agreement
(including the obligations of the Sellers to the Seller Representative under
this _Article XI_ hereof). At such time as the Seller Representative
determines that the Seller Representative Reserve Amount is no longer
necessary but in no event later than the one year anniversary of the Closing
Date (and without limiting any of the obligations of the Sellers under this
Agreement (including the obligations of the Sellers to the Seller
Representative under this _Article XI_ hereof)), any then remaining balance of
the Seller Representative Reserve Amount shall be distributed by the
Representative to the Sellers based on their respective Percentage Shares. 

11.02 _Authority; Indemnification_. Each Seller agrees that Buyer shall be
entitled to rely on any action taken by the Seller Representative, on behalf
of such Seller, pursuant to _Section 11.01_ above (an " _Authorized Action_
"), and that each Authorized Action shall be binding on each Seller as fully
as if such Seller had taken such Authorized Action. Buyer agrees that the
Seller Representative, as the Seller Representative, shall have no liability
to Buyer for any Authorized Action. Each Seller hereby severally (based on
such Sellers Percentage Share), for itself only and not jointly and
severally, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Seller Representative
against (x) any and all losses, expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement incurred by the Seller
Representative by reason of the fact such Person is or was acting as the
Seller Representative pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and/or the
Escrow Agreement (including in connection with any action, suit or proceeding
against or involving the Seller Representative in its capacity as such) and
(y) any and all fees, costs and expenses incurred by the Seller Representative
in connection with the performance of its duties hereunder or thereunder. For
the avoidance of doubt, (a) each of the Sellers acknowledge and agree that
none of the limitations on indemnification recovery set forth in _Article X_
shall apply to, affect or otherwise limit any of the obligations of the
Sellers to the Seller Representative under this _Article XI_ and (b) in no
event shall the aggregate liability of any Seller for indemnification under
this _Section 11.02_ exceed the gross proceeds received by such Seller
pursuant to this Agreement. 

11.03 _Exculpation_. The Seller Representative shall not have by reason of
this Agreement a fiduciary relationship in respect of any Seller, except in
respect of amounts received on behalf of such Seller. The Seller
Representative shall not be liable to any Seller for any action taken or
omitted by the Seller Representative or any agent employed by the
Seller Representative hereunder or under any other document entered into in
connection herewith, except that the Seller Representative shall not be
relieved

 



50  of any liability imposed by law for fraud, willful misconduct or gross
negligence. The Seller Representative shall not be liable to the Sellers for
any apportionment or distribution of payments made by the Seller
Representative in good faith, and if any such apportionment or distribution is
subsequently determined to have been made in error the sole recourse of any
Seller to whom payment was due, but not made, shall be to recover from other
Sellers any payment in excess of the amount to which they are determined to
have been entitled. The Seller Representative shall not be required to make
any inquiry concerning either the performance or observance of any of the

specification of any item or matter in any representation, warranty or
covenant contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of any specific item in

contemplated hereby; _provided_ that, with respect to any such supplement,
modification or update that reflects facts, circumstances or events occurring
or arising after the date hereof, (x) the delivery of any such supplement,
modification or update will be deemed to have cured any misrepresentation or
breach of representation or warranty that otherwise might have existed

Buyer hereby agrees that, in the event that a dispute arises after the Closing
between Buyer, on the one hand, and any Tricor Seller and/or the

Sellers and the Seller Representative in such dispute even though the
interests of a Tricor Seller or Seller Representative may be directly adverse
to Buyer, the Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries, and even though
WandS or NF may have represented the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in a
matter substantially related to such dispute, or may be handling ongoing
matters for Buyer, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



64  Buyer further agrees that, as to all communications among WandS or NF and the
Company, the Subsidiaries, any Tricor Seller and/or the Seller Representative
that relate in any way to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
the attorney-client privilege and the expectation of client confidence belongs
to the Seller Representative and may be controlled by the Seller
Representative and shall not pass to or be claimed by Buyer, the Company or
any of the Companys Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing, following
the Closing (if the Closing occurs), except in connection with a dispute
involving a party to this Agreement after the Closing, the Company and
the Subsidiaries may assert the attorney-client privilege (with the consent
of the Seller Representative (not to be unreasonably withheld)) to prevent
disclosure to a third party of confidential communications between WandS or NF
and the Company;  _provided_ , _however_ , that neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries may waive such privilege without the prior written consent
of the Seller Representative.

13.18 _Prevailing Party_. If any litigation or other court action, arbitration
or similar adjudicatory proceeding is commenced by any party hereto to enforce
its rights under this Agreement against any other party hereto, all out-of-
pocket fees, costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable
attorneys fees and court costs, incurred by the prevailing party in
prosecuting or defending (as applicable) such litigation, action, arbitration
or proceeding shall be reimbursed by the losing party; _provided_ , that if a
party to such litigation, action, arbitration or proceeding prevails in part,
and loses in part, the court, arbitrator or other adjudicator presiding
over such litigation, action, arbitration or proceeding shall award a
reimbursement of the fees, costs and expenses incurred by such party on an
equitable basis.
