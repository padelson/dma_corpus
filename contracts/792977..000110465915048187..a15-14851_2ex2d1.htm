 **STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT**

 



 

THIS STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of June 29,
2015, is made by and among CBR Acquisition Holdings Corp., a Delaware
corporation (the " _Company_ "), AMAG Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the " _Purchaser_ "), and CBR Holdco, LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company (the " _Seller_ "). Capitalized terms used and not otherwise
defined herein have the meanings set forth in _Article XII_.

 



 

WHEREAS, the Seller is the owner of 1,000 shares of common stock, $0.01 par
value per share, of the Company (the " _Shares_ ");

 



 

WHEREAS, the Shares represent all of the issued and outstanding equity
securities (and rights to acquire equity securities) of the Company; and

 



 

WHEREAS, the parties hereto desire to enter into this Agreement pursuant to
which the Seller shall sell to the Purchaser, and the Purchaser shall purchase
from the Seller, all of the Shares on the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth herein.

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein and
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

 



 

ARTICLE I

 



 

 _SALE AND PURCHASE OF SHARES_

 



 

1.01 _Sale and Purchase of Shares_. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, the Seller agrees to sell, assign,
transfer and deliver to the Purchaser at the Closing, and the Purchaser agrees
that it shall purchase and accept delivery from the Seller of, all of the
Shares, which Shares shall constitute all of the outstanding equity securities
(and rights to acquire equity securities) of the Company, free and clear of
all Liens other than applicable federal and state securities law restrictions.

 



 

1.02 _Consideration_. As consideration for the Shares, the Purchaser shall
deliver to the Seller, in the manner and as adjusted as described herein, an
amount equal to the Closing Cash Consideration.

 



 

1.03 _Closing Calculations_. Not less than three (3) Business Days prior to
the anticipated Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to the Purchaser a
schedule (the " _Estimated Statement_ ") setting forth its good faith
estimates of (i) Cash (" _Estimated Cash_ "), (ii) Indebtedness (" _Estimated
Indebtedness_ "), (iii) Transaction Expenses (" _Estimated Transaction
Expenses_ "), and (iv) Net Working Capital (the " _Estimated Net Working
Capital Amount_ "), together with a schedule calculating in reasonable detail
such amounts. From the delivery of the Estimated Statement until the Closing,
the Seller and the Company shall (i) give the Purchaser and its advisers
reasonable access to their respective books, records and personnel relating to
the preparation of the Estimated Statement and calculations of the amounts set
forth therein and (ii) reasonably consider any good faith comments from the
Purchaser relating to any such amounts.

      
 

 



 

1.04 _Final Closing Balance Sheet Calculation_. As promptly as possible, but
in any event within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, the Purchaser will
deliver to the Seller a statement showing the calculation of Cash,
Indebtedness, Transaction Expenses and Net Working Capital (the " _Preliminary
Statement_ "). The calculations of Cash, Indebtedness, Transaction Expenses
and Net Working Capital shall be determined (including for purposes of
_Section 1.03_) on a consolidated basis (of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
and not on a consolidated basis of the Purchaser and its Subsidiaries) in
accordance with GAAP using the same accounting methods, policies, principles,
practices and procedures, with consistent classifications, judgments and
estimation methodology, as were used in the preparation of the calculation of
Net Working Capital set forth on _Exhibit A_ and, to the extent not specified
on _Exhibit A_, in the preparation of the Latest Balance Sheet, and shall not
include any changes in assets or liabilities as a result of purchase
accounting adjustments (related to the transactions contemplated hereby) or
other changes arising from or resulting as a consequence of the transactions
contemplated hereby. The parties agree that the purpose of determining Cash,
Indebtedness, Transaction Expenses and Net Working Capital and the related
purchase price adjustment contemplated by this _Section 1.04_ is to (i)
measure the amount of Cash, Indebtedness and Transaction Expenses and (ii)
measure changes in Net Working Capital against the Target Net Working Capital
Amount, and such processes are not intended to permit the introduction of
different judgments, accounting methods, policies, principles, practices,
procedures, classifications or estimation methodologies for the purpose of
determining Cash, Indebtedness, Transaction Expenses or Net Working Capital.
After delivery of the Preliminary Statement, the Purchaser shall cause the
Company to provide the Seller and its accountants and other representatives
reasonable access to review the Companys and its Subsidiaries books and
records and any work papers related to the preparation of the Preliminary
Statement. The Seller and its accountants and other representatives may make
inquiries of the Purchaser, the Company and their respective accountants
regarding questions concerning or disagreements with the Preliminary Statement
arising in the course of their review thereof, and the Purchaser shall use
its, and shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to use their,
commercially reasonable efforts to cause any such accountants to cooperate
with and respond to such inquiries. If the Seller has any objections to the
Preliminary Statement, the Seller shall deliver to the Purchaser a statement
setting forth in reasonable detail each objected item or amount and the basis
for such objection, together with supporting calculations (an " _Objections
Statement_ "). If an Objections Statement is not delivered to the Purchaser
within sixty (60) days after delivery of the Preliminary Statement to the
Seller, the Preliminary Statement shall be final, binding and non-appealable
by the parties hereto. The Seller and the Purchaser shall negotiate in good
faith to resolve any such objections, but if they do not reach a final
resolution within thirty (30) days after the delivery of the Objections
Statement, the Seller and the Purchaser shall submit such dispute to Duff and
Phelps Corporation (the " _Valuation Firm_ "). Any further submissions to the
Valuation Firm must be written and delivered to each party to the dispute. The
Valuation Firm shall make a final determination of Cash, Indebtedness,
Transaction Expenses and Net Working Capital, and the resulting Final Cash
Consideration calculated with reference to such amounts to the extent such
amounts are in dispute, in accordance with the guidelines and procedures set
forth in this Agreement and on _Exhibit B_. The parties will cooperate with
the Valuation Firm during the term of its engagement. The determination of
Cash, Indebtedness, Transaction Expenses and Net Working Capital as of the
Closing Date, and the resulting Final Cash Consideration calculated with
reference thereto, shall become final and binding on the parties on the date
the Valuation Firm delivers its final resolution in writing to the parties.

 



      
 

 



 

1.05 _Post-Closing Adjustment Payment_. If the Final Cash Consideration is
greater than the Closing Cash Consideration, the Purchaser shall promptly (but
in any event within two (2) Business Days) pay to the Seller the amount of
such excess, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or
accounts designated in writing by the Seller to the Purchaser. If the Final
Cash Consideration is less than the Closing Cash Consideration, the Seller
shall promptly (but in any event within two (2) Business Days) pay to the
Purchaser the absolute value of such difference by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated in writing by
the Purchaser to the Seller. For the avoidance of doubt, (a) _clauses (a)_
and _(b)_ of the _Adjustment Amount Schedule_ shall not be subject to any
adjustment pursuant to this _Section 1.05_, and (b) _clause (c)_ of the
_Adjustment Amount Schedule_ shall be subject to adjustment pursuant to this
_Section 1.05_.

or at such other date as is mutually agreeable to the Purchaser and the

(e) the Purchaser, the Company and the Seller shall make such other deliveries
as are required by _Article III_.

 



 

2.03 _Withholding_. The Purchaser and the Company, as applicable, shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to the Seller such amounts as it is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under
applicable Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Purchaser or
the Company, as applicable, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Seller in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made by the Purchaser or the Company,
as applicable.

any Tax allocation or sharing agreement or any other agreement or practice of
a similar nature with respect to any amount of Taxes (other than pursuant to

agreements, leases, and agreements entered with employees, in each case, not
primarily related to Taxes and entered into in the ordinary course of
business).

 



 

(l) No Governmental Entity in any state, territory or jurisdiction (whether
foreign or domestic) where the Company or any Subsidiary does not file Tax
Returns has made a written claim that the Company or such Subsidiary is
required to file Tax Returns or is otherwise subject to taxation in such
state, territory or jurisdiction.

 



 

(m) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary (i) has been a member of any

(p) The Company and its Subsidiaries are in compliance in all material
respects with all terms and conditions of any Tax exemption, Tax holiday or
other Tax reduction agreement or order (each, a " _Tax Incentive_ "), and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not have
any adverse effect on the continued validity and effectiveness of any such Tax
Incentive.

country other than its country of incorporation or formation by virtue of
having a permanent establishment or other place of business in that country.

6.07 _Investment Representation_. The Purchaser is acquiring the Shares for
its own account with the present intention of holding such securities for
investment purposes and not with a view to, or for sale in connection with,
any distribution of such securities in violation of

 



       
 

 



 

any federal or state securities Laws. The Purchaser is an "accredited
investor" as defined in Regulation D promulgated by the Securities and
Exchange Commission under the Securities Act. The Purchaser acknowledges that
it is informed as to the risks of the transactions contemplated hereby and of
ownership of the Shares. The Purchaser acknowledges that the Shares have not
been registered under the Securities Act or any state or foreign securities
Laws and that the Shares may not be sold, transferred, offered for sale,
pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of unless such transfer, sale,
assignment, pledge, hypothecation or other disposition is pursuant to the
terms of an effective registration statement under the Securities Act and the
Shares are registered under any applicable state or foreign securities Laws or
sold pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act, and
any applicable state or foreign securities Laws.

 



 

6.08 _Financing_. The Purchaser has obtained a fully executed commitment
letter (including all exhibits, annexes and other attachments thereto), a copy
of which has been delivered to the Company (the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ "),
from the parties identified therein (together with each other Person that has
committed to provide or otherwise entered into agreements in connection with
the Debt Commitment Letter or other financings in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including (without limitation)
any commitment letters, engagement letters, credit agreements, loan agreements
or indentures relating thereto, together with each affiliate thereof and each
officer, director, employee, partner, controlling person, advisor, attorney,
agent and representative of each such Person or affiliate and their respective
successors and assigns, the " _Debt Financing Sources_ ", who shall not
include the Purchaser or its Affiliates, to provide the Purchaser with debt
financing in the amount set forth therein for the purpose of financing the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (being collectively referred to as
(the " _Debt Financing_ "). As of the date of this Agreement, the Debt
Commitment Letter has not been amended or modified, the respective commitments
have not been withdrawn or rescinded in any way, and no such amendment or
modification is contemplated (except as described in the fee letter relating
to the Debt Financing and to add additional lenders, lead arrangers,
bookrunners, agents or similar entities who had not executed the Debt
Commitment Letter as of the date hereof). The Purchaser has fully paid any and
all commitment fees or other fees due as of the date of this Agreement in
connection with the Debt Commitment Letter and will pay in full any such
amounts due on or before the Closing Date. The Debt Commitment Letter, in the
form so delivered, is a valid and binding obligation of the Purchaser and, to
the Knowledge of the Purchaser, the other parties thereto, except as
enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy Laws, other similar Laws affecting
creditors rights and general principles of equity affecting the availability
of specific performance and other equitable remedies. Except for the fee
letter relating to the Debt Financing (a true and complete copy of which has
been provided to the Company, redacted as to fee amounts, discount amounts,
pricing caps and other economic terms only, but not redacted as to any such
provisions that could adversely affect the amount (other than fees and
discounts) or availability of the Debt Financing), as of the date of this
Agreement, there are no other agreements, side letters, or arrangements
relating to the Debt Financing that would reasonably be expected to affect the
availability of the Debt Financing on the Closing Date, other than as
expressly set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter. As of the date hereof, no
event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
constitute a failure of any condition to the funding of the Debt Financing on
the Closing Date or result in any portion of the Debt Financing being
unavailable on the Closing Date (except to the extent offset by an increase in
the Debt Financing or other funding being made available by the Debt Financing
Source Related Parties or another

 



      
 

 



 

financing source) and, assuming the satisfaction of the conditions set forth
in _Section 3.01_, the accuracy of the representations and warranties set
forth in _Article IV_ and _Article V_, and the commencement and completion
of the Marketing Period, the aggregate proceeds from the Debt Financing,
together with immediately available cash on hand and other sources of cash
available to the Purchaser, will provide the Purchaser with all of the
financing required to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement at the Closing Date, the Refinancing (as defined in the Debt
Commitment Letter) and any other amounts required to be paid at the Closing
Date in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated
under this Agreement and to pay all related fees and expenses, in each case
for which the Purchaser is responsible. Except as expressly provided in the
Debt Commitment Letter and the fee letter referenced therein, there are no
conditions precedent, or other contractual contingencies as between Purchaser
and any Debt Financing Source, in each case, that are related to the funding
of the full amount of the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letter. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no facts or circumstances
that that would reasonably be expected to affect the availability of the full
amount of the Debt Financing on the Closing Date or impose additional
conditions to the funding of Debt Financing, other than as described in the
Debt Commitment Letter (or in the unredacted portion of the fee letter
referenced therein).

 



 

6.09 _Solvency_. Assuming the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
_Section 3.01_ and the accuracy of the representations and warranties set
forth in _Article IV_ and _Article V_, immediately after giving effect to
the Closing (and any transactions related thereto or incurred in connection
therewith), each of the Purchaser, the Company and its Subsidiaries will (a)
be able to pay their respective debts as they become due and will own property
that has a fair saleable value greater than the amounts required to pay their
respective debts (including a reasonable estimate of the amount of all
contingent liabilities), and (b) have adequate capital to carry on their
respective businesses. No transfer of property is being made and no obligation
is being incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future
creditors of the Purchaser, the Company or its Subsidiaries.

relating to the exculpation or indemnification (including fee advancement) of
any officers and/or directors of the Company or its Subsidiaries (each such
officer or director, an " _Indemnified Person_ ") as in effect as of the date
of this Agreement that is adverse to such officers and/or directors (unless
required by Law), it being the intent of the parties that the Indemnified
Persons shall continue to be entitled to such exculpation and indemnification
(including fee advancement) to the full extent of the Law. The Purchaser shall
cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to honor and perform under all
indemnification obligations owed to any of the Indemnified Persons.

 



 

(b) The Purchaser acknowledges that, prior to or at the Closing, the Company
or its Subsidiaries intend to purchase a prepaid insurance policy ( _i.e._ ,
"tail coverage", 50% of the cost of which shall be a Transaction Expense and
50% of the cost of which will be borne by the Purchaser) which policy provides
liability insurance coverage for the Indemnified Persons on no less favorable
terms (including in amount and scope) as the policy or policies maintained by
the Seller, the Company or its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing
for the benefit of such Indemnified Persons for an aggregate period of not
less than six years with respect to claims arising from acts, events or
omissions that occurred at or prior to the Closing, including with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Such policy shall be from an
insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys or
its Subsidiaries current insurance carrier with respect to directors and
officers liability insurance. The Purchaser shall not, and shall cause the
Company and its Subsidiaries to not, cancel or otherwise terminate such
prepaid insurance policy.

 



 

(c) If the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective successors or
assigns (i) is to consolidate with or merges into any other Person and will
not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation
or merger or (ii) is to transfer all or substantially all of its properties
and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall
be made so that the successors and assigns of the Company and its Subsidiaries
shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this _Section 8.03_. The
provisions of this _Section 8.03_ are intended for the benefit of, and will
be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person and his or her heirs and
representatives, and are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have
had by contract or otherwise.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any Proceeding or
investigation (whether arising before, at or after the Closing Date) is made
against any Indemnified Person or any other party covered by directors and
officers liability insurance, on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the
Closing Date, the provisions of this _Section 8.03_ shall continue in effect
until the final disposition of such Proceeding or investigation.

 



      
 

 



 

8.04 _Employment and Benefit Arrangements_. From the Closing Date until
December 31, 2015, the Purchaser shall cause the Company to provide employees
of the Company and its Subsidiaries with compensation (other than equity-based
compensation) that is substantially equivalent to the compensation (other than
equity-based compensation) provided to such employees prior to the Closing and
to either (i) maintain in effect on behalf of employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries all employment, severance, termination, consulting, retirement
and other compensation and benefit plans, programs, arrangements, agreements
and policies (other than any equity-based plans) of the Company or its
Subsidiaries as in effect as of the date hereof (the " _Company Plans_ ") or
(ii) provide all employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries with such
compensation and benefit plans, programs, arrangements, agreements and
policies as are provided to similarly situated employees of the Purchaser;
_provided_ that such benefit plans, programs, arrangements, agreements and
policies provide a level of benefits that in the aggregate is substantially
comparable to the aggregate level of benefits provided under the Company Plans
as of the Closing. The Purchaser shall take all actions necessary so that
employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries shall receive service credit for
all purposes (other than for purposes of benefit accrual under any defined
benefit pension plan) under any compensation or benefit plans, programs,
arrangements, agreements and policies sponsored by the Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates (other than any equity-based arrangements), except to the extent
duplication of benefits would result. To the extent that the Purchaser or any
of its Affiliates modifies any welfare benefit coverage or plan under which
the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries participate in the plan year
in which the Closing occurs, the Purchaser shall waive or cause to be waived
any applicable waiting periods, pre-existing conditions or actively-at-work
requirements and shall give such employees credit under the new coverages or
benefit plans for deductibles, co-insurance and out-of-pocket payments that
have been paid during the year in which such welfare benefit coverage or plan
modification occurs. Nothing in this _Section 8.04_ shall (i) confer upon any
Person any right to continue in the employ or service of Purchaser, the
Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates, or interfere
with or restrict in any way the rights of Purchaser, the Company, its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates, which rights are hereby
expressly reserved, to discharge or terminate the services of any employee at
any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause, (ii) subject to
compliance with this _Section 8.04_, restrict the Purchasers, Companys or
its Subsidiaries right to amend, modify or terminate any Company Plan, (iii)
be deemed or construed to be an amendment or other modification of any Company
Plan or Purchaser employee benefit plan or (iv) give any Person other than the
parties to this Agreement, including any employees of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, any right to enforce the provisions of this _Section 8.04_
as a third-party beneficiary. The Purchaser agrees that the Purchaser and the
Company shall be solely responsible for satisfying the continuation coverage
requirements of Section 4980B of the Code for all individuals who are "MandA
qualified beneficiaries" as such term is defined in Treasury Regulation
Section 54.4980B-9.

of making the Purchaser HSR Filing request early termination of the applicable
premerger waiting period.

of any communication (whether written or oral) received by it from any
Governmental Entity with respect to the foregoing, consult with the Company
and the Seller prior to providing any additional information to or otherwise
communicating (whether in written or oral form) with any Governmental Entity
with respect to the foregoing, and incorporate the reasonable comments of the
Company and the Seller in connection with providing any additional information
to or otherwise communicating (whether in written or oral form) with any
Governmental Entity with respect to the foregoing.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
neither the Purchaser nor any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, shall be
required to agree to (i) any license, divestiture, sale or other disposition
or holding separate (through establishment of a trust or otherwise) of any
shares of its capital stock or of any of its businesses, assets, business
lines or properties, or those of any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates or the
Company or its Subsidiaries, (ii) the imposition of any limitation or
restriction on the ability of Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates to conduct, operate or manage any of their respective businesses,
assets, business lines or properties or own any capital stock or assets or to
acquire, hold or exercise full rights of ownership of their respective
businesses, assets, business lines or properties and, in the case of
Purchaser, the business, assets, business lines or properties of the Company
and its Subsidiaries, or (iii) the imposition of any impediment, condition or
undertaking on Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates of any kind
under any Law, statute, rule, regulation, executive order, decree, order or
other legal restraint governing competition, monopolies or restrictive trade
practices (collectively, a " _Divestiture Action_ "), unless such Divestiture
Action would not have a material adverse impact on the Purchaser, any of its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates, the Company or its Subsidiaries. With regard to
any Governmental Entity, neither the Seller nor the Company shall, without
Purchasers written consent in Purchasers sole discretion, discuss or commit
to any Divestiture Action, or discuss or commit to alter the Companys or its
Subsidiaries business, assets, business lines, properties or commercial
practices in any way, or otherwise discuss or take or commit to take any
action that limits Purchasers freedom of action with respect

businesses, assets, business lines or properties or otherwise receive the full
benefits of this Agreement, in Purchasers sole discretion. Nothing herein
shall require Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates to litigate
with any Person, or otherwise contest or defend against any administrative,
regulatory or judicial action or proceeding or the imposition of any
undertaking or condition or decree, judgment, injunction or other order,
whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, unless contesting or defending
against such litigation, action, proceeding, undertaking, condition, decree,
judgment, injunction or other order would not result in a material adverse
impact on the Purchaser, any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, the Company or
its Subsidiaries.

 



 

8.06 _Conditions_. The Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the conditions set forth in _Section 3.02_ to be satisfied as soon as
practicable following the date hereof, to cause the Closing to occur as
expeditiously as possible following the execution of this Agreement, and to
consummate the transactions contemplated herein as soon as reasonably possible
after the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Article III_ (other
than those to be satisfied at the Closing itself, but subject to such
conditions being able to be satisfied at the Closing).

 



 

8.07 _Contact with Employees, Customers and Suppliers_. Prior to the Closing,
the Purchaser and the Purchasers Representatives may not contact and
communicate with any employee, customer, service provider, or supplier of the
Company and its Subsidiaries unless (a) it obtains prior written approval of
the Company or (b) such contact or communication is completely unrelated to
the transactions contemplated hereby, does not include mention of the Seller,
the Company, their respective Subsidiaries, or any other matter contemplated
hereby, and is not intended to seek or obtain any information regarding the
Seller, the Company, and their respective Subsidiaries. For the avoidance of
doubt, nothing set forth in this _Section 8.07_ shall prohibit Purchaser or
Purchasers Representatives from contacting and communicating with any
relevant employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries in connection with the
covenants set forth in _Section 7.08_ or otherwise in furtherance of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

8.08 _Financing_.

 



 

(a) The Purchaser shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain the Debt
Financing on or prior to the Closing Date on the terms and conditions
described in the Debt Commitment Letter (as the same may be amended, modified
or replaced in accordance with this _Section 8.08_), including its reasonable
best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Debt Commitment Letter and comply
with its obligations thereunder; (ii) negotiate and execute the financing
documents on terms contained in the Debt Commitment Letter (including any
"flex" provisions related thereto); (iii) satisfy on a timely basis (taking
into account the expected timing of the Marketing Period), or obtain a waiver
of, the conditions to the Debt Commitment Letter that are within the
Purchasers control (but excluding any condition where the failure to be so
satisfied is a direct result of the Companys failure to furnish information
as required under _Section 7.08_ or the Companys or the Sellers breach of
any of their respective other obligations under this Agreement); (iv) subject
to the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter and upon the satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter, enforce its rights

 



      
 

 



 

to consummate the Debt Financing or to cause the Debt Financing Sources and
the other persons committing to fund the Debt Financing to fund the Financing
at the Closing under the Debt Commitment Letter (provided, however, that in no
event shall reasonable best efforts include any obligation on the part of
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates to commence or thereafter to commence any
litigation, arbitration, action or other adjudicatory or legal proceeding
against any Debt Financing Source); and (v) upon satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter, to consummate the Debt
Financing at or prior to the Closing, including using its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Debt Financing Sources and the other persons committing
to fund the Debt Financing to fund the Debt Financing at the Closing. The
Purchaser shall not permit or agree to any termination, amendment or
modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision under, or any
replacement of, any of the Debt Commitment Letter if such termination,
amendment, modification, waiver or replacement (A) reduces (or would have the
effect of reducing) the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing (including by
increasing the amount of fees to be paid or original issue discount), unless
the representation and warranty set forth in _Section 6.08_ hereof (as though
made at the time of the effectuation of such termination, amendment,
modification, waiver or replacement) shall remain true and correct; or (B)
imposes new or additional conditions or otherwise expands, amends or modifies
any of the conditions to the receipt of the Debt Financing, or otherwise
expands, amends or modifies any other provision of the Debt Commitment Letter
in a manner that would reasonably be expected to (x) delay or prevent the
funding of the Debt Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to the Debt
Commitment Letter that are in the Purchasers control) on the Closing Date or
(y) adversely impact the ability of Purchaser to enforce its rights against
other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter or solely to the extent definitive
loan agreements are entered into prior to the Closing Date, the definitive
agreements with respect thereto; provided that (i) the Purchaser shall not be
deemed to have violated this _Section 8.08_ if the Purchaser shall have (A)
provided prior written notice to the Seller of any termination, amendment,
modification, waiver or replacement it proposes to take or any other event,
fact or circumstance that would be restricted by the foregoing provisions of
this _Section 8.08_ and (B) demonstrated (to the reasonable satisfaction of
the Seller) that it has other funds available to it (on conditions not
materially less favorable in the aggregate to the Purchaser than the
conditions to the Debt Commitment Letter) that are sufficient to pay all other
amounts required to be paid by the Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement and in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (ii) for
the avoidance of doubt, neither the existence nor the exercise of any "flex"
provision in the Debt Commitment Letter shall constitute a breach of (or
notice under) this provision or any other provision of this Agreement.
Purchaser shall promptly deliver to the Seller copies of any such termination,
amendment, modification, waiver or replacement of the Debt Commitment Letter.
In no event shall the Purchaser have any liability for breach of its covenants
or agreements in this _Section 8.08_ if the Closing occurs.

 



 

(b) If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and
conditions contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter, the Purchaser shall (i)
promptly notify the Seller of such failure and the reasons therefor and (ii)
use its reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain alternative financing
from the same or alternative sources in an amount sufficient, when added to
the portion of the Debt Financing being replaced that is still available, to
consummate the transactions

 



      
 

 



 

contemplated hereby with terms and conditions that are not materially less
favorable to the Purchaser, in the aggregate, than the terms and conditions
set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter (giving effect to any applicable flex
provisions), except as agreed by the Purchaser, as promptly as practicable
following the occurrence of such event (the " _Alternative Debt Financing_ ").
The Purchaser shall as soon as reasonably practicable deliver a true, correct
and complete copy of each alternative financing commitment (collectively, a "
_New Debt Commitment Letter_ ") to the Company. Any reference in this
Agreement to the "Debt Financing" shall include the financing contemplated by
the Debt Commitment Letter on the date hereof, as permitted to be amended,
modified or replaced (in whole or in part) by this _Section 8.08_, including
any Alternative Debt Financing, and references to "Debt Commitment Letter"
shall include such debt commitment letters as permitted to be amended,
modified or replaced (in whole or in part) by this _Section 8.08_, including
any New Debt Commitment Letter.

 



 

(c) Prior to the Closing, the Purchaser shall keep the Company reasonably
informed, upon the request of the Company, of the status of its efforts to
arrange the Debt Financing and shall give the Company prompt notice: (i) of
any breach of any material provisions of any of the Debt Commitment Letter or
definitive document related to the Debt Financing by any party to any Debt
Commitment Letter or definitive document related to the Debt Financing of
which it has Knowledge, in each case to the extent such breach could
reasonably be expected to delay or prevent the Closing, and (ii) of the
receipt of any written notice or other written communication from any Debt
Financing Source with respect to any (A) actual or potential breach, default,
termination or repudiation by any party to any Debt Commitment Letter or any
definitive document related to the Debt Financing or any provisions of the
Debt Commitment Letter or (B) dispute or disagreement between or among any
parties to any Debt Commitment Letter with respect to the obligation to fund
the Debt Financing or the amount of the Debt Financing to be funded at the
Closing.

 _ADDITIONAL COVENANTS_

 



 

10.01 _Provision Respecting Legal Representation_.

 



 

(a) The Seller and the Company hereby inform the Purchaser that each of the
Company, the Seller, their respective Subsidiaries and GTCR have retained KandE
to act as its counsel in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby
and that KandE has not acted as counsel for any other party hereto in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby and that none of the other parties
hereto has the status of a client of KandE for conflict of interest or any other
purposes as a result thereof.

 



 

(b) The Purchaser, the Company and the Seller hereby agree that, in the event
that a dispute arises under this Agreement after the Closing between the
Purchaser, the

 



      
 

 



 

Company, and/or its Subsidiaries on the one hand, and the Seller, GTCR or
their respective post-Closing Affiliates, on the other hand, (an " _Agreement
Dispute_ ") KandE may represent the Seller, GTCR and/or such post-Closing
Affiliates in any Agreement Dispute even though the interests of the Seller,
GTCR and/or such post-Closing Affiliates may be directly adverse to the
Purchaser, the Company or its Subsidiaries, and even though KandE may have
represented the Company or its Subsidiaries in a matter substantially related
to such Agreement Dispute, or may be handling other matters for the Purchaser,
the Company or any of their Subsidiaries.

 



 

(c) The Purchaser further agrees that, in any Agreement Dispute, the portion
of the communications among KandE, GTCR, the Seller and their respective

communications made prior to the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries,
that (i) relate in any way to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and (ii) are subject to the attorney-client privilege (communications meeting
the requirements of clauses (i) and (ii) of this sentence are collectively
referred to as the " _Privileged Communications_ "), the attorneyclient
privilege and the expectation of client confidence belongs to the Seller, may

_Unaffiliated Party_ "). In the event of a dispute between the Purchaser, the
Company, and/or its Subsidiaries on the one hand, and an Unaffiliated Party,
on the other hand, (an " _Unaffiliated Party Suit_ "), the Purchaser, the
Company and its Subsidiaries may assert the attorney-client privilege to
prevent the disclosure of any Privileged Communications to such Unaffiliated
Party; _provided_ , however, that none of the Purchaser, the Company or its
Subsidiaries may waive such privilege without the prior written consent of
GTCR for any Third-Party Suit subject to indemnification by the Seller under
_Section 11.02(a)_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, in the event that any of the Purchaser, the Company or its
Subsidiaries is required or requested by governmental order, other order or

_provided that_ , as soon as reasonably practicable following such a request
or order, the Purchaser shall notify the Seller in writing so that the Seller
can seek such remedy as may be available to the Seller to prevent the
production or disclosure of, or access to, any of such Privileged

Communications in an Unaffiliated Party Suit, the Purchaser agrees to
reasonably assist the Seller in seeking such remedy.

 



 

(e) The Purchaser agrees that, in any Agreement Dispute, it will not, and that
it will cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to not, (i) seek to obtain such

or through other means, or (ii) use or rely on any of the Privileged
Communications. The Privileged Communications may be used by the Seller, GTCR
and/or any of their respective post-Closing Affiliates in connection with any
Agreement Dispute, including in any claim for indemnification brought by the
Purchaser.

(a) _Tax Returns_. The Purchaser shall prepare and file or cause to be
prepared and filed all Tax Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries for any
Taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date and that portion of any

Period_ ") that are filed after the Closing Date and, subject to the
indemnification obligations hereunder, shall pay or cause to be paid all Taxes
due with respect to such Tax Returns; _provided_ that, with respect to any
income Tax Returns of the Company its Subsidiaries for any Taxable period (or
portion thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date that reflects a Tax for
which the Seller may be liable, the Purchaser shall prepare such Tax Returns

thirty (30) days prior to the due date thereof (taking into account any
extensions of the due date), and the Purchaser shall allow the Seller to
comment on such Tax Return and shall consider in good faith all comments made
by the Seller that are received by the Purchaser at least ten (10) days prior

the Closing Date and ending after the Closing Date. With respect to Taxes of
the Company its Subsidiaries relating to a Straddle Period, the portion of any
Tax that is allocable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period will be determined as
follows: (i) in the case of real property Taxes, personal property Taxes and
similar ad valorem Taxes, the amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle
Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of
calendar days of such Straddle Period in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the
denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire Straddle
Period, and (ii) in the case of all other Taxes, determined as though the
taxable year of the Company and its Subsidiaries terminated at the close of
business on the Closing Date, except that exemptions, allowances or deductions
that are calculated on an annual basis (including depreciation and
amortization deductions), other than with respect to property purchased by the
Purchaser and placed in service after the Closing, shall be allocated on a per
diem basis. The parties hereto agree to deduct the Transaction Tax Deductions
on the Closing Date to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law and
shall file all Tax Returns consistently therewith. In the event of any
disagreement over the application of this _Section 10.02(a)_, including with
respect to the deductibility of any Transaction Tax Deductions or the amount
or timing of any payment to the Seller, the Valuation Firm shall resolve such
dispute in accordance with the principles set forth in _Section 1.04_.

 



 

(b) _Transfer Taxes_. The Purchaser and the Seller will each pay, and will
indemnify and hold the other harmless against one-half of any transfer,
documentary, sales, use, registration and real property transfer or gains tax,
stamp tax, excise tax, stock transfer tax, or other similar Tax imposed,
directly or indirectly, on the Company or the Seller as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively,

 



      
 

 



 

" _Transfer Taxes_ "), and any penalties or interest with respect to the
Transfer Taxes. The Seller and the Purchaser agree to cooperate with each
other in the filing of any returns with respect to Transfer Taxes, including
by promptly supplying any information in its possession that is reasonably
necessary to complete such returns.

 



 

(c) _Tax Sharing Agreements_. Any and all existing Tax sharing or similar
agreements between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand,
and any Affiliate of the Company other than one of its Subsidiaries, on the
other hand, shall be terminated and all payables and receivables arising
thereunder shall be settled, in each case prior to the Closing Date. After the
Closing Date, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall have any
further rights or liabilities thereunder or under any payables or receivables
arising thereunder.

 



 

(d) _Intermediary Transaction Tax Shelter_. The Purchaser shall not take any
action with respect to the Company or cause or permit the Company to take any
action that would cause the transaction contemplated by this Agreement to

(ii) The Purchaser shall have the right, directly or through its designated
representatives, to control the defense of any Tax Claim, including the

pay over, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, such Tax Refund to
an account or accounts designated by the Seller. The Purchaser will, and will
cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to, execute such documents, take
reasonable additional actions and otherwise reasonably cooperate as may be
necessary for the Purchaser, the Company and its Subsidiaries to perfect their
rights in and obtain all Tax Refunds for which any such Person is eligible and
to which the Seller is entitled. None of the Purchaser, the Company, or its
Subsidiaries shall forfeit, fail to collect or otherwise minimize any Tax
Refund to which the Seller would be entitled, whether through any election to
carry forward a net operating loss or otherwise, except as required by
applicable Laws. In the case of any Straddle Period, the amount of Tax Refunds
to which the Seller is entitled shall be determined as if the relevant Tax
period ended on the Closing Date. Notwithstanding any other provision in this
Agreement, if any such refunds that are subsequently required to be paid back
to a Governmental Entity, then such refunds shall be indemnifiable Losses for
which the Seller shall indemnity the Purchaser pursuant to _Article XI_.

Agreement, the Valuation Firm shall promptly resolve such dispute pursuant to

ARTICLE XI

 



 

 _SURVIVAL; INDEMNIFICATION_

 



 

11.01 _Survival of Representations and Warranties and Covenants_. The parties,
intending to contractually shorten the applicable statute of limitations,
hereby acknowledge, represent, warrant, covenant and agree that none of the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the parties in this
Agreement or in any instrument delivered by the parties

 



      
 

 



 

pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Closing other than (a) the
Company Fundamental Reps, Seller Fundamental Reps, Purchaser Fundamental Reps,
_Section 4.08_ and _Section 4.15_, each of which shall survive the Closing
through the earlier of (i) the thirtieth (30th) day following the date on
which the Purchaser publicly announces its earnings for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2015 and (ii) nine (9) months following the Closing (such
earliest date, the " _Survival Expiration Date_ "), and (b) all covenants and
other agreements that by their terms are to be performed after the Closing
shall survive the Closing in accordance with their terms. If written notice of
a claim has been given in the manner required by this _Article XI_ prior to
the expiration of the applicable representations and warranties by the party
seeking indemnification for such claim, then the relevant representations and
warranties of the applicable party shall survive solely as to such claim until
such claim has been finally resolved pursuant to this _Article XI_. Any claim
pursuant to _Section 11.02(a)(iii)_ must be made on or prior to the Survival
Expiration Date; provided, that if written notice of such a claim has been
given in the manner required by this _Article XI_ on or prior to the Survival
Expiration Date, then such claim shall survive until such claim has been
finally resolved pursuant to this _Article XI_. The aggregate amount of all
Losses under each such unresolved indemnification claim made in accordance
with this _Article XI_ which remains outstanding and unresolved as of the
Survival Expiration Date shall be collectively referred to, for purposes of
the Limited Guaranty or otherwise, as the " _Outstanding Claims_." Solely for
purposes of this _Article XI_, the representations and warranties contained
in _Article IV_, _Article V_ and _Article VI_ are made as of the date of
this Agreement and as of the Closing Date (unless expressly made as of an
earlier date, in which case they are made as of such date) so that an
Indemnitee may recover Losses for any failure of any representation or
warranty to be true and correct at either such date.

 



 

11.02 _Indemnification; Limits on Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the other provisions of this _Article XI_, from and after the
Closing, the Seller shall hold harmless and without duplication, indemnify and
defend the Purchaser and its Affiliates (including the Company and its
Subsidiaries after the Closing), their respective successors and permitted
assigns, and their respective stockholders, employees, officers, partners,
members, trustees and directors (in all cases other than the Seller and its
post-Closing Affiliates) (the " _Purchaser Indemnitees_ ") from and against,
and pay or reimburse the Purchaser Indemnitees for, any and all Losses that
any of them actually incur or pay to the extent arising out of or resulting
from:

 



 

(i) any inaccuracy in any (A) Seller Fundamental Rep made by the Seller, or
(B) Company Fundamental Rep or representation or warranty set forth in
_Section 4.08_ or _Section 4.15_ made by the Company;

 



 

(ii) any breach of any of the covenants or other agreements made in and to be
performed by the Seller after the Closing pursuant to this Agreement;

 



 

(iii) any Pre-Closing Taxes; and

 



 

(iv) any failure to reimburse the Purchaser pursuant to the provision titled
"Retainer and Fees Related to an Engagement Pursuant to Section 1.04" on
_Exhibit B_.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Subject to the other provisions of this _Article XI_, from and after the
Closing, the Purchaser shall hold harmless and, without duplication, indemnify
and defend the Seller and its Affiliates, their respective successors and
permitted assigns, and their respective stockholders, employees, officers,
partners, members, trustees and directors (the " _Seller Indemnitees_ ") from
and against, and pay or reimburse the Seller Indemnitees for, any and all
Losses that any of them incur, pay or sustain arising out of or resulting
from:

 



 

(i) any inaccuracy in any Purchaser Fundamental Rep made by the Purchaser; and

 



 

(ii) any breach of any of the covenants or other agreements made in and to be
performed by the Purchaser after the Closing pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary:

 



 

(i) the maximum amount of indemnifiable Losses that may be recovered from the
Seller for all claims for indemnification pursuant to _Section 11.02(a)_
shall be $20,000,000 (the " _Indemnity Cap_ ");

 



 

(ii) the maximum amount of indemnifiable Losses that may be recovered from the
Purchaser for all claims for indemnification pursuant to _Section 11.02(b)_
shall be an amount equal to the Indemnity Cap;

 



 

(iii) in calculating any amount indemnifiable hereunder in respect of Losses,
such Losses shall be reduced by (A) any amounts actually recovered by the
Indemnitee under applicable insurance policies (net of any increase in related
premiums), under any indemnification or similar agreements, or other rights of
recovery with respect to such Losses (other than from an Affiliate of such
Indemnitee), net of any deductible or any other reasonable and necessary out-
of-pocket expense incurred by the Indemnitee in obtaining such recovery and
(B) the amount of any Tax benefits actually realized in the form of a
reduction in income Tax liability of the Company and its Affiliates in the
taxable year that includes the relevant Loss resulting from the relevant Loss
(calculated by comparing the income Tax liability of the Company and its
Affiliates, taking the relevant Loss into account, with the income Tax
liability that the Company and its Affiliates would have had absent the Loss).
If an Indemnitee or its Affiliates receives any such recovery described above
that was not previously taken into account after an indemnification payment by
the Indemnifying Party has been made, then such Indemnitee or its Affiliates
shall promptly reimburse the Indemnifying Party for any payment made, but not
in excess of the amount received by the Indemnitee or its Affiliates. The
Indemnitee shall take all commercially reasonable actions to seek full and
prompt recovery under all insurance policies and any other rights, remedies or
agreements covering any Losses to the same extent as if it would if such Loss
were not subject to indemnification hereunder. Each party hereby waives, to
the extern permitted under its applicable insurance policies, any

 



      
 

 



 

subrogation rights that its insurer may have with respect to any indemnifiable
Losses;

 



 

(iv) the Purchaser shall not be entitled to recover damages or obtain payment,
reimbursement, restitution or indemnity more than once in respect of any one
Loss or related group of Losses; and

 



 

(v) no Purchaser Indemnitee shall have any right to indemnification hereunder
with respect to any Loss or alleged Loss to the extent such Loss or alleged
Loss is included in the calculation of Cash, Indebtedness, Transaction
Expenses or Net Working Capital as finally determined pursuant to _Section
1.04_.

 



 

11.03 _Claims Notice_.

 



 

(a) Promptly after the Person seeking indemnification pursuant to _Section
11.02_ (the " _Indemnitee_ ") has knowledge of any event or circumstance,
including any written claim by a third party, that would reasonably be
expected to give rise to indemnification under this _Article XI_ (a " _Third-
Party Claim_ "), the Indemnitee shall deliver to the Person from which
indemnification is sought (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") a written notice (a "
_Claim Notice_ ") setting forth in reasonable detail a description of the
matter giving rise to indemnification hereunder, including, if known, the
anticipated Losses; _provided_ , _however_ , that any failure or delay by the
Indemnitee in delivering a Claim Notice to the Indemnifying Party shall not
affect the Indemnitees right to indemnification under this _Article XI_,
except to the extent the Indemnifying Party has been materially prejudiced by
such failure or delay.

 



 

(b) Promptly, but in any event no later than twenty (20) Business Days, after
receipt by the Indemnifying Party of a Claim Notice of a Third-Party Claim,
such Indemnifying Party may, at its option, assume the defense of the
Indemnitee against such claim (including the employment of counsel of the
Indemnifying Partys choosing that is reasonably acceptable to the
Indemnitee); provided, that the Purchaser shall have the exclusive right to
control the defense, prosecution and resolution of a Third-Party Claim that is
brought by or involves a Governmental Authority (the party conducting the
defense of such Third-Party Claim is referred to herein as the " _Controlling
Party_ " and the other party is referred to herein as the " _Non-Controlling
Party_ "). The Non-Controlling Party, at the expense of the Indemnifying
Party, shall cooperate in the compromise of, or defense against, such claim.
Except with the prior written consent of the Indemnitee, such consent not to
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, no Indemnifying Party shall
settle or compromise any Third-Party Claim or permit a default judgment or
consent to an entry of judgment unless such settlement, compromise or judgment
(i) relates solely to money damages, (ii) provides for a full, unconditional
and irrevocable release by such third party of each Indemnitee and (iii) does
not contain any admission or finding of wrongdoing on behalf of the
Indemnitee. Until the Indemnifying Party shall have so assumed the defense of
the Indemnitee against such claim following the delivery of such Claim Notice,
the Indemnitee may, but shall not be obligated to, undertake the defense of
such claim on behalf of and for the account and risk of the Indemnifying
Party; _provided_ , that (x) such Indemnitee, except with the prior written
consent of the Indemnifying Party, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or

 



      
 

 



 

delayed, shall not settle or compromise any Third-Party Claim or permit a
default judgment or consent to an entry of judgment (subject to the exceptions
set forth in _clauses (i)_ through _(iii)_ above, and (y) if such Indemnitee
is entitled to indemnification under this _Article XI_ (as determined by an
agreement of the parties or by a final and non-appealable judgment of a court
of competent jurisdiction), all reasonable out-of-pocket legal and other
expenses reasonably incurred by the Indemnitee shall be borne by the
Indemnifying Party. Any Non-Controlling Party shall have the right to employ
separate counsel in any such action or claim and to participate in the defense
thereof either (I) at its own expense or (II) at the Indemnifying Partys cost
and expense if (1) the employment of such counsel has been specifically
authorized in writing by the Indemnifying Party, (2) on the reasonable advice
of legal counsel to the Indemnitee, a conflict or potential conflict of
interest exists between the Indemnitee and the Indemnifying Party that would
make such separate representation advisable or (3) one or more defenses are
available to the Indemnitee that are not available to the Indemnifying Party;
_provided_ , that such expenses shall be paid by the Indemnifying Party if and
only if (and at the time) that the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification
in respect of such Third-Party Claim (as determined by an agreement of the
parties or by a final and non-appealable judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction). After any such claim has been filed or initiated, each party
shall make available to the other parties and their attorneys and accountants
all pertinent information under its control relating to such claim which is
made available under the terms of a confidentiality agreement or similar
protective measures, and the parties agree to render to each other such
assistance as they may reasonably require of each other in order to facilitate
the proper and adequate defense of any such claim.

 



 

11.04 _Recovery of Losses_. With respect to any indemnification claim made
pursuant to this _Article XI_, all indemnifiable Losses shall be paid as
follows:

 



 

(a) With respect to the Seller, the Seller shall promptly pay to the Purchaser
the amount of the Purchasers Losses indemnifiable by the Seller pursuant to
_Section 11.02(a)_ by wire transfer to an account designated in writing by

or otherwise, including a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement made by any party hereto, except (i) for the determination of the
Final NWC Adjustment Amount, which shall be governed by _Section 1.04_, and
(ii) as provided in the Limited Guaranty.

 



 

(b) The waiver of any condition based on the accuracy of any such
representation or warranty, or on the performance of, or compliance with, any
such

 



      
 

 



 

covenant or agreement, will not affect the right to indemnification or any
other remedy based on such representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements.

 



 

11.06 _Mitigation_. Each Person entitled to indemnification hereunder shall
take all reasonable steps to mitigate all Losses after becoming aware of any

familiar with such uncertainties and that the Purchaser is taking full
responsibility for making its own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of
all estimates, projections, budgets, pipeline reports and other forecasts and
plans so furnished to it, including the reasonableness of the assumptions
underlying such estimates, projections, budgets, pipeline reports and other
forecasts and plans. Accordingly, the Purchaser hereby acknowledges that
neither

 



      
 

 



 

the Seller nor the Company is making any representation or warranty with
respect to such estimates, projections, budgets, pipeline reports and other
forecasts and plans, including the reasonableness of the assumptions
underlying such estimates, projections, budgets, pipeline reports, forecasts
and plans, and that the Purchaser has not relied on any such estimates,
projections, budgets, pipeline reports or other forecasts or plans. The
Purchaser further agrees that (i) neither the Seller nor the Company or any
other Person will have or be subject to any liability to the Purchaser or any
other Person resulting from the distribution to the Purchaser, or the
Purchasers use of, any such information, including any information, document
or material made available to the Purchaser in certain "data rooms,"
management presentations, the confidential information memorandum, or any
other form in expectation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including liability related to the completeness or accuracy of any such
information, and (ii) the Purchaser has not relied on any such information.

 



 

13.02 _Press Releases and Communications_. No press release or public
announcement related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
herein, or prior to the Closing any other announcement or communication to the
employees, customers or suppliers of the Company, shall be issued or made by
any party hereto (or any Affiliate of a party hereto) without the joint
approval of the Purchaser and the Seller, unless required by Law or the
listing requirements of the Nasdaq (on the reasonable advice of counsel) in
which case the Purchaser and the Seller shall have the right to review such
press release, announcement or communication prior to issuance, distribution
or publication to the extent reasonably practicable. For the avoidance of
doubt, the parties acknowledge and agree that the Seller and its Affiliates
may provide general information about the subject matter of this Agreement in
connection with their fund raising, marketing, informational or reporting
activities. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, unless
required by Law or the listing requirements of the Nasdaq (on the reasonable
advice of counsel), the Purchaser, and after the Closing, the Company, shall
not use the name or mark of any post-Closing Affiliates of the Seller, or any
abbreviation, variation or derivative thereof, in any press release, public
announcement or similar public document or communication relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the express written
consent of the Seller or, in the event the Seller ceases to exist, GTCR.

 



 

13.03 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, the Company,
on the one hand, and the Purchaser, on the other hand, shall pay all of their
own expenses (including attorneys and accountants fees and expenses and, in
the case of the Company, the expenses of the Seller) in connection with the
negotiation of this Agreement, the performance of their obligations hereunder
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
_provided_ that the Purchaser shall pay the Transaction Expenses as provided
in _Section 2.02(d)_.

13.05 _Assignment_. This Agreement and all of the provisions hereof shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns; _provided_ that neither this
Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder may be
assigned or delegated by (a) the Purchaser without the prior written consent
of, prior to the Closing, the Company or, after Closing, the Seller, or (b)
the Seller or the Company

 



      
 

 



 

without the prior written consent of the Purchaser. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, (i) the Purchaser may assign (without relieving it of its
obligations under) this Agreement in whole or in part to any of its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates and (ii) each of the Purchaser and the Company may
collaterally assign its rights under this Agreement to any lender providing
financing to the Purchaser or, following the Closing, the Company, in each
case, without such consent or any further action on the part of either the
Company or the Seller.

 



 

13.06 _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement
shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under
applicable Law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be
prohibited by or invalid under applicable Law, such provision shall be
ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without
invalidating the remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions of
this Agreement, unless the severance of such provision would be in opposition
to the parties intent with respect to such provision.

 



 

13.07 _References_. The table of contents and the section and other headings
and subheadings contained in this Agreement and the Exhibits hereto are solely
for the purpose of reference, are not part of the agreement of the parties
hereto, and shall not in any way affect the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement or any Exhibit hereto. All references to days or months shall be
deemed references to calendar days or months. All references to "$" shall be
deemed references to United States dollars. Unless the context otherwise
requires, any reference to an "Article," "Section," "Exhibit," "Disclosure
Schedule" or "Schedule" shall be deemed to refer to an article of this
Agreement, section of this Agreement, exhibit to this Agreement or a schedule
to this Agreement, as applicable. Capitalized terms used in the Disclosure
Schedules and not otherwise defined therein have the meanings given to them in
this Agreement. The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words of
similar import referring to this Agreement refer to this Agreement as a whole
and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. The word "including" or
any variation thereof means "including, without limitation" and shall not be
construed to limit any general statement that it follows to the specific or
similar items or matters immediately following it. The phrase "ordinary course
of business" means "ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice." Unless the context otherwise clearly indicates, each defined term
used in this Agreement shall have a comparable meaning when used in its plural
or singular form.

 



 

13.08 _Construction_. The language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to
be the language chosen by the parties hereto to express their mutual intent,
and no rule of strict construction shall be applied against any Person. The
Disclosure Schedules have been arranged for purposes of convenience in
separately titled sections; however, each section of the Disclosure Schedules
shall be deemed to incorporate by reference all information disclosed in any
other section of the Disclosure Schedules to the extent its relevance is
reasonably apparent on its face. Any information set forth in any Schedule or
incorporated in any Section of the Agreement shall, to the extent its
relevance is reasonably apparent on its face, be considered to have been set
forth in each other Schedule and shall be deemed to modify the representations
and warranties in _Article IV_ or _Article V_ of the Agreement whether or
not such representations and warranties refer to such Schedule or any
Schedule; _provided_ that the disclosures and information in the Schedules
shall not constitute a representation or warranty and shall not expand any
representation or warranty in _Article IV_ or _Article V_. The specification
of any dollar amount or the inclusion of any item in the representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement or the Disclosure Schedules or Exhibits
is not intended to imply that the amounts, or higher or lower

 

 _ _

       
 

 



 

amounts, or the items so included, or other items, are or are not required to
be disclosed (including whether such amounts or items are required to be
disclosed as material or threatened) or are within or outside of the ordinary
course of business. The information contained in this Agreement and in the
Disclosure Schedules and Exhibits hereto is disclosed solely for purposes of
this Agreement, and no information contained herein or therein shall be deemed
to be an admission by any party hereto to any third party of any matter
whatsoever (including any violation of Law or breach of contract). For
purposes of this Agreement, if the Company or a Person acting on its behalf
posts a document to the online data room hosted on behalf of the Company and
located at https://datasite.merrillcorp.com, such document shall be deemed to
have been "delivered," "furnished" or "made available" (or any phrase of
similar import) to the Purchaser by the Company.

 



 

13.09 _Amendment and Waiver_. Any provision of this Agreement or the
Disclosure Schedules or Exhibits hereto may be amended or waived only in a
writing signed by the Purchaser, the Company and the Seller. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, any amendment or modification of this
_Section 13.09_ or _Section 13.11_, _Section 13.15_, _Section 13.16_,
_Section 13.17_ or _Section 13.19_ that is adverse to the Debt Financing
Sources or Debt Financing Source Related Parties shall not be made without the
prior written consent of such Debt Financing Sources.

 



 

13.10 _Complete Agreement_. This Agreement and the documents referred to
herein (including the Confidentiality Agreement) contain the complete
agreement between the parties hereto and supersede any prior understandings,
agreements or representations by or between the parties, written or oral,
which may have related to the subject matter hereof in any way.

 



 

13.11 _Third-Party Beneficiaries_. _Section 8.03_ shall be enforceable by
each Indemnified Person and his or her heirs and representatives. Except as
otherwise expressly provided herein, including, without limitation, with
respect to the Debt Financing Sources and the Debt Financing Sources Related
Parties, which shall be express third party beneficiaries of and shall be
entitled to enforce the provisions (solely as such provision relates to such
Debt Financing Sources and Debt Financing Sources Related Parties in such
capacity as third party beneficiary) of this _Section 13.11_ or Section _
13.09_, _Section 13.15_, _Section 13.16_, _Section 13.17_ or _Section
13.19_, nothing expressed or referred to in this Agreement will be construed
to give any Person other than the parties to this Agreement any legal or
equitable right, remedy, or claim under or with respect to this Agreement or
any provision of this Agreement.

 



 

13.12 _Purchaser Deliveries_. The Purchaser agrees and acknowledges that all
documents or other items delivered or made available to the Purchasers
Representatives shall be deemed to be delivered or made available, as the case
may be, to the Purchaser for all purposes hereunder.

 



 

13.13 _Delivery by Electronic Transmission_. This Agreement and any signed
agreement entered into in connection herewith or contemplated hereby, and any
amendments hereto or thereto, to the extent signed and delivered by means of a
facsimile machine or by .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpeg or similar attachment to
electronic mail, shall be treated in all manner and respects as an original
contract and shall be considered to have the same binding legal effects as if
it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person. At the
request of any party hereto or to any such contract, each other party hereto
or thereto shall reexecute original forms thereof and deliver them to all
other parties. No party hereto or to any such contract shall raise the use of
a

 



      
 

 



 

facsimile machine or by .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpeg or similar attachment to
electronic mail to deliver a signature or the fact that any signature or
contract was transmitted or communicated through the use of facsimile machine
or by .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpeg or similar attachment to electronic mail as a
defense to the formation of a contract and each such party forever waives any
such defense.

 



 

13.14 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts,
any one of which need not contain the signature of more than one party, but
all such counterparts taken together shall constitute one and the same
instrument.

 



 

13.15 _Governing Law_. All issues and questions concerning the construction,
validity, interpretation and enforceability of this Agreement and the Exhibits
and Schedules hereto shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with,
the Laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any choice of law
or conflict of law rules or provisions (whether of the State of Delaware or
any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any
jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

 



 

13.16 _Jurisdiction_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, any Proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any
matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought in the United States
District Court for the District of Delaware, the Delaware Court of Chancery of
the State of Delaware or any other court of the State of Delaware, and each of
the parties hereto hereby consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of such
courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such
Proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any
objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any
such Proceeding in any such court or that any such Proceeding which is brought
in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Process in any
such Proceeding may be served on any party anywhere in the world, whether
within or without the jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the
foregoing, each party agrees that service of process on such party as provided
in _Section 13.04_ shall be deemed effective service of process on such
party. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT,
EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY AGREES THAT IT WILL NOT BRING OR SUPPORT
ANY ACTION, CAUSE OF ACTION, CLAIM, CROSS-CLAIM OR THIRD PARTY CLAIM OF ANY
KIND OR DESCRIPTION, WHETHER AT LAW OR IN EQUITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT OR IN
TORT OR OTHERWISE, AGAINST ANY DEBT FINANCING SOURCE OR ANY DEBT FINANCING
SOURCE RELATED PARTY IN ANY WAY RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, INCLUDING ANY DISPUTE ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING IN ANY WAY TO THE DEBT COMMITMENT LETTER THE DEFINITIVE DEBT
DOCUMENTS, THE PERFORMANCE OF ANY THEREOF OR THE DEBT FINANCING, IN ANY FORUM
OTHER THAN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW
YORK OR ANY NEW YORK STATE COURT SITTING IN NEW YORK CITY, AND THAT THE
PROVISIONS OF SECTION 13.17 RELATING TO THE WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL SHALL APPLY
TO ANY SUCH ACTION, CAUSE OF ACTION, CLAIM, CROSS-CLAIM OR THIRD PARTY CLAIM.

 



 

13.17 _Waiver of Trial by Jury_. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY WAIVES,
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY
CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION, OR CAUSE OF ACTION (A) ARISING

 



      
 

 



 

UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY DEBT COMMITMENT LETTER OR OTHER FINANCING
COMMITMENT OR (B) IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH OR RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THE
DEALINGS AMONG THE PARTIES HERETO AND/OR THE DEBT FINANCING SOURCES AND/OR THE
DEBT FINANCING SOURCE RELATED PARTIES IN RESPECT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY DEBT
COMMITMENT LETTER OR OTHER FINANCING COMMITMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS
RELATED HERETO OR THERETO, IN EACH CASE WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER
ARISING, AND WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, EQUITY, OR OTHERWISE. EACH PARTY TO
THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY AGREES AND CONSENTS THAT ANY SUCH CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION,
OR CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE DECIDED BY COURT TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY, AND THAT
THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT AND/OR ANY DEBT COMMITMENT LETTER OR OTHER
FINANCING COMMITMENT MAY FILE A COPY OF THIS AGREEMENT WITH ANY COURT AS
WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF THE PARTIES HERETO TO THE WAIVER OF THEIR
RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.

 



 

13.18 _Non-Recourse_. Except as expressly set forth herein and in the Limited
Guaranty, this Agreement may only be enforced against, and any claim or cause
of action based upon, arising out of or related to this Agreement may only be
brought against, the Persons that are expressly named as parties to this
Agreement. Except to the extent named as a party to this Agreement, and then
only to the extent of the specific obligations of such parties set forth in
this Agreement, no past, present or future shareholder, member, partner,
manager, director, officer, employee, Affiliate, agent or representative of
any party to this Agreement or any Subsidiary of Company will have any
liability (whether in contract, tort, equity or otherwise) for any of the
representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or other obligations or
liabilities of any of the parties to this Agreement or for any claim based
upon, arising out of or related to this Agreement.

 



 

13.19 _Specific Performance_.

 



 

(a) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that the rights of each party to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby are unique and recognizes and
affirms that in the event of a breach of this Agreement by any party, money
damages may be inadequate and the non-breaching party may have no adequate
remedy at law. Accordingly, the parties agree that such non breaching party
shall have the right, in addition to any other rights and remedies existing in
their favor at law or in equity, to enforce their rights and the other partys
obligations hereunder not only by an action or actions for damages but also by
an action or actions for specific performance, injunctive and/or other
equitable relief (without posting of bond or other security).

 



 

(b) To the extent any party hereto brings any Proceeding before any
Governmental Entity to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and
provisions of this Agreement prior to the Closing, the Outside Date shall
automatically be extended by (i) the amount of time during which such action,
claim, complaint or other proceeding is pending, plus five (5) Business Days,
or (ii) such other time period established by the court presiding over such
action, claim, complaint or other proceeding.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, (i)
none of the Seller, the Company, any of their respective Subsidiaries,
Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, partners, managers,
members, stockholders or representatives, or any Person claiming by, through
or under any such Person, shall have any rights or claims against any Debt
Financing Source, in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or in respect of any, or in
respect of any oral representations made or alleged to have been made in
connection herewith or therewith, including any dispute arising out of or
relating in any way to the Debt Commitment Letter or the performance thereof
or the financings contemplated thereby, whether at law or equity, in contract,
in tort or otherwise and (ii) no Debt Financing Source shall have any
liability (whether in contract, in tort or otherwise) to the Seller, the
Company, any of their respective Subsidiaries, Affiliates, directors,
officers, employees, agents, partners, managers, members, stockholders or
representatives, or any Person claiming by, through or under any such Person
for any obligations or liabilities of the Seller or the Company under this
Agreement or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby or in respect of any oral
representations made or alleged to have been made in connection herewith or
therewith, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the
Commitment Letter or the performance thereof or the financings contemplated
thereby, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise;
_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this clause (ii) shall affect in any
manner the express rights of the Company, its Subsidiaries and their
respective post-Closing Affiliates following the Closing pursuant to the
definitive documentation entered into in connection with the funding of the
Debt Financing.

 



 

13.20 _Time is of the Essence_. The parties hereby expressly acknowledge and
agree that time is of the essence for each and every provision of this
Agreement.
