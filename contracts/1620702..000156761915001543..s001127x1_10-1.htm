useful in the determination of the fair market value of the Applicable Assets.

reasonable access to all information prepared by or on behalf of the Parties
with respect to the Applicable Assets to the extent reasonably requested by

fair market value of the Applicable Assets as soon as practicable, but in any
event within thirty (30) calendar days (or such other time as the parties
hereto shall agree in writing) of the retention of the Independent Expert.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Independent
Expert shall, in determining the fair market value of the Applicable Assets,
assume that the Fixed Assumptions remain unchanged as agreed in the Framework
Financial Model. The findings of the Independent Expert shall be final and
binding on the Parties.

accordance with this _Section 3.4_.

in _Sections 3.1_ , _3.2_ , and _3.3_ , the Parties shall execute and deliver
