                   would subject it to service of process in any jurisdiction
                   where such entity is not now so subject, except as to matters
                   and transactions arising solely from the offer and sale of
                   the Exchangeable Shares and the Duke Energy Common Shares;

             material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be

             misleading in the light of the circumstances in which it is
             furnished.

         (c) Each of Duke Energy and Westcoast shall promptly notify the other
             if at any time before or after the Effective Time it becomes aware
             that the Circular or an application for an order or a registration
             statement described in Section 2.6 contains any misrepresentation
             (as defined in the Securities Act) or any untrue statement of a

             stated therein or necessary to make the statements contained
             therein not misleading in light of the circumstances in which they
             are made, or that otherwise requires an amendment or supplement to
             the Circular or such application or registration statement. In any
             such event, Duke Energy and Westcoast shall cooperate in the
             preparation of a supplement or amendment to the Circular or such

             Securityholders or filed with the relevant securities regulatory
             authorities.

         (d) Westcoast shall ensure that the Circular complies with all
             applicable Laws and, without limiting the generality of the

             (as defined in the Securities Act) or any untrue statement of a
             material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
             stated therein or necessary to make the statements contained
             therein not misleading in light of the circumstances in which they
             are made (other than with respect to any information relating to

             generality of the foregoing, Westcoast shall ensure that the
             Circular complies with OSC Rule 54-501 and provides Westcoast
             Securityholders with information in sufficient detail to permit
             them to form a reasoned judgment concerning the matters to be
             placed before them at the Westcoast Meeting.

         (e) Duke Energy shall ensure that the Form S-3 and Form S-8 comply with
             all applicable Laws and, without limiting the generality of the
             foregoing, that such documents do not contain any untrue statement
             of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
             stated therein or necessary to make the statements contained
             therein not misleading in light of the circumstances in which they
             are made (other than with respect to any information relating to
             and provided by Westcoast).

         Westcoast represents and warrants to the Duke Energy Parties as follows

which exceptions shall specifically identify the relevant section hereof to
which it relates):

         (a) Each of Westcoast and its subsidiaries has been duly organized or
             formed and is validly existing under the Laws of its jurisdiction
             of organization or formation with full corporate or legal power and
             authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to conduct
             its businesses as currently owned and conducted except where,
             individually or in the aggregate, the failure of a subsidiary other

             Subsidiary to be so organized, formed or existing or to have such
             power or authority would not have a Material Adverse Effect on
             Westcoast. Each of Westcoast and its subsidiaries is duly qualified
             to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the
             business conducted by it or the ownership or leasing of its
             properties requires it to so qualify, except where, individually or
             in the aggregate, the failure to be so qualified would not have a
             Material Adverse Effect on Westcoast.

         (b) Section 3.1 of the Westcoast Disclosure Letter sets forth, as of
             the date hereof, a true and complete list of each of Westcoast's
             subsidiaries and Partially Owned Entities, together with (i) the

             percentage interest owned by Westcoast or any of its subsidiaries
             in such person. Neither Westcoast nor any of its subsidiaries is
             subject to any obligation in excess of $10 million to provide funds
             to or make any investment in (in the form of a loan, capital
             contribution or otherwise) any subsidiary, Partially Owned Entity
             or other person other than Westcoast or a wholly owned subsidiary
             of Westcoast.

         (c) Westcoast has heretofore made available to Duke Energy complete and
             correct copies of its governing documents as well as the governing
             documents of each of its subsidiaries and Partially Owned Entities,

             Options have been granted.

         (b) All of the Westcoast Common Shares and First Preferred Shares have
             been duly authorized and are validly issued and fully paid and
             non-assessable, were not issued in violation of pre-emptive or

             authorized and are validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable,

             encumbrances, except for restrictions on transfers contained in
             governing documents and except where, individually or in the
             aggregate, the failure of the shares or ownership interest in a
             subsidiary other than a Material Subsidiary to be so authorized or
             issued or owned free and clear would not have a Material Adverse
             Effect on Westcoast.

         (c) Except as described in Section 3.2(a) above, as of the date hereof,
             there are no outstanding options, warrants, subscriptions, puts,

             any of its subsidiaries or any other person and neither Westcoast
             nor any of its subsidiaries or, to the knowledge of Westcoast, any
             of its Partially Owned Entities has any obligation of any kind to
             issue any additional securities or to pay for or repurchase any
             securities. There are not outstanding as of the date hereof any
             stock appreciation rights, phantom equity or similar rights,
             agreements, arrangements or commitments based upon the book value,
             income or any other attribute of Westcoast or any of its
             subsidiaries. There are no outstanding bonds, debentures or other
             evidences of indebtedness of Westcoast or any of its subsidiaries

             disposition or registration of any outstanding securities of
             Westcoast, any of its subsidiaries or any of its Partially Owned
             Entities.

         (d) Since June 30, 2001, except for issuances of Westcoast Common
             Shares pursuant to Westcoast Options granted prior to the date
             hereof, pursuant to the Westcoast Dividend Reinvestment Plan and
             upon conversion of First Preferred Shares pursuant to their terms,
             there have been no Westcoast capital stock, voting securities or
             securities convertible or exchangeable therefor issued or purchased
             for cancellation.

             Partially Owned Entities, have conducted their respective
             businesses only in the ordinary course in a manner consistent with
             past practice and there has been no Material Adverse Effect with
             respect to Westcoast or any event, occurrence or development which
             would be reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
             Westcoast or which materially and adversely affects the ability of
             Westcoast to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

         (b) Except as disclosed in the Westcoast SRA Reports or Westcoast SEC
             Reports filed prior to the date hereof, since December 31, 2000,
             none of Westcoast or any of its subsidiaries, or, to the knowledge

             conduct that is proscribed during the Pre-Effective Date Period by
             Section 5.1.

3.7      EMPLOYMENT MATTERS

         (a) Except as set forth in the management proxy circular prepared in
             connection with the Annual Meeting of Westcoast held on April 25,
             2001 or Section 3.7 of the Westcoast Disclosure Letter, neither
             Westcoast nor any of its subsidiaries is a party to any written or
             oral policy, agreement, obligation or understanding providing for
             severance or termination payments to, or any employment agreement
             with, any former or current director, officer or employee other
             than any agreement which applies to only one individual and which
             does not provide for payment to such individual in excess of
             $150,000 in any one calendar year and other than as required by
             applicable Law for employees without agreements as to notice or
             severance or pursuant to collective bargaining agreements.

         (b) Neither Westcoast nor any of its subsidiaries is a party to any
             consulting contract, written or oral, providing for compensation of
             any individual in excess of $350,000 per calendar year.

         (c) Neither Westcoast nor any of its subsidiaries has agreed to
             recognize any union or other collective bargaining representative,
             nor has any union or other collective bargaining representative
             been certified as the exclusive bargaining representative of any of
             Westcoast's or any of its subsidiaries' employees. No labor union
             or



                             COMBINATION AGREEMENT

             representative of the employees of Westcoast or any of its
             subsidiaries claims to be seeking to represent employees of
             Westcoast or any of its subsidiaries other than those that are
             parties to executed collective bargaining agreements identified in
             Section 3.7 of the Westcoast Disclosure Letter. To the knowledge of
             Westcoast, no union organizational campaign or representation
             petitions are currently pending with respect to any of the
             employees of Westcoast or any of its subsidiaries or Partially
             Owned Entities. Neither Westcoast nor any of its subsidiaries is a
             party to, or bound by, any collective bargaining agreement or any
             other labor contract applicable to any employees of Westcoast or
             its subsidiaries. All collective bargaining agreements to which
             Westcoast is a party have been duly ratified and there are no
             written or oral agreements which modify the terms of any such
             collective bargaining agreement. No collective bargaining
             agreements or other labor contracts relating to employees of
             Westcoast or its subsidiaries are being negotiated. To the
             knowledge of Westcoast, neither Westcoast nor any of its
             subsidiaries have breached any of their obligations under any
             collective bargaining agreements that would have a Material Adverse
             Effect on Westcoast. There is no labor strike or labor dispute,
             slowdown, lockout or stoppage actually pending or threatened
             against or affecting Westcoast or its subsidiaries, individually or
             in the aggregate, that would be reasonably expected to have a
             Material Adverse Effect on Westcoast, and Westcoast and its
             subsidiaries have not experienced any labor strikes or labor
             disputes, slowdowns, lockouts or stoppages since December 31, 1998,
             that had a Material Adverse Effect on Westcoast. To the knowledge
             of Westcoast, no union or collective bargaining representative has
             applied to have Westcoast or any of its subsidiaries declared a
             related or successor employer pursuant to applicable labor Laws.

         (d) All employees and former employees of Westcoast and its
             subsidiaries have been, or will have been on or before the
             Effective Date, paid or amounts in respect thereof shall have been
             accrued for wages, salaries, commissions, bonuses, vacation pay,
             severance and termination pay, sick pay, and other compensation for
             all services performed by them or that was accrued by them up to
             the Effective Date, in accordance with the obligations of Westcoast
             and its subsidiaries under any employment or labor practices and
             policies or any collective bargaining agreement or individual
             agreement to which Westcoast or its subsidiaries is a party, or by
             which Westcoast or its subsidiaries may be bound, except for, in
             the case of severance and termination pay, statutory and common law
             requirements for payment in lieu of reasonable notice of
             termination.

         (e) There are no current, pending or, to the knowledge of Westcoast,
             threatened proceedings before any board or tribunal or claims with
             respect to employment and labor Laws, including, but not limited
             to, employment and labor standards, unfair labor practices,
             employment discrimination, occupational health and safety,
             employment equity, pay equity, workers' compensation, human rights
             and labor relations, other than such proceedings and claims which,
             individually or in the aggregate, would not have a Material Adverse
             Effect on Westcoast. Westcoast and its subsidiaries are not subject
             to any settlement agreement, conciliation agreement, letter of
             commitment, deficiency letter or consent decree with any present or
             former employee or applicant for employment, labor union or other
             employee representative,



                             COMBINATION AGREEMENT

             or any Government Entity or arbitrator relating to claims of unfair
             labor practices, employment discrimination, or other claims with
             respect to employment and labor practices and policies that would
             have a Material Adverse Effect on Westcoast, and no Government
             Entity or arbitrator has issued a judgment, order, decree,
             injunction, decision, award or finding with respect to the
             employment and labor practices or policies of Westcoast or its
             subsidiaries which currently has or would be reasonably expected to
             have a Material Adverse Effect on Westcoast. There are no
             outstanding assessments, penalties, fines, liens, charges,
             surcharges, or other amounts due and owing pursuant to any
             workplace safety and insurance legislation by Westcoast or any of
             its subsidiaries and they have not been reassessed in any material
             respect under such legislation during the past three years and, to
             the knowledge of Westcoast, no audit is currently being performed
             pursuant to any applicable workplace safety and insurance
             legislation. There are no claims or, to the knowledge of Westcoast,
             potential claims which may materially and adversely affect accident
             cost experience.

3.8      REPORTS; FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

         (a) Since January 1, 1998, Westcoast and its subsidiaries have timely
             filed all forms, reports, schedules, statements and other documents
             required to be filed with (i) Canadian securities regulatory
             authorities (collectively the "Westcoast SRA Reports"), (ii) the
             SEC under the Exchange Act or the 1933 Act (collectively the
             "Westcoast SEC Reports"), (iii) any other applicable state,
             provincial or territorial securities authority, and (iv) any other
             Governmental Entity, except in each case where the failure to file
             any such forms, reports, schedules, statements or other documents
             would not have a Material Adverse Effect on Westcoast (all such
             forms, reports, schedules, statements and other documents are
             collectively referred to as the "Westcoast Documents"). The
             Westcoast Documents at the time filed (x) did not contain any
             misrepresentation (as defined in the Securities Act), (y) did not
             contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
             material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
             to make the statements contained therein not misleading in light of
             the circumstances under which they were made and (z) complied in
             all material respects with the requirements of applicable Laws
             (including, with respect to the Westcoast SEC Reports, the 1933
             Act, the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder).
             Westcoast has not filed any confidential material change report
             with the OSC or any other securities authority or regulator or any
             stock exchange or other self-regulatory authority that at the date
             hereof remains confidential.

         (b) The consolidated financial statements (including, in each case, any
             related notes thereto) contained in any Westcoast SRA Reports or
             Westcoast SEC Reports (i) have been prepared in accordance with
             Canadian generally accepted accounting principles applied on a
             consistent basis during the periods involved (subject, in the case
             of unaudited financial statements, to the absence of notes in the
             case of Westcoast SRA Reports filed prior to the implementation of
             OSC Rule 51-501), (ii) complied in all material respects with the
             requirements of applicable securities Laws, and (iii) fairly
             present, in all material respects, the consolidated financial
             position, results of operations and cash flows of Westcoast and its
             subsidiaries as of the respective dates


                             COMBINATION AGREEMENT

             thereof and for the respective periods covered thereby, subject, in
             the case of unaudited financial statements, to normal, recurring
             audit adjustments none of which will be material.

         (c) From January 1, 1998 to the date of this Agreement, there has been
             no change by Westcoast or its subsidiaries in their accounting
             policies, methods, practices or principles that are material to
             Westcoast's consolidated financial statements, except as described
             in the notes thereto with respect to periods ending prior to the
             date hereof.

             (iii) any written demand or written notice with respect to
                   liability, by contract or operation of Environmental Laws

                   the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or
                   the continuation of business of Westcoast or any subsidiaries
                   of Westcoast or, to the knowledge of Westcoast, any of its
                   Partially Owned Entities following such consummation.

3.12     TAX MATTERS

         (a) Westcoast and each of its subsidiaries have timely filed, or caused
             to be filed, all material Tax Returns required to be filed by them
             (all of which returns were correct and complete in all material
             respects), have timely paid, or caused to be paid, Taxes shown to
             be due and payable thereon, and have satisfied in full in all
             respects all Tax withholding, deposit and remittance requirements
             imposed on or with respect to any of Westcoast and its
             subsidiaries, and Westcoast's most recently published financial
             statements contain an adequate provision in accordance with
             Canadian generally accepted accounting principles for all material
             amounts of Taxes payable in respect of each period covered by such
             financial statements and all prior periods to the extent such Taxes
             have not been paid, whether or not due and whether or not shown as
             being due on any Tax Returns. Westcoast and each of its
             subsidiaries have made adequate provision in accordance with
             Canadian generally accepted accounting principles in their books
             and records for any amount of Taxes material to Westcoast on a
             consolidated basis and accruing in respect of any accounting period
             ending subsequent to the period covered by such financial
             statements.

         (b) Neither Westcoast nor any subsidiary of Westcoast has received any
             written notification that any issue involving an amount of Taxes
             material to Westcoast on a consolidated basis has been raised (and
             is currently pending) by the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency, the
             United States Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing
             authority, including, without limitation, any sales tax authority,
             in connection with any of the Tax Returns filed or required to be
             filed, and no waivers of statutes of limitations or objections to
             any assessments or reassessments involving an amount of Taxes
             material to Westcoast on a consolidated basis have been given,
             filed or requested with respect to Westcoast or any subsidiary of
             Westcoast. All liability of Westcoast and its subsidiaries for
             Canadian federal and provincial income and capital taxes has been
             assessed by the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency and, where


                             COMBINATION AGREEMENT
                                       24
<PAGE>   29


             applicable, Canadian provincial tax authorities for all fiscal
             years up to and including the fiscal year ended December 31, 1999.
             Neither Westcoast nor any of its subsidiaries has received any
             notice from any taxing authority to the effect that any Tax Return
             is being examined, and Westcoast has no knowledge of any Tax audit
             or issue that would be reasonably expected to have a Material
             Adverse Effect on Westcoast. There are no proposed (but unassessed)
             additional Taxes applicable to Westcoast or any of its subsidiaries
             or, to the knowledge of Westcoast, any of its Partially Owned
             Entities, involving an amount of Taxes material to Westcoast on a
             consolidated basis and none has been asserted against Westcoast or
             any of its subsidiaries or, to the knowledge of Westcoast, any of
             its Partially Owned Entities. There are no Tax liens on any assets
             of Westcoast or any of its subsidiaries except for Taxes not yet
             due and payable and those which would not be reasonably expected to
             result in a Material Adverse Effect on Westcoast. Neither Westcoast
             nor any of its subsidiaries has received a refund of any Taxes to
             which it was not entitled. Neither Westcoast nor any of its
             subsidiaries (i) has made an election to be treated as a
             "consenting corporation" under Section 341(f) of the United States
             Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the "Code") or (ii) is a party to
             any Tax sharing or other similar agreement or arrangement or any
             Tax indemnification agreement of any nature with any other person
             (other than in agreements with Westcoast or any of its
             subsidiaries) pursuant to which Westcoast or any of its
             subsidiaries has or could have any material liabilities in respect
             of Taxes. Westcoast has not made an election under Section 897(i)
             of the Code to be treated as a domestic corporation for purposes of
             Sections 897, 1445 and 6039C of the Code.

         (c) "Tax" and "Taxes" means, with respect to any person, all income
             taxes (including any tax on or based upon net income, gross income,
             income as specially defined, earnings, profits or selected items of
             income, earnings or profits) and all capital taxes, gross receipts
             taxes, environmental taxes, sales taxes, use taxes, ad valorem
             taxes, value added taxes, transfer taxes, franchise taxes, license
             taxes, withholding taxes, payroll taxes, employment taxes, pension
             plan premiums, excise, severance, social security premiums,
             workers' compensation premiums, unemployment insurance or
             compensation premiums, stamp taxes, occupation taxes, premium
             taxes, property taxes, windfall profits taxes, alternative or
             add-on minimum taxes, goods and services tax, customs duties or
             other taxes, fees, imports, assessments or charges of any kind
             whatsoever, together with any interest and any penalties or
             additional amounts imposed by any taxing authority (domestic or
             foreign) on such entity, and any interest, penalties, additional
             taxes and additions to tax imposed with respect to the foregoing.

3.13     PENSION AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

         (a) Section 3.13 of the Westcoast Disclosure Letter sets forth a list
             of all employee benefit, health, welfare, supplemental unemployment
             benefit, bonus, incentive, pension, profit sharing, deferred
             compensation, stock compensation, stock option, stock purchase,
             retirement, hospitalization insurance, medical, dental, legal,
             disability and similar plans or arrangements or practices, whether
             written or oral, which are sponsored, maintained or contributed to
             by Westcoast or any of its subsidiaries

             (collectively referred to as the "Westcoast Plans"). The Westcoast
             Disclosure Letter states which of the Westcoast Plans are subject
             to the provisions of the United States Employee Retirement Income
             Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"). For purposes of this
             Section 3.13, a subsidiary of Westcoast shall be deemed to also
             include each corporation, trade, business, or entity that would be
             considered to be a single employer or under common control with
             Westcoast pursuant to Section 414 of the Code or Section 4001 of
             ERISA.

         (b) No step has been taken, no event has occurred and no condition or
             circumstance exists that has resulted in or could be reasonably
             expected to result in any Westcoast Plan being ordered or required
             to be terminated or wound up in whole or in part or having its
             registration under applicable Laws refused or revoked, or being
             placed under the administration of any trustee or receiver or
             regulatory authority or being required to pay any material amount
             of Taxes, fees, penalties or levies under applicable Laws. There
             are no actions, suits, claims (other than routine claims for
             payment of benefits in the ordinary course), trials, demands,
             investigations, arbitrations or other proceedings which are pending
             or threatened in respect of any of the Westcoast Plans or their
             assets which individually or in the aggregate would have a Material
             Adverse Effect on Westcoast.

         (c) Westcoast has provided to Duke Energy true, correct and complete
             copies of all of the Westcoast Plans as amended (or, in the case of
             any unwritten Westcoast Plan, a description thereof) together with
             all related actuarial reports, and Westcoast has made available to
             Duke Energy all other related documentation including, without
             limitation, funding agreements, trust agreements, funding and
             financial information returns and statements with respect to each
             Westcoast Plan, and current plan summaries, booklets and personnel
             manuals. Westcoast has provided to Duke Energy a true and complete
             copy of (i) the most recent annual report on Form 5500 filed with
             the United States Internal Revenue Service with respect to each
             Westcoast Plan in respect of which such a report was required and
             (ii) the most recent annual information return filed with the
             Canada Customs and Revenue Agency with respect to each Westcoast
             Plan in respect of which such a return was required.

         (d) All of the Westcoast Plans are and have been established,
             registered, qualified, invested and administered, in all material
             respects, in accordance with all applicable Laws, and in accordance
             with their terms and the terms of agreements between Westcoast or a
             subsidiary of Westcoast, as the case may be, and their respective
             employees. No fact or circumstance exists that could adversely
             affect the existing tax status of a Westcoast Plan.

         (e) All obligations of Westcoast or a subsidiary of Westcoast regarding
             the Westcoast Plans have been satisfied in all material respects.
             All contributions or premiums required to be made by Westcoast or a
             subsidiary of Westcoast, as the case may be, under the terms of
             each Westcoast Plan or by applicable Laws have been made in a
             timely fashion in accordance with applicable Laws and the terms of
             the Westcoast Plans.

<PAGE>   31


         (f) Each Westcoast Plan is fully insured or fully funded (both on a
             going-concern and solvency basis) and in good standing with such
             regulatory authorities as may be applicable and, as of the date
             hereof, no notice of underfunding, noncompliance, failure to be in
             good standing or otherwise has been received by Westcoast or its
             subsidiaries from any such regulatory authority.

         (g) There have been no improper withdrawals, applications or transfers
             of assets from any Westcoast Plan or the trusts or other funding
             media relating thereto that remain outstanding and unremedied, and
             neither Westcoast, nor any subsidiary of Westcoast, nor, to the
             knowledge of Westcoast, any of their respective agents has been in
             breach of any fiduciary obligation with respect to the
             administration of the Westcoast Plans or the trusts or other
             funding media relating thereto.

         (h) Westcoast or its subsidiaries may unilaterally amend or terminate,
             in whole or in part, each Westcoast Plan and take contribution
             holidays under or withdraw surplus from each Westcoast Plan,
             subject only to approvals required by Law and, with respect to
             amendment or termination, the collective agreements disclosed in
             Section 3.7 of the Westcoast Disclosure Letter.

         (i) No commitments to improve or otherwise amend any Westcoast Plan
             have been made except as required by applicable Laws.

         (j) None of the Westcoast Plans (other than pension plans) provide
             benefits to retired or former employees or to the beneficiaries or
             dependants of retired or former employees.

         (k) No insurance policy or any other contract or agreement affecting
             any Westcoast Plan requires or permits a retroactive increase in
             premiums or payments due thereunder.

         (l) All Westcoast Plans intended to be tax-qualified in the United
             States have been the subject of determination letters from the
             United States Internal Revenue Service to the effect that such
             Westcoast Plans and their related trusts are qualified and exempt
             from United States Federal income taxes under Sections 401(a) and
             501(a), respectively, of the Code, and no such determination letter
             has been revoked nor, to the knowledge of Westcoast, has revocation
             been threatened, nor has any such Westcoast Plan been amended since
             the date of its most recent determination letter or application
             therefor in any respect that would adversely affect its
             qualification or materially increase its costs and nothing has
             occurred since the date of such letter that could adversely affect
             the qualified status of such plan. As to any such Westcoast Plan,
             there has been no termination or partial termination of such
             Westcoast Plan within the meaning of Section 411(d)(3) of the Code.

         (m) No amount or benefit that could be received (whether in cash or
             property, the vesting of property or the acceleration of the
             exerciseability of stock options) as a result of or in connection
             with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
             Arrangement (whether or not some other subsequent action or event
             would be required to cause the receipt of such amount or benefit to
             occur) by any employee,

             officer or director of Westcoast or any of its affiliates who is a
             "disqualified individual" (as such term is defined in proposed
             United States Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1) under any
             employment, severance or termination agreement, other compensation
             arrangement or Westcoast Plan currently in effect will fail to be
             deductible for United States federal income tax purposes by virtue
             of Section 280G of the Code.

         (n) None of the Westcoast Plans is a "multiemployer plan" within the
             meaning of Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA or any other applicable Law,
             nor has Westcoast or any subsidiary of Westcoast been obligated to
             contribute to any such multiemployer plan at any time within the
             past six years.

         (o) No employment, severance or termination agreement, other
             compensation arrangement or Westcoast Plan provides for payment of
             a benefit, the increase of a benefit amount, the acceleration of
             contributions or funding, the payment of a contingent benefit or
             the acceleration of the payment or vesting of a benefit by reason
             of the execution of this Agreement or the consummation of the
             transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Arrangement
             (whether or not some other subsequent action or event would be
             required to cause such payment, increase, acceleration, or vesting
             to be triggered).

         (p) As to any Westcoast Plan that is subject to Title IV of ERISA, no
             accumulated funding deficiency, whether or not waived, within the
             meaning of Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code has been
             incurred, no reportable event within the meaning of Section 4043 of
             ERISA has occurred, no notice of intent to terminate the plan has
             been given under Section 4041 of ERISA, no proceeding has been
             instituted under Section 4042 of ERISA to terminate the plan, and
             no liability to the United States Pension Benefit Guaranty
             Corporation has been incurred.

         (q) As to any Westcoast Plan which is subject to ERISA or the Code, no
             act, omission or transaction has occurred which would result in
             imposition on Westcoast or any subsidiary of Westcoast of (i)
             breach of fiduciary duty liability damages under Section 409 of
             ERISA, (ii) a civil penalty assessed pursuant to subsections (c),
             (i) or (l) of Section 502 of ERISA, or (iii) a tax imposed pursuant
             to Chapter 43 of Subtitle D of the Code.

         (r) Each trust funding a Westcoast Plan, which trust is intended to be
             exempt from United States federal income taxation pursuant to
             Section 501(c)(9) of the Code, satisfies the requirements of such
             section and has received a favourable determination letter from the
             United States Internal Revenue Service regarding such exempt status
             and has not, since receipt of the most recent favourable
             determination letter, been amended or operated in a way which would
             adversely affect such exempt status.

3.14     AFFILIATES

         Section 3.14 of the Westcoast Disclosure Letter identifies all persons
who, to the knowledge of Westcoast, may be deemed to be affiliates of Westcoast

             January 1, 1998 have complied, with all applicable Laws other than
             non-compliance which would not, individually or in the aggregate,
             have a Material Adverse Effect on Westcoast. No investigation or
             review by any Governmental Entity with respect to Westcoast, any of
             its subsidiaries, or the knowledge of Westcoast, its Partially
             Owned Entities, is pending or, to the knowledge of Westcoast, is
             threatened, nor has any Governmental Entity indicated in writing an
             intention to conduct the same, other than those the outcome of
             which would not have a Material Adverse Effect on Westcoast.

         (b) Westcoast and its subsidiaries and, to the knowledge of Westcoast,
             its Partially Owned Entities are in possession of all franchises,
             grants, authorizations, licenses, permits, easements, variances,

             their businesses as they are now being conducted (collectively, the
             "Westcoast Permits"), except where the failure to be in possession
             of such Westcoast Permits would not, individually or in the
             aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on Westcoast, and there
             is no action, proceeding or investigation pending or, to the
             knowledge of Westcoast, threatened regarding any of the Westcoast
             Permits which would have a Material Adverse Effect on Westcoast.
             None of Westcoast, any of its subsidiaries or, to the knowledge of
             Westcoast, any of its Partially Owned Entities is in conflict with,
             or in default or violation of any of the Westcoast Permits, except
             for any such conflicts, defaults or violations which would not,
             individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on
             Westcoast.

         (c) None of Westcoast, any of its subsidiaries or, to the knowledge of
             Westcoast, any directors, officers, agents or employees of

             which could reasonably be expected to have a material and adverse
             effect on Westcoast.

3.16     RESTRICTIONS ON BUSINESS ACTIVITIES

         There is no agreement, judgment, injunction, order or decree binding
upon Westcoast or any of its subsidiaries that has or could be reasonably
expected to have the effect of prohibiting, restricting or materially impairing
any business practice of Westcoast or any of its subsidiaries, any acquisition
of property by Westcoast or any of its subsidiaries or the conduct of business
by Westcoast or any of its subsidiaries as currently conducted other than such
agreements, judgments, injunctions, orders or decrees which would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on Westcoast.

3.17     INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

         (a) Westcoast and its subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, own,
             license or otherwise have legally enforceable rights to use, or can
             acquire on reasonable terms and without material expense, all
             patents, patent rights, trademarks, trade names, service marks,
             copyrights and any applications therefore, technology, know-how,
             computer software and applications and tangible or intangible
             proprietary information or materials, that are material to and used
             in the business of Westcoast and its subsidiaries as presently
             conducted (the "Intellectual Property Rights").

         (b) In the case of Intellectual Property Rights owned by Westcoast or
             one of its subsidiaries, either Westcoast or one of its
             subsidiaries owns such Intellectual Property Rights free and clear
             of any material liens, charges or encumbrances. Westcoast or one of
             its subsidiaries has an adequate right to the use of the
             Intellectual Property Rights or the material covered thereby in
             connection with the services or products in respect of which such
             Intellectual Property Rights are being used. Westcoast has not
             received any written notice or claim, nor has it received any other
             information, stating that the manufacture, sale, licensing, or use
             of any of the services or products of Westcoast or any of its
             subsidiaries as now manufactured, sold, licensed or used or
             proposed for manufacture, sale, licensing or use by Westcoast or
             any of its subsidiaries in the ordinary course of Westcoast's
             business as presently conducted infringes on any copyright, patent,
             trade mark, service mark or trade secret of a third party where
             such infringement would have a Material Adverse Effect on
             Westcoast. Westcoast has not received any written notice or claim,
             nor has it received any other information, stating that the use by
             Westcoast or any of its subsidiaries of any trademarks, service
             marks, trade names, trade secrets, copyrights, patents, technology
             or know-how and applications used in the business of Westcoast and
             any of its subsidiaries as presently conducted infringes on any
             other person's trademarks, service marks, trade names, trade
             secrets, copyrights, patents, technology or know-how and
             applications where such infringement would have a Material Adverse
             Effect on Westcoast. Westcoast has not received any written notice
             or claim, nor has it received any other information, challenging
             the ownership by Westcoast or any of its subsidiaries or the
             validity of any of the Intellectual Property Rights. All registered
             patents, trademarks, service marks and copyright held by Westcoast
             and its subsidiaries are subsisting, except to the extent any
             failure to be subsisting would not have a Material Adverse Effect
             on Westcoast. To the knowledge of Westcoast, there is no material
             unauthorized use, infringement or misappropriation of any of the
             Intellectual Property Rights by any third party, including any
             employee or former employee of Westcoast or any of its subsidiaries
             No Intellectual Property Right is subject to any known outstanding
             decree, order, judgment, or stipulation restricting in any manner
             the licensing thereof by Westcoast or any of its subsidiaries,
             except to the extent any such restriction would not have a Material
             Adverse Effect on Westcoast.

         Each of Westcoast and its subsidiaries is, and has been continuously
since September 1, 1996, insured by reputable and financially responsible
insurers in amounts and against risks and losses as are customary for companies
conducting their respective businesses. Westcoast's and its subsidiaries'
insurance policies are in all material respects in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms, no notice of cancellation or termination has been
received, and there is no existing default or event which, with the giving of
notice or lapse of time or both would constitute a default thereunder.

3.19     PROPERTY

         (a) Westcoast, its subsidiaries and, to the knowledge of Westcoast, its
             Partially Owned Entities have defensible title (or, with respect to
             pipelines, equipment and other tangible personal property used in
             connection with Westcoast's pipeline operations (collectively,
             "Westcoast Pipeline Assets") title to or interest in the applicable
             Westcoast Pipeline Assets sufficient to enable Westcoast, its
             subsidiaries and, to the knowledge of Westcoast, its Partially
             Owned Entities to conduct their businesses with respect thereto
             without material interference as it is currently being conducted)
             to all their material properties and assets, whether tangible or
             intangible, real, personal or mixed, free and clear of all liens,
             except for liens disclosed in the Westcoast Documents and liens the
             existence of which would not have a Material Adverse Effect on
             Westcoast.

         (b) The businesses of Westcoast and each of its subsidiaries have been
             and are being operated in a manner which does not violate (in any
             manner which would, or which would be reasonably expected to, have
             a Material Adverse Effect on Westcoast) the terms of any easements,
             rights of way, permits, servitudes, licenses, leasehold estates and
             similar rights relating to real property (collectively,
             "Easements") used by Westcoast and each of its subsidiaries in such
             businesses. All Easements are valid and enforceable, except as the
             enforceability thereof may be affected by bankruptcy, insolvency or
             other Laws of general applicability affecting the rights of
             creditors generally or principles of equity, and grant the rights
             purported to be granted thereby and all rights necessary thereunder
             for the current operation of such businesses where the failure of
             any such Easement to be valid and enforceable or to grant the
             rights purported to be granted thereby or necessary thereunder
             would have a Material Adverse Effect on Westcoast. There are no
             special gaps in the Easements which would impair the conduct of
             such businesses in a manner that would, or that would be reasonably
             expected to, have a Material Adverse Effect on Westcoast, and no
             part of the Westcoast Pipeline Assets is located on property which
             is not owned in fee by Westcoast or a subsidiary of Westcoast or
             subject to an Easement in favour of Westcoast or a subsidiary of
             Westcoast, where the failure of such Westcoast Pipeline Assets to
             be so located would have a Material Adverse Effect on Westcoast.

         None of Westcoast, any of its subsidiaries or, to the knowledge of
Westcoast, any of its Partially Owned Entities, all or part of whose rates or
services are regulated by a Governmental Entity, is a party to any proceeding
before a Governmental Entity which is reasonably likely to result in orders
having a material burden on the future operations or business of Westcoast or
any Material Subsidiary of Westcoast nor has written notice of any such
proceeding been received by Westcoast, any of its subsidiaries or, to the
knowledge of Westcoast, any of its Partially Owned Entities.

         (a) Westcoast and all of its "subsidiary companies" and "affiliates",
             as such terms are defined in the 1935 Act, either are not subject
             to or are exempt from all provisions of the 1935 Act other than
             Section 9(a)(2) of the 1935 Act.

         (b) None of Westcoast or any of its "subsidiary companies" or
             "affiliates" is subject to regulation as a "holding company" or a
             "subsidiary company" or "affiliate" of a "holding company", as such
             terms are defined in the 1935 Act.

3.22     FUTURES TRADING AND FIXED PRICE EXPOSURE

         The Board of Directors of Westcoast has approved the formation and
mandate of the Corporate Risk Management Committee (the "CRMC"). The CRMC is
responsible for providing the overall direction on all aspects of Westcoast's
business risk management. Such responsibilities include approval and oversight
of the aggregate risk limits and the delegation of risk management authority and
accountability to the business units and functional units. The business risk
management programs of Westcoast and its subsidiaries are consistent with the
policies of the CRMC.

         The Board of Directors of Westcoast has established risk parameters to
restrict the level of risk that Engage Energy Canada, Inc. ("Engage") and its
subsidiaries are authorized to take with respect to the net position of Engage
and its subsidiaries resulting from all physical commodity transactions,
exchange traded futures and options and over-the-counter derivative instruments
(the "Net Engage Position") and the CRMC monitors the compliance by Engage and
its subsidiaries with such risk parameters. The risk parameters established by
the Board of Directors of Westcoast as of the date hereof are set forth in
Section 3.22 of the Westcoast Disclosure Letter and may be modified only by the
Board of Directors of Westcoast. The Net Engage Position is within the risk
parameters which have been established by Westcoast's Board of Directors or
otherwise approved by Westcoast's Board of Directors.

         In the case of Westcoast's regulated subsidiaries, risk management
programs have been established which govern the actions and conduct of such
subsidiaries with respect to their management of gas supply portfolio risk
arising from the use of physical commodity transactions, exchange traded futures
and options and over-the-counter derivative instruments. The actions of each
regulated subsidiary are reviewed by each of such subsidiary's respective
regulatory bodies. Such subsidiaries are in compliance with their stated
programs or policies.

                                    ARTICLE 4

            REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE DUKE ENERGY PARTIES

         The Duke Energy Parties represent and warrant to Westcoast as follows
in each case except as set forth in the Duke Energy Disclosure Letter (each of
which exceptions shall specifically identify the relevant section hereof to
which it relates):

4.1      ORGANIZATION AND STANDING

         (a) Each of the Duke Energy Parties has been duly organized or formed
             and is validly existing under the Laws of its jurisdiction of
             organization or formation with full corporate or legal power and
             authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to conduct
             its businesses as currently owned and conducted except where,
             individually or in the aggregate, the failure of a subsidiary other
             than a Material Subsidiary to be


                             COMBINATION AGREEMENT
                                       33
<PAGE>   38


             so organized, formed or existing or to have such power or authority
             would not have a Material Adverse Effect on Duke Energy. Each of
             the Duke Energy Parties is duly qualified to do business in each
             jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or
             the ownership or leasing of its properties requires it to so
             qualify, except where the failure to be so qualified would not have
             a Material Adverse Effect on Duke Energy.

         (b) Duke Energy has heretofore made available to Westcoast complete and
             correct copies of its governing documents as well as the governing
             documents of Exchangeco, in each case as in effect on the date
             hereof.

4.2      CAPITALIZATION

         (a) The authorized capital stock of Duke Energy consists of 12.5
             million shares of Preferred Stock, 10.0 million shares of Preferred
             Stock A, 1.5 million shares of Preference Stock and 2.0 billion
             Duke Energy Common Shares and there were 2,284,984 shares of
             Preferred Stock, 2,057,185 shares of Preferred Stock A and no
             Preference Stock issued and outstanding and 775,386,163 Duke Energy
             Common Shares issued and outstanding as of September 6, 2001. As of
             September 6, 2001 there were 55,276,119 Duke Energy Common Shares
             reserved, in the aggregate, for issuance in respect of the Duke
             Energy Stock Plans. As of August 31, 2001, there were outstanding
             options permitting the holders thereof to purchase 20,166,929 Duke
             Energy Common Shares in the aggregate.

         (b) All of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Duke Energy
             Parties have been duly authorized and are validly issued and fully
             paid and non-assessable, were not issued in violation of
             pre-emptive or similar rights or any other agreement or
             understanding binding upon the Duke Energy Parties and were issued
             in compliance with all applicable securities Laws and the governing
             documents of the Duke Energy Parties except where, individually or
             in the aggregate, the failure of the shares or ownership interest
             in a subsidiary other than a Material Subsidiary to be so
             authorized or issued would not have a Material Adverse Effect on
             Duke Energy. The authorized capital stock of Exchangeco consists of
             an unlimited number of common shares and an unlimited number of
             preference shares. As of the date hereof, all of the outstanding
             capital stock of Exchangeco is owned by N.S. U.L.C. and all of the
             outstanding capital stock of N.S. U.L.C. is owned indirectly by
             Duke Energy.

         (c) Except as described in Section 4.2(a) above, there are no
             outstanding options, warrants, subscriptions, puts, calls or other
             rights, agreements, arrangements or commitments (pre-emptive,
             contingent or otherwise) obligating Duke Energy to offer, issue,
             sell, redeem, repurchase, otherwise acquire or transfer, pledge or
             encumber any capital stock of Duke Energy nor are there outstanding
             any securities or obligations of any kind convertible into or
             exercisable or exchangeable for any capital stock of Duke Energy
             and Duke Energy has no obligation of any kind to issue any
             additional securities or to pay for or repurchase any securities.
             There are not outstanding as of the date hereof any stock
             appreciation rights, phantom equity or similar rights, agreements,
             arrangements or commitments based upon the book value, income or
             any


                             COMBINATION AGREEMENT

             other attribute of Duke Energy or any of its subsidiaries. There
             are no outstanding bonds, debentures or other evidences of
             indebtedness of Duke Energy or any of its subsidiaries having the
             right to vote (or that are exchangeable or convertible for or
             exercisable into securities having the right to vote) with the
             holders of the Duke Energy Common Shares on any matter as of the
             date hereof.

4.3      AUTHORITY AND NO CONFLICTS

         (a) Each of the Duke Energy Parties has all requisite corporate power
             and authority to enter into this Agreement and to perform its
             obligations hereunder and to consummate the transactions
             contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement
             by the Duke Energy Parties and the consummation by the Duke Energy
             Parties of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement have
             been duly and validly authorized by all requisite corporate action
             and no other corporate proceedings on the part of the Duke Energy
             Parties are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate
             the transactions contemplated hereby.

         (b) This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Duke
             Energy Parties and constitutes a legal, valid and binding
             obligation of each of the Duke Energy Parties, enforceable against
             each of them in accordance with its terms, except as the same may
             be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency and other applicable Laws
             affecting creditors' rights generally, and by general principles of
             equity.

         (c) The Board of Directors of Duke Energy at a meeting duly called and
             held has determined by the unanimous approval of all directors
             voting that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
             are in the best interests of Duke Energy and the holders of Duke
             Energy Common Shares.

         (d) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Duke
             Energy Parties nor the performance by each of them of their
             obligations hereunder and the completion of the transactions
             contemplated hereby, will:

             (i)   conflict with, or violate any provision of, the governing
                   documents of any of the Duke Energy Parties;

             (ii)  subject to the consents, approvals, orders, authorizations,
                   registrations, declarations or filings referred to in Section
                   4.4 being made or obtained, violate or breach any Laws
                   applicable to Duke Energy or any of its subsidiaries;

             (iii) subject to the consents, approvals, orders, authorizations,
                   registrations, declarations or filings referred to in Section
                   4.4 being made or obtained, violate or conflict with or
                   result in the breach of, or constitute a default (or an event
                   that with the giving of notice, the passage of time, or both
                   would constitute a default) under, or entitle any party (with
                   the giving of notice, the passage of time or both) to
                   terminate, accelerate, modify or call any obligations or
                   rights under any credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage,
                   indenture, deed of trust, contract, agreement, lease,
                   license, franchise, permit,

                   or any of its subsidiaries is a party or by which Duke Energy
                   or any of its subsidiaries or its or their property is bound
                   or subject; or

             (iv)  result in the imposition of any encumbrance, charge or lien
                   upon any of Duke Energy's assets or the assets of any of its
                   subsidiaries, or restrict, hinder, impair or limit the
                   ability of Duke Energy or any of its subsidiaries to carry on
                   the business of Duke Energy or any of its subsidiaries as and
                   where it is now being carried on;

         except in the case of clauses (ii) through (iv) for any of the
         foregoing that would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
         Material Adverse Effect on Duke Energy or materially impair the ability
         of Duke Energy to perform its obligations hereunder or prevent or
         materially delay the consummation of any of the transactions
         contemplated hereby.

4.4      CONSENTS; APPROVALS

         No consent, approval, order or authorization of, or registration,
declaration or filing with, any third party or Governmental Entity is required

to perform its obligations hereunder.

4.5      NO DEFAULTS

         None of Duke Energy, any of its Material Subsidiaries or, to the
knowledge of Duke Energy, any other party thereto, is in default under or
violation of, and there has been no event, condition or occurrence which, after
notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute such a default or violation

4.6      ABSENCE OF CERTAIN CHANGES OR EVENTS

         Except as disclosed in the Duke Energy SEC Documents filed prior to the
date hereof, since December 31, 2000, there has been no Material Adverse Effect
with respect to Duke Energy or any event, occurrence or development which would

4.7      REPORTS; FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

         (a) Since January 1, 1998 Duke Energy and its subsidiaries have timely
             filed all forms, reports, schedules, statements and other documents
             required to be filed with (i) the SEC under the Exchange Act or the
             1933 Act (the "Duke Energy SEC Documents"), (ii) any applicable
             state securities authority and (iii) any other Governmental Entity,
             except in each case where the failure to file any such forms,
             reports, schedules, statements or other documents would not have a
             Material Adverse Effect on Duke Energy (all such forms, reports,
             schedules, statements and other documents are collectively referred
             to as the "Duke Energy Documents"). The Duke Energy SEC Documents,
             at the time filed (x) did not contain any untrue statement of a
             material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
             stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
             contained therein not misleading in light of the circumstances
             under which they were made and (y) complied in all material
             respects with the requirements of applicable Laws (including the
             1933 Act, the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
             thereunder).

         (b) The consolidated financial statements (including in each case, any
             related notes thereto) contained in any Duke Energy SEC Documents
             (i) have been prepared in accordance with United States generally
             accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis during
             the periods involved (subject, in the case of unaudited financial
             statements, to the absence of notes), (ii) complied in all material
             respects with the requirements of applicable securities Laws, and
             (iii) fairly present, in all material respects, the consolidated
             financial position, results of operations and cash flows of Duke
             Energy and its subsidiaries as of the respective dates thereof and
             for the respective periods covered thereby, subject, in the case of
             unaudited financial statements, to normal, recurring audit
             adjustments none of which will be material.

         (c) From January 1, 1998 to the date of this Agreement, there has been
             no change in Duke Energy's accounting policies or methods of making
             accounting estimates or changes in estimates that are material to
             such financial statements, except as described in the notes thereto
             with respect to periods ending prior to the date hereof.

                   business of Duke Energy or any subsidiaries of Duke Energy
                   following such consummation.

4.10     NUCLEAR OPERATIONS

         To the knowledge of Duke Energy, the operations of its Nuclear Steam
Generating Stations ("Nuclear Stations") are and have at all times been
conducted in material compliance with applicable health, safety, regulatory and
other legal requirements. To the knowledge of Duke Energy, the Nuclear Stations
maintain emergency plans designed to respond to an unplanned release therefrom
of radioactive materials into the environment, liability insurance to the extent
required by Law, and such further insurance (other than liability insurance) as
is consistent with Duke Energy's view of the risks inherent in the operation of
a nuclear power facility. To the knowledge of Duke Energy, plans for the
decommissioning of each of the Nuclear Stations and for the short-term storage
of spent nuclear fuel conform in all material respects with applicable
regulatory or other legal requirements, and such plans have at all times since
January 1, 1998 been funded to the extent required by Law (which funded amount
is not materially inconsistent, in the aggregate, with Duke Energy's budget
projections for the amount required to be spent under such plans) except for any
lack of funding which would not have a Material Adverse Effect on Duke Energy.

4.11     COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS; PERMITS

         (a) Duke Energy and its subsidiaries are in compliance, and at all
             times since January 1, 1998 have complied, with all applicable Laws
             other than non-compliance which would not, individually or in the
             aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on Duke Energy. No
             investigation or review by any Governmental Entity with respect to
             Duke Energy or any of its subsidiaries is pending or, to the
             knowledge of Duke Energy, is threatened, nor has any Governmental
             Entity indicated in writing an intention to conduct the same, other
             than those the outcome of which would not have a Material Adverse
             Effect on Duke Energy.

         (b) Duke Energy and its subsidiaries are in possession of all
             franchises, grants, authorizations, licenses, permits, easements,
             variances, exemptions, consents, certificates, approvals and orders
             necessary to own, lease and operate their properties and to
             lawfully carry on their businesses as they are now being conducted
             (collectively, the "Duke Energy Permits"), except where the failure
             to be in possession of such Duke Energy Permits would not,
             individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on
             Duke Energy, and there is no action, proceeding or investigation
             pending or, to the knowledge of Duke Energy, threatened regarding
             any of the Duke Energy Permits which would have a Material Adverse
             Effect on Duke Energy. Neither Duke Energy nor any of its
             subsidiaries is in conflict with, or in default or violation of any
             of the Duke Energy Permits, except for any such conflicts, defaults
             or violations which, individually or in the aggregate, would not
             have a Material Adverse Effect on Duke Energy.

         (c) None of Duke Energy, any of its subsidiaries or, to the knowledge
             of Duke Energy, any directors, officers, agents or employees of
             Duke Energy or any of its subsidiaries


                             COMBINATION AGREEMENT

             has (i) used any funds for unlawful contributions, gifts,
             entertainment or other unlawful expenses relating to political
             activity, or (ii) made any unlawful payment to any government
             officials or employees or to political parties or campaigns or
             violated any provision of the United States Foreign Corrupt
             Practices Act of 1977, as amended in each case which could
             reasonably be expected to have a material and adverse effect on
             Duke Energy.

4.12     REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS

         Neither Duke Energy nor any of its subsidiaries, all or part of whose
rates or services are regulated by a Governmental Entity, is a party to any
proceeding before a Governmental Entity which is reasonably likely to result in
orders having a material burden on the future operations or business of any
Material Subsidiary of Duke Energy nor has written notice of any such proceeding
been received by Duke Energy or any of its subsidiaries.

4.13     FUTURES TRADING AND FIXED PRICE EXPOSURE

         The Market Risk Committee of Duke Energy has established risk
parameters to restrict the level of risk that Duke Energy and its subsidiaries
are authorized to take with respect to the open position resulting from all
physical commodity transactions, exchange traded futures and options and
over-the-counter derivative instruments (the "Open Duke Energy Position") and
monitors the compliance by Duke Energy and its subsidiaries with such risk
parameters. The risk parameters established by the Market Risk Committee of Duke
Energy may be modified only by the Market Risk Committee of Duke Energy. The
Open Duke Energy Position is within the risk parameters which have been
established by the Market Risk Committee of Duke Energy.

4.14     BROKERAGE AND FINDERS' FEES

         Neither Duke Energy nor any of its shareholders, directors, officers or
employees has incurred or will incur on behalf of Duke Energy, any brokerage,
finders' or similar fee in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby,
except that Duke Energy has employed Merrill Lynch & Co. as its financial
advisor pursuant to a written agreement.

                       practice, provided that the overall compensation budget
                       shall not increase by more than 3.5% on an annual basis;

                   (C) whether through its Board of Directors or otherwise,
                       accelerate the vesting of any unvested Westcoast Options
                       or accelerate the release of, or the expiry date of any

                   materially decrease the revenues of the business unit

                   its subsidiaries to, deliver to Duke Energy a copy of each
                   filing or agreement relating to a Rate Change at least five

            (xi)   Except as required by applicable Laws, Westcoast shall not,
                   nor shall it permit any of its subsidiaries to, enter into,

                   Canadian generally accepted accounting principles as advised
                   by Westcoast's or such subsidiary's regular independent
                   accountants, as the case may be.

            (xiii) Westcoast shall not, nor shall it permit any of its

                   change in its status, or that of its subsidiaries, under the
                   1935 Act, or that would impair the ability of Duke Energy to
                   continue to claim an exemption as of right under Rule 2 of
                   the 1935 Act following the Arrangement.

                   or other Law that purports to limit or restrict business
                   combinations or the ability to acquire or vote shares, any
                   person (other than Duke Energy and its subsidiaries) or any
                   action taken thereby, including any Take-over Bid (as defined
                   in the Westcoast Rights Plan), which person or action would
                   have otherwise been subject to the restrictive provisions
                   thereof and not exempt therefrom. Westcoast shall not nor
                   shall it permit any subsidiary to, (a) enter into any
                   confidentiality or standstill agreement except as permitted
                   by Section 5.5(a), (b) amend, release any third party from
                   its obligations or grant any consent under any
                   confidentiality or standstill provision or fail to fully

                   warranties hereunder to be untrue or would be reasonably
                   expected to prevent or materially impede, interfere with or
                   delay the Arrangement.

             (xvii) Westcoast shall not, nor shall it permit any of its
                    subsidiaries to, agree in writing or otherwise to take any
                    of the actions as described above in clauses (ii) through
                    (xvi).

         (b) Westcoast shall promptly advise Duke Energy in writing:

             (i)   of any event, condition or circumstance that might be
                   reasonably expected to cause any representation or warranty
                   of Westcoast contained in this Agreement to be untrue or
                   inaccurate on the Effective Date (or, in the case of any
                   representation or warranty made as of a specified date, as of
                   such specified date);

             (ii)  of any Material Adverse Effect on Westcoast or any event,
                   occurrence or development which would be reasonably expected
                   to have a Material Adverse Effect on Westcoast; and

             (iii) of any material breach by Westcoast of any covenant,
                   obligation or agreement contained in this Agreement.

         (c) Westcoast shall use its reasonable best efforts to, and shall use
             its reasonable best efforts to cause its subsidiaries to, perform

             subsidiaries under this Agreement, cooperate with Duke Energy in
             connection therewith, and do all such other acts and things as may
             be necessary or desirable in order to consummate and make

                   Rights Plan Waiver Resolution (in a commercially reasonable
                   manner) and use reasonable best efforts to obtain the
                   approval by Westcoast Securityholders of the Arrangement and
                   of the Westcoast Rights Plan Waiver Resolution;

             (ii)  subject to the last sentence of Section 5.6(a), not adjourn,
                   postpone or cancel (or propose adjournment, postponement or
                   cancellation of) the Westcoast Meeting without Duke Energy's

                   case of adjournment, as may be required by Westcoast
                   Securityholders as expressed by majority resolution;

             (iii) use reasonable best efforts to satisfy or cause to be
                   satisfied as soon as reasonably practicable all the

             Rights Plan Waiver Resolution; provided that the Board of Directors
             of Westcoast may withdraw, modify or change its recommendation if
             prior to the approval of the Arrangement by the Westcoast
             Securityholders, Westcoast receives a Superior Proposal that was
             not solicited or encouraged in violation of Section 5.5 and the
             Board of Directors of Westcoast determines in good faith (based
             upon the written opinion of its outside legal counsel) that it is
             necessary for the Board of Directors of Westcoast to take such
             action in order to discharge properly its fiduciary duties. Any
             such withdrawal, change or modification of the Westcoast Board of
             Directors' recommendation of the Arrangement and the Westcoast
             Rights Plan Waiver Resolution shall not change the approval of the
             Board of Directors of Westcoast for any purpose or change the

             recommendation) at a duly called and convened Westcoast Meeting in
             accordance with Westcoast's obligations under this Agreement.

         (e) Westcoast shall not waive the application of Section 3.1 of the
             Westcoast Rights Plan to an Acquisition Proposal unless the
             Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal and Westcoast has
             complied with Section 5.5 and Section 5.6, provided that, in such
             case, the waiver cannot be effective until after the Westcoast
             Meeting and further provided that such waiver cannot be effective
             if the Arrangement Resolution shall have been approved by the
             requisite majority of the Westcoast Securityholders at the
             Westcoast Meeting.

         (f) Prior to the Effective Time, Westcoast will complete the corporate
             reorganizations as set forth in Section 5.1(f) of the Westcoast
             Disclosure Letter, subject only to (i) receipt of any required
             approval of any provincial regulatory body with respect to any
             portion of such reorganization which Westcoast shall use its
             reasonable best efforts to obtain, (ii) receipt of any required
             approvals under Westcoast's existing debt trust indentures and
             (iii) approval by Duke Energy of the costs to be incurred to
             complete such reorganization.

         (b) Duke Energy shall promptly advise Westcoast in writing:

             (i)   of any event, condition or circumstance that might be
                   reasonably expected to cause any representation or warranty
                   of the Duke Energy Parties contained in this Agreement to be
                   untrue or inaccurate on the Effective Date (or, in the case
                   of any representation or warranty made as of a specified
                   date, as of such specified date);

             (ii)  of any Material Adverse Effect on Duke Energy or any event,
                   occurrence or development which would be reasonably expected
                   to have a Material Adverse Effect on Duke Energy; and

             (iii) of any material breach by any of the Duke Energy Parties of
                   any of their covenants, obligations or agreements contained
                   in this Agreement.

         (c) Duke Energy shall use its reasonable best efforts to, and shall use
             its reasonable best efforts to cause its subsidiaries to, perform
             all obligations required to be performed by it or any of its
             subsidiaries under this Agreement, cooperate with Westcoast in
             connection therewith, and do all such other acts and things as may
             be necessary or desirable in order to consummate and make
             effective, as soon as reasonably practicable, the transactions
             contemplated by this Agreement and, without limiting the generality
             of the foregoing:

             (i)   use reasonable best efforts to satisfy or cause to be
                   satisfied as soon as reasonably practicable all conditions
                   precedent that are set forth in Article 6 hereof;

             (ii)  apply for and use reasonable best efforts to obtain promptly
                   all Appropriate Regulatory Approvals relating to Duke Energy

                   proceedings related to obtaining the Appropriate Regulatory
                   Approvals, including, but not limited to, providing Westcoast
                   with copies of all related applications and notifications, in
                   draft form, in order for Westcoast to provide its reasonable
                   comments;

             (iii) carry out the terms of the Interim Order and Final Order
                   applicable to it and use reasonable best efforts to comply
                   promptly with all requirements which applicable Laws may
                   impose on the Duke Energy Parties with respect to the
                   transactions contemplated hereby and by the Arrangement;

             (iv)  in respect of holders of Westcoast Common Shares who are not
                   exempt from tax under Part 1 of the Income Tax Act (Canada)
                   and who receive Exchangeable Shares under the Arrangement, to
                   cause Exchangeco to enter

                    into elections with such holders under Section 85 of the
                    Income Tax Act (Canada) and any equivalents thereof under
                    provincial Laws;

             (v)    use reasonable best efforts to defend all lawsuits or other
                    legal, regulatory or other proceedings to which it is a
                    party challenging or affecting this Agreement or the
                    consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby;

             (vi)   use reasonable best efforts to have lifted or rescinded any
                    injunction or restraining order or other order relating to
                    the Duke Energy Parties which may adversely affect the
                    ability of the parties to consummate the transactions
                    contemplated hereby;

             (vii)  effect all necessary registrations, filings and submissions
                    of information required by Governmental Entities from the
                    Duke Energy Parties or their subsidiaries in connection with
                    the transactions contemplated hereby;

             (viii) cause governing documents of Exchangeco to be amended, among
                    other things, to create the Exchangeable Shares;

             (ix)   reserve or have available a sufficient number of Duke Energy
                    Common Shares for issuance upon the completion of the
                    Arrangement and the exchange from time to time of
                    Exchangeable Shares and the exercise from time to time of
                    Replacement Options and use reasonable best efforts to cause
                    such Duke Energy Common Shares to be approved for listing on

                    issuance, prior to the Effective Time;

             (x)    use reasonable best efforts (A) to cause the Exchangeable
                    Shares to be listed for trading on The Toronto Stock
                    Exchange by the Effective Date and (B) to ensure that
                    Exchangeco remains a "public corporation" within the meaning
                    of the Income Tax Act (Canada) for so long as there are
                    Exchangeable Shares outstanding (other than those
                    Exchangeable Shares held by Duke Energy or any of its
                    affiliates); and

             (xi)   use reasonable best efforts to obtain all waivers, consents
                    and approvals from other parties to loan agreements, leases
                    or other contracts required to be obtained by Duke Energy or
                    any subsidiary of Duke Energy to consummate the transactions
                    contemplated hereby which the failure to obtain would
                    materially and adversely affect the ability of the Duke
                    Energy Parties to consummate the transactions contemplated
                    hereby.

5.3      ACCESS TO INFORMATION

         (a) Subject to Section 5.3(b) and applicable Laws, upon reasonable
             notice to an officer or business unit head of Westcoast, Westcoast
             shall (and shall cause each of its subsidiaries to) afford the
             officers, employees, counsel, accountants and other authorized
             representatives and advisors ("Representatives") of Duke Energy
             access, during normal business hours from the date hereof and until
             the earlier of the Effective Date or the termination of this
             Agreement, to its properties, books, contracts


                             COMBINATION AGREEMENT
                                       49
<PAGE>   54


             and records as well as to its management personnel; provided that
             such access shall be provided on a basis that minimizes the
             disruption to the operations of Westcoast. During such period,
             Westcoast shall (and shall cause each of its subsidiaries to)
             furnish promptly to Duke Energy all information concerning
             Westcoast's business, properties and personnel as Duke Energy may
             reasonably request. Subject to Section 5.3(b) and applicable Laws,
             Duke Energy shall afford the Representatives of Westcoast access
             during normal business hours from the date hereof and until the
             earlier of the Effective Date or the termination of this Agreement,
             to such of Duke Energy's management personnel as Westcoast may
             request, acting reasonably.

         (b) The Duke Energy Parties and Westcoast acknowledge that certain
             information received pursuant to Section 5.3(a) will be non-public
             or proprietary in nature and as such will be deemed to be
             "Confidential Information" for purposes of the Confidentiality
             Agreement. The Duke Energy Parties and Westcoast further
             acknowledge their obligation to maintain the confidentiality of
             such Confidential Information in accordance with the
             Confidentiality Agreement.

5.4      INDEMNIFICATION

         (a) Duke Energy agrees that all rights to indemnification for acts or
             omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time existing as of the
             date hereof in favour of the directors or officers of Westcoast as
             provided in its governing documents or in written contracts in
             effect on the date hereof, shall survive the Arrangement and shall
             continue in full force and effect until the earlier of the
             expiration of the applicable statute of limitations with respect to
             any claims against directors or officers of Westcoast arising out
             of such acts or omissions and the sixth anniversary of the
             Effective Date, and Duke Energy hereby assumes, effective upon
             consummation of the Arrangement, all such liability with respect to
             any matters arising prior to the Effective Time.

         (b) Duke Energy shall use reasonable best efforts to cause to be
             maintained in effect, for not less than six years from the
             Effective Time, substantially the same coverage and containing
             substantially similar terms and conditions for acts and omissions
             prior to the Effective Time under the current policies of the
             directors' and officers' liability insurance maintained by
             Westcoast so long as the annual premium therefor would not be in
             excess of 200% of the last annual premium paid prior to the date
             hereof.

5.5      COVENANTS REGARDING NON-SOLICITATION

         (a) Westcoast shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
             existing solicitation, encouragement, activity, discussion or
             negotiation with any parties by Westcoast, any of its subsidiaries
             or any of its or its subsidiaries' officers, directors, employees,
             representatives and agents with respect to an Acquisition Proposal
             whether or not initiated by Westcoast and in connection therewith,
             Westcoast shall request (and exercise all rights it has to require)
             the return of information regarding Westcoast and its subsidiaries
             previously provided to such parties and shall request (and exercise
             all rights it has to require) the destruction of all materials
             including or incorporating any information regarding Westcoast and
             its subsidiaries.


                             COMBINATION AGREEMENT
                                       50
<PAGE>   55


         (b) Subject to Section 5.6, Westcoast agrees that it shall not, and
             shall not authorize or permit any of its subsidiaries or any of its
             or its subsidiaries' officers, directors, employees,
             representatives or agents, directly or indirectly, to (i) solicit,
             initiate, encourage or knowingly facilitate, including by way of
             furnishing information or entering into any form of agreement,
             arrangement or understanding, any inquiries or the making of any
             proposals regarding an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) participate in
             any discussions or negotiations regarding any Acquisition Proposal,
             (iii) withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Duke Energy the
             approval or recommendation of the Board of Directors of Westcoast
             of the transactions contemplated hereby, (iv) approve or recommend
             any Acquisition Proposal or (v) enter into any agreement,
             arrangement or understanding related to any Acquisition Proposal or
             requiring Westcoast to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the
             Arrangement or providing for the payment of any break, termination
             or other fees or expenses to any person in the event that Westcoast
             or any of its subsidiaries completes the transactions contemplated
             hereby or any other transaction with Duke Energy or any of its
             affiliates agreed to prior to any termination of this Agreement.
             Notwithstanding the preceding sentence and any other provisions of
             this Agreement, the Board of Directors of Westcoast may, prior to
             the approval of the Arrangement by the Westcoast Securityholders,
             consider, participate in any discussions or negotiations with, or
             provide information in accordance with the last sentence of this
             paragraph to, any person who has delivered a bona fide written
             Acquisition Proposal which was not solicited or encouraged after
             the date of this Agreement and did not otherwise result from a
             breach of this Section 5.5 and that the Board of Directors of
             Westcoast determines in good faith, after consultation with its
             financial advisors and outside legal counsel, is a Superior
             Proposal; provided, however, that prior to taking any such action,
             (x) the Board of Directors of Westcoast must receive written advice
             of outside counsel that it is necessary for the Board of Directors
             of Westcoast to take such action in order to discharge properly its
             fiduciary duties and (y) Westcoast must obtain a confidentiality
             agreement from the person making such Acquisition Proposal that is
             substantively the same as the Confidentiality Agreement, including
             a standstill provision at least as stringent as contained in the
             Confidentiality Agreement; provided further that Westcoast shall
             not commence discussions or negotiations with, or provide
             information to any person who has delivered an unsolicited bona
             fide written Acquisition Proposal until 48 hours after Westcoast
             shall have advised Duke Energy of its determination that such
             Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and of its
             intention to take such actions. Westcoast shall not consider,
             negotiate, accept, approve or recommend an Acquisition Proposal or
             provide information to any person proposing an Acquisition
             Proposal, in each case after the date of the approval of the
             Arrangement by the Westcoast Securityholders. If Westcoast receives
             a request for material non-public information from a person who has
             made an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal and
             Westcoast is permitted, as contemplated under the second sentence
             of this Section 5.5(b), to negotiate the terms of such Acquisition
             Proposal, then, and only in such case, the Board of Directors of
             Westcoast may, subject to the execution by such person of the
             confidentiality agreement as described in (y) above, provide such
             person with access to information regarding Westcoast; provided
             that Westcoast sends a copy of any such


                             COMBINATION AGREEMENT
                                       51
<PAGE>   56


             confidentiality agreement to Duke Energy promptly upon its
             execution and Duke Energy is provided with a list of, and copies
             of, the information provided to such person and is immediately
             provided with access to similar information to which such person
             was provided.

         (c) From and after the date of this Agreement, Westcoast shall promptly
             (and in any event within 24 hours) notify Duke Energy, at first
             orally and then in writing, of any inquiries, proposals or offers
             relating to or constituting an Acquisition Proposal, or any request
             for non-public information relating to Westcoast or any of its
             subsidiaries. Such notice shall include a description of the terms
             and conditions of any proposal, inquiry or offer, the identity of
             the person making such proposal, inquiry or offer and provide such
             other details of the proposal, inquiry or offer as Duke Energy may
             reasonably request. Westcoast shall keep Duke Energy fully informed
             on a prompt basis of the status, including any change to the
             material terms, of any such inquiry, proposal or offer.

         (d) Westcoast shall ensure that its officers, directors and employees
             and its subsidiaries and their officers, directors and employees
             and any financial advisors or other advisors or representatives
             retained by it are aware of the provisions of this Section 5.5, and
             it shall be responsible for any breach of this Section 5.5 by such
             officers, directors, employees, financial advisors or other
             advisors or representatives.

5.6      RIGHT TO ACCEPT A SUPERIOR PROPOSAL

         (a) If Westcoast has complied with Section 5.5 with respect thereto,
             Westcoast may accept, approve, recommend or enter into any
             agreement, understanding or arrangement in respect of a Superior
             Proposal prior to the approval of the Arrangement by the Westcoast
             Securityholders if, and only if (with the exception of a
             confidentiality agreement the execution of which shall not be
             subject to the conditions of this Section 5.6), (i) Westcoast has
             provided Duke Energy with a copy of the Superior Proposal document,
             (ii) five Business Days shall have elapsed from the later of (x)
             the date Duke Energy received written notice (a "Section 5.6
             Notice") advising Duke Energy that Westcoast's Board of Directors
             has resolved, subject only to compliance with this Section 5.6, to
             accept, approve, recommend or enter into an agreement in respect of
             such Superior Proposal, specifying the terms and conditions of such
             Superior Proposal and identifying the person making such Superior
             Proposal, and (y) the date Duke Energy received a copy of such
             Superior Proposal, (iii) Westcoast's Board of Directors has
             determined in good faith (based upon the written opinion of its
             outside legal counsel) that it is necessary for the Board of
             Directors of Westcoast to take such action in order to discharge
             properly its fiduciary duties, (iv) such Superior Proposal does not
             provide for the payment of any break, termination or other fees or
             expenses to the other party in the event that Westcoast or any of
             its subsidiaries completes the transactions contemplated by this
             Agreement or any other transaction with Duke Energy or any of its
             affiliates agreed to prior to any termination of this Agreement,
             and (v) Westcoast has previously or concurrently will have paid to
             Duke Energy the Termination Fee, if any, payable under Section 7.3.
             In the event that Westcoast provides Duke Energy with a Section 5.6
             Notice on a date


                             COMBINATION AGREEMENT
                                       52
<PAGE>   57


             that is less than five Business Days prior to the Westcoast
             Meeting, Westcoast shall adjourn the Westcoast Meeting (without
             notice on the Arrangement or any related matters) to a date that is
             not less than five Business Days and not more than 10 Business Days
             after the date of the Section 5.6 Notice.

         (b) During the five Business Day period referred to in Section
             5.6(a)(ii), Westcoast agrees that Duke Energy shall have the right,
             but not the obligation, to offer to amend the terms of this
             Agreement. The Board of Directors of Westcoast will review any
             proposal by Duke Energy to amend the terms of this Agreement in
             good faith in order to determine, in its discretion in the exercise
             of its fiduciary duties, whether Duke Energy's amended proposal
             upon acceptance by Westcoast would result in such Superior Proposal
             ceasing to be a Superior Proposal. If the Board of Directors of
             Westcoast so determines, it will enter into an amended agreement
             with Duke Energy reflecting Duke Energy's amended proposal. If the
             Board of Directors of Westcoast continues to believe, in good faith
             and after consultation with financial advisors and outside counsel,
             that such Superior Proposal remains a Superior Proposal and
             therefore rejects Duke Energy's amended proposal, Westcoast may,
             subject to the terms of this Agreement, accept, approve, recommend
             or enter into an agreement, understanding or arrangement in respect
             of such Superior Proposal.

         (c) Westcoast also acknowledges and agrees that each successive
             material modification of any Acquisition Proposal shall constitute
             a new Acquisition Proposal for purposes of Section 5.5 and the
             requirement under clause (ii) of Section 5.6(a) to initiate an
             additional five Business Day notice period.

5.7      EMPLOYEE BENEFITS AND RELATED MATTERS

         Duke Energy agrees, and after the Effective Time will cause Westcoast
or any of its subsidiaries, as the case may be, to:

         (a) from the Effective Time through December 31, 2002, provide Affected
             Employees, taken as a whole, employee benefits pursuant to employee
             benefit plans, programs, policies or arrangements maintained by
             Duke Energy or any subsidiary of Duke Energy providing coverage and
             benefits which, in the aggregate, are no less favourable than (i)
             those provided to Affected Employees immediately prior to the
             Effective Time (other than benefits provided pursuant to Westcoast
             Employee Share Purchase Plans) or, (ii) if elected by Duke Energy
             with respect to all or certain Affected Employees, those provided
             from time to time after the Effective Time to employees of Duke
             Energy or its subsidiaries who are similarly situated, in terms of
             their positions, tenure and geographic locations, to such Affected
             Employees; "Affected Employees" means individuals who are actively
             employed by Westcoast or any of its subsidiaries as of the
             Effective Time, are not subject to a collective bargaining
             agreement and who remain employed with Duke Energy or any
             subsidiary of Duke Energy;

         (b) give each Affected Employee full credit for purposes of determining
             severance pay and eligibility to participate, vesting and benefit
             accrual (except for purposes of


                             COMBINATION AGREEMENT
                                       53
<PAGE>   58


             benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plans, or to the
             extent such treatment would result in duplicative accrual on or
             after the Effective Date of benefits for the same period maintained
             by Duke Energy or any subsidiary of Duke Energy), for such Affected
             Employee's service with Westcoast or any subsidiary of Westcoast to
             the same extent and for the same purpose recognized by Westcoast
             immediately prior to the Effective Time and previously disclosed to

         (c) waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions exclusions with
             respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to
             the Affected Employees under any medical or dental benefit plans

             to participate, other than preexisting conditions exclusions
             imposed with respect to any Affected Employee immediately prior to
             such participation under any medical or dental plan maintained by
             Westcoast for the Affected Employees and other than preexisting
             conditions exclusions imposed by third-party health benefit

             in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket

             such expenses are taken into account for the benefit of similarly

             Shares in accordance with the terms of such First Preferred Shares,
             Series 2. Westcoast shall complete such conversion by such time as
             is necessary to enable such holders to be holders entitled to
             receive notice of the Westcoast Meeting. Notwithstanding any other
             provision of this Agreement, the acts of Westcoast to convert the
             Westcoast First Preferred Shares, Series 2 in accordance with their
             terms

             and this Section 5.9 shall be deemed not to breach or violate or
             fail to satisfy any representations, warranties, covenants or
             obligations of Westcoast under this Agreement.

         (b) Westcoast shall within two Business Days provide written notice to
             a designated officer of Duke Energy of any conversion notice given

             Westcoast by a holder of UEI Holdings Inc. First Series Preferred
             Shares (a "UEI Conversion Notice"). Westcoast shall redeem, unless
             Duke Energy otherwise consents, all such First Preferred Shares,
             Series 5 in respect of which a Series 5 Conversion Notice is given,
             in accordance with the terms of such First Preferred Shares, Series
             5 and shall redeem, unless Duke Energy otherwise consents, all such
             UEI Holdings Inc. First Series Preferred Shares in respect of which
             a UEI Conversion Notice is given, in accordance with the terms of
             such UEI Holdings Inc. First Series Preferred Shares, as the case
             may be. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the
             acts of Westcoast to redeem the First Preferred Shares, Series 5
             and the UEI Holdings Inc. First Series Preferred Shares in
             accordance with their respective terms and this Section 5.9 shall
             be deemed not to breach or violate or fail to satisfy any
             representations, warranties, covenants or obligations of Westcoast
             under this Agreement.

         (b) by either Westcoast or Duke Energy, if there shall be any Law that

             injunction, order or decree of a competent Governmental Entity
             (other than any order from the Court refusing to grant the Final
             Order) enjoining Duke Energy or Westcoast from consummating the

         (d) by Duke Energy if, (i) the Board of Directors of Westcoast fails to
             recommend or withdraws, modifies or changes its approval or

             Resolution within 10 Business Days of any written request to do so
             from Duke Energy, (iii) the Arrangement Resolution and the
             Westcoast Rights Plan Waiver Resolution are not submitted for
             approval at the Westcoast Meeting, or the Westcoast Meeting is not
             held prior to January 31, 2002 or such later date to which the
             Westcoast Meeting shall have been adjourned or postponed as may be
             permitted pursuant to Section 5.6(a); provided that in the event a
             Force Majeure has occurred which makes giving notice of the
             Westcoast Meeting impractical, or if such notice has already been
             given, makes holding the Westcoast Meeting impractical on or prior
             to such date, such date shall be extended until the earlier of the
             thirty-fifth day after the cessation of such Force Majeure or March
             31, 2002, or (iv) Westcoast shall have breached in any material
             respect its obligations under Section 5.5 or 5.6;

7.3      EFFECT OF TERMINATION

         (a) If this Agreement is terminated in accordance with the provisions
             of Section 7.2, no party shall have any further liability to
             perform its obligations hereunder except for the provisions of this
             Section 7.3 and Section 5.3(b) and Section 8.9; provided that
             neither the termination of this Agreement nor anything contained in
             this Section 7.3 shall relieve any party from any liability for any
             breach by it of this Agreement, including from any inaccuracy in
             its representations and warranties and any non-performance by it of
             its covenants and agreements made herein. If it shall be judicially
             determined that termination of this Agreement was caused by an
             intentional breach of this Agreement, then, in addition to any
             other remedies at law or equity for breach of this Agreement, the
             party so found to have intentionally breached this Agreement shall
             indemnify and hold harmless the other parties for their
             out-of-pocket costs, including fees and expenses of their counsel,
             accountants, financial advisors and other experts and advisors,
             incident to the negotiation, preparation and execution of this

         (b) If this Agreement is terminated:

             (i)   by Duke Energy pursuant to Section 7.2(d); or

                   Energy pursuant to Section 7.2(e)(iii) and at any time after
                   the date of this Agreement and prior to such termination a
                   bona fide Acquisition Proposal with respect to Westcoast or
                   its subsidiaries shall have been made, or any proposal or
                   expression of interest by a third party regarding an
                   Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly disclosed;

             then Westcoast will, in the case of a termination by Duke Energy,
             within three Business Days following any such termination or, in
             the case of a termination by Westcoast, prior to such termination,
             pay to Duke Energy in cash by wire transfer in immediately
             available funds to an account designated by Duke Energy the

         (c) If this Agreement is terminated by either party pursuant to Section
             7.2(e)(i) or by Duke Energy pursuant to Section 7.2(e)(iii) and
             after the date of this Agreement and prior to such termination no

             after the date of such termination, Westcoast enters into any
             agreement for an Acquisition Proposal or consummates a transaction
             that constitutes an Acquisition Proposal, Westcoast will, prior to
             the earlier of consummation of a transaction that constitutes an
             Acquisition Proposal, or execution of a definitive agreement with

             pay to the terminating party in cash by wire transfer in
             immediately available funds to an account designated by the
             terminating party an amount equal to the Expense Fee as payment in
             full of the terminating party's costs and expenses in connection
             with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

         (e) If this Agreement is terminated by Duke Energy pursuant to Section
             7.2(f) and at any time after the date of this Agreement and prior
             to such termination a bona fide Acquisition Proposal with respect
             to Westcoast or its subsidiaries shall have been made, or any
             proposal or expression of interest by a third party regarding an
             Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly disclosed, then (i)
             Westcoast will, within three Business Days following any such
             termination, pay to Duke Energy in cash by wire transfer in
             immediately available funds to an account designated by Duke Energy

             months after the date of such termination, Westcoast enters into
             any agreement for an Acquisition Proposal or consummates a
             transaction that constitutes an Acquisition Proposal, Westcoast
             will, prior to the earlier of consummation of a transaction that
             constitutes an Acquisition Proposal, or execution of a definitive
             agreement with respect thereto, pay to Duke Energy in cash by wire
             transfer in immediately available funds to an account designated by
             Duke Energy, the Termination Fee minus the amount of any payment
             previously made pursuant to clause (i) of this subsection (e).

         (f) If this Agreement is terminated by either party pursuant to Section
             7.2(c) or pursuant to Section 7.2(e)(ii) and within 12 months after
             the date of such termination, Westcoast enters into any agreement
             for an Acquisition Proposal or consummates a transaction that

             by Westcoast, prior to such termination, pay to Duke Energy in cash

             expenses in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
             Agreement.

         (h) Solely for purposes of this Section 7.3, (x) each reference to 20%
             in the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be 25%
             and (y) for purposes of determining under Section 7.03(b)(ii)

to Duke Energy for damages for claims in respect of breaches of this Agreement
shall be subject to a maximum limit equal to the liability of Duke Energy to
Westcoast for damages for claims in respect of breaches of this Agreement plus
the Termination Fee.

R.S.C. 1995, c. C-44 (the "Arrangement") to be entered pursuant to the terms and

disposition under Rule 145 are eliminated pursuant to action of the SEC. The
undersigned understands that Duke Energy will not be required to file or

Act for the purpose of resale of Securities held by the undersigned.

         The undersigned acknowledges and agrees that appropriate restrictive
legends will be placed on certificates representing Securities received by the
undersigned in the Arrangement or held by a transferee thereof and that "stop
transfer" orders may be entered in the records of the transfer agent for
Securities with respect to such shares. Such orders will be removed and such
legends will be removed by delivery of substitute certificates upon receipt of
an opinion in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Duke Energy from
counsel reasonably satisfactory to Duke Energy to the effect that such legends
are no longer required to assure compliance with applicable provisions of the
Securities Act.

         The undersigned acknowledges that the undersigned has carefully read
this letter and understands the requirements hereof and the limitations imposed
upon the distribution, sale, transfer or other disposition of Securities and the
receipt by Duke Energy of this letter is an inducement to Duke Energy to
consummate the Arrangement.

all obligations of the undersigned hereunder shall terminate upon the
termination of the Agreement in accordance with its terms.

         2.2 ARRANGEMENT

         Commencing at the Effective Time, the following shall occur and shall
be deemed to occur without any further act or formality:

               (a) Subject to the proration adjustments set forth in Section
2.2(d), each Westcoast Common Share that is not held by (i) a Dissenting
Shareholder who is ultimately entitled to be paid the fair value of the
Westcoast Common Shares held by such Dissenting Shareholder or (ii) Duke Energy
or any affiliate thereof (which shall not be exchanged under the Arrangement and
shall remain outstanding as a Westcoast Common Share held by Duke Energy or any
affiliate thereof), will be transferred to, and acquired by, Exchangeco, without
any act or formality on the part of the holder of such Westcoast Common Share or
Exchangeco, free and clear of all liens, claims and encumbrances in exchange
for, at the holder's election (or deemed election), (w) Cdn$43.80 in cash
without interest (a "CASH ELECTION"); or (x) such number of fully paid and
non-assessable Exchangeable Shares (and the Ancillary Rights) as is equal to the
Exchange Ratio; or (y) such number of fully paid and non-assessable Duke Energy
Common Shares as is equal to the Exchange Ratio; or (z) a combination of the
foregoing, with the aggregate value of the cash portion to be less than
Cdn$43.80 and the total number of Exchangeable Shares and/or Duke Energy Common
Shares (if any) determined in accordance with Section 2.2(d) (a "MIXED
ELECTION"), payable, in each case, in accordance with Article 4, and the name of
each such holder of Westcoast Common Shares will be removed from the register of
holders of Westcoast Common Shares and added to the register of holders of the
Exchangeable Shares or Duke Energy Common Shares, as the case may be, if any,
comprising all or part of the consideration to be received by such holder for
such transfer, and Exchangeco will be recorded as the registered holder of such
Westcoast Common Shares so exchanged and will be deemed to be the legal and
beneficial owner thereof; provided, however, that holders of Westcoast Common
Shares who are not Canadian Residents will not be entitled to elect or be deemed
to have elected to receive Exchangeable Shares (and the Ancillary Rights), and
any such election or deemed election otherwise made by any such holder shall be
deemed to be an election to receive Duke Energy Common Shares.

               (b) After application of the proration provisions in Section
2.2(d) to all Westcoast Common Shares in respect of which an election has been
made by the holder thereof in accordance with Section 2.2(a), each Westcoast
Common Share in respect of which no election has been made by the holder
thereof, or in respect of which an effective election has not been made (other
than Westcoast Common Shares held by (i) a Dissenting Shareholder who is
ultimately entitled to be paid the fair value of the Westcoast Common Shares
held by such Dissenting Shareholder and (ii) Duke Energy or any affiliate
thereof (which shall not be exchanged under the Arrangement and shall remain
outstanding as a Westcoast Common Share held by Duke Energy or any affiliate
thereof)) ("NON-ELECTION SHARES") will be transferred to, and acquired by,
Exchangeco, without any act or formality on the part of the holder of such
Westcoast Common Share or Exchangeco, free and clear of all liens, claims and
encumbrances, and the holder shall be deemed to have elected to receive in
exchange therefor (x) if the Aggregate Amount of Cash Elected equals or exceeds
the Cash Available, such number of fully paid and non-assessable Exchangeable
Shares (and the Ancillary Rights) if such holder is a Canadian Resident (or such
number of fully paid and non-assessable Duke Energy Common


                                      -8-

Shares if such holder is not a Canadian Resident) as is equal to the Exchange
Ratio, (y) if the Aggregate Number of Shares Elected equals or exceeds the
Shares Available, Cdn$43.80 in cash, without interest, or (z) if neither Clause
(x) or (y) is applicable, (1) an amount of cash, without interest, equal to (A)
the Cash Available minus the Aggregate Amount of Cash Elected divided by (B) the
number of outstanding Non-Election Shares (the "NON-ELECTION CASH AMOUNT") and
(2) the number of Exchangeable Shares (and the Ancillary Rights) if such holder
is a Canadian Resident (or the number of Duke Energy Common Shares if such
holder is not a Canadian Resident) as is equal to (A) the Exchange Ratio
multiplied by (B) a fraction the numerator of which is Cdn$43.80 minus the
Non-Election Cash Amount and the denominator of which is Cdn$43.80, in all such
cases payable in accordance with Article 4, and the name of each such holder of
Westcoast Common Shares will be removed from the register of holders of
Westcoast Common Shares and added to the register of holders of the Exchangeable
Shares or Duke Energy Common Shares, as the case may be, if any, comprising all
or part of the consideration to be received by such holder for such transfer,
and Exchangeco will be recorded as the registered holder of such Westcoast
Common Shares so exchanged and will be deemed to be the legal and beneficial
owner of such Westcoast Common Shares.

               (c) For greater certainty, a pro rata portion of the total number
of Exchangeable Shares, the total amount of cash, and the total number of Duke
Energy Common Shares received under the Arrangement by any particular holder
will be allocated to every Westcoast Common Share held by that holder at the
Effective Time, so that such holder will receive for each Westcoast Common Share
held by the holder at the Effective Time the same combination of Exchangeable
Shares, cash and/or Duke Energy Common Shares as is received for every other
Westcoast Common Share held by that holder at the Effective Time.
Notwithstanding any provisions of this Plan of Arrangement, of the aggregate
consideration to be received by the holders of Westcoast Common Shares, 50% will
consist of cash and 50% will consist of Exchangeable Shares and/or Duke Energy
Common Shares, subject to the effects of Dissenting Shareholders pursuant to
Section 3.1.

               (d) The consideration which each holder of Westcoast Common
Shares has elected in accordance with Section 2.2(a) to receive in exchange for
such holder's Westcoast Common Shares shall be subject to adjustment and
proration on the following bases:

                    (i) if the Aggregate Amount of Cash Elected exceeds the Cash
Available, then the amount of cash payable under the Arrangement to each holder
of Westcoast Common Shares who has made a Cash Election or a Mixed Election
shall be prorated (based on the fraction equal to the Cash Available divided by
the Aggregate Amount of Cash Elected) among all such holders of Westcoast Common
Shares who made a Cash Election or a Mixed Election so that the aggregate amount
of cash payable to all such holders of Westcoast Common Shares who made a Cash
Election or a Mixed Election shall be equal to the Cash Available and each such
holder of Westcoast Common Shares who made a Cash Election or a Mixed Election
shall be entitled to receive cash equal to the amount of cash payable to such
holder of Westcoast Common Shares after giving effect to the proration
provisions of this Section 2.2(d)(i) and (x) if such holder of Westcoast Common
Shares has made a further election to receive Exchangeable Shares or Duke Energy
Common Shares in such event, then such holder shall be deemed to have elected to
receive the number of Exchangeable Shares per Westcoast Common Share equal to
the Exchange Ratio or the number of Duke Energy Common Shares per Westcoast
Common Share

<PAGE>   87
equal to the Exchange Ratio, as the case may be, in respect of the balance of
such holder's Westcoast Common Shares in respect of which cash was elected but
not available, or (y) if such holder shall not have made a valid further
election to receive Exchangeable Shares or Duke Energy Common Shares, (A) if
such holder is a Canadian Resident, such holder shall be deemed to have elected
to receive the number of Exchangeable Shares per Westcoast Common Share equal to
the Exchange Ratio in respect of the balance of such holder's Westcoast Common
Shares in respect of which cash was elected but not available and (B) if such
holder is not a Canadian Resident, such holder shall be deemed to have elected
to receive the number of Duke Energy Common Shares per Westcoast Common Share
equal to the Exchange Ratio in respect of the balance of such holder's Westcoast
Common Shares in respect of which cash was elected but not available; and

                    (ii) if the Aggregate Number of Shares Elected exceeds the
Shares Available, then (x) the number of Exchangeable Shares issuable under the
Arrangement to each holder of Westcoast Common Shares who has elected to receive
all or part of the consideration for such holder's Westcoast Common Shares in
the form of Exchangeable Shares shall be prorated (based on the fraction equal
to the Maximum Number of Exchangeable Shares divided by the aggregate number of
Exchangeable Shares that would be issuable to holders of Westcoast Common Shares
based upon the elections made pursuant to Section 2.2(a) before giving effect to
the proration provisions of this Section 2.2(d)) among all holders who have
elected to receive all or part of the consideration for their Westcoast Common
Shares in the form of Exchangeable Shares so that the number of Exchangeable
Shares issuable to all holders who have elected to receive all or part of the
consideration for their Westcoast Common Shares in the form of Exchangeable
Shares under the Arrangement shall be equal to the Maximum Number of
Exchangeable Shares and each such holder shall be entitled to receive that
number of Exchangeable Shares that is equal to the number of Exchangeable Shares
issuable to such holder, after giving effect to the proration provisions of this
Section 2.2(d)(ii)(x), and an amount of cash, without interest, equal to (A) the
difference between the number of Exchangeable Shares such holder elected to
receive pursuant to Section 2.2(a) and the number of Exchangeable Shares such
holder will be entitled to receive after giving effect to the proration
provisions of this Section 2.2(d)(ii)(x), divided by (B) the Exchange Ratio, and
multiplied by (C) Cdn$43.80; and (y) the number of Duke Energy Common Shares
issuable under the Arrangement to each holder of Westcoast Common Shares who has
elected (or is deemed to have elected) to receive all or part of the
consideration for such holder's Westcoast Common Shares, as the case may be, in
the form of Duke Energy Common Shares shall be prorated (based on the fraction
equal to the Maximum Number of Duke Energy Common Shares divided by the
aggregate number of Duke Energy Common Shares that would be issuable to holders
of Westcoast Common Shares based upon the elections made pursuant to Section
2.2(a) before giving effect to the proration provisions of this Section 2.2(d))
among all holders who have elected to receive all or part of the consideration
for their Westcoast Common Shares in the form of Duke Energy Common Shares so
that the number of Duke Energy Common Shares issuable to all holders who have
elected to receive all or part of the consideration for their Westcoast Common
Shares in the form of Duke Energy Common Shares under the Arrangement shall be
equal to the Maximum Number of Duke Energy Common Shares and each such holder
shall be entitled to receive that number of Duke Energy Common Shares that is
equal to the number of Duke Energy Common Shares issuable to such holder, after
giving effect to the proration provisions of this Section 2.2(d)(ii)(y), and an

                              PLAN OF ARRANGEMENT
<PAGE>   88
amount of cash, without interest, equal to (A) the difference between the number
of Duke Energy Common Shares such holder elected (or is deemed to have elected)
to receive pursuant to Section 2.2(a) and the number of Duke Energy Common
Shares such holder will be entitled to receive after giving effect to the
proration provisions of this Section 2.2(d)(ii)(y), divided by (B) the Exchange
Ratio, and multiplied by (C) Cdn$43.80.

               (e) Each of the outstanding First Preferred Shares shall remain
outstanding in accordance with its terms.

               (f) Each Westcoast Option that has not been duly exercised prior
to the Effective Time shall be exchanged for or converted into an option (a
"REPLACEMENT OPTION") to purchase that number of Duke Energy Common Shares equal
to the number of Westcoast Common Shares subject to such Westcoast Option
multiplied by the Exchange Ratio. Such Replacement Option shall provide for an
exercise price per Duke Energy Common Share equal to (x) the exercise price per
Westcoast Common Share of such Westcoast Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time divided by the Exchange Ratio, divided by (y) the Currency
Exchange Rate for United States dollars on the Effective Date, provided that in
no circumstance shall the exercise price per Duke Energy Common Share be less
than $.01 and if the calculation results in an exercise price less than $.01,
the exercise price shall be deemed to be $.01 per Duke Energy Common Share. If
the foregoing calculation results in a Replacement Option being exercisable for
a fraction of a Duke Energy Common Share, then the number of Duke Energy Common
Shares subject to such Replacement Option shall be rounded down to the next
whole number of Duke Energy Common Shares and the total exercise price for the
Replacement Option shall be reduced by the exercise price of the fractional Duke
Energy Common Share, provided that in no circumstance shall the exercise price
per Duke Energy Common Share be less than $.01 and if the calculation results in
an exercise price less than $.01, the exercise price shall be deemed to be $.01
per Duke Energy Common Share. The term to expiry, conditions to and manner of
exercising, vesting schedule and all other terms and conditions of such
Replacement Option will be the same as the terms and conditions of such
Westcoast Option, and any document or agreement previously evidencing such
Westcoast Option shall thereafter evidence and be deemed to evidence such
Replacement Options. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the holder of a Westcoast
Option may, at his or her sole option, notify Duke Energy in writing on or
before the Effective Time that he or she wishes to increase the exercise price
per Duke Energy Common Share for his or her Replacement Option in the event that
the value of such Replacement Option immediately after the Effective Time
(measured as the difference between the closing price of the Duke Energy Common
Shares on the NYSE on the Effective Date and the exercise price for such shares
pursuant to such Replacement Option) exceeds the value of the Westcoast Option
immediately before the Effective Time (measured as (x) the difference between
the closing price of the Westcoast Common Shares underlying such Westcoast
Option on The Toronto Stock Exchange on the trading day immediately preceding
the Effective Date and the exercise price for such shares pursuant to such
Westcoast Option, divided by (y) the Currency Exchange Rate for United States
dollars on the Effective Date) to the amount necessary to make the value of such
Replacement Option immediately after the Effective Time equal to the value of
such Westcoast Option immediately before the Effective Time and in the event
such notice is given, the exercise price per Duke Energy Common Share under such
Replacement

Option shall be deemed to be equal to such amount; provided that in no
circumstances shall the exercise price per Duke Energy Common Share be less than
$.01.

         2.3 ELECTIONS

               (a) Each Person who, at or prior to the Election Deadline, is a

all or a portion of their shares, to make an election at or prior to the
Election Deadline to receive (i) cash, (ii) Exchangeable Shares (and the
Ancillary Rights), (iii) Duke Energy Common Shares, or (iv) a combination
thereof, in exchange for such holder's Westcoast Common Shares on the basis set
forth herein and in the Letter of Transmittal and Election Form; provided that,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a holder of Westcoast Common
Shares who is not a Canadian Resident will not be entitled to elect to receive
Exchangeable Shares (and the Ancillary Rights) and any such election otherwise
made by any such holder shall be and be deemed to be an election to receive Duke
Energy Common Shares.

               (b) Holders of Westcoast Common Shares who are Canadian
Residents, other than any such holder who is exempt from tax under the ITA, and
who have elected (or who are deemed to have elected) to receive Exchangeable
Shares (and the Ancillary Rights) shall be entitled to make an income tax
election pursuant to subsection 85(1) of the ITA or, if the holder is a
partnership, subsection 85(2) of the ITA (and in each case, where applicable,
the analogous provisions of provincial income tax law) with respect to the
transfer of their Westcoast Common Shares to Exchangeco by providing two signed
copies of the necessary prescribed election forms to the Depositary within 90
days following the Effective Date, duly completed with the details of the number
of Westcoast Common Shares transferred and the applicable agreed amounts for the
purposes of such elections. Thereafter, subject to the election forms being

90 days following the Effective Date, within 30 days after the receipt thereof
by the Depositary, Exchangeco will not be responsible for any taxes, interest,
penalties or any other costs or damages resulting from the failure by a holder
of Westcoast Common Shares to properly complete or file the election forms in
the form and manner and within the time prescribed by the ITA (or any applicable
provincial income tax law). In its sole discretion, Exchangeco may choose to
sign and return an election form received more than 90 days following the
Effective Date, but Exchangeco will have no obligation to do so.

         2.4 ADJUSTMENTS TO EXCHANGE RATIO

         The Exchange Ratio, including the minimum and maximum Exchange Ratio
used in the calculation thereof, shall be proportionately and appropriately
adjusted to reflect fully the effect of (a) any stock split, reverse split,
stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible
into Duke Energy Common Shares or Westcoast Common Shares), reorganization,
recapitalization or other like change with respect to Duke Energy Common Shares
or Westcoast Common Shares and (b) any extraordinary dividend or distribution
with

respect to Duke Energy Common Shares (other than a dividend or distribution
referenced in clause (a)), but only if the Weighted Average Trading Price of
Duke Energy Common Shares is less than $36.88 as of the Effective Date, in each
case of clause (a) or (b) the record date for which occurs after the date of the
Combination Agreement and prior to the Effective Time. Regular quarterly cash
dividends and increases therein shall not be considered extraordinary for
purposes of the preceding sentence.

                                RIGHTS OF DISSENT

         3.1 RIGHTS OF DISSENT

         Holders of Westcoast Common Shares may exercise rights of dissent with
respect to such Westcoast Common Shares pursuant to and in the manner set forth
in section 190 of the CBCA as modified by the Interim Order and this Section 3.1
(the "DISSENT RIGHTS") in connection with the Arrangement; provided that,
notwithstanding subsection 190(5) of the CBCA, the written objection to the
Arrangement Resolution referred to in subsection 190(5) of the CBCA must be
received by Westcoast not later than 2:00 p.m. (Vancouver time) on the Business
Day preceding the Westcoast Meeting. Holders of Westcoast Common Shares who duly
exercise such rights of dissent and who:

               (a) are ultimately determined to be entitled to be paid fair
value for their Westcoast Common Shares shall be deemed to have transferred such
Westcoast Common Shares as of the Effective Time, without any further act or
formality and free and clear of all liens, claims and encumbrances, to
Exchangeco, in consideration for a payment of cash from Exchangeco equal to such
fair value; or

               (b) are ultimately determined not to be entitled, for any reason,
to be paid fair value for their Westcoast Common Shares, shall be deemed to have
participated in the Arrangement, as of the Effective Time, on the same basis as
a non-dissenting holder of Westcoast Common Shares who did not make an election
and shall receive cash, Exchangeable Shares or Duke Energy Common Shares on the
same basis as holders of Non-Election Shares,

but in no case shall Duke Energy, Exchangeco, Callco, Westcoast or any other
Person be required to recognize any Dissenting Shareholder as a holder of
Westcoast Common Shares after the Effective Time, and the names of each
Dissenting Shareholder shall be deleted from the register of holders of
Westcoast Common Shares at the Effective Time.

                       CERTIFICATES AND FRACTIONAL SHARES

         4.1 PAYMENT OF CASH

         At or promptly after the Effective Time, Exchangeco shall deposit with

Depositary for transfer to Exchangeco of a certificate which immediately prior
to or upon the Effective Time represented Westcoast Common Shares in respect of
which the holder is entitled to receive cash under the Arrangement, together
with a duly completed Letter of Transmittal and Election Form, and such other
documents and instruments as would have been required to effect the transfer of
the shares formerly represented by such certificate under the CBCA and the
by-laws of Westcoast and such additional documents and instruments as the
Depositary may reasonably require, the holder of such surrendered certificate
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and after the Effective Time
the Depositary shall deliver to such holder the amount of cash such holder is
entitled to receive under the Arrangement (together with any unpaid dividends or
distributions declared on the Westcoast Common Shares, if any, prior to the
Effective Time), and any certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
transferred to Exchangeco. In the event of a transfer of ownership of such
Westcoast Common Shares that was not registered in the securities register of
Westcoast, the amount of cash payable for such Westcoast Common Shares under the
Arrangement may be delivered to the transferee if the certificate representing
such Westcoast Common Shares is presented to the Depositary as provided above,
accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and
to evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this Section 4.1, each certificate which
immediately prior to or upon the Effective Time represented one or more
outstanding Westcoast Common Shares that, under the Arrangement, were exchanged
or were deemed to be exchanged for cash pursuant to Section 2.2 shall be deemed
at all times after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive
upon such surrender the cash payment contemplated by this Section 4.1.

         4.2 ISSUANCE OF CERTIFICATES REPRESENTING EXCHANGEABLE SHARES

         At or promptly after the Effective Time, Exchangeco shall deposit with
the Depositary, for the benefit of the holders of Westcoast Common Shares who
will receive Exchangeable Shares (and the Ancillary Rights) in connection with
the Arrangement, certificates representing the Maximum Number of Exchangeable
Shares. Upon surrender to the Depositary for transfer to Exchangeco of a
certificate which immediately prior to or upon the Effective Time represented
Westcoast Common Shares in respect of which the holder is entitled to receive
Exchangeable Shares under the Arrangement, together with a duly completed Letter
of Transmittal and Election Form and such other documents and instruments as
would have been required to effect the transfer of the shares formerly
represented by such certificate under the CBCA and the by-laws of Westcoast and
such additional documents and instruments as the Depositary may reasonably
require, the holder of such surrendered certificate shall be entitled to receive
in exchange therefor, and after the Effective Time the Depositary shall deliver
to such holder, a certificate representing that number (rounded down to the
nearest whole number) of Exchangeable Shares which such holder has the right to
receive (together with any unpaid dividends or distributions declared on the
Westcoast Common


                                      -14-

Shares prior to the Effective Time) and any certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be transferred to Exchangeco. No interest shall be paid or accrued on
the cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, or on unpaid dividends and
distributions, if any, payable to holders of certificates that formerly
represented Westcoast Common Shares. In the event of a transfer of ownership of
Westcoast Common Shares that was not registered in the securities register of
Westcoast, a certificate representing the proper number of Exchangeable Shares
(together with any unpaid dividends or distributions declared on the Westcoast
Common Shares prior to the Effective Time) may be issued to the transferee if
the certificate representing such Westcoast Common Shares is presented to the
Depositary as provided above, accompanied by all documents required to evidence
and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer
taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 4.2,
each certificate which immediately prior to or upon the Effective Time
represented one or more Westcoast Common Shares that, under the Arrangement,
were exchanged or were deemed to be exchanged for Exchangeable Shares pursuant
to Section 2.2 shall be deemed at all times after the Effective Time, but
subject to Section 4.5, to represent only the right to receive upon such
surrender a certificate representing that number (rounded down to the nearest
whole number) of Exchangeable Shares (together with any unpaid dividends or
distributions declared on the Westcoast Common Shares prior to the Effective
Time) which such holder has the right to receive.

         4.3 ISSUANCE OF CERTIFICATES REPRESENTING DUKE ENERGY COMMON SHARES

         At or promptly after the Effective Time, Exchangeco shall deposit with
the Depositary, for the benefit of the holders of Westcoast Common Shares who
will receive Duke Energy Common Shares in connection with the Arrangement,
certificates representing the Maximum Number of Duke Energy Common Shares. Upon
surrender to the Depositary for transfer to Exchangeco of a certificate which
immediately prior to or upon the Effective Time represented Westcoast Common
Shares in respect of which the holder is entitled to receive Duke Energy Common
Shares under the Arrangement, together with a duly completed Letter of
Transmittal and Election Form and such other documents and instruments as would
have been required to effect the transfer of the shares formerly represented by
such certificate under the CBCA and the by-laws of Westcoast and such additional
documents and instruments as the Depositary may reasonably require, the holder
of such surrendered certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor, and after the Effective Time the Depositary shall deliver to such
holder, a certificate representing that number (rounded down to the nearest
whole number) of Duke Energy Common Shares which such holder has the right to
receive (together with any unpaid dividends or distributions declared on the
Westcoast Common Shares prior to the Effective Time) and any certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be transferred to Exchangeco. No interest shall be
paid or accrued on the cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, or on unpaid
dividends and distributions, if any, payable to holders of certificates that
formerly represented Westcoast Common Shares. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Westcoast Common Shares that was not registered in the securities
register of Westcoast, a certificate representing the proper number of Duke
Energy Common Shares (together with any unpaid dividends or distributions
declared on the Westcoast Common Shares prior to the Effective Time) may be
issued to the transferee if the certificate representing such Westcoast Common
Shares is presented to the Depositary as provided above, accompanied by all
documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any
applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 4.3, each certificate which immediately prior to or
upon the Effective Time represented one or more Westcoast Common Shares, under
the Arrangement, that were exchanged or were deemed to be exchanged for Duke
Energy Common Shares pursuant to Section 2.2 shall be deemed at all times after
the Effective Time, but subject to Section 4.5, to represent only the right to
receive upon such surrender a certificate representing that number (rounded down
to the nearest whole number) of Duke


                                      -15-

                              PLAN OF ARRANGEMENT
<PAGE>   93

Energy Common Shares (together with any unpaid dividends or distributions
declared prior to the Effective Time) which such holder has the right to
receive.

         4.4 DISTRIBUTIONS WITH RESPECT TO UNSURRENDERED CERTIFICATES

         No dividends or other distributions paid, declared or made with respect
to Exchangeable Shares or Duke Energy Common Shares, in each case with a record
date after the Effective Time, shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding Westcoast Common Shares that were exchanged for Exchangeable Shares
or Duke Energy Common Shares pursuant to Section 2.2 unless and until the holder
of such certificate shall comply with the provisions of Section 4.2 or 4.3, as
applicable. Subject to applicable law, at the time such holder shall have
complied with the provisions of Section 4.2 or 4.3, as applicable, (or, in the
case of clause (ii) below, at the appropriate payment date), there shall be paid
to the holder of the certificates formerly representing Westcoast Common Shares,
without interest, (i) the amount of dividends or other distributions with a
record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to the
Exchangeable Shares or Duke Energy Common Shares, as the case may be, to which
such holder is entitled pursuant hereto and (ii) on the appropriate payment
date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after
the Effective Time but prior to the date of compliance by such holder with the
provisions of Section 4.2 or 4.3 and a payment date subsequent to the date of
such compliance and payable with respect to such Exchangeable Shares or Duke
Energy Common Shares, as the case may be.

         4.5 NO FRACTIONAL SHARES

         No certificates representing fractional Exchangeable Shares or
fractional Duke Energy Common Shares shall be issued upon compliance with the
provisions of Section 4.2 or 4.3 and no dividend, stock split or other change in
the capital structure of Exchangeco or Duke Energy shall relate to any such
fractional security and such fractional interests shall not entitle the owner
thereof to exercise any rights as a security holder of Exchangeco or Duke
Energy. In lieu of any such fractional securities, each holder otherwise
entitled to a fractional interest in an Exchangeable Share or to a fractional
interest in a Duke Energy Common Share will be entitled to receive a cash
payment from the Depositary equal to the product of such fractional interest and
the Duke Energy Average Price as of the Effective Date, such amount to be
provided to the Depositary by Exchangeco upon request. Such payment with respect
to fractional shares is merely intended to provide a mechanical rounding off of,
and is not separately bargained for, consideration. If more than one certificate
formerly representing Westcoast Common Shares are surrendered for the account of
the same holder, the number of Exchangeable Shares or Duke Energy Common Shares
for which such certificates have been surrendered shall be computed on the basis
of the aggregate number of Westcoast Common Shares represented by the
certificates so surrendered. On the date of the notice referred to in Section
7.2 of the Exchangeable Share Provisions, the aggregate number of Exchangeable
Shares and the aggregate number of Duke Energy Common Shares for which no
certificates were issued as a result of the foregoing provisions of this Section
4.5 shall be deemed to have been surrendered by the Depositary for no
consideration to Exchangeco.

<PAGE>   94
         4.6 LOST CERTIFICATES

         In the event any certificate which immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented one or more outstanding Westcoast Common Shares that were
exchanged pursuant to Section 2.2 shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder of Westcoast Common
Shares claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Depositary
will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, any cash
pursuant to Section 4.1 and/or one or more certificates representing one or more
Exchangeable Shares pursuant to Section 4.2 or Duke Energy Common Shares
pursuant to Section 4.3 (and any dividends or distributions with respect
thereto) in each case deliverable in accordance with Section 2.2. When
authorizing such payment in exchange for any lost, stolen or destroyed
certificate, the holder to whom cash and/or certificates representing
Exchangeable Shares or Duke Energy Common Shares are to be issued shall, as a
condition precedent to the issuance thereof, give a bond satisfactory to
Westcoast, Exchangeco, Duke Energy and their respective transfer agents in such
sum as Westcoast, Exchangeco or Duke Energy may direct or otherwise indemnify
Westcoast, Exchangeco and Duke Energy in a manner satisfactory to Westcoast,
Exchangeco and Duke Energy against any claim that may be made against Westcoast,
Exchangeco or Duke Energy with respect to the certificate alleged to have been
lost, stolen or destroyed.

         4.7 EXTINGUISHMENT OF RIGHTS

         Any certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding Westcoast Common Shares that are not held by a
Dissenting Shareholder who is ultimately entitled to be paid fair value of the
Westcoast Common Shares held by such Dissenting Shareholder but was exchanged or
was deemed to have been exchanged pursuant to Section 2.2, that has not been
deposited with all other instruments required by Section 4.1, 4.2 or 4.3, on or
prior to the earlier of the fifth anniversary of the Effective Date and the date
of the notice referred to in Section 7.2 of the Exchangeable Share Provisions
shall cease to represent a claim or interest of any kind or nature to such cash
payment and/or as a holder of Exchangeable Shares or Duke Energy Common Shares.
On such date, the cash payment and/or the Exchangeable Shares or Duke Energy
Common Shares (and any dividends or distributions with respect thereto) to which
the former holder of the certificate referred to in the preceding sentence was
ultimately entitled shall be deemed to have been surrendered for no
consideration to Exchangeco or Duke Energy, as the case may be, together with
all entitlements to dividends, distributions, cash and interest in respect
thereof held for such former holder. None of Duke Energy, Exchangeco, Callco,
Westcoast or the Depositary shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash
payment, Duke Energy Common Shares or Exchangeable Shares (or dividends,
distributions and/or cash in lieu of fractional shares) delivered to a public
official pursuant to and in compliance with any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar law.

         4.8 WITHHOLDING RIGHTS

         Westcoast, Exchangeco, Callco, Duke Energy and the Depositary shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from any dividend or consideration otherwise
payable to any holder of Westcoast Common Shares, Duke Energy Common Shares or
Exchangeable Shares such amounts as Westcoast, Exchangeco, Callco, Duke Energy
or the Depositary is required to deduct


                                      -17-

                              PLAN OF ARRANGEMENT
<PAGE>   95
and withhold with respect to such payment under the ITA, the United States
Internal Revenue Code of 1986 or any provision of federal, provincial,
territorial, state, local or foreign tax law, in each case, as amended. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes hereof as having been paid to the holder of the shares in respect
of which such deduction and withholding was made, provided that such withheld
amounts are actually remitted to the appropriate taxing authority. To the extent
that the amount so required to be deducted or withheld from any payment to a
holder exceeds the cash portion of the consideration otherwise payable to the
holder, Westcoast, Exchangeco, Callco, Duke Energy and the Depositary are hereby
authorized to sell or otherwise dispose of such portion of the consideration as
is necessary to provide sufficient funds to Westcoast, Exchangeco, Callco, Duke
Energy or the Depositary, as the case may be, to enable it to comply with such
deduction or withholding requirement and Westcoast, Exchangeco, Callco, Duke
Energy or the Depositary shall notify the holder thereof and remit any unapplied
balance of the net proceeds of such sale.

         4.9 TERMINATION OF DEPOSITARY

         Any Exchangeable Shares or Duke Energy Common Shares, together with any
funds held by the Depositary, that remain undistributed to former holders of
Westcoast Common Shares nine months after the Effective Date shall be delivered
to Exchangeco, upon demand therefor, and holders of certificates previously
representing Westcoast Common Shares who have not theretofore complied with
Sections 4.1, 4.2 or 4.3 shall thereafter look only to Exchangeco for payment of
any claim to cash, Exchangeable Shares, Duke Energy Common Shares, cash in lieu
of fractional shares thereof or dividends or distributions, if any, in respect
thereof.

                       CERTAIN RIGHTS OF CALLCO TO ACQUIRE
                               EXCHANGEABLE SHARES

         5.1 CALLCO LIQUIDATION CALL RIGHT

               (a) Callco shall have the overriding right (the "LIQUIDATION CALL
RIGHT"), in the event of and notwithstanding the proposed liquidation,
dissolution or winding-up of Exchangeco or any other distribution of the assets
of Exchangeco among its shareholders for the purpose of winding-up its affairs,
pursuant to Article 5 of the Exchangeable Share Provisions, to purchase from all
but not less than all of the holders of Exchangeable Shares (other than any
holder of Exchangeable Shares which is an affiliate of Duke Energy) on the
Liquidation Date all but not less than all of the Exchangeable Shares held by
each such holder upon payment by Callco to each such holder of the Exchangeable
Share Price applicable on the last Business Day prior to the Liquidation Date
(the "LIQUIDATION CALL PURCHASE PRICE") in accordance with Section 5.1(c). In
the event of the exercise of the Liquidation Call Right by Callco, each holder
shall be obligated to sell all the Exchangeable Shares held by such holder to
Callco on the Liquidation Date upon payment by Callco to such holder of the
Liquidation Call Purchase Price for each such Exchangeable Share, whereupon
Exchangeco shall have no obligation to pay any Liquidation Amount to the holders
of such shares so purchased by Callco.

                              PLAN OF ARRANGEMENT
<PAGE>   96
               (b) To exercise the Liquidation Call Right, Callco must notify
Exchangeco and Exchangeco's transfer agent (the "TRANSFER AGENT"), as agent for
the holders of Exchangeable Shares, and Exchangeco of Callco's intention to
exercise such right at least 45 days before the Liquidation Date in the case of
a voluntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of Exchangeco or any other
voluntary distribution of the assets of Exchangeco among its shareholders for
the purpose of winding-up its affairs, and at least five Business Days before
the Liquidation Date in the case of an involuntary liquidation, dissolution or
winding-up of Exchangeco or any other involuntary distribution of the assets of
Exchangeco among its shareholders for the purpose of winding up its affairs. The
Transfer Agent will notify the holders of Exchangeable Shares as to whether
Callco has exercised the Liquidation Call Right forthwith after the expiry of
the period during which the same may be exercised by Callco. If Callco exercises
the Liquidation Call Right, then on the Liquidation Date, Callco will purchase
and the holders of Exchangeable Shares will sell all of the Exchangeable Shares
then outstanding for a price per share equal to the Liquidation Call Purchase
Price.

               (c) For the purposes of completing the purchase of the
Exchangeable Shares pursuant to the Liquidation Call Right, Callco shall deposit
or cause to be deposited with the Transfer Agent, on or before the Liquidation
Date, the Exchangeable Share Consideration representing the total Liquidation
Call Purchase Price. Provided that such Exchangeable Share Consideration has
been so deposited with the Transfer Agent, on and after the Liquidation Date,
the holders of the Exchangeable Shares shall cease to be holders of the
Exchangeable Shares and shall not be entitled to exercise any of the rights of
holders in respect thereof (including any rights under the Voting and Exchange
Trust Agreement), other than the right to receive their proportionate part of
the total Liquidation Call Purchase Price payable by Callco, without interest,
upon presentation and surrender by the holder of certificates representing the
Exchangeable Shares held by such holder and the holder shall on and after the
Liquidation Date be considered and deemed for all purposes to be the holder of
the Duke Energy Common Shares to which such holder is entitled. Upon surrender
to the Transfer Agent of a certificate or certificates representing Exchangeable
Shares, together with such other documents and instruments as may be required to
effect a transfer of Exchangeable Shares under the CBCA and the by-laws of
Exchangeco and such additional documents and instruments as the Transfer Agent
may reasonably require, the holder of such surrendered certificate or
certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and the Transfer
Agent on behalf of Callco shall deliver to such holder, the Exchangeable Share
Consideration to which such holder is entitled. If Callco does not exercise the
Liquidation Call Right in the manner described above, on the Liquidation Date
the holders of the Exchangeable Shares will be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the Liquidation Amount otherwise payable by Exchangeco in connection
with the liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of Exchangeco pursuant to
Article 5 of the Exchangeable Share Provisions.

         5.2 CALLCO REDEMPTION CALL RIGHT

         In addition to Callco's rights contained in the Exchangeable Share
Provisions, including the Retraction Call Right (as defined in the Exchangeable
Share Provisions), Callco shall have the following rights in respect of the
Exchangeable Shares:

               (a) Callco shall have the overriding right (the "REDEMPTION CALL
RIGHT"), in the event of and notwithstanding the proposed redemption of the
Exchangeable Shares by Exchangeco pursuant to Article 7 of the Exchangeable
Share Provisions, to purchase from all but not less than all of the holders of
Exchangeable Shares (other than any holder of Exchangeable Shares which is an
affiliate of Duke Energy) on the Redemption Date all but not less than all of
the Exchangeable Shares held by each such holder upon payment by Callco to each
such holder of the Exchangeable Share Price applicable on the last Business Day
prior to the Redemption Date (the "REDEMPTION CALL PURCHASE PRICE") in
accordance with 5.2(c). In the event of the exercise of the Redemption Call
Right by Callco, each holder shall be obligated to sell all the Exchangeable
Shares held by such holder to Callco on the Redemption Date upon payment by
Callco to such holder of the Redemption Call Purchase Price for each such
Exchangeable Share, whereupon Exchangeco shall have no obligation to redeem, or
to pay the Redemption Price in respect of, such shares so purchased by Callco.

               (b) To exercise the Redemption Call Right, Callco must notify the
Transfer Agent, as agent for the holders of Exchangeable Shares, and Exchangeco
of Callco's intention to exercise such right at least 60 days before the
Redemption Date, except in the case of a redemption occurring as a result of a
Duke Energy Control Transaction, an Exchangeable Share Voting Event or an Exempt
Exchangeable Share Voting Event (each as defined in the Exchangeable Share
Provisions), in which case Callco shall so notify the Transfer Agent and
Exchangeco on or before the Redemption Date. The Transfer Agent will notify the
holders of the Exchangeable Shares as to whether Callco has exercised the
Redemption Call Right forthwith after the expiry of the period during which the
same may be exercised by Callco. If Callco exercises the Redemption Call Right,
then on the Redemption Date, Callco will purchase and the holders of
Exchangeable Shares will sell all of the Exchangeable Shares then outstanding
for a price per share equal to the Redemption Call Purchase Price.

               (c) For the purposes of completing the purchase of the
Exchangeable Shares pursuant to the Redemption Call Right, Callco shall deposit
or cause to be deposited with the Transfer Agent, on or before the Redemption
Date, the Exchangeable Share Consideration representing the total Redemption
Call Purchase Price. Provided that such Exchangeable Share Consideration has
been so deposited with the Transfer Agent, on and after the Redemption Date the
holders of the Exchangeable Shares shall cease to be holders of the Exchangeable
Shares and shall not be entitled to exercise any of the rights of holders in
respect thereof (including any rights under the Voting and Exchange Trust
Agreement), other than the right to receive their proportionate part of the
total Redemption Call Purchase Price payable by Callco, without interest, upon
presentation and surrender by the holder of certificates representing the
Exchangeable Shares held by such holder and the holder shall on and after the
Redemption Date be considered and deemed for all purposes to be the holder of
the Duke Energy Common Shares to which such holder is entitled. Upon surrender
to the Transfer Agent of a certificate or certificates representing Exchangeable
Shares, together with such other documents and instruments as may be required to
effect a transfer of Exchangeable Shares under the CBCA and the by-laws of
Exchangeco and such additional documents and instruments as the Transfer Agent


                                      -20-

<PAGE>   98
may reasonably require, the holder of such surrendered certificate or
certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and the Transfer
Agent on behalf of Callco shall deliver to such holder, the Exchangeable Share
Consideration to which such holder is entitled. If Callco does not exercise the
Redemption Call Right in the manner described above, on the Redemption Date the
holders of the Exchangeable Shares will be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the Redemption Price otherwise payable by Exchangeco in connection with
the redemption of the Exchangeable Shares pursuant to Article 7 of the
Exchangeable Share Provisions.

                                   AMENDMENTS

         6.1 AMENDMENTS TO PLAN OF ARRANGEMENT

         Westcoast and Duke Energy reserve the right to amend, modify and/or
supplement this Plan of Arrangement at any time and from time to time prior to
the Effective Date subject to amendment in the manner provided for in the
Combination Agreement, provided that each such amendment, modification and/or
supplement must be (i) set out in writing, (ii) approved by Duke Energy, (iii)
filed with the Court and, if made following the Westcoast Meeting, approved by
the Court, and (iv) communicated to Westcoast Securityholders if and as required

Shares to be paid in Duke Energy Common Shares, in lieu of declaring the stock
dividend contemplated by Section 3.1(b) on the Exchangeable Shares, the Board of
Directors may, in good faith and in its discretion and subject to applicable law
and to obtaining all required regulatory approvals, subdivide, redivide or
change (the "SUBDIVISION") each issued and unissued Exchangeable Share on the
basis that each Exchangeable Share before the subdivision becomes a number of
Exchangeable Shares equal to the sum of (i) one Duke Energy Common Share and
(ii) the number of Duke Energy Common shares to be paid as a share dividend on
each Duke Energy Common Share. In making such Subdivision, the Board of
Directors shall consider the effect thereof upon the then outstanding
Exchangeable Shares and the general taxation consequences of the Subdivision to
the holders of the Exchangeable Shares. In such instance, and notwithstanding
any other provision hereof, such Subdivision shall become effective on the
effective date specified in Section 3.4 without any further act or formality on
the part of the Board of Directors or of the holders of Exchangeable Shares. For
greater certainty, subject to applicable law, no approval of the holders of
Exchangeable Shares to an amendment to the articles of the Company shall be
required to give effect to such subdivision.

         3.3 Cheques of the Company payable at par at any branch of the bankers
of the Company shall be issued in respect of any cash dividends contemplated by
Section 3.1(a) and the sending of such a cheque to each holder of an
Exchangeable Share shall satisfy the cash dividend represented thereby unless
the cheque is not paid on presentation. Subject to applicable law, certificates
registered in the name of the registered holder of Exchangeable Shares shall be
issued or transferred in respect of any stock dividends contemplated by Section
3.1(b) or any Subdivision contemplated by Section 3.2 and the sending of such a
certificate to each holder of an Exchangeable Share shall satisfy the stock
dividend represented thereby. Such other type and amount of property in respect
of any dividends contemplated by Section 3.1(c) shall be issued, distributed or
transferred by the Company in such manner as it shall determine and the
issuance, distribution or transfer thereof by the Company to each holder of an
Exchangeable Share shall satisfy the dividend represented thereby. No holder of
an Exchangeable Share shall be entitled to recover by action or other legal
process against the Company any dividend that is represented by a cheque that
has not been duly presented to the Company's bankers for payment or that
otherwise remains unclaimed for a period of six years from the date on which
such dividend was first payable.

         3.4 The record date for the determination of the holders of
Exchangeable Shares entitled to receive payment of, and the payment date for,
any dividend declared on the Exchangeable Shares under Section 3.1 shall be the
same dates as the record date and payment date, respectively, for the
corresponding dividend declared on the Duke Energy Common Shares. The record
date for the determination of the holders of Exchangeable Shares entitled to
receive Exchangeable Shares in connection with any Subdivision of the
Exchangeable Shares under Section 3.2 and the effective date of such Subdivision
shall be the same dates as the record date and payment date, respectively, for
the corresponding dividend declared on the Duke Energy Common Shares

         3.5 If on any payment date for any dividends declared on the
Exchangeable Shares under Section 3.1 the dividends are not paid in full on all
of the Exchangeable Shares then outstanding, any such dividends that remain
unpaid shall be paid on a subsequent date or dates determined by the Board of
Directors on which the Company shall have sufficient moneys, assets or property
properly applicable to the payment of such dividends.

         3.6 The Board of Directors shall determine, in good faith and in its
sole discretion, economic equivalence for the purposes of Sections 3.1 and 3.2,
and each such determination shall be conclusive and binding on the Company and
its shareholders. In making each such determination, the following factors
shall, without excluding other factors determined by the Board of Directors to
be relevant, be considered by the Board of Directors:

               (a) in the case of any stock dividend or other distribution
payable in Duke Energy Common Shares, the number of such shares issued in
proportion to the number of Duke Energy Common Shares previously outstanding;

               (b) in the case of the issuance or distribution of any rights,
options or warrants to subscribe for or purchase Duke Energy Common Shares (or
securities exchangeable for or convertible into or carrying rights to acquire
Duke Energy Common Shares), the relationship between the exercise price of each
such right, option or warrant and the Current Market Price;

               (c) in the case of the issuance or distribution of any other form
of property (including any shares or securities of Duke Energy of any class
other than Duke Energy Common Shares, any rights, options or warrants other than
those referred to in Section 3.6(b) above, any evidences of indebtedness of Duke
Energy or any assets of Duke Energy) the relationship between the fair market
value (as determined by the Board of Directors in the manner above contemplated)
of such property to be issued or distributed with respect to each outstanding
Duke Energy Common Share and the Current Market Price; and

               (d) in all such cases, the general taxation consequences of the
relevant event to holders of Exchangeable Shares to the extent that such
consequences may differ from the taxation consequences to holders of Duke Energy
Common Shares as a result of differences between taxation laws of Canada and the
United States (except for any differing consequences arising as a result of
differing marginal taxation rates and without regard to the individual
circumstances of holders of Exchangeable Shares).

<PAGE>   109
         3.7 Except as provided in this Article 3, the holders of Exchangeable
Shares shall not be entitled to receive dividends in respect thereof.

                                    ARTICLE 4

                              CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS

         4.1 So long as any of the Exchangeable Shares are outstanding, the
Company shall not at any time without, but may at any time with, the approval of
the holders of the Exchangeable Shares given as specified in Section 10.2 of
these share provisions:

               (a) pay any dividends on the Common Shares or any other shares
ranking junior to the Exchangeable Shares with respect to the payment of
dividends, other than stock dividends payable in Common Shares or any such other
shares ranking junior to the Exchangeable Shares, as the case may be;

               (b) redeem or purchase or make any capital distribution in
respect of Common Shares or any other shares ranking junior to the Exchangeable
Shares with respect to the payment of dividends or on any liquidation,
dissolution or winding-up of the Company or any other distribution of the assets
of the Company;

               (c) redeem or purchase any other shares of the Company ranking
equally with the Exchangeable Shares with respect to the payment of dividends or
on any liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Company or any other
distribution of the assets of the Company; or

               (d) issue any Exchangeable Shares or any other shares of the
Company ranking equally with, or superior to, the Exchangeable Shares other than
by way of stock dividends to the holders of such Exchangeable Shares;

         The restrictions in Sections 4.1(a), (b), (c) and (d) shall not apply
if all dividends on the outstanding Exchangeable Shares corresponding to
dividends declared and paid to date on the Duke Energy Common Shares shall have
been declared and paid on the Exchangeable Shares.

                                    ARTICLE 5

                           DISTRIBUTION ON LIQUIDATION

         5.1 In the event of the liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the
Company or any other distribution of the assets of the Company among its
shareholders for the purpose of winding up its affairs, a holder of Exchangeable
Shares shall be entitled, subject to applicable law and to the exercise by
Callco of the Liquidation Call Right, to receive from the assets of the Company
in respect of each Exchangeable Share held by such holder on the effective date
(the "LIQUIDATION DATE") of such liquidation, dissolution, winding-up or
distribution of assets, before any distribution of any part of the assets of the
Company among the holders of the Common Shares or any other shares ranking
junior to the Exchangeable Shares, an amount per share equal to the Exchangeable
Share Price applicable on the last Business Day prior to the Liquidation Date
(the "LIQUIDATION AMOUNT").


                                      1-10
<PAGE>   110
         5.2 On or promptly after the Liquidation Date, and subject to the
exercise by Callco of the Liquidation Call Right, the Company shall cause to be
delivered to the holders of the Exchangeable Shares the Liquidation Amount for
each such Exchangeable Share upon presentation and surrender of the certificates
representing such Exchangeable Shares, together with such other documents and
instruments as may be required to effect a transfer of Exchangeable Shares under
the CBCA and the articles and by-laws of the Company and such additional
documents and instruments as the Transfer Agent and the Company may reasonably
require, at the registered office of the Company or at any office of the
Transfer Agent as may be specified by the Company by notice to the holders of
the Exchangeable Shares. Payment of the total Liquidation Amount for such
Exchangeable Shares shall be made by delivery to each holder, at the address of
the holder recorded in the register of the Company for the Exchangeable Shares
or by holding for pick-up by the holder at the registered office of the Company
or at any office of the Transfer Agent as may be specified by the Company by
notice to the holders of Exchangeable Shares, on behalf of the Company of the
Exchangeable Share Consideration representing the total Liquidation Amount. On
and after the Liquidation Date, the holders of the Exchangeable Shares shall
cease to be holders of such Exchangeable Shares and shall not be entitled to
exercise any of the rights of holders in respect thereof (including any rights
under the Voting and Exchange Trust Agreement), other than the right to receive
their proportionate part of the total Liquidation Amount, unless payment of the
total Liquidation Amount for such Exchangeable Shares shall not be made upon
presentation and surrender of share certificates in accordance with the
foregoing provisions, in which case the rights of the holders shall remain
unaffected until the total Liquidation Amount to which such holders are entitled
shall have been paid to such holders in the manner hereinbefore provided. The
Company shall have the right at any time on or after the Liquidation Date to
deposit or cause to be deposited the Exchangeable Share Consideration in respect
of the Exchangeable Shares represented by certificates that have not at the
Liquidation Date been surrendered by the holders thereof in a custodial account
with any chartered bank or trust company in Canada. Upon such deposit being
made, the rights of the holders of Exchangeable Shares, after such deposit,
shall be limited to receiving their proportionate part of the total Liquidation
Amount for such Exchangeable Shares so deposited, against presentation and
surrender of the said certificates held by them, respectively, in accordance
with the foregoing provisions. Upon such payment or deposit of such Exchangeable
Share Consideration, the holders of the Exchangeable Shares shall thereafter be
considered and deemed for all purposes to be holders of the Duke Energy Common
Shares delivered to them or the custodian on their behalf.

         5.3 After the Company has satisfied its obligations to pay the holders
of the Exchangeable Shares the Liquidation Amount per Exchangeable Share
pursuant to Section 5.1 of these share provisions, such holders shall not be
entitled to share in any further distribution of the assets of the Company.

                                    ARTICLE 6

                   RETRACTION OF EXCHANGEABLE SHARES BY HOLDER

         6.1 A holder of Exchangeable Shares shall be entitled at any time,
subject to the exercise by Callco of the Retraction Call Right and otherwise
upon compliance with the provisions of this Article 6, to require the Company to
redeem any or all of the Exchangeable


                                      1-11
<PAGE>   111
Shares registered in the name of such holder for an amount per share equal to
the Exchangeable Share Price applicable on the last Business Day prior to the
Retraction Date (the "RETRACTION PRICE"), which shall be satisfied in full by
the Company causing to be delivered to such holder the Exchangeable Share
Consideration representing the Retraction Price. To effect such redemption, the
holder shall present and surrender at the registered office of the Company or at
any office of the Transfer Agent as may be specified by the Company by notice to
the holders of Exchangeable Shares, the certificate or certificates representing
the Exchangeable Shares which the holder desires to have the Company redeem,
together with such other documents and instruments as may be required to effect
a transfer of Exchangeable Shares under the CBCA and the articles and bylaws of
the Company and such additional documents and instruments as the Transfer Agent
and the Company may reasonably require, and together with a duly executed
statement (the "RETRACTION REQUEST") in the form of Schedule A hereto or in such
other form as may be acceptable to the Company:

               (a) specifying that the holder desires to have all or any number
specified therein of the Exchangeable Shares represented by such certificate or
certificates (the "RETRACTED SHARES") redeemed by the Company;

               (b) stating the Business Day on which the holder desires to have
the Company redeem the Retracted Shares (the "RETRACTION DATE"), provided that
the Retraction Date shall be not less than 10 Business Days nor more than 15
Business Days after the date on which the Retraction Request is received by the
Company and further provided that, in the event that no such Business Day is
specified by the holder in the Retraction Request, the Retraction Date shall be
deemed to be the 15th Business Day after the date on which the Retraction
Request is received by the Company; and

               (c) acknowledging the overriding right (the "RETRACTION CALL
RIGHT") of Callco to purchase all but not less than all the Retracted Shares
directly from the holder and that the Retraction Request shall be deemed to be a
revocable offer by the holder to sell the Retracted Shares to Callco in
accordance with the Retraction Call Right on the terms and conditions set out in
Section 6.3 below.

         6.2 Subject to the exercise by Callco of the Retraction Call Right,
upon receipt by the Company or the Transfer Agent in the manner specified in
Section 6.1 of a certificate or certificates representing the number of
Retracted Shares, together with a Retraction Request and such additional
documents and instruments as the Transfer Agent and the Company may reasonably
require, and provided that the Retraction Request is not revoked by the holder
in the manner specified in Section 6.7, the Company shall redeem the Retracted
Shares effective at the close of business on the Retraction Date and shall cause
to be delivered to such holder the total Retraction Price with respect to such
shares in accordance with Section 6.4. If only a part of the Exchangeable Shares
represented by any certificate is redeemed (or purchased by Callco pursuant to
the Retraction Call Right), a new certificate for the balance of such
Exchangeable Shares shall be issued to the holder at the expense of the Company.

         6.3 Upon receipt by the Company of a Retraction Request, the Company
shall immediately notify Callco thereof and shall provide to Callco a copy of
the Retraction Request. In order to exercise the Retraction Call Right, Callco
must notify the Company of its


                                      1-12
<PAGE>   112
determination to do so (the "CALLCO CALL NOTICE") within five Business Days of
notification to Callco by the Company of the receipt by the Company of the
Retraction Request. If Callco does not so notify the Company within such five
Business Day period, the Company will notify the holder as soon as possible
thereafter that Callco will not exercise the Retraction Call Right. If Callco
delivers the Callco Call Notice within such five Business Day period, and
provided that the Retraction Request is not revoked by the holder in the manner
specified in Section 6.7, the Retraction Request shall thereupon be considered
only to be an offer by the holder to sell all but not less than all the
Retracted Shares to Callco in accordance with the Retraction Call Right. In such
event, the Company shall not redeem the Retracted Shares and Callco shall
purchase from such holder and such holder shall sell to Callco on the Retraction
Date all but not less than all the Retracted Shares for a purchase price (the
"PURCHASE PRICE") per share equal to the Retraction Price, which, as set forth
in Section 6.4, shall be fully paid and satisfied by the delivery by or on
behalf of Callco, of the Exchangeable Share Consideration representing the total
Purchase Price. For the purposes of completing a purchase pursuant to the
Retraction Call Right, Callco shall deposit with the Transfer Agent, on or
before the Retraction Date, the Exchangeable Share Consideration representing
the total Purchase Price. Provided that Callco has complied with Section 6.4,
the closing of the purchase and sale of the Retracted Shares pursuant to the
Retraction Call Right shall be deemed to have occurred as at the close of
business on the Retraction Date and, for greater certainty, no redemption by the
Company of such Retracted Shares shall take place on the Retraction Date. In the
event that Callco does not deliver a CALLCO Call Notice within such five
Business Day period, and provided that the Retraction Request is not revoked by
the holder in the manner specified in Section 6.7, the Company shall redeem the
Retracted Shares on the Retraction Date and in the manner otherwise contemplated
in this Article 6.

         6.4 The Company or Callco, as the case may be, shall deliver or cause
the Transfer Agent to deliver to the relevant holder, at the address of the
holder recorded in the register of the Company for the Exchangeable Shares or at
the address specified in the holder's Retraction Request or by holding for
pick-up by the holder at the registered office of the Company or at any office
of the Transfer Agent as may be specified by the Company by notice to such
holder of Exchangeable Shares, the Exchangeable Share Consideration representing
the total Retraction Price or the total Purchase Price, as the case may be, and
such delivery of such Exchangeable Share Consideration to the Transfer Agent
shall be deemed to be payment of and shall satisfy and discharge all liability
for the total Retraction Price or total Purchase Price, as the case may be, to
the extent that the same is represented by such Exchangeable Share
Consideration.

         6.5 On and after the close of business on the Retraction Date, the
holder of the Retracted Shares shall cease to be a holder of such Retracted
Shares and shall not be entitled to exercise any of the rights of a holder in
respect thereof, other than the right to receive the total Retraction Price or
total Purchase Price, as the case may be, unless upon presentation and surrender
of certificates in accordance with the foregoing provisions, payment of the
total Retraction Price or the total Purchase Price, as the case may be, shall
not be made as provided in Section 6.4, in which case the rights of such holder
shall remain unaffected until the total Retraction Price or the total Purchase
Price, as the case may be, has been paid in the manner hereinbefore provided. On
and after the close of business on the Retraction Date, provided that
presentation and surrender of certificates and payment of the total Retraction
Price or the total Purchase Price, as the case may be, has been made in
accordance with the foregoing provisions,


                                      1-13
<PAGE>   113
the holder of the Retracted Shares so redeemed by the Company or purchased by
Callco shall thereafter be considered and deemed for all purposes to be the
holder of the Duke Energy Common Shares delivered to it.

         6.6 Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article 6, the Company
shall not be obligated to redeem Retracted Shares specified by a holder in a
Retraction Request to the extent that such redemption of Retracted Shares would
be contrary to solvency requirements or other provisions of applicable law. If
the Company believes that on any Retraction Date it would not be permitted by
any of such provisions to redeem the Retracted Shares tendered for redemption on
such date, and provided that Callco shall not have exercised the Retraction Call
Right with respect to the Retracted Shares, the Company shall only be obligated
to redeem Retracted Shares specified by a holder in a Retraction Request to the
extent of the maximum number that may be so redeemed (rounded down to a whole
number of shares) as would not be contrary to such provisions and shall notify
the holder at least two Business Days prior to the Retraction Date as to the
number of Retracted Shares which will not be redeemed by the Company. In any
case in which the redemption by the Company of Retracted Shares would be
contrary to solvency requirements or other provisions of applicable law, the
Company shall redeem the maximum number of Exchangeable Shares which the Board
of Directors determines the Company is permitted to redeem as of the Retraction
Date on a pro rata basis and shall issue to each holder of Retracted Shares a
new certificate, at the expense of the Company, representing the Retracted
Shares not redeemed by the Company pursuant to Section 6.2. Provided that the
Retraction Request is not revoked by the holder in the manner specified in
Section 6.7 and Callco does not exercise the Retraction Call Right, the holder
of any such Retracted Shares not redeemed by the Company pursuant to Section 6.2
as a result of solvency requirements or other provisions of applicable law shall
be deemed by giving the Retraction Request to have instructed the Trustee to
require Duke Energy to purchase such Retracted Shares from such holder on the
Retraction Date or as soon as practicable thereafter on payment by Duke Energy
to such holder of the Retraction Price for each such Retracted Share, all as
more specifically provided in the Voting and Exchange Trust Agreement.

         6.7 A holder of Retracted Shares may, by notice in writing given by the
holder to the Company before the close of business on the Business Day
immediately preceding the Retraction Date, withdraw its Retraction Request, in
which event such Retraction Request shall be null and void and, for greater
certainty, the revocable offer constituted by the Retraction Request to sell the
Retracted Shares to Callco shall be deemed to have been revoked.

                                    ARTICLE 7

                REDEMPTION OF EXCHANGEABLE SHARES BY THE COMPANY

         7.1 Subject to applicable law, and provided Callco has not exercised
the Redemption Call Right, the Company shall on the Redemption Date redeem all
but not less than all of the then outstanding Exchangeable Shares for an amount
per share equal to the Exchangeable Share Price applicable on the last Business
Day prior to the Redemption Date (the "REDEMPTION PRICE").



                                      1-14
<PAGE>   114
         7.2 In any case of a redemption of Exchangeable Shares under this
Article 7, the Company shall, at least 45 days before the Redemption Date (other
than a Redemption Date established in connection with a Duke Energy Control
Transaction, an Exchangeable Share Voting Event or an Exempt Exchangeable Share
Voting Event), send or cause to be sent to each holder of Exchangeable Shares a
notice in writing of the redemption by the Company or the purchase by Callco
under the Redemption Call Right, as the case may be, of the Exchangeable Shares
held by such holder. In the case of a Redemption Date established in connection
with a Duke Energy Control Transaction, an Exchangeable Share Voting Event or an
Exempt Exchangeable Share Voting Event, the written notice of redemption by the
Company or the purchase by Callco under the Redemption Call Right will be sent
on or before the Redemption Date, on as many days prior written notice as may be
determined by the Board of Directors to be reasonably practicable in the
circumstances. In any such case, such notice shall set out the formula for
determining the Redemption Price or the Redemption Call Purchase Price, as the
case may be, the Redemption Date and, if applicable, particulars of the
Redemption Call Right. In the case of any notice given in connection with a
possible Redemption Date, such notice will be given contingently and will be
withdrawn if the contingency does not occur.

         7.3 On or after the Redemption Date and subject to the exercise by
Callco of the Redemption Call Right, the Company shall cause to be delivered to
the holders of the Exchangeable Shares to be redeemed the Redemption Price for
each such Exchangeable Share upon presentation and surrender at the registered
office of the Company or at any office of the Transfer Agent as may be specified
by the Company in the notice described in Section 7.2 of the certificates
representing such Exchangeable Shares, together with such other documents and
instruments as may be required to effect a transfer of Exchangeable Shares under
the CBCA and the articles and by-laws of the Company and such additional
documents and instruments as the Transfer Agent and the Company may reasonably
require. Payment of the total Redemption Price for such Exchangeable Shares
shall be made by delivery to each holder, at the address of the holder recorded
in the securities register of the Company or by holding for pick-up by the
holder at the registered office of the Company or at any office of the Transfer
Agent as may be specified by the Company in such notice, on behalf of the
Company of the Exchangeable Share Consideration representing the total
Redemption Price. On and after the Redemption Date, the holders of the
Exchangeable Shares called for redemption shall cease to be holders of such
Exchangeable Shares and shall not be entitled to exercise any of the rights of
holders in respect thereof, other than the right to receive their proportionate
part of the total Redemption Price, unless payment of the total Redemption Price
for such Exchangeable Shares shall not be made upon presentation and surrender
of certificates in accordance with the foregoing provisions, in which case the
rights of the holders shall remain unaffected until the total Redemption Price
has been paid in the manner hereinbefore provided. The Company shall have the
right at any time after the sending of notice of its intention to redeem the
Exchangeable Shares as aforesaid to deposit or cause to be deposited the
Exchangeable Share Consideration with respect to the Exchangeable Shares so
called for redemption, or of such of the said Exchangeable Shares represented by
certificates that have not at the date of such deposit been surrendered by the
holders thereof in connection with such redemption, in a custodial account with
any chartered bank or trust company in Canada named in such notice. Upon the
later of such deposit being made and the Redemption Date, the Exchangeable
Shares in respect whereof such deposit shall have been made shall be redeemed
and the rights of the holders thereof after such deposit or Redemption Date, as
the case may be, shall be limited to receiving their proportionate part of the


                                      1-15
<PAGE>   115
total Redemption Price for such Exchangeable Shares so deposited, against
presentation and surrender of the said certificates held by them, respectively,
in accordance with the foregoing provisions. Upon such payment or deposit of
such Exchangeable Share Consideration, the holders of the Exchangeable Shares
shall thereafter be considered and deemed for all purposes to be holders of the
Duke Energy Common Shares delivered to them or the custodian on their behalf.

                                    ARTICLE 8

                            PURCHASE FOR CANCELLATION

         8.1 Subject to applicable law and the articles of the Company and
notwithstanding Section 8.2, the Company may at any time and from time to time
purchase for cancellation all or any part of the Exchangeable Shares by private
agreement with any holder of Exchangeable Shares.

         8.2 Subject to applicable law and the articles of the Company, the
Company may at any time and from time to time purchase for cancellation all or
any part of the outstanding Exchangeable Shares by tender to all the holders of
record of Exchangeable Shares then outstanding or through the facilities of any
stock exchange on which the Exchangeable Shares are listed or quoted at any
price per share together with an amount equal to all declared and unpaid
dividends thereon for which the record date has occurred prior to the date of
purchase. If in response to an invitation for tenders under the provisions of
this Section 8.2, more Exchangeable Shares are tendered at a price or prices
acceptable to the Company than the Company is prepared to purchase, the
Exchangeable Shares to be purchased by the Company shall be purchased as nearly
as may be pro rata according to the number of shares tendered by each holder who
submits a tender to the Company, provided that when shares are tendered at
different prices, the pro rating shall be effected (disregarding fractions) only
with respect to the shares tendered at the price at which more shares were
tendered than the Company is prepared to purchase after the Company has
purchased all the shares tendered at lower prices. If only part of the
Exchangeable Shares represented by any certificate shall be purchased, a new
certificate for the balance of such shares shall be issued at the expense of the
Company.

                                    ARTICLE 9

                                  VOTING RIGHTS

         9.1 Except as required by applicable law and by Article 10, Section
11.1 and Section 12.2, the holders of the Exchangeable Shares shall not be
entitled as such to receive notice of or to attend any meeting of the
shareholders of the Company or to vote at any such meeting.

                                   ARTICLE 10

                             AMENDMENT AND APPROVAL

         10.1 The rights, privileges, restrictions and conditions attaching to
the Exchangeable Shares may be added to, changed or removed but only with the
approval of the holders of the Exchangeable Shares given as hereinafter
specified.

         10.2 Any approval given by the holders of the Exchangeable Shares to
add to, change or remove any right, privilege, restriction or condition
attaching to the Exchangeable Shares or any other matter requiring the approval

         13.1 The certificates evidencing the Exchangeable Shares shall contain
or have affixed thereto a legend in form and on terms approved by the Board of
Directors, with respect to the Support Agreement, the provisions of the Plan of
Arrangement relating to the Liquidation Call Right and the Redemption Call
Right, and the Voting and Exchange Trust Agreement (including the provisions
with respect to the voting rights, exchange right and automatic exchange
thereunder) and the Retraction Call Right.

         13.2 Each holder of an Exchangeable Share, whether of record or
beneficial, by virtue of becoming and being such a holder shall be deemed to
acknowledge each of the Liquidation Call Right, the Retraction Call Right and
the Redemption Call Right, in each case, in favour of Callco, and the overriding
nature thereof in connection with the liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of
the Company or any other distribution of the assets of the Company among its

redemption of Exchangeable Shares, as the case may be, and to be bound thereby

         13.3 The Company, Callco, Duke Energy and the Transfer Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from any dividend or consideration otherwise
payable to any holder of Exchangeable Shares such amounts as the Company,
Callco, Duke Energy or the Transfer Agent is required to deduct and withhold
with respect to such payment under the Income Tax Act (Canada), the United
States Internal Revenue Code of 1986 or any provision of provincial, state,

that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes hereof as having been paid to the holder of the Exchangeable Shares in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made, provided that such
withheld amounts are actually remitted to the appropriate taxing authority. To
the extent that the amount so required or permitted to be deducted or withheld
from any payment to a holder exceeds the cash portion of the consideration
otherwise payable to the holder, the Company, Callco, Duke Energy and the
Transfer Agent are hereby authorized to sell or otherwise dispose of such
portion of the consideration as is necessary to provide sufficient funds to the
Company, Callco, Duke Energy or the Transfer Agent, as the case may be, to
enable it to comply with such deduction or withholding requirement and the
Company, Callco, Duke Energy or the Transfer Agent shall notify the holder
thereof and remit any unapplied balance of the net proceeds of such sale.

              Shares in exchange for outstanding Westcoast Common Shares
              pursuant to the Arrangement).

         Duke Energy covenants that if any Duke Energy Common Shares (or other
shares or securities into which Duke Energy Common Shares may be reclassified or

Shares held by the Trustee) to be issued and delivered hereunder (including for
greater certainty, pursuant to the Exchangeable Share Provisions, or pursuant to
the Exchange Right or the Automatic Exchange Rights (all as defined in the
Voting and Exchange Trust Agreement)) require registration or qualification

any Canadian or United States federal, provincial, territorial or state
securities or other law or regulation or pursuant to the rules and regulations
of any securities or other regulatory authority, or the fulfillment of any other
United States or Canadian legal requirement (collectively, the "APPLICABLE
LAWS") before such shares (or other shares or securities into which Duke Energy
Common Shares may be reclassified or changed as contemplated by Section 2.7
hereof) may be issued and delivered by Duke Energy at the direction of
Exchangeco or Callco, if applicable, to the holder of surrendered Exchangeable
Shares or in order that such shares (or other shares or securities into which
Duke Energy Common Shares may be reclassified or changed as contemplated by
Section 2.7 hereof) may be freely traded thereafter (other than any restrictions
of general application on transfer by reason of a holder being a "control

faith expeditiously

qualified or approved under United States and/or Canadian law, as the case may
be, to the extent expressly provided in the Combination Agreement. Duke Energy

such actions and do all such things as are reasonably necessary or desirable to
cause all Duke Energy Common Shares (or other shares or securities into which
Duke Energy Common Shares may be reclassified or changed as contemplated by

2.7      ECONOMIC EQUIVALENCE

         So long as any Exchangeable Shares not owned by Duke Energy or its
Affiliates are outstanding:

                    than an issue of Duke Energy Common Shares (or securities
                    exchangeable for or convertible into or carrying rights to
                    acquire Duke Energy Common Shares) to holders of Duke Energy
                    Common Shares who (A) exercise an option to receive

                    Energy Common Shares), (B) rights, options or warrants

                    of Duke Energy,

              unless the economic equivalent on a per share basis of such
              rights, options, warrants, securities, shares, evidences of
              indebtedness or other assets is issued or distributed
              simultaneously to holders of the Exchangeable Shares.

         (b)  Duke Energy will not without the prior approval of Exchangeco and
              the prior approval of the holders of the Exchangeable Shares given
              in accordance with Section 10.2 of the Exchangeable Share
              Provisions:

              (i)   subdivide, redivide or change the then outstanding Duke
                    Energy Common Shares into a greater number of Duke Energy
                    Common Shares; or

              (ii)  reduce, combine, consolidate or change the then outstanding
                    Duke Energy Common Shares into a lesser number of Duke
                    Energy Common Shares; or

              (iii) reclassify or otherwise change Duke Energy Common Shares or
                    effect an amalgamation, merger, reorganization or other
                    transaction affecting the Duke Energy Common Shares,

              unless the same or an economically equivalent change shall
              simultaneously be made to, or in the rights of the holders of, the
              Exchangeable Shares.

         (c)  Duke Energy will ensure that the record date for any event
              referred to in Section 2.7(a) or 2.7(b) above, or (if no record
              date is applicable for such event) the effective date for any such
              event, is not less than five Business Days after the date on which
              such event is declared or announced by Duke Energy (with
              contemporaneous notification thereof by Duke Energy to
              Exchangeco).

         (d)  The Board of Directors of Exchangeco shall determine, in good
              faith and in its sole discretion, economic equivalence for the
              purposes of any event referred to in Section 2.7(a) or 2.7(b)
              above and each such determination shall be conclusive and binding
              on Duke Energy. In making each such determination, the following
              factors shall, without excluding other factors determined by the
              Board of Directors of Exchangeco to be relevant, be considered by
              the Board of Directors of Exchangeco:

              (i)   in the case of any stock dividend or other distribution
                    payable in Duke Energy Common Shares, the number of such

                    options or warrants to subscribe for or purchase Duke Energy
                    Common Shares (or securities exchangeable for or convertible
                    into or carrying rights to acquire Duke Energy Common
                    Shares), the relationship between the exercise price of each

                    of Duke Energy or any assets of Duke Energy), the

                    consequences to holders of Duke Energy Common Shares as a
                    result of differences between taxation laws of Canada and
                    the United States (except for any differing consequences
                    arising as a result of differing marginal taxation rates and
                    without regard to the individual circumstances of holders of

              from Duke Energy, Exchangeco will use its best efforts to take or
              cause to be taken such steps as may be necessary for the purposes
              of ensuring that appropriate dividends are paid or other
              distributions are made by Exchangeco, or subdivisions, redivisions
              or changes are made to the Exchangeable Shares, in order to
              implement the required economic equivalent with respect to the
              Duke Energy Common Shares and Exchangeable Shares as provided for
              in this Section 2.7.

2.8      TENDER OFFERS

         In the event that a tender offer, share exchange offer, issuer bid,
take-over bid or similar transaction with respect to Duke Energy Common Shares
(an "OFFER") is proposed by Duke Energy or is proposed to Duke Energy or its
shareholders and is recommended by the Board of Directors of Duke Energy, or is
otherwise effected or to be effected with the consent or approval of the Board
of Directors of Duke Energy, and the Exchangeable Shares are not redeemed by
Exchangeco or purchased by Callco pursuant to the Redemption Call Right, Duke
Energy will use its reasonable best efforts expeditiously and in good faith to
take all such actions and do all such things as are necessary or desirable to
enable and permit holders of Exchangeable Shares (other than Duke Energy and its
Affiliates) to participate in such Offer to the same extent and on an
economically equivalent basis as the holders of Duke Energy Common Shares,
without

discrimination. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Duke Energy
will use its reasonable best efforts expeditiously and in good faith to ensure
that holders of Exchangeable Shares may participate in each such Offer without
being required to retract Exchangeable Shares as against Exchangeco (or, if so
required, to ensure that any such retraction, shall be effective only upon, and
shall be conditional upon, the closing of such Offer and only to the extent
necessary to tender or deposit to the Offer). Nothing herein shall affect the
rights of Exchangeco to redeem (or Callco to purchase pursuant to the Redemption
Call Right) Exchangeable Shares, as applicable, in the event of a Duke Energy
Control Transaction.

2.9      OWNERSHIP OF OUTSTANDING SHARES

         Without the prior approval of Exchangeco and the prior approval of the
holders of the Exchangeable Shares given in accordance with Section 10.2 of the
Exchangeable Share Provisions, Duke Energy covenants and agrees in favour of
Exchangeco that, as long as any outstanding Exchangeable Shares are owned by any
Person other than Duke Energy or any of its Affiliates, Duke Energy will be and
remain the direct or indirect beneficial owner of all issued and outstanding
voting shares in the capital of Exchangeco and Callco. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Duke Energy shall not be in violation of this section if any person
or group of persons acting jointly or in concert acquires all or substantially
all of the assets of Duke Energy or the Duke Energy Common Shares pursuant to
any merger of Duke Energy pursuant to which Duke Energy was not the surviving
corporation.

2.10     DUKE ENERGY AND AFFILIATES NOT TO VOTE EXCHANGEABLE SHARES

         Duke Energy covenants and agrees that it will appoint and cause to be
appointed proxyholders with respect to any Exchangeable Shares held by it and
its Affiliates for the sole purpose of attending each meeting of holders of
Exchangeable Shares in order to be counted as part of the quorum for each such
meeting. Duke Energy further covenants and agrees that it will not, and will
cause its Affiliates not to, exercise any voting rights which may be exercisable
by holders of Exchangeable Shares from time to time pursuant to the Exchangeable
Share Provisions or pursuant to the provisions of the CBCA (or any successor or
other corporate statute by which Exchangeco may in the future be governed) with
respect to any Exchangeable Shares held by it or by its Affiliates in respect of
any matter considered at any meeting of holders of Exchangeable Shares.

2.11     RULE L0B-18 PURCHASES

         For greater certainty, nothing contained in this Agreement, including
the obligations of Duke Energy contained in Section 2.8 hereof, shall limit the
ability of Duke Energy or Exchangeco to make a "Rule 10b-18 purchase" of Duke
Energy Common Shares pursuant to Rule 10b-18 of the United States Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any successor rule.

2.12     STOCK EXCHANGE LISTING

         Duke Energy covenants and agrees in favour of Exchangeco that, as long
as any outstanding Exchangeable Shares are owned by any Person other than Duke
Energy or any of its

3.1      CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS IN RESPECT OF COMBINATION, ETC.

         Duke Energy shall not consummate any transaction (whether by way of
reconstruction, reorganization, consolidation, merger, transfer, sale, lease or
otherwise) whereby all or substantially all of its undertaking, property and
assets would become the property of any other Person or, in the case of a
merger, of the continuing corporation resulting therefrom unless, but may do so
if:

         (a)  such other Person or continuing corporation (the "DUKE ENERGY
              SUCCESSOR") by operation of law, becomes, without more, bound by

                  power or authority to sell, transfer, vote or otherwise deal
                  in or with such Duke Energy Common Shares and such Duke Energy
                  Common Shares shall not be used or disposed of by the Trustee
                  for any purpose other than the purposes for which this Trust
                  is created pursuant to this Agreement.

                  ENERGY

         In connection with the exchange by a holder or redemption or retraction
of Exchangeable Shares from time to time for Duke Energy Common Shares, the
Trustee shall concurrently therewith distribute to Duke Energy such Duke Energy
Common Shares from the Trust Estate equal to the number of Exchangeable Shares
exchanged by such holder for Duke Energy Common Shares. Upon receipt of any
dividend or other distribution on the Duke Energy Common Shares (except to the
extent such dividend or distribution is paid in Duke Energy Common Shares), the
Trustee shall immediately transfer such dividend or distribution to Duke Energy;
provided, however, that the Trustee may not transfer any dividend or
distribution on the Duke Energy Common Shares held by the Trustee to Duke Energy
pursuant to the preceding clause until such time as an Equivalent Dividend (as
defined in the Support Agreement) is declared and paid on the Exchangeable
Shares.

         (b)      to the extent that no instructions are received from a
                  Beneficiary with respect to the Voting Rights to which such

                  pursuant to Section 4.7, to attend such Duke Energy Meeting
                  and to exercise personally thereat the Beneficiary Votes of
                  such Beneficiary;

         (d)      a statement that if no such instructions are received from the

         (e)      a form of direction whereby the Beneficiary may so direct and

         (f)      a statement of the time and date by which such instructions
                  must be received by the Trustee in order to be binding upon
                  it, which in the case of a Duke Energy Meeting shall not be
                  earlier than the close of business on the second Business Day
                  prior to such meeting, and of the method for revoking or
                  amending such instructions.

         For the purpose of determining Beneficiary Votes to which a Beneficiary
is entitled in respect of any Duke Energy Meeting or Duke Energy Consent, the
number of Exchangeable Shares owned of record by the Beneficiary shall be
determined at the close of business on the record date established by Duke
Energy or by applicable law for purposes of determining shareholders entitled to

such Duke Energy Consent. Duke Energy will notify the Trustee of any decision of
the Board of Directors of Duke Energy with respect to the calling of any Duke
Energy Meeting or the seeking of any Duke Energy Consent and shall provide all
necessary information and materials to the Trustee in each case promptly and in
any event in sufficient time to enable the Trustee to perform its obligations
contemplated by this Section 4.3.

materials to be provided to the Trustee are provided in sufficient time to
permit the Trustee to comment as aforesaid and to send all materials to each
Beneficiary at the same time as such materials are first sent to holders of Duke
Energy Common Shares. Duke Energy agrees not to communicate with holders of Duke
Energy Common Shares with respect to the materials referred to in this Section
4.3 otherwise than by mail unless such method of communication is also
reasonably available to the Trustee for communication with the Beneficiaries.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Duke Energy may at its option exercise the duties
of the Trustee to deliver copies of all materials to each Beneficiary as
required by this Section 4.3 so long as in each case Duke Energy delivers a
certificate to the Trustee stating that Duke Energy has undertaken to perform
the obligations set forth in this Section 4.3.

         4.4      COPIES OF SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION

         Duke Energy will deliver to the Trustee copies of all proxy materials

case, are to be distributed from time to time to holders of Duke Energy Common
Shares in sufficient quantities and in sufficient time so as to enable the
Trustee to send those materials to each Beneficiary, to the extent possible, at
the same time as such materials are first sent to holders of Duke Energy Common
Shares. The Trustee will mail or otherwise send to each Beneficiary, at the
expense of Duke Energy, copies of all such materials (and all materials
specifically directed to the Beneficiaries or to the Trustee for the benefit of
the Beneficiaries by Duke Energy) received by the Trustee from Duke Energy, to
the extent possible, at the same time as such materials are sent to holders of
Duke Energy Common Shares. The Trustee will make copies of all such materials
available for inspection by any Beneficiary at the Trustee's principal office in
___________. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Duke Energy at its option may
exercise the duties of the Trustee to deliver copies of all materials to each
Beneficiary as required by this Section 4.4 so long as in each case Duke Energy
delivers a certificate to the Trustee stating that Duke Energy has undertaken to
perform the obligations set forth in this Section 4.4.

         4.5      OTHER MATERIALS

         As soon as reasonably practicable after receipt by Duke Energy or
holders of Duke Energy Common Shares (if such receipt is known by Duke Energy)
of any material sent or given by or on behalf of a third party to holders of
Duke Energy Common Shares generally, including dissident proxy and information
circulars (and related information and material) and tender and exchange offer
circulars (and related information and material), Duke Energy shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain and deliver to the Trustee copies thereof in
sufficient quantities so as to enable the Trustee to forward such material
(unless the same has been provided directly to Beneficiaries by such third
party) to each Beneficiary as soon as possible thereafter. As soon as reasonably
practicable after receipt thereof, the Trustee will mail or otherwise send to
each Beneficiary, at the expense of Duke Energy, copies of all such materials
received by the Trustee from Duke Energy. The Trustee will also make available

foregoing, Duke Energy at its option may exercise the duties of the Trustee to

         Exchangeco shall, (a) prior to each annual and special Duke Energy

arranged in alphabetical order and showing the number of Exchangeable Shares

the close of business on the record date established by Duke Energy or pursuant

be delivered to the Trustee promptly after receipt by Exchangeco of such request
or the record date for such meeting or seeking of consent, as the case may be,
and in any event within sufficient time as to permit the Trustee to perform its
obligations under this Agreement. Duke Energy agrees to give Exchangeco notice

seeking of any Duke Energy Consent by Duke Energy or its management, together
with the record dates therefor, sufficiently prior to the date of the calling of
such meeting or seeking of such consent so as to enable Exchangeco to perform

                  any lesser number thereof as may be set forth in the
                  instructions); provided, however, that such written
                  instructions are received by the Trustee from the Beneficiary
                  prior to the time and date fixed by the Trustee for receipt of

                  it to sign and deliver, on behalf of the Trustee, proxies for
                  Voting Rights to attend each Duke Energy Meeting. Upon
                  submission by a Beneficiary (or its designee) of
                  identification satisfactory to the Trustee's representative,
                  and at the Beneficiary's request, such representative shall
                  sign and deliver to such Beneficiary (or its designee) a proxy
                  to exercise personally the Beneficiary Votes as to which such
                  Beneficiary is otherwise entitled hereunder to direct the
                  vote, if such Beneficiary either (i) has not previously given
                  the Trustee instructions pursuant to Section 4.3 in respect of
                  such meeting or (ii) submits to such representative written
                  revocation of any such previous instructions. At such meeting,
                  upon receipt of a proxy from the Trustee's representative, the
                  Beneficiary exercising such Beneficiary Votes shall have the
                  same rights as the Trustee to speak at the meeting in respect
                  of any matter, question, proposal or proposition, to vote by

         Any written materials distributed by or on behalf of the Trustee
pursuant to this Agreement shall be sent by mail (or otherwise communicated in
the same manner as Duke Energy utilizes in communications to holders of Duke
Energy Common Shares, subject to applicable regulatory requirements and provided
such manner of communications is reasonably available to the Trustee) to each
Beneficiary at its address as shown on the books of Exchangeco. Duke Energy
agrees not to communicate with holders of Duke Energy Common Shares with respect
to such written material otherwise than by mail unless such method of
communication is also reasonably available to the Trustee for communication with
the Beneficiaries. Exchangeco shall provide or cause to be provided to the
Trustee for purposes of communication, on a timely basis and without charge or
other expense:

deliver copies of materials to each Beneficiary and Exchangeco provides the
required information and materials to Duke Energy.

         4.10     TERMINATION OF VOTING RIGHTS

         Except as otherwise provided herein or in the Exchangeable Share
Provisions, all of the rights of a Beneficiary with respect to the Beneficiary

to the Trustee for delivery to the Beneficiaries), or upon the redemption of
Exchangeable Shares pursuant to Article 6 or Article 7 of the Exchangeable Share
Provisions, or upon the effective date of the liquidation, dissolution or

         Duke Energy hereby grants to the Trustee as trustee for and on behalf
of, and for the use and benefit of, the Beneficiaries the right (the "EXCHANGE
RIGHT"), upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Insolvency Event,
to require Duke Energy to purchase from each or any Beneficiary all or any part

hereby acknowledges receipt from the Trustee as trustee for and on behalf of the
Beneficiaries of good and valuable consideration (and the adequacy thereof) for
the grant of the Exchange Right and the Automatic Exchange Rights by Duke Energy
to the Trustee. During the term of the Trust and subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, the Trustee shall possess and be vested with full
legal ownership of the Exchange Right and the Automatic Exchange Rights and
shall be entitled to exercise all of the rights and powers of an owner with
respect to the Exchange Right and the Automatic Exchange Rights, provided that
the Trustee shall:

         (a)      hold the Exchange Right and the Automatic Exchange Rights and
                  the legal title thereto as trustee solely for the use and
                  benefit of the Beneficiaries in accordance with the provisions
                  of this Agreement; and

                  power or authority to exercise or otherwise deal in or with
                  the Exchange Right or the Automatic Exchange Rights, and the
                  Trustee shall not exercise any such rights for any purpose
                  other than the purposes for which the Trust is created
                  pursuant to this Agreement.

         5.2      LEGENDED SHARE CERTIFICATES

         Exchangeco will cause each certificate representing Exchangeable Shares
to bear an appropriate legend notifying the Beneficiaries of:

         (a)      their right to instruct the Trustee with respect to the
                  exercise of the Exchange Right in respect of the Exchangeable
                  Shares held by a Beneficiary; and

         (b)      the Automatic Exchange Rights.

         5.3      GENERAL EXERCISE OF EXCHANGE RIGHT

         The Exchange Right shall be and remain vested in and exercisable by the
Trustee. Subject to Section 6.15, the Trustee shall exercise the Exchange Right
only on the basis of instructions received pursuant to this Article 5 from
Beneficiaries entitled to instruct the Trustee as to the exercise thereof. To
the extent that no instructions are received from a Beneficiary with respect to
the Exchange Right, the Trustee shall not exercise or permit the exercise of the
Exchange Right.

         5.4      PURCHASE PRICE

         The purchase price payable by Duke Energy for each Exchangeable Share
to be purchased by Duke Energy under the Exchange Right shall be an amount per
share equal to the Exchangeable Share Price on the last Business Day prior to
the day of closing of the purchase and sale of such Exchangeable Share under the
Exchange Right. In connection with each exercise of the Exchange Right, Duke
Energy shall provide to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate setting forth the
calculation of the Exchangeable Share Price for each Exchangeable Share. The
Exchangeable Share Price for each such Exchangeable Share so purchased may be
satisfied only by Duke Energy delivering or causing to be delivered to the
Trustee, on behalf of the relevant Beneficiary, the Exchangeable Share
Consideration representing the total Exchangeable Share Price. Upon payment by
Duke Energy of such purchase price to the Trustee for the benefit of the
Beneficiary, the relevant Beneficiary shall cease to have any right to be paid
any amount in respect of declared and unpaid dividends on each such Exchangeable
Share by Exchangeco.

         5.5      EXERCISE INSTRUCTIONS

         Subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth, a Beneficiary
shall be entitled, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an
Insolvency Event, to instruct the Trustee to exercise the Exchange Right with
respect to all or any part of the Exchangeable Shares registered in the name of
such Beneficiary on the books of Exchangeco. To cause the exercise of the
Exchange Right by the Trustee, the Beneficiary shall deliver to the Trustee, in
person or by certified or registered mail, at its principal office in _________
or at such other places in Canada as the Trustee may from time to time designate
by written notice to the Beneficiaries, the certificates representing the
Exchangeable Shares which such Beneficiary desires Duke Energy to purchase, duly
endorsed in blank for transfer, and accompanied by such other documents and
instruments as may be required to effect a transfer of Exchangeable Shares under

duly completed form of notice of exercise of the Exchange Right, contained on
the reverse of or attached to the Exchangeable Share certificates, stating (i)

Right so as to require Duke Energy to purchase from the Beneficiary the number

title to and owns all such Exchangeable Shares to be acquired by Duke Energy

Exchangeable Shares represented by any certificate or certificates delivered to
the Trustee are to be purchased by Duke Energy under the Exchange Right, a new
certificate for the balance of such Exchangeable Shares shall be issued to the
holder at the expense of Exchangeco.

         5.6      DELIVERY OF DUKE ENERGY COMMON SHARES; EFFECT OF EXERCISE

         Promptly after the receipt by the Trustee of the certificates
representing the Exchangeable Shares which the Beneficiary desires Duke Energy
to purchase under the Exchange Right, together with such documents and
instruments of transfer and a duly completed form of notice of exercise of the
Exchange Right (and payment of taxes, if any payable as contemplated by Section
5.8 or evidence thereof), duly endorsed for transfer to Duke Energy, the Trustee
shall notify Duke Energy and Exchangeco of its receipt of the same, which notice
to Duke Energy and Exchangeco shall constitute exercise of the Exchange Right by
the Trustee on behalf of the Beneficiary in respect of such Exchangeable Shares,
and Duke Energy shall promptly thereafter deliver or cause to be delivered to
the Trustee, for delivery to the Beneficiary in respect of such Exchangeable
Shares (or to such other persons, if any, properly designated by such
Beneficiary) the Exchangeable Share Consideration deliverable in connection with
the exercise of the Exchange Right; provided, however, that no such delivery
shall be made unless and until the Beneficiary requesting the same shall have
paid (or provided evidence satisfactory to the Trustee, Exchangeco and Duke
Energy of the payment of) the taxes (if any) payable as contemplated by Section
5.8 of this Agreement. Immediately upon the giving of notice by the Trustee to
Duke Energy and Exchangeco of the exercise of the Exchange Right, as provided in
this Section 5.6, the closing of the transaction of purchase and sale
contemplated by the Exchange Right shall be deemed to have occurred, and the
Beneficiary of such Exchangeable Shares shall be deemed to have transferred to
Duke Energy all of such Beneficiary's right, title and interest in and to such
Exchangeable Shares and in the related interest in the Trust Estate and shall
cease to be a holder of such Exchangeable Shares and shall not be entitled to
exercise any of the rights of a holder in respect thereof, other than the right
to receive his proportionate part of the total purchase price therefor, unless
such Exchangeable Share Consideration is not delivered by Duke Energy to the
Trustee for delivery to such Beneficiary (or to such other person, if any,
properly designated by such Beneficiary) within five Business Days of the date
of the giving of such notice by the Trustee, in which case the rights of the
Beneficiary shall remain unaffected until such Exchangeable Share Consideration
is delivered by Duke Energy and any cheque included therein

is paid. Upon delivery of such Exchangeable Share Consideration by Duke Energy
to the Trustee, the Trustee shall deliver such Exchangeable Share Consideration
to such Beneficiary (or to such other person, if any, properly designated by
such Beneficiary). Concurrently with such Beneficiary ceasing to be a holder of
Exchangeable Shares, the Beneficiary shall be considered and deemed for all
purposes to be the holder of the Duke Energy Common Shares delivered to it
pursuant to the Exchange Right.

         5.7      EXERCISE OF EXCHANGE RIGHT SUBSEQUENT TO RETRACTION

         In the event that a Beneficiary has exercised its right under Article 6
of the Exchangeable Share Provisions to require Exchangeco to redeem any or all
of the Exchangeable Shares held by the Beneficiary (the "RETRACTED SHARES") and
is notified by Exchangeco pursuant to Section 6.6 of the Exchangeable Share
Provisions that Exchangeco will not be permitted as a result of solvency
requirements of applicable law to redeem all such Retracted Shares, and provided
that Callco shall not have exercised the Retraction Call Right with respect to
the Retracted Shares and that the Beneficiary has not revoked the retraction
request delivered by the Beneficiary to Exchangeco pursuant to Section 6.7 of
the Exchangeable Share Provisions, and provided further that the Trustee has
received written notice of same from Exchangeco or Duke Energy, the retraction
request will constitute and will be deemed to constitute notice from the
Beneficiary to the Trustee instructing the Trustee to exercise the Exchange
Right with respect to those Retracted Shares that Exchangeco is unable to
redeem. In any such event, Exchangeco hereby agrees with the Trustee and in
favour of the Beneficiary promptly to forward or cause to be forwarded to the
Trustee all relevant materials delivered by the Beneficiary to Exchangeco or to
the transfer agent of the Exchangeable Shares (including a copy of the
retraction request delivered pursuant to Section 6.1 of the Exchangeable Share
Provisions) in connection with such proposed redemption of the Retracted Shares
and the Trustee will thereupon exercise the Exchange Right with respect to the
Retracted Shares that Exchangeco is not permitted to redeem and will require
Duke Energy to purchase such shares in accordance with the provisions of this
Article 5.

         5.8      STAMP OR OTHER TRANSFER TAXES

         Upon any sale of Exchangeable Shares to Duke Energy pursuant to the
Exchange Right or the Automatic Exchange Rights, the share certificate or
certificates representing Duke Energy Common Shares to be delivered in
connection with the payment of the purchase price therefor shall be issued in
the name of the Beneficiary in respect of the Exchangeable Shares so sold or in
such names as such Beneficiary may otherwise direct in writing without charge to
the holder of the Exchangeable Shares so sold; provided, however, that such
Beneficiary (a) shall pay (and none of Duke Energy, Exchangeco or the Trustee
shall be required to pay) any documentary, stamp, transfer or other taxes that
may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issuance or delivery
of such shares to a person other than such Beneficiary or (b) shall have
evidenced to the satisfaction of the Trustee, Duke Energy and Exchangeco that
such taxes, if any, have been paid.

         5.9      NOTICE OF INSOLVENCY EVENT

         As soon as practicable following the occurrence of an Insolvency Event
or any event that with the giving of notice or the passage of time or both would
be an Insolvency Event, Exchangeco and Duke Energy shall give written notice
thereof to the Trustee. As soon as practicable following the receipt of notice
from Exchangeco and Duke Energy of the occurrence of an Insolvency Event, or
upon the Trustee becoming aware of an Insolvency Event, the Trustee will mail to
each Beneficiary, at the expense of Duke Energy (such funds to be received in
advance), a notice of such Insolvency Event in the form provided by Duke Energy,
which notice shall contain a brief statement of the rights of the Beneficiaries
with respect to the Exchange Right.

         5.10     QUALIFICATION OF DUKE ENERGY COMMON SHARES

         Duke Energy covenants that if any Duke Energy Common Shares to be
issued and delivered pursuant to the Exchange Right or the Automatic Exchange
Rights require registration or qualification with or approval of or the filing
of any document, including any prospectus or similar document, or the taking of
any proceeding with or the obtaining of any order, ruling or consent from any
governmental or regulatory authority under any Canadian or United States
federal, provincial, territorial or state law or regulation or pursuant to the
rules and regulations of any regulatory authority or the fulfillment of any
other Canadian or United States federal, provincial, territorial or state legal
requirement before such shares may be issued and delivered by Duke Energy to the
initial holder thereof or in order that such shares may be freely traded
thereafter (other than any restrictions of general application on transfer by
reason of a holder being a "control person" of Duke Energy for purposes of
Canadian provincial securities law or an "affiliate" of Duke Energy for purposes
of United States federal or state securities law), Duke Energy will in good
faith take all such actions and do all such things as are necessary or desirable
to cause such Duke Energy Common Shares to be and remain duly registered,
qualified or approved under United States and/or Canadian law, as the case may
be, to the extent expressly provided in the Combination Agreement. Duke Energy
will use its reasonable best efforts and in good faith expeditiously take all
such actions and do all such things as are reasonably necessary or desirable to
cause all Duke Energy Common Shares to be delivered pursuant to the Exchange
Right or the Automatic Exchange Rights to be listed, quoted or posted for
trading on all stock exchanges and quotation systems on which outstanding Duke
Energy Common Shares are listed, quoted or posted for trading at such time.

         5.11     DUKE ENERGY COMMON SHARES

         Duke Energy hereby represents, warrants and covenants that the Duke
Energy Common Shares issuable to Beneficiaries as described herein will be duly
authorized and validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and shall be free
and clear of any lien, claim or encumbrance.

         5.12     AUTOMATIC EXCHANGE ON LIQUIDATION OF DUKE ENERGY

         (a)      Duke Energy will give the Trustee written notice of each of
                  the following events at the time set forth below:

<PAGE>   154

                  (i)      in the event of any determination by the Board of
                           Directors of Duke Energy to institute voluntary
                           liquidation, dissolution or winding-up proceedings
                           with respect to Duke Energy or to effect any other
                           distribution of assets of Duke Energy among its
                           shareholders for the purpose of winding up its
                           affairs, at least 60 days prior to the proposed
                           effective date of such liquidation, dissolution,
                           winding-up or other distribution; and

                  (ii)     promptly following the earlier of (A) receipt by Duke
                           Energy of notice of, and (B) Duke Energy otherwise
                           becoming aware of, any threatened or instituted
                           claim, suit, petition or other proceedings with
                           respect to the involuntary liquidation, dissolution
                           or winding-up of Duke Energy or to effect any other
                           distribution of assets of Duke Energy among its
                           shareholders for the purpose of winding up its
                           affairs, in each case where Duke Energy has failed to
                           contest in good faith any such proceeding commenced
                           in respect of Duke Energy within 30 days of becoming
                           aware thereof.

         (b)      Promptly following receipt by the Trustee from Duke Energy of
                  notice of any event (a "LIQUIDATION Event") contemplated by
                  Section 5.12(a) above, the Trustee will give notice thereof to
                  the Beneficiaries. Such notice shall be provided to the
                  Trustee by Duke Energy and shall include a brief description
                  of rights of the Beneficiaries with respect to the Automatic
                  Exchange Rights provided for in Section 5.12(c).

         (c)      In order that the Beneficiaries will be able to participate on
                  a pro rata basis with the holders of Duke Energy Common Shares
                  in the distribution of assets of Duke Energy in connection
                  with a Liquidation Event, immediately prior to the effective
                  time (the "LIQUIDATION EVENT EFFECTIVE TIME") of a Liquidation
                  Event all of the then outstanding Exchangeable Shares shall be
                  automatically exchanged for Duke Energy Common Shares. To
                  effect such automatic exchange, Duke Energy shall purchase
                  each Exchangeable Share outstanding immediately prior to the
                  Liquidation Event Effective Time and held by Beneficiaries,
                  and each Beneficiary shall sell the Exchangeable Shares held
                  by such Beneficiary at such time, for a purchase price per
                  share equal to the Exchangeable Share Price applicable at that
                  time. Duke Energy shall provide the Trustee with an Officer's
                  Certificate in connection with any automatic exchange setting
                  forth the calculation of the Exchangeable Share Price for each
                  Exchangeable Share.

         (d)      The closing of the transaction of purchase and sale
                  contemplated by the automatic exchange of Exchangeable Shares
                  for Duke Energy Common Shares shall be deemed to have occurred
                  immediately prior to the Liquidation Event Effective Time, and
                  each Beneficiary shall be deemed to have transferred to Duke
                  Energy all of the Beneficiary's right, title and interest in
                  and to such Beneficiary's Exchangeable Shares and the related
                  interest in the Trust Estate. Any right of each such
                  Beneficiary to receive declared and unpaid dividends from
                  Exchangeco

<PAGE>   155

                  shall be deemed to be satisfied and discharged and each such
                  Beneficiary shall cease to be a holder of such Exchangeable
                  Shares and Duke Energy shall deliver to the Beneficiary the
                  Exchangeable Share Consideration deliverable upon the
                  automatic exchange of Exchangeable Shares. Concurrently with
                  such Beneficiary ceasing to be a holder of Exchangeable
                  Shares, the Beneficiary shall be considered and deemed for all
                  purposes to be the holder of the Duke Energy Common Shares
                  issued pursuant to the automatic exchange of Exchangeable
                  Shares for Duke Energy Common Shares and the certificates held
                  by the Beneficiary previously representing the Exchangeable
                  Shares exchanged by the Beneficiary with Duke Energy pursuant
                  to such automatic exchange shall thereafter be deemed to
                  represent Duke Energy Common Shares issued to the Beneficiary
                  by Duke Energy pursuant to such automatic exchange. Upon the
                  request of a Beneficiary and the surrender by the Beneficiary
                  of Exchangeable Share certificates deemed to represent Duke
                  Energy Common Shares, duly endorsed in blank and accompanied
                  by such instruments of transfer as Duke Energy may reasonably
                  require, Duke Energy shall deliver or cause to be delivered to
                  the Beneficiary certificates representing Duke Energy Common
                  Shares of which the Beneficiary is the holder.

         5.13     WITHHOLDING RIGHTS

         Duke Energy, Exchangeco and the Trustee shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any consideration otherwise payable under this Agreement to any
holder of Exchangeable Shares or Duke Energy Common Shares such amounts as Duke
Energy, Exchangeco or the Trustee is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to such payment under the Income Tax Act (Canada), the United States
Internal Revenue Code of 1986 or any provision of federal, provincial, state,
local or foreign tax law, in each case as amended or succeeded. The Trustee may
act on the advice of counsel with respect to such matters. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
as having been paid to the holder of the shares in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made, provided that such withheld amounts are
actually remitted to the appropriate taxing authority. To the extent that the
amount so required to be deducted or withheld from any payment to a holder
exceeds the cash portion of the consideration otherwise payable to the holder,
Duke Energy, Exchangeco and the Trustee are hereby authorized to sell or
otherwise dispose of such portion of the consideration as is necessary to
provide sufficient funds to Duke Energy, Exchangeco or the Trustee, as the case
may be, to enable it to comply with such deduction or withholding requirement
and Duke Energy, Exchangeco or the Trustee shall notify the holder thereof and
remit to such holder any unapplied balance of the net proceeds of such sale.
Duke Energy represents and warrants that, based upon facts currently known to
it, it has no current intention, as at the date of this Agreement, to deduct or
withhold from any consideration paid to holders of Exchangeable Shares any
amounts under the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

                  receiving from Beneficiaries Exchangeable Shares and other
                  requisite documents and distributing to such Beneficiaries
                  Duke Energy Common Shares and cheques, if any, to which such
                  Beneficiaries are entitled upon the exercise of the Exchange

                  case may be;

         (f)      holding title to the Trust Estate;

         (g)      investing any moneys forming, from time to time, a part of the
                  Trust Estate as provided in this Agreement;

         (h)      taking action on its own initiative or at the direction of a

the Trust. Any exercise of such discretionary rights, powers, duties and
authorities by the Trustee shall be final, conclusive and binding upon all
persons.

         The Trustee in exercising its rights, powers, duties and authorities
hereunder shall act honestly and in good faith and with a view to the best
interests of the Beneficiaries and shall exercise the care, diligence and skill
that a reasonably prudent trustee would exercise in comparable circumstances.

         The Trustee shall not be bound to give notice or do or take any act,
action or proceeding by virtue of the powers conferred on it hereby unless and
until it shall be specifically required to do so under the terms hereof, nor

act, action or proceeding as a result of any default or breach of any provision
hereunder, unless and until notified in writing of such default or breach, which
notices shall distinctly specify the default or breach desired to be brought to
the attention of the Trustee, and in the absence of such notice the Trustee may
for all purposes of this Agreement conclusively assume that no default or breach
has been made in the observance or performance of any of the representations,
warranties, covenants, agreements or conditions contained herein.

         6.2      NO CONFLICT OF INTEREST

         The Trustee represents to Duke Energy and Exchangeco that at the date
of execution and delivery of this Agreement there exists no material conflict of
interest in the role of the Trustee as a fiduciary hereunder and the role of the
Trustee in any other capacity. The Trustee shall, within 90 days after it
becomes aware that such material conflict of interest exists, either eliminate
such material conflict of interest or resign in the manner and with the effect
specified in Article 10. If, notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
Section 6.2, the Trustee has such a material conflict of interest, the validity
and enforceability of this Agreement shall not be affected in any manner
whatsoever by reason only of the existence of such material conflict of
interest. If the Trustee contravenes the foregoing provisions of this Section
6.2, any interested party may apply to the Court for an order that the Trustee
be replaced as trustee hereunder.

         6.3      DEALINGS WITH TRANSFER AGENTS, REGISTRARS, ETC.

         Duke Energy and Exchangeco irrevocably authorize the Trustee, from time
to time, to:

                  registrars and transfer agents, and with any such subsequent
                  registrar or transfer agent, of the Exchangeable Shares and
                  Duke Energy Common Shares; and

         (b)      requisition, from time to time, (i) from any such registrar or
                  transfer agent any information readily available from the
                  records maintained by it which the Trustee may reasonably
                  require for the discharge of its duties and responsibilities
                  under this Agreement and (ii) from the transfer agent of Duke
                  Energy Common Shares, and any subsequent transfer agent of

                  from time to time of the Exchange Right and pursuant to the
                  Automatic Exchange Rights.

         Duke Energy and Exchangeco irrevocably authorize their respective
registrars and transfer agents to comply with all such requests. Duke Energy

Beneficiaries and all transactions pursuant to the Exchange Right and the
Automatic Exchange Rights. On or before January 15, 2002, and on or before
January 15 in every year thereafter, so long as any Duke Energy Common Shares
are on deposit with the Trustee, the Trustee shall transmit to Duke Energy and
Exchangeco a brief report, dated as of the preceding December 31, with respect
to:

                  date;

                  issuance by Duke Energy of Duke Energy Common Shares in

power hereunder unless the Beneficiary has requested the Trustee to take or
institute such action, suit or proceeding and furnished the Trustee with the

         (e)      declaring that such person has made such examination or
                  investigation as such person believes is necessary to enable
                  such person to make the statements or give the opinions
                  contained or expressed therein.

behalf of the Trustee which under the terms of this Agreement may or ought to be
invested or which may be on deposit with the Trustee or which may be in the
hands of the Trustee may be invested and reinvested in the name or under the
control of the Trustee, in trust for Exchangeco, in securities in which, under
the laws of the Province of Ontario, trustees are authorized to invest trust
moneys, provided that such securities are stated to mature within two years
after their purchase by the Trustee, and the Trustee shall so invest such moneys
on the written direction of Exchangeco. Pending the investment of any moneys as
hereinbefore provided, such moneys may be deposited in the name of the Trustee
in any chartered bank in Canada or, with the consent of Exchangeco, in the
deposit department of the Trustee or any other loan or trust company authorized
to accept deposits under the laws of Canada or any province thereof at the rate
of interest then current on similar deposits.

         6.12     TRUSTEE NOT REQUIRED TO GIVE SECURITY

         6.13     TRUSTEE NOT BOUND TO ACT ON REQUEST

         Except as in this Agreement otherwise specifically provided, the
Trustee shall not be bound to act in accordance with any direction or request of
Duke Energy and/or Exchangeco or of the directors thereof until a duly
authenticated copy of the instrument or resolution containing such direction or
request shall have been delivered to the Trustee, and the Trustee shall be

authorized to carry on business, the validity and enforceability of this
Agreement and the Voting Rights, the Exchange Right and the Automatic Exchange
Rights shall not be affected in any manner whatsoever by reason only of such
event but the Trustee shall, within 90 days after ceasing to be authorized to
carry on the business of a trust company in any province of

Canada, either become so authorized or resign in the manner and with the effect
specified in Article 10.

         6.15     CONFLICTING CLAIMS

         If conflicting claims or demands are made or asserted with respect to
any interest of any Beneficiary in any Exchangeable Shares, including any
disagreement between the heirs, representatives, successors or assigns
succeeding to all or any part of the interest of any Beneficiary in any
Exchangeable Shares, resulting in conflicting claims or demands being made in
connection with such interest, then the Trustee shall be entitled, at its sole
discretion, to refuse to recognize or to comply with any such claims or demands.
In so refusing, the Trustee may elect not to exercise any Voting Rights,
Exchange Right or Automatic Exchange Rights subject to such conflicting claims
or demands and, in so doing, the Trustee shall not be or become liable to any
person on account of such election or its failure or refusal to comply with any
such conflicting claims or demands. The Trustee shall be entitled to continue to
refrain from acting and to refuse to act until:

         (a)      the rights of all adverse claimants with respect to the Voting
                  Rights, Exchange Right or Automatic Exchange Rights subject to
                  such conflicting claims or demands have been adjudicated by a
                  final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction and all
                  rights of appeal have expired; or

         (b)      all differences with respect to the Voting Rights, Exchange
                  Right or Automatic Exchange Rights subject to such conflicting
                  claims or demands have been conclusively settled by a valid
                  written agreement binding on all such adverse claimants, and
                  the Trustee shall have been furnished with an executed copy of
                  such agreement certified to be in full force and effect.

         If the Trustee elects to recognize any claim or comply with any demand
made by any such adverse claimant, it may in its discretion require such
claimant to furnish such surety bond or other security satisfactory to the
Trustee as it shall deem appropriate to fully indemnify it as between all
conflicting claims or demands.

         6.16     ACCEPTANCE OF TRUST

         The Trustee hereby accepts the Trust created and provided for by and in
this Agreement and agrees to perform the same upon the terms and conditions
herein set forth and to hold all rights, privileges and benefits conferred
hereby and by law in trust for the various persons who shall from time to time
be Beneficiaries, subject to all the terms and conditions herein set forth.

         Duke Energy will maintain in Vancouver an office or agency where
certificates representing Exchangeable Shares may be presented or surrendered
for exchange by Beneficiaries and where notices and demands to or upon Duke
Energy or Exchangeco in respect of the Exchangeable Shares may be served. Duke
Energy will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of the location, and any
change in the location, of such office or agency. If at any time

                                      -25-
                       VOTING AND EXCHANGE TRUST AGREEMENT
<PAGE>   163

Duke Energy shall fail to maintain any such office or agency or shall fail to
furnish the Trustee with the address thereof, such presentations, surrenders,
notices and demands may be served at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee,
and Duke Energy and Exchangeco hereby appoint the Trustee as their agent to

                                  COMPENSATION

         7.1      FEES AND EXPENSES OF THE TRUSTEE

         Duke Energy and Exchangeco jointly and severally agree to pay the
Trustee reasonable compensation for all of the services rendered by it under
this Agreement and will reimburse the Trustee for all reasonable expenses
(including taxes other than taxes based on the net income of the Trustee, fees
paid to legal counsel and other experts and advisors and travel expenses) and
disbursements, including the cost and expense of any suit or litigation of any
character and any proceedings before any governmental agency reasonably incurred
by the Trustee in connection with its duties under this Agreement; provided that
Duke Energy and Exchangeco shall have no obligation to reimburse the Trustee for
any expenses or disbursements paid, incurred or suffered by the Trustee in any
suit or litigation in which the Trustee is determined to have acted in bad faith
or with negligence, recklessness or willful misconduct.

                                   ARTICLE 8
                   INDEMNIFICATION AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

         8.1      INDEMNIFICATION OF THE TRUSTEE

         Duke Energy and Exchangeco jointly and severally agree to indemnify and
hold harmless the Trustee and each of its directors, officers, employees and
agents appointed and acting in accordance with this Agreement (collectively, the
"INDEMNIFIED PARTIES") against all claims, losses, damages, reasonable costs,
penalties, fines and reasonable expenses (including reasonable expenses of the
Trustee's legal counsel) which, without fraud, negligence, recklessness, willful
misconduct or bad faith on the part of such Indemnified Party, may be paid,
incurred or suffered by the Indemnified Party by reason or as a result of the
Trustee's acceptance or administration of the Trust, its compliance with its
duties set forth in this Agreement, or any written or oral instruction delivered
to the Trustee by Duke Energy or Exchangeco pursuant hereto.

         In no case shall Duke Energy or Exchangeco be liable under this
indemnity for any claim against any of the Indemnified Parties unless Duke
Energy and Exchangeco shall be notified by the Trustee of the written assertion
of a claim or of any action commenced against the Indemnified Parties, promptly
after any of the Indemnified Parties shall have received any such written
assertion of a claim or shall have been served with a summons or other first
legal process giving information as to the nature and basis of the claim.
Subject to (ii) below, Duke Energy and Exchangeco shall be entitled to
participate at their own expense in the defense and, if Duke Energy and
Exchangeco so elect at any time after receipt of such notice, either of them may

                                      -26-
                       VOTING AND EXCHANGE TRUST AGREEMENT
<PAGE>   164

assume the defense of any suit brought to enforce any such claim. The Trustee
shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such suit and participate
in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at
the expense of the Trustee unless: (i) the employment of such counsel has been
authorized by Duke Energy or Exchangeco; or (ii) the named parties to any such
suit include both the Trustee and Duke Energy or Exchangeco and the Trustee
shall have been advised by counsel acceptable to Duke Energy or Exchangeco that
there may be one or more legal defenses available to the Trustee that are
different from or in addition to those available to Duke Energy or Exchangeco
and that, in the judgment of such counsel, would present a conflict of interest
were a joint representation to be undertaken (in which case Duke Energy and
Exchangeco shall not have the right to assume the defense of such suit on behalf
of the Trustee but shall be liable to pay the reasonable fees and expenses of
counsel for the Trustee). This indemnity shall survive the termination of this
Agreement and the resignation or removal of the Trustee.

         8.2      LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

         The Trustee shall not be held liable for any loss which may occur by
reason of depreciation of the value of any part of the Trust Estate or any loss
incurred on any investment of funds pursuant to this Agreement, except to the
extent that such loss is attributable to the fraud, negligence, recklessness,
willful misconduct or bad faith on the part of the Trustee.

                                   ARTICLE 9

         9.1      RESIGNATION

         The Trustee, or any trustee hereafter appointed, may at any time resign
by giving written notice of such resignation to Duke Energy and Exchangeco
specifying the date on which it desires to resign, provided that such notice
shall not be given less than thirty (30) days before such desired resignation
date unless Duke Energy and Exchangeco otherwise agree and provided further that
such resignation shall not take effect until the date of the appointment of a
successor trustee and the acceptance of such appointment by the successor
trustee. Upon receiving such notice of resignation, Duke Energy and Exchangeco
shall promptly appoint a successor trustee, which shall be a corporation
organized and existing under the laws of the State of New York or the State of
Delaware, by written instrument in duplicate, one copy of which shall be
delivered to the resigning trustee and one copy to the successor trustee.
Failing the appointment and acceptance of a successor trustee, a successor
trustee may be appointed by order of a court of competent jurisdiction upon
application of one or more of the parties to this Agreement. If the retiring
trustee is the party initiating an application for the appointment of a
successor trustee by order of a court of competent jurisdiction, Duke Energy and
Exchangeco shall be jointly and severally liable to reimburse the retiring
trustee for its legal costs and expenses in connection with same.

         9.2      REMOVAL

         The Trustee, or any trustee hereafter appointed, may (provided a
successor trustee is appointed) be removed at any time on not less than 30 days'
prior notice by written instrument executed by Duke Energy and Exchangeco, in
duplicate, one copy of which shall be delivered to the trustee so removed and
one copy to the successor trustee.

         9.3      SUCCESSOR TRUSTEE

         Any successor trustee appointed as provided under this Agreement shall
execute, acknowledge and deliver to Duke Energy and Exchangeco and to its
predecessor trustee an instrument accepting such appointment. Thereupon the
resignation or removal of the predecessor trustee shall become effective and
such successor trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall
become vested with all the rights, powers, duties and obligations of its
predecessor under this Agreement, with the like effect as if originally named as
trustee in this Agreement. However, on the written request of Duke Energy and
Exchangeco or of the successor trustee, the trustee ceasing to act shall, upon
payment of any amounts then due it pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement,
execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor trustee all the
rights and powers of the trustee so ceasing to act. Upon the request of any such
successor trustee, Duke Energy, Exchangeco and such predecessor trustee shall
execute any and all instruments in writing for more fully and certainly vesting
in and confirming to such successor trustee all such rights and powers.

         9.4      NOTICE OF SUCCESSOR TRUSTEE

         Upon acceptance of appointment by a successor trustee as provided
herein, Duke Energy and Exchangeco shall cause to be mailed notice of the
succession of such trustee hereunder to each Beneficiary specified in a List. If
Duke Energy or Exchangeco shall fail to cause such notice to be mailed within 10
days after acceptance of appointment by the successor trustee, the successor
trustee shall cause such notice to be mailed at the expense of Duke Energy and
Exchangeco.

         10.1     CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS IN RESPECT OF COMBINATION, ETC.

         Duke Energy shall not consummate any transaction (whether by way of
reconstruction, reorganization, consolidation, merger, transfer, sale, lease or
otherwise) whereby all or substantially all of its undertaking, property and
assets would become the property of any other person or, in the case of a
merger, of the continuing corporation resulting therefrom unless, but may do so
if:

         (a)      such other person or continuing corporation (herein called the
                  "DUKE ENERGY SUCCESSOR"), by operation of law, becomes,
                  without more, bound by the terms and provisions of this
                  Agreement or, if not so bound, executes, prior to or
                  contemporaneously with the consummation of such transaction, a

                  supplemental hereto and such other instruments (if any) as are
                  satisfactory to the Trustee, acting reasonably, and in the
                  opinion of legal counsel to the Trustee are reasonably
                  necessary or advisable to evidence the assumption by the Duke
                  Energy Successor of liability for all moneys payable and
                  property deliverable hereunder and the covenant of such Duke
                  Energy Successor to pay and deliver or cause to be delivered
                  the same and its agreement to observe and perform all the
                  covenants and obligations of Duke Energy under this Agreement;
                  and

         (b)      such transaction shall be upon such terms and conditions as
                  substantially to preserve and not to impair in any material
                  respect any of the rights, duties, powers and authorities of
                  the Trustee or of the Beneficiaries hereunder.

         10.2     VESTING OF POWERS IN SUCCESSOR

         Whenever the conditions of Section 10.1 have been duly observed and
performed, the Trustee, Duke Energy Successor and Exchangeco shall, if required
by Section 10.1, execute and deliver the supplemental trust agreement provided
for in Article 11 and thereupon Duke Energy Successor shall possess and from
time to time may exercise each and every right and power of Duke Energy under
this Agreement in the name of Duke Energy or otherwise and any act or proceeding
by any provision of this Agreement required to be done or performed by the Board
of Directors of Duke Energy or any officers of Duke Energy may be done and
performed with like force and effect by the directors or officers of such Duke
Energy Successor.

         10.3     WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARIES

         Nothing herein shall be construed as preventing the amalgamation or
merger of any wholly-owned direct or indirect subsidiary of Duke Energy with or
into Duke Energy or the winding-up, liquidation or dissolution of any
wholly-owned subsidiary of Duke Energy provided that all of the assets of such
subsidiary are transferred to Duke Energy or another wholly-owned direct or
indirect subsidiary of Duke Energy and any such transactions are expressly
