This Agreement and Plan of Merger (this "Agreement") is entered into as of
December 12, 2003 (the "Effective Date") by and among Edwards Lifesciences
Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Purchaser"), Edwards Acquisition, Inc.,
a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Purchaser ("Merger
Sub"), and Percutaneous Valve Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the
"Company"). Certain additional capitalized terms used herein are defined in
Article IX of this Agreement.

  



  

 **RECITALS**

  



  

WHEREAS, Merger Sub was incorporated for the sole purpose of entering into
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and

  



  

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of Purchaser, Merger Sub and the
Company have determined that the Merger (as defined in Section 1.1) is fair
and in the best interests of their respective stockholders, and have approved
the Merger in accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement.

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and mutual covenants
hereinafter set forth and other good and valuable consideration, the parties
hereto, on the basis of, and in reliance upon, the representations,
warranties, covenants, obligations and agreements set forth in this
Agreement, and upon the terms and subject to the conditions contained herein,
hereby agree as follows:

  



  

# **ARTICLE I** 
  
 THE MERGER

  

# ** **

  

1.1 _Merger_. At the Effective Time and upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, Merger Sub
shall be merged with and into the Company (the "Merger"). Following the
Merger, the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation (the
"Surviving Corporation") and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub
shall cease.

  



  

1.2 _Effective Time_. On the Closing Date, subject to the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement, the parties shall cause the Merger to
be consummated by (i) filing pursuant to the DGCL a Certificate of Merger
substantially in the form of _Exhibit A_ (the "Certificate of Merger") duly
executed and acknowledged by Merger Sub and the Company, and (ii) making all
other filings or recordings required under the DGCL in connection with the
Merger.  The Merger shall become effective at such time as the Certificate
of Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware
in accordance with the DGCL, or such later time upon which Purchaser and
the Company may agree and set forth in the Certificate of Merger (the time
the Merger becomes effective being referred to herein as the "Effective
Time").

  



  

1.3 _Merger Consideration_. The aggregate maximum consideration to be paid
by Purchaser to Sellers for all outstanding Capital Stock shall be
$125,453,380 in cash (the "Closing

  



  

1      
   



  

Payment"), as determined in accordance with Section 1.5, and increased to the
extent applicable by the Contingent Payments, if any, as determined in
accordance with Section 1.4 (collectively, the "Merger Consideration").

  



  

1.4 _Contingent Payments_. Purchaser shall pay to the Sellers (to be paid
ratably in accordance with each SellerÂ’s Pro Rata Share) the following
payments (each a "Contingent Payment" and collectively, the "Contingent
Payments") if the Company meets the requirements described in _Schedule 1.4_
:

  



  

(a) The first Contingent Payment ("First Contingent Payment") in the amount
of $10,000,000 shall be earned if on or before the third anniversary of
the Closing Date the Company has achieved Milestone #1, as set forth in
_Schedule 1.4_.

  



  

(b) The second Contingent Payment ("Second Contingent Payment") in the amount
of $10,000,000 shall be earned if on or before the third anniversary of
the Closing Date the Company has achieved Milestone #2, as set forth in
_Schedule 1.4_.

  



  

(c) The third Contingent Payment ("Third Contingent Payment") in the amount
of $10,000,000 shall be earned if on or before the third anniversary of
the Closing Date the Company has achieved Milestone #3, as set forth in
_Schedule 1.4_.

  



  

SellersÂ’ Agent shall provide written notice to Purchaser at such time as
SellersÂ’ Agent believes that a Milestone has been achieved. The
First Contingent Payment, Second Contingent Payment and Third Contingent
Payment shall be payable, subject to Section 8.3, within 30 days after the
date that the Company has achieved the applicable Milestone set forth in
_Schedule 1.4_  and SellersÂ’ Agent has provided written notice to Purchaser
to such effect. If within 30 days after the date of such written notice,
Purchaser has not paid to Sellers the applicable Contingent Payment, either
Purchaser or SellersÂ’ Agent can submit a request for binding arbitration,
pursuant to Section 10.5(d), to determine whether such Milestone has been
achieved.

  



  

1.5 _Closing Cash Balance_. On the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver
to Purchaser a statement, setting forth the closing consolidated cash balance
(including cash and cash equivalents) of the Company and its Subsidiaries as
of the Closing Date, as prepared in accordance with GAAP (the "Closing Cash
Balance").  The Closing Cash Balance shall be equal to at least the amount
set forth in Section 4.9.

  



  

1.6 _Date_ _, Time and Place of Closing_. Unless this Agreement is earlier
terminated pursuant to Section 7.1, the closing of the transactions
contemplated hereby (the "Closing") shall take place at the offices of Morea
and Schwartz, P.C., 120 Broadway, New York, New York 10271 ("Morea and Schwartz")
as promptly as practicable following the satisfaction or valid waiver of the
conditions set forth in Article VI by the party or parties entitled to waive
the same, or such other date and time as may be mutually agreed upon by the
parties (the "Closing Date"). All proceedings to take place at the
Closing shall take place simultaneously, and no delivery shall be considered
to have been made until all such proceedings have been completed.

  



  

1.7 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in
the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all of the
properties, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of

Liabilities of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the Liabilities of the
Surviving Corporation.

  



  

1.8 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_.  The certificate of
incorporation of Merger Sub in effect at the Effective Time shall be the
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
amended as provided therein and in accordance with applicable law; _provided_
that Article One of the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation shall be amended in its entirety to read as follows: "The name of
the corporation is Percutaneous Valve Technologies, Inc." The bylaws of
Merger Sub in effect at the Effective Time shall be the bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided therein and in
accordance with applicable law.

  



  

1.9 _Directors and Officers_.

  



  

(a) _Directors_. The directors of Merger Sub at the Effective Time shall
serve as the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold

and qualified.

  



  

(b) _Officers_. The officers of the Company at the Effective Time, together
with any other persons designated by Purchaser, shall serve as the initial
officers of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with
the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation

officerÂ’s successor is duly elected or appointed and qualified.

  



  

1.10 _Effect on Capital Stock; Treatment of Stock Options and Warrants_. On
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of

Section 1.11, the Merger Consideration as follows:

  



  

(i) upon the later of the surrender of the Certificate representing such
share of Capital Stock and the Closing Date:

  



  

(A) each share of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without
interest, equal to such portion of the Closing Payment that a holder of
Common Stock is entitled to receive for such share of Common Stock pursuant
to Article Four, Section 4 of the Amended and Restated Certificate (the
"Common Stock Merger Consideration");

  



  

(B) each share of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive an amount in
cash, without interest, equal to such portion of the Closing Payment that a
holder of Series A

Preferred Stock is entitled to receive for such share of Series A Preferred
Stock pursuant to Article Four, Section 4 of the Amended and Restated
Certificate (the "Series A Merger Consideration");

  



  

(C) each share of Series B Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to

Amended and Restated Certificate (the "Series B Merger Consideration");

  



  

(D) each share of Common Stock or Preferred Stock owned by Purchaser, Merger

the Merger, be canceled without payment of any consideration with respect
thereto; and

  



  

(E) each share of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of Merger Sub
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, each stock
certificate formerly representing shares of common stock of Merger Sub shall
be deemed to represent an equivalent number of shares of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation; and

  



  

(ii) such SellerÂ’s Pro Rata Share of any Contingent Payments.

  



  

(b) _Stock Options; Warrants_. The Company shall waive, accelerate or cause
the termination of, prior to the Effective Time, any vesting provisions on
all outstanding Stock Options or Warrants. The Company shall take all actions
necessary to provide for an exercise period after the date hereof with
respect to all outstanding Stock Options and Warrants which exercise period
shall terminate at least three Business Days prior to the Closing Date.
Thereafter, effective as of the Effective Time, the Company shall take all
actions necessary to terminate any unexercised Stock Options, any Warrants,
the Stock Option Plan and the Warrant Agreements. At and after the Effective
Time, no Person shall have any right under the Stock Option Plan or the
Warrant Agreements with respect to any Capital Stock or any equity securities
of the Subsidiaries.

  



  

1.11 _Exchange Procedures_. Each Seller must deliver to Purchaser a duly
executed letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected and title to the Certificates shall pass only upon delivery of the

provisions as Purchaser may reasonably specify), and a Certificate
representing shares of Capital Stock, to be entitled to receive the payment
pursuant to Section 1.10(a)(i), and the Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled.

  



  

No interest will be paid or accrued on the cash payable under the surrender
of the Certificates. If the payment is to be made to a Person other than the
Person in whose name a Certificate surrendered is registered, it shall be a
condition of payment that (a) the Certificate so surrendered shall be
properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for transfer, and (b)
the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes
required by reason of the

  



  

4      
   



  

payment to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate
surrendered or establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation
that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable.

  



  

1.12 _Lost Certificates_. In the event that any Certificate representing
shares of Capital Stock shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Purchaser
shall issue in exchange therefor, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact in a form satisfactory to Purchaser by the holder thereof, such payment
as may be required pursuant to the provisions of Section 1.10(a)(i);
provided, however, that Purchaser may, in its sole discretion, require the

Purchaser may reasonably direct.

  



  

1.13 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who has properly
exercised and perfected his or her demand for appraisal rights under Section
262 of the DGCL or any successor provision (the "Dissenting Shares"), will
not be converted into the right to receive their respective portion of the
Merger Consideration, but the holders of such Dissenting Shares will be
entitled to receive from the Company such consideration as will be determined
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL; provided, however, that if any such
holder will have failed to perfect or will effectively withdraw or lose his
or her right to appraisal and payment under the DGCL, each share of Common
Stock or Preferred Stock held by such holder will thereupon be deemed to have
been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive their
respective portion of the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon,
upon the surrender of the Certificate representing such Common Stock or
Preferred Stock, pursuant to Section 1.11, and such shares will not be deemed
to be Dissenting Shares. The Company will give Purchaser (i) prompt notice
of any written notices or demands for appraisal of Common Stock or Preferred
Stock received by the Company, and (ii) the opportunity to participate and
direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demands or
notices.  The Company will not, without the prior written consent of
Purchaser, make any payment with respect to, or settle, offer to settle, or
otherwise negotiate any such demands.

liable to any holder of Capital Stock for any cash delivered to a

are now being conducted. All such properties are adequate for the conduct of
the Business as currently conducted and as proposed to be conducted by the
Surviving Corporation. All plants, structures and equipment owned or leased
by the Company or its Subsidiaries and material to the operation of the
Business are in satisfactory condition and repair for the requirements of the

any of such approvals, permits, franchises, licenses and governmental

have a Material Adverse Effect.  The Company has no knowledge of any fact or
condition which might reasonably be expected to give rise to any such action,
proceeding or investigation.

  



  

(b) The CompanyÂ’s business and operations have not been and are not being,
and the Company or its Subsidiaries have not received any notice from any
Governmental Authority or other Person that the CompanyÂ’s business and

ordinance or regulation, including without limitation any law, ordinance or
regulation relating to (a) Environmental Laws, (b) the testing or provision

24      
   



  

obtain any required regulatory approvals, clearances or expirations of

its Subsidiaries set forth in this Agreement (including the Disclosure
Schedule);

  



  

(c) any event or development that would reasonably be expected to prevent any
Closing condition under Article VI from being met;

  



  

(d) any notice of default received by it subsequent to the date of this

which the Company is a party or by which it is bound, which default would, if
not remedied, result in a Material Adverse Effect or which would render
materially incomplete or untrue any representation or warranty made herein;
and

  



  

(e) any suit, action or proceeding instituted or, to the knowledge of the
Company, threatened against or affecting the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries subsequent to the date of this Agreement and prior to the

5.4 _Confidentiality_ _; Communications_.

  



  

(a) Each party to this Agreement agrees that it will not use to the detriment
of the disclosing party or disclose to any Third Party any confidential or
proprietary information of any other party, except to the extent that such
information (i) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as
a result of a disclosure by the receiving party or its Representatives, or
(ii) was within the receiving partyÂ’s possession prior to its first being
furnished to it. Each party may disclose the confidential information of
another party to such partyÂ’s Representatives, who

  



  

25      
   



  

shall not use such information except for the purposes contemplated hereby,
and who shall maintain the confidentiality of such information, provided
however, that each party shall be responsible for any breach of this Section
5.4 by its Representatives.

  



  

(b) In the event that any party or any of its Representatives are requested
or required to disclose any of the confidential information of another party,
it shall provide the disclosing party with prompt written notice of any
such request or requirement so that the disclosing party may seek a
protective order or other appropriate remedy. If, in the absence of a
protective order or other remedy, the receiving party or any of its
Representatives are nonetheless, in the opinion of its outside
counsel, legally compelled to disclose such confidential information to any
Governmental Authority or else stand liable for contempt or suffer other
censure or penalty, the receiving party or its Representative may, without
liability hereunder, disclose to such Governmental Authority only that
portion of such confidential information which such counsel advises is
legally required to be disclosed.

  



  

(c) If the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are not consummated
for any reason, each party shall return or destroy all Contracts, and other
documents, work papers and other materials provided to it in the course of
its investigations and negotiations in connection with this Agreement or
based on any confidential information of another party, and shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause its Representatives to return or
destroy all such items.

  



  

(d) Each party agrees that, without the prior written consent of the other
parties, it and its Representatives will not disclose to any Third Party the
fact that discussions or negotiations are taking place concerning the
transaction contemplated hereby or any of the terms, conditions or other
facts with respect thereto (including the status thereof), provided _,_ that
each party (or its Affiliates) may make such disclosure if it has been
advised by its outside counsel that such disclosure must be made by it in
order not to commit a violation of law, or to comply with the requirements of
the New York Stock Exchange, Inc.

  



  

(e) Subject to their respective legal obligations (including requirements of
the New York Stock Exchange and Governmental Authorities), until the Closing
Date, the parties shall consult with each other, and use reasonable efforts
to agree upon, the text of any public statements with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement and any other
agreement entered into by the parties, any party to this Agreement (and their
Representatives) may disclose to any and all Persons, without limitation of
any kind, the tax treatment and tax structure of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (the "Transactions") and all materials of any
kind (including opinions or other tax analyses) that are provided to it
relating to such tax treatment and tax structure; provided, however, that
this sentence shall not permit any disclosure that otherwise is prohibited by
this Agreement (i) if such disclosure would result in a violation of federal
or state securities laws; or (ii) to the extent not related to the tax
aspects of the transaction. Moreover, nothing in this Agreement shall
be construed to limit in any way any partyÂ’s ability to consult any tax
advisor regarding the tax treatment or tax structure of the Transactions.

  



  

26      
   



  

5.5 _Expenses_. Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, whether or

cause to be taken, all reasonable actions and to do, or cause to be done, all

regulations to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement as promptly as reasonably practicable.  Such obligation shall
include without limitation (i) the CompanyÂ’s obligation to call a
stockholdersÂ’ meeting or obtain the written consents of its stockholders, and
(ii) such efforts of each of the parties, prior to the Closing Date, to
timely obtain any required consents with respect to, or novations of, any
Contracts of the Company in effect prior to the Closing Date.

end of such annual period, in conformity with GAAP without requiring an
audit, and which statement shall be prepared in the same manner and
consistent with the 2002 Financial Statements and in compliance with Section
2.6.  Notwithstanding the previous sentence, with respect to each quarterly
or annual period ending prior to the earlier of termination of this Agreement
or the Closing Date, including the fiscal year ended December 31, 2003,
the Company shall provide to Purchaser, within 45 days following the end

the CompanyÂ’s Board of Directors by a majority vote determines in its good
faith judgment, after consultation with and based upon the advice of outside
legal counsel, that it may be required to do so in order to comply with its
fiduciary duties, the CompanyÂ’s Board of Directors may withdraw its
recommendation of the transactions contemplated hereby or approve or

incorporation providing for exculpation of director liability and

persons are entitled thereto under the Amended and Restated Certificate and
Bylaws of the Company on the date hereof, subject to Delaware law, which
provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period
of five years after the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely
affect the rights thereunder of individuals who at any time prior to the

"Indemnified Director or Officer") in respect of actions or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including, without limitation,
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), unless such modification is

(b) Any Indemnified Director or Officer wishing to claim indemnification
under this Section 5.10 shall notify the Surviving Corporation promptly upon

liability which it may have under this Section 5.10 except to the extent such
failure prejudices such party).

of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Director or Officer and his

# **ARTICLE VIII** 
  
 SURVIVAL; INDEMNIFICATION

  



  

8.1 _Survival of Representations and Warranties_.  The representations and
warranties made in this Agreement shall survive for three years following the
Closing Date or the date of termination of this Agreement, as applicable, and
any party seeking indemnification must notify, in writing, the party or
parties from which it is seeking indemnification of a claim for Losses and
specify the factual basis of that claim in reasonable detail to the extent
then known by such party.

  



  

8.2 _Indemnification_.

  



  

(a) _Indemnification by the Company_. Subject to the other subsections of
this Section 8.2, Purchaser and each of its Affiliates and their
Representatives shall be indemnified and held harmless from and against any
and all Losses incurred by, imposed on, borne by or asserted against any
of such indemnified parties in any way relating to, arising out of or
resulting from:

  



  

(i) the breach of any of the representations or warranties made by the
Company in this Agreement;

  



  

(ii) the breach or the failure of performance by the Company of any of the
covenants, promises or agreements that any of them is to perform under this
Agreement;

  



  

(iii) the payment of any Taxes (including interest and penalties) of any kind
or nature imposed, whether before or after the Closing Date (except such
Taxes, if any, that are adequately reserved against in the Financial
Statements excluding, however, any reserve for deferred Taxes established to
reflect timing differences between book and Tax income), by any Governmental
Authority upon the Business, assets or employees or independent contractors
of the Company or otherwise resulting from or relating to the respective
businesses or operations of the Company on or prior to the Closing Date or
any of their respective properties or assets as they existed as of or any
time on or prior to the Closing Date and the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement;

  



  

(iv) the existence prior to the Closing Date of any hazardous or toxic
substances, wastes or materials, defined as such or governed by any
applicable Environmental Law ("Hazardous Materials") upon, about or beneath
any property of the Company or migrating or threatening to migrate from any
of such properties, regardless of whether the existence of such Hazardous
Materials or the violation of Environmental Laws arose prior to the present
ownership or operation of such properties by the Company; or

  



  

(v) the death of or injury to any Person or damage to property that occurred
prior to the Closing Date and arose out of or in connection with the Business
or

  



  

35      
   



  

operations of the Company (whether asserted, discovered or established before
or after the Closing Date).

  



  

The express written waiver by Purchaser of any condition set forth in Section
6.2 based on the inaccuracy of any representation or warranty, or on the
nonperformance of or noncompliance with any covenant or obligation, will not
preclude any right of Purchaser or any other indemnified Person
to indemnification, payment of Losses, or other remedy based on
such representation, warranty, covenant, and obligation.

  



  

(b) _Indemnification by Purchaser_. Subject to the other subsections of this
Section 8.2, the Company and each of its Affiliates and their Representatives
shall be indemnified and held harmless from and against any and all Losses
incurred by, imposed on, borne by or asserted against any of such indemnified
parties in any way relating to, arising out of or resulting from:

  



  

(i) the breach of any of the representations or warranties made by Purchaser
or Merger Sub in this Agreement; or

  



  

(ii) the breach or the failure of performance by Purchaser or Merger Sub of
any of the covenants, promises or agreements that either of them is to
perform under this Agreement.

  



  

(c) _Limitations on Indemnification_. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, no indemnifying party shall have any obligation to
indemnify any Person entitled to indemnity under this Section 8.2 unless the
Persons so entitled to indemnity thereunder have suffered Losses in an
aggregate amount in excess of $100,000 (the "Threshold"), it being agreed and
acknowledged by the parties that for purposes of determining whether the
foregoing Threshold has been exceeded in the aggregate, the representations
and warranties of the parties contained herein shall not be deemed qualified
by any references herein to materiality generally or to whether any such
breach results or may result in a Material Adverse Effect on the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Once the aggregate amount exceeds the
Threshold, the indemnified party shall be entitled to recover the full amount
of all Losses, including any amounts which constituted the Threshold.

  



  

(d) _Indemnity Cap_.

  



  

(i) In no event will the Liability (for indemnification from Losses or
otherwise) with respect to the matters set forth in (A) Section 8.2(a) exceed
an amount equal to the amount of earned but unpaid Contingent Payments, or
(B) Section 8.2(b) exceed an amount equal to the amount of earned Contingent
Payments.

  



  

(ii) Purchaser and Merger Sub agree that, except as set forth in Section 7.3,
their sole and exclusive remedy for any breach of the representations,
warranties or covenants of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under this
Agreement (other than claims of or causes of action arising from fraud),
shall be the remedies set forth in this Article VIII, and Purchaser and
Merger Sub hereby waive, from and after the Closing, any and all other
remedies (other than claims of or causes of action arising from fraud) which
may be available at law or

  



  

36      
   



  

equity for any breach or alleged breach of the representations, warranties
and covenants of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries contained herein.

  



  

(iii) The Company on behalf of itself and its Affiliates agrees that, except
as set forth in Section 7.3, its sole and exclusive remedy for any breach of
the representations, warranties or covenants of Purchaser or Merger Sub under
this Agreement (other than claims of or causes of action arising from fraud),
shall be the remedies set forth in this Article VIII, and the Company and
its Subsidiaries hereby waive, from and after the Closing, any and all
other remedies (other than claims of or causes of action arising from fraud)
which may be available at law or equity for any breach or alleged breach of
the representations, warranties and covenants of Purchaser or Merger Sub
contained herein.

  



  

8.3 _Right to Offset_. In addition to any rights of set-off, off-set or
other rights that Purchaser may have at common law, by statute or otherwise,
Purchaser shall have the option or right to set-off or recoup all or any part
of its Losses to which it is entitled under this Agreement as and when they
are incurred by notifying the Sellers in writing that Purchaser is reducing
the amount owed to the Sellers pursuant to any earned and unpaid Contingent
Payments and any other payments owed by the Purchaser or the Surviving
Corporation to the Sellers pursuant to this Agreement (excluding any payments
required to be made by Purchaser or its Affiliates pursuant to the Employment
Agreements).

  



  

8.4 _Claims Upon Contingent_ _Payments; Objections to Claims_.

  



  

(a) _Claims_. In order to make a claim for Losses or offset Losses pursuant
to this Article VIII, Purchaser shall deliver to SellersÂ’ Agent a certificate
signed by any authorized officer of Purchaser (an "OfficerÂ’s Certificate"):
 (i) stating that Purchaser or its Affiliates has paid, suffered or properly
accrued or reasonably anticipates that it will pay, suffer or accrue Losses;
(ii) specifying in reasonable detail, to the extent available, the individual
items of Losses included in the amount so stated, the date each such item was
paid, suffered or accrued, or the basis for such anticipated Losses; (iii)
the nature of the Losses to which such item or other payments is related; and
(iv) the amount of Losses Purchaser seeks to offset against any Contingent
Payments otherwise payable.  Purchaser shall not be estopped by any estimate
it may make of the amount of any anticipated or actual Losses claimed in any
OfficerÂ’s Certificate, or the bases therefor, and Purchaser may submit
amendments to any OfficerÂ’s Certificate, or additional OfficerÂ’s
Certificates, in the event that actual or anticipated Losses, or the bases
therefor, subsequently change or are determined to be different than
represented in an OfficerÂ’s Certificate previously delivered. Purchaser
shall not offset any Losses against any Contingent Payments or other payments
payable then or in the future until 45 days after the date of delivery of the
OfficerÂ’s Certificate to the SellersÂ’ Agent (or at such earlier date as the
SellersÂ’ Agent may authorize).

  



  

(b) _Objections to Claims_. Purchaser shall be entitled to offset against
any Contingent Payments the full amount of Losses claimed in the OfficerÂ’s
Certificate immediately after the 45 day waiting period specified in Section
8.4(a) expires (or at such earlier date as the SellersÂ’ Agent may authorize),
unless prior to such time the SellersÂ’ Agent delivers a written objection to
the claim made in the OfficerÂ’s Certificate (a "Notice of Dispute") to
Purchaser. The Notice of Dispute must include a reasonably detailed
description of the basis of the objection, as

  



  

37      
   



  

well as the amount of Losses, if any, which the SellersÂ’ Agent is not
disputing. Any undisputed Losses immediately shall be offset by Purchaser
against any Contingent Payments or other payments and Purchaser shall be
entitled to withhold any or all of the Contingent Payments reasonably
anticipated to cover disputed or anticipated Losses described in
the OfficerÂ’s Certificate. If the SellersÂ’ Agent does not timely deliver a
Notice of Dispute (or such Notice of Dispute does not reasonably describe the
basis of the objection), the SellersÂ’ Agent shall be deemed to have
irrevocably approved and consented to the offset of all Losses specified in
the OfficerÂ’s Certificate (including any anticipated Losses, which will be
deemed irrevocably by SellersÂ’ Agent approved and shall be offset by
Purchaser promptly upon their actual incurrence). Purchaser shall be entitled
to rely on and act in accordance with any written or deemed approval and
consent of the SellersÂ’ Agent in immediately offsetting the amount of any
Losses claimed in a specific OfficerÂ’s Certificate (and in offsetting any
Contingent Payments or other payments reasonably anticipated to cover any
Losses upon occurrence), even if the SellersÂ’ Agent subsequently objects to
or disputes the nature or amount of Losses. At such time as the cash payable
to cover the amount of Losses exceeds the payments pursuant to the Contingent
Payments, all Sellers shall cease to have any rights to receive any further
Merger Consideration under this Agreement.
