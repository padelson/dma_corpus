Accordingly, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual representations,

valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the parties to this Agreement, intending to be legally bound,
agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

THE OFFER AND THE MERGER

Section 1.1 _The Offer_.

 

(a) _Commencement of the Offer_. Provided that this Agreement shall not have
been terminated in accordance with Article VII, as promptly as practicable
but in no event later than ten Business Days after the date of this Agreement,
Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, commence (within the
meaning of Rule 14d-2 promulgated by the United States Securities and
Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ ")) the Offer.

 

(b) _Terms and Conditions of the Offer_. The obligations of Merger Sub to, and
of Parent to cause Merger Sub to, accept for payment, and pay for, any shares
of Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer are subject only to the
conditions set forth in _Exhibit A_ (the " _Offer Conditions_ "). Merger Sub
expressly reserves the right to waive any condition to the Offer or modify
the terms of the Offer, except that, without the prior written consent of the
Company, Merger Sub shall not (i) reduce the number of shares of Common Stock
subject to the Offer, (ii) reduce the Offer Price, (iii) change, modify or
waive the Minimum Tender Condition or the Antitrust Condition, (iv) add to the
Offer Conditions or modify any Offer Condition in a manner adverse to the
holders of Common Stock, (v) extend or otherwise change the expiration date
of the Offer (except as required or permitted by the provisions of Section
1.1(c)), (vi) change the form of consideration payable in the Offer or (vii)
otherwise amend, modify or supplement any of the other terms of the Offer in
any manner adverse to the holders of Common Stock.

 



2 (c) _Expiration and Extension of the Offer_. The initial expiration date of
the Offer shall be the 20th Business Day following the commencement of the
Offer (determined using Exchange Act Rule 14d-1(g)(3)). Merger Sub shall (and
Parent shall cause Merger Sub to) (i) extend the Offer for the minimum period
required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC or the
staff thereof applicable to the Offer; and (ii) if, on the initial expiration
date or any subsequent date as of which the Offer is scheduled to expire, any
Offer Condition shall not have been satisfied or waived, extend the Offer on
one or more occasions in consecutive increments of up to ten Business Days
each (or such longer period as the parties hereto may agree), until such time
as such Offer Conditions shall have been satisfied or waived; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (1) Merger Sub shall not be required to extend the Offer
beyond the earlier of the date of a Conversion Event (if exercising its rights
pursuant to and in accordance with Section 1.3 with respect to such
Conversion Event), the Outside Date or the termination of this Agreement and
(2) if, at any otherwise scheduled expiration of the Offer, all of the Offer
Conditions except for the Minimum Tender Condition shall have been satisfied
or waived, Merger Sub shall in such situation be required to extend the Offer
for one or more additional periods of at least five Business Days each but in
no event shall Merger Sub or Parent be required to extend the Offer for more
than twenty-five Business Days in the aggregate in such situation. The
expiration date for the Offer, as the same may be extended from time to time,
is referred to as the " _Offer Expiration Date_." The Offer may not be
terminated prior to its expiration date (as such expiration date may be
extended and re-extended in accordance with this Section 1.1(c)) unless this
Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with Article VII or as may be
required by applicable Law. In the event that this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to Article VII prior to any scheduled expiration thereof, Merger Sub
shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to) promptly (and in any event
within one Business Day of such termination), irrevocably and unconditionally
terminate the Offer.

(d) _Payment_. On the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer and
this Agreement, Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to),
accept for payment (the time of such acceptance, the " _Acceptance Time_ ")
and thereafter pay for, all shares of Common Stock validly tendered and not
withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as soon as practicable after the expiration of
the Offer and, in any event, no more than three Business Days after the
Acceptance Time. Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Merger Sub
on a timely basis the funds necessary to purchase any shares of Common Stock
that Merger Sub becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer. The Offer
Price shall, subject to any required withholding of Taxes, be net to the
seller in cash without interest, upon the terms and subject to the conditions
of the Offer.

(e) _Termination of the Offer_. The termination of the Offer pursuant to
Section 1.1(c) or Section 1.3 is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Offer
Termination_." If the Offer is terminated or withdrawn by Merger Sub, or this
Agreement is terminated in accordance with Article VII, Merger Sub shall
promptly return, and shall

 



3  cause any depository acting on behalf of Merger Sub to return, all tendered
shares of Common Stock to the registered holders thereof in accordance with
the terms of the Offer and applicable Law. The parties hereto acknowledge and
agree that the Offer Termination shall not give rise to a right of termination
of this Agreement except to the extent expressly provided for in Article VII
and that, absent any such termination of this Agreement, the obligations of
the parties hereunder other than those related to the Offer shall continue to
remain in effect, including those obligations with respect to the Merger.

 

(f) _Guaranteed Delivery_. For purposes of this Agreement and the Offer,
unless otherwise mutually agreed to by the Company and Merger Sub, any shares

Merger Sub.

Section 1.2 _Offer Documents_.

 

(a) As promptly as practicable on the date of commencement of the Offer,
Parent and Merger Sub shall (i) file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on
Schedule TO with respect to the Offer, which shall include an offer to
purchase and a related letter of transmittal and summary advertisement (such
Schedule TO and the documents included therein pursuant to which the Offer
will be made, together with any supplements or amendments thereto, the "
_Offer Documents_ ") and (ii) cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to
holders of shares of Common Stock as and to the extent required by applicable

the Company required by the Exchange Act to be set forth in the Offer

necessary to amend or supplement the Offer Documents and to cause the Offer
Documents as so amended or supplemented to be filed with the SEC and
disseminated to the holders of Common Stock, in each case as and to the
extent required by applicable federal securities Laws. Prior to the disclosure
of an Adverse Recommendation Change in accordance with Section 5.4, Parent and

reasonably determines in good faith that as a result of developments occurring
after the date hereof it is more probable than not that the Company
Stockholders Meeting would be reasonably likely to be held at least five days
prior to the satisfaction of the Offer Conditions and that the Transactions
would be consummated in a more timely manner than if the Offer were to be
consummated following satisfaction of the Offer Conditions and (b) at or after

is 30 Business Days after the commencement of the Offer any Offer Condition
shall not have been satisfied or, to the extent permitted by this Agreement

are to be satisfied on the Offer Expiration Date), then Merger Sub may, at its
sole option, upon one Business Days prior notice to the Company, irrevocably
and unconditionally terminate the Offer, in which case Merger Sub shall
thereafter pursue the Merger as contemplated in Section 5.6 (a " _Conversion
Event_ "). For the avoidance of doubt, Section 1.1, Section 1.2, Section 1.4

have become false or misleading in any material respect, and the Company
shall take all steps necessary to amend or supplement the Schedule 14D-9 and
to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so amended or supplemented to be

 



5  filed with the SEC and disseminated to the holders of Common Stock, in each

Change or in connection with any disclosures made in compliance with Section

that none of the Schedule 14D-9 and any information supplied by or on behalf
of the Company or any Affiliate of the Company for inclusion or incorporation
by reference in the Offer Documents shall, at the date it is first filed with
the SEC or at the Acceptance Time or at the time of any amendment
or supplement thereof, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading; _provided_ , that no representation or

evidenced by that Certificate or such Book-Entry Share less any
required withholding of Taxes. Any Certificates and Book-Entry Shares so
surrendered shall be canceled immediately. No interest shall accrue or be paid
on any amount payable upon surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

 

(iii) _Unregistered Transferees_. If any Merger Consideration is to be paid to

requesting such payment (x) pays any applicable transfer Taxes or (y)
establishes to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent and the Paying Agent that
any such transfer Taxes have already been paid or are not applicable.

2.2(c), each Certificate and each Book-Entry Share shall be deemed, from and
after the Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive the

paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Certificate or
Book-Entry Share and, in the case of a Certificate, the shares of Common Stock
formerly represented by it.

of 1986 (the " _Code_ "), or any applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law.
To the extent that any amounts are so deducted and withheld and paid to the
appropriate taxing authorities, those amounts shall be treated as having been
paid to the Person in respect of whom such deduction or withholding was made
for all purposes under this Agreement.

(g) _No Liability_. None of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent shall be liable to any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for
any amount properly paid to a public official under any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law.

Fund as directed by Parent; _provided_ , that such investment shall be in
obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States of America, in commercial
paper obligations of issuers organized under the Law of a state of the United
States of America, rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service,
Inc. or Standard and Poors Ratings Service, respectively, or in certificates of
deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial
banks with capital exceeding $10 billion, or in mutual funds investing in
such assets. Any such investment shall be for the benefit, and at the risk, of
Parent, and any interest or other income resulting from such investment shall
be for the benefit of Parent; _provided_ , that no such investment or losses
thereon shall affect the Merger Consideration payable to the holders of Common
Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time and other amounts payable under
Article II in accordance with this Agreement and Parent shall promptly
provide, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to promptly provide,
additional funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the holders of Common

which shall remain responsible for payment of the applicable Merger
Consideration, subject to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.

 



11 Section 2.3 _Company Equity Awards_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, each option to acquire shares of Common Stock
(each, a " _Company Option_ ") outstanding immediately before the Effective
Time, whether or not then exercisable or vested, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action by Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder of that
Company Option, shall be canceled and converted into the right to
receive from Parent or the Surviving Corporation promptly following the
Effective Time an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the Option
Consideration (as defined below) multiplied by the aggregate number of shares
of Common Stock that may be acquired upon exercise of such Company Option
whether or not then exercisable or vested, immediately before the Effective
Time. " _Option Consideration_ " means the excess, if any, of the Merger
Consideration over the per share exercise or purchase price of the applicable

to receive shares of Common Stock (each, a " _Company RSU_ ") outstanding
immediately before the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action by Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder of that Company RSU,
shall be, to the extent not already vested, vested and each Company RSU shall
be canceled and converted into the right to receive from Parent or the
Surviving Corporation an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the Merger
Consideration multiplied by the number of shares of Common Stock underlying
such Company RSUs.

(c) At the Effective Time, each performance share unit that conveys the right
to receive shares of Common Stock (each, a " _Company PSU_ ", and together
with the Company Options and Company RSUs, the " _Company Equity Awards_ ")
outstanding immediately before the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action by Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder of
that Company PSU, shall be, to the extent not already vested, vested in
accordance with its terms and each Company PSU shall be canceled and converted
into the right to receive from Parent or the Surviving Corporation an amount
in cash, without interest, equal to the Merger Consideration multiplied by
either (i) the number of shares of Common Stock, if any, that would be payable
upon settlement of such Company PSU based upon achievement of the performance
goal based on actual performance through the Effective Time, in the case of
Company PSUs with a performance cycle beginning more than 18 months prior to
the Effective Time or (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock that would be
payable upon settlement of such Company PSU upon achievement of the
performance goal at target level, in the case of Company PSUs with a
performance cycle beginning 18 months or less prior to the Effective Time.

(d) The payment of the amounts set forth in Section 2.3(a), Section 2.3(b) and
Section 2.3(c) in respect of the Company Equity Awards shall be reduced by
any income or employment Tax withholding required under the Code or any
applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that any amounts are
so withheld and paid to the appropriate taxing authorities, those amounts
shall be treated as having been paid to the holder of that Company Equity
Award for all purposes under this Agreement. The Company shall take all
requisite action so that all Company Equity Awards shall be canceled in
accordance with this Section 2.3 and that all Company Stock Plans shall
terminate at the Effective Time.

 



12 (e) Promptly following the Effective Time (and in any event not later than the
second payroll date thereafter), Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall
pay to each applicable holder of a Company Equity Award the amount due and
payable to such holder pursuant to this Section 2.3. Any such amounts may, at
Parents election, be made through the Surviving Corporations payroll
system, through the Paying Agent or otherwise.

Section 2.4 _Dissenting Shares_. 

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary (but
subject to the other provisions of this Section 2.4), any shares of Common
Stock for which the holder thereof (i) has not voted in favor of the Merger or
consented to it in writing and (ii) has properly demanded the appraisal of
such shares in accordance with, and has complied in all respects with, the
DGCL (collectively, the " _Dissenting Shares_ "), shall not be converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section
2.1(c). At the Effective Time, (A) all Dissenting Shares shall be canceled
and cease to exist and (B) the holders of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled
only to such rights as may be granted to them under the DGCL.

 

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.4(a), if after the Effective
Time any holder of Dissenting Shares effectively withdraws or loses such
appraisal rights (through failure to perfect such appraisal rights or
otherwise), then that holders shares (i) shall no longer be deemed to be
Dissenting Shares and (ii) shall be treated as if they had been
converted automatically at the Effective Time into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, upon surrender of the Certificate formerly representing
such shares or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, upon adherence to the
procedures set forth in the letter of transmittal, in each case in accordance
with Section 2.2.

(c) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands for
appraisal of any shares of Common Stock, any withdrawals of such demands and
any other instrument served on the Company under the DGCL and (ii) the right
to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect
to such demands for appraisal. Except to the extent required by applicable
Law, the Company shall not offer to make or make any payment with respect to
any such demands for appraisal without the prior written consent of Parent,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

Adverse Effect or a Parent Material Adverse Effect, as applicable, or which
would reasonably be likely to result in the failure of any of the conditions
set forth in Article VI or Exhibit A to be satisfied. In addition, Parent and
Merger Sub shall notify the Company promptly of the occurrence of any
Conversion Event Trigger. In no event shall (x) the delivery of any notice by
a party pursuant to this Section 5.3(b) limit or otherwise affect the
respective rights, obligations, representations,

 



37  warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties or the conditions to the
obligations of the parties under this Agreement, or (y) any such disclosure be
deemed to amend or supplement the Company Disclosure Letter or constitute an
exception to any representation or warranty.

(c) Parent and the Company shall comply with, and shall cause their
respective Representatives to comply with, all of their respective obligations
under the Confidentiality Agreement, dated June 19, 2014 (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "), between Parent and the Company with respect
to the information disclosed under this Section 5.2.

(d) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent, directly or
indirectly, rights to control or direct the operations of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries before the Effective Time. Before the Effective Time, the
Company shall, subject to and consistent with the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, exercise complete control and supervision over the operations
of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

Section 5.4 _No Solicitation_.

(a) Except as expressly permitted by Section 5.4(b), the Company shall not,
and the Company shall cause any of its Subsidiaries not to, and the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives not to, (i)
solicit, initiate, facilitate or knowingly encourage any inquiries regarding,
or the making of any Takeover Proposal or any proposal or offer that would
reasonably be expected to lead to a Takeover Proposal, (ii) continue, enter
into or participate in any discussions with any Person regarding a Takeover
Proposal (other than to state that the Company is not permitted to have
discussions), (iii) execute or enter into any Contract with respect to a
Takeover Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement), (iv)
furnish to any Person any non-public information with respect to any
Takeover Proposal, (v) release any third party from any confidentiality or
standstill agreement to which the Company is a party or fail to reasonably
enforce or grant any material waiver, request or consent to any Takeover
Proposal under, any such agreement or (vi) approve any transaction under, or
any person becoming an "interested stockholder" under, Section 203 of the
DGCL. The Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, and the
Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Representatives of the
Company and its Subsidiaries to, immediately cease and terminate any existing
solicitation, encouragement, discussion or negotiation heretofore conducted by
the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives with
any Person (other than Parent and its Affiliates) with respect to any Takeover
Proposal. The Company shall promptly after the date of this Agreement instruct
each Person which has heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement
relating to any Takeover Proposal with or for the benefit of the Company to
promptly return or destroy all confidential information, documents and
materials relating to a Takeover Proposal or to the Company or its
businesses, operations or affairs heretofore furnished by the Company or any
of its Representatives to such Person or any of its Representatives in
accordance with the terms of any confidentiality agreement with such Person
and immediately terminate any "data room" or similar access of such Persons
and their Representatives. It is understood that any violation of the
restrictions of this Section 5.4 by any Representative of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries shall be deemed a breach of this Section 5.4 by the
Company.

 



38 (b) Notwithstanding Section 5.4(a), prior to the earlier of the Acceptance
Time and the date the Requisite Company Vote is obtained, following the
receipt after the date hereof by the Company of a written Takeover Proposal
that has not resulted from a breach or violation of Section 5.4(a), (i) the
Company Board shall be permitted to participate in discussions regarding such
Takeover Proposal solely to clarify the terms of such Takeover Proposal and
(ii) if the Company Board determines in good faith after consultation with
outside legal counsel and financial advisors that such Takeover Proposal
constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal and
that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the fiduciary
duties of the Company Board to the Companys stockholders under applicable
Law, then the Company may, in response to such Takeover Proposal and upon
prior written notice to Parent, (x) furnish access and non-public information
with respect to the Company and any of its Subsidiaries to the Person who has
made such Takeover Proposal pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement, so long as any written material non-public information provided
under this clause (x) has previously been provided to Parent or is provided
to Parent substantially concurrently (and in any event within 24 hours) with
the time it is provided to such Person, and (y) participate in discussions and
negotiations regarding such Takeover Proposal. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, the Company Board shall be permitted, to the
extent it determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties, to modify, waive, amend or release any existing standstill
obligations owed by any Person to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

(c) From and after the date of this Agreement, the Company shall promptly
(but in any event within 24 hours) notify Parent in writing of (i) the receipt
of any Takeover Proposal or any proposal or offer that would reasonably be
expected to lead to a Takeover Proposal, specifying the material terms and
conditions thereof (and including a copy thereof, if such proposal or offer is
in writing) and the identity of the party making the proposal or offer, and
(ii) any material modifications to the financial or other material terms and
conditions of such Takeover Proposal. Such notice shall contain a statement as
to whether the Company Board has made the determination required by Section
5.4(b) in respect thereof.

 

(d) Except as set forth in Section 5.4(e) and Section 5.4(f), neither the
Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw, qualify, modify
or amend (or publicly propose to withdraw, qualify, modify or amend) the
Company Board Recommendation in any manner adverse to Parent, (ii) approve,
endorse or recommend a Takeover Proposal, or (iii) approve, recommend or
allow the Company to enter into a letter of intent or Contract relating to a
Takeover Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement entered
into following compliance with this Section 5.4) (any of the foregoing, an "
_Adverse Recommendation Change_ ").

 



39 (e) Notwithstanding Section 5.4(d), the Company Board may, at any time before
the earlier of the Acceptance Time and the date the Requisite Company Vote is
obtained, in response to a Superior Proposal received by the Company Board
after the date of this Agreement and not resulting from a breach of this
Section 5.4, terminate this Agreement to enter into a Contract with respect
to such Superior Proposal, but only if:

(i) the Company shall have first provided written notice to Parent at least
four Business Days prior to any such proposed termination that it is prepared
to terminate this Agreement to enter into a Contract with respect to a
Superior Proposal, which notice shall include the material terms and
conditions of the transaction that constitutes such Superior Proposal and the
identity of the party making such Superior Proposal, and shall have given
Parent during such four Business Day period the opportunity to meet or
negotiate with the Company Board and its outside legal counsel to enable
Parent and the Company to discuss or negotiate in good faith a modification of
the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such Superior Proposal is
no longer a Superior Proposal; and

 

(ii) Parent does not make, within four Business Days after the receipt of such
notice (it being understood and agreed that any material change to the
financial or other terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal shall
require an additional notice to Parent and a new two Business Day period), a
binding and irrevocable written and complete proposal (including any schedules
or exhibits) that the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisor, causes the Takeover Proposal that
constituted a Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, at any time
before the earlier of the Acceptance Time and the date the Requisite Company
Vote is obtained, the Company Board may make an Adverse Recommendation Change
if, in response to an Intervening Event or a Takeover Proposal, (i) the
Company Board has concluded in good faith, following consultation with
its outside legal counsel, that its failure to make such Adverse
Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law and (ii) at least four Business Days prior to such Adverse
Recommendation Change, the Company shall have provided to Parent notice
stating that an Intervening Event or a Takeover Proposal has occurred and
describing such Intervening Event or Takeover Proposal and given Parent during
such four Business Day period the opportunity to meet or negotiate with the
Company Board and its outside legal counsel to enable Parent and the Company
to discuss or negotiate in good faith a modification of the terms and
conditions of this Agreement so that the Transactions may be effected.

 

(g) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company from
complying with Rules 14a-9, 14d-9, 14e-2 and Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A
promulgated under the Exchange Act, or from issuing a "stop, look and listen"
statement pending disclosure of its position thereunder or making any required
disclosure to the Companys stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of
the Company Board, after

 



40  consultation with its outside legal counsel, the failure to do so would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law or such disclosure
is otherwise required under applicable Law. For the avoidance of doubt, this
Section 5.4(g) shall not limit any of Parents or Merger Subs rights under
Article 7 in respect of any such position taken or disclosure made.

 

(h) Neither Parent nor Merger Sub, nor any of their respective Affiliates or
Representatives shall make, propose or enter into any formal or informal
arrangements or understandings (whether or not binding) with any Person, or
have any discussions or other communications with any other Person, in any
such case, with respect to any Takeover Proposal involving the Company.

 

Section 5.5 _Company Proxy Statement_.

 

(a) If Merger Sub makes the determination described in subclause (a) of
Section 1.3, Parent shall have the right to request, and in such case, the
Company shall, prepare a draft of the Company Proxy Statement and cause it to
be filed in preliminary form with the SEC no later than the later of (i) the
fifth Business Day following such request and (ii) the twentieth Business Day
following the date of this Agreement. Parent shall provide the Company with
any information that may be required from Parent and Merger Sub in connection
with the preparation and filing of the Company Proxy Statement and any updates
to such information, as appropriate. The Company shall provide Parent with a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such draft, and once such
draft is in a form reasonably acceptable to each of Parent and the Company,
the Company shall file the Company Proxy Statement with the SEC.

(b) The Company agrees that none of the information included or incorporated
by reference in the Company Proxy Statement will, at the date it is first
mailed to the stockholders of the Company or at the time of the Company
Stockholders Meeting or at the time of any amendment or supplement thereof,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading; _provided_ , that no representation or warranty is made by
the Company with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference
therein to the extent based on information supplied by or on behalf of Parent
or Merger Sub or any Affiliate of Parent or Merger Sub in connection with
the preparation of the Company Proxy Statement for inclusion or incorporation
by reference therein.

(c) Parent and Merger Sub hereby covenant and agree that none of the
information supplied by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub or any Affiliate
of Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the
Company Proxy Statement shall, at the date it is first mailed to the
stockholders of the Company or at the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting
or at the time of any amendment or supplement thereof, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading;
_provided_ , that no representation or warranty is made by either Parent or
Merger Sub with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference
therein to the extent based on information supplied by the Company or any
Affiliate of the Company in connection with the preparation of the Company
Proxy Statement for inclusion or incorporation by reference therein.

 



41 (d) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) respond to any
comments on the Company Proxy Statement or requests for additional
information from the SEC as soon as practicable after receipt of any such
comments or requests and (ii) obtain clearance of the Company Proxy Statement
by the SEC as promptly as practicable following the filing thereof. The
Company shall promptly (A) notify Parent upon the receipt of any such comments
or requests and (B) provide Parent with copies of all correspondence between
the Company and its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC and its
staff, on the other hand, to the extent such correspondence relates to the
Company Proxy Statement. Before responding to any such comments or requests or
the filing or mailing of the Company Proxy Statement, the Company (x) shall
provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any
drafts of the Company Proxy Statement and related correspondence and filings
and (y) shall include in such drafts, correspondence and filings all
comments reasonably proposed by Parent.

(e) The Company Proxy Statement shall include the Company Board Recommendation
unless the Company Board has withdrawn, modified or amended the Company Board
Recommendation in accordance with Section 5.4.

Section 5.6 _Company Stockholders Meeting_. The following provisions shall
apply only (i) after the Acceptance Time or the Offer Termination, as
applicable, if adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company
is required under applicable Law to consummate the Merger or (ii) at the
election of Merger Sub pursuant to and in accordance with Section 1.3
following the occurrence of a Conversion Event:

 

(a) Subject to Section 5.4, as promptly as reasonably practical following the
clearance of the Company Proxy Statement by the SEC, the Company shall call
and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of obtaining the
Requisite Company Vote (including causing the Company Proxy Statement to be
mailed to the stockholders of the Company as promptly as practicable).
Subject to Section 5.4, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
solicit or cause to be solicited from its stockholders proxies in favor of
adoption of this Agreement (including by engaging a proxy solicitation firm)
and to take all other actions reasonably necessary to secure the Requisite
Company Vote.

(b) Once the Company Stockholders Meeting has been called and noticed, the
Company shall not postpone, recess or adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting
except: (i) with the consent of Parent, (ii) in order to obtain a quorum in
the absence thereof, or (iii) to allow reasonable additional time for the
filing and distribution of any supplemental or amended disclosure that the
Company Board has determined in good faith (after consultation with its
outside legal counsel) is necessary under applicable Laws and for such
supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated to and reviewed by the
Companys stockholders prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting; _provided_ ,
that no adjournment pursuant to the foregoing clauses (ii) or (iii) may be to
a date on or after two Business Days prior to the Outside Date.

 



42 Section 5.7 _Employees; Benefit Plans_.

 

(a) For a period of one year following the Closing Date, Parent shall, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates
to, provide to each individual who, immediately prior to the Effective Time is
an employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, including any
individual on short-term disability leave immediately prior to the Effective
Time (each, an " _Employee_ ") with (i) at least the same salary or hourly
wage rate provided to such Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time,
(ii) at least the same short-term (annual or more frequent) cash bonus or
commission opportunity provided to such Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and (iii) other compensation and benefits (excluding equity
and equity-based awards, which will remain discretionary) that in the case of
this clause (iii) are either, in Parents sole discretion, (A) not materially
less favorable in the aggregate than those provided as of the date of this
Agreement to the Employees considered as a group or (B) substantially similar
to those being provided to similarly situated employees of Parent (other than
the Employees). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein,
after the Effective Time, nothing herein shall preclude the Surviving
Corporation from terminating the employment of any Employee for any lawful
reason and neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall have any
obligation to retain any employee or group of employees of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries. This Section 5.7(a) shall not apply to any
Person covered by the Executive Agreement or any collective bargaining
agreement.

(b) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and each of their
respective Affiliates to, honor all Company Benefit Plans (including all
severance, change of control and similar plans and agreements) in accordance
with their terms as in effect on the date hereof (subject to any
modification thereof made in accordance with Section 5.1(d) of this
Agreement, subject to any amendment or termination thereof that may be
permitted by such Company Benefit Plans and except as provided herein;
_provided_ , that nothing herein shall prevent the amendment or termination
of any specific plan, program policy, agreement or arrangement, or interfere
with Parents, the Surviving Corporations or any of their respective
Affiliates rights or obligations to make such changes as are necessary to
comply with applicable Law.

(c) For all purposes under any employee benefit plans or arrangement of
Parent, the Surviving Corporation and their respective Affiliates, including
severance, benefit and vacation or other paid-time off benefits (but not for
accrual of pension benefits), made available to any Employee after the
Effective Time (other than any pension plan or other defined benefit plan)
(the " _New Plans_ "), Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
provide that (i) each Employee shall receive credit for such Employees years
of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries before the Effective Time
(including predecessor or acquired entities or any other entities) for

 



43  purposes of eligibility to participate in and vesting thereunder (but not
benefit accrual), (except to the extent such credit would result in a
duplication of accrual of benefits or with respect to New Plans created after
the Effective Time for which similarly situated employees of Parent or the
applicable Affiliate do not receive past service credit), (ii) at the
Effective Time, any waiting time limitation in any New Plan is waived to the
extent such waiting time was satisfied under the similar or comparable Company
Benefit Plan in which such Employee participated immediately before the
Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the " _Old Plans_ "), (iii)
all pre-existing condition exclusions or limitations and actively-at-work
requirements of each New Plan be waived or satisfied for such Employee and his
or her covered dependents to the extent waived or satisfied under the
analogous Old Plan as of the Effective Time and (iv) eligible expenses
incurred by each Employee and his or her covered dependents in respect of the
plan year in which the Closing be taken into account for purposes of
satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements
applicable to such Employee and his or her covered dependents for such
applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such
New Plan. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
no Employee shall have any right by virtue of this Agreement or the
Transactions to participate in any pension plan or other defined benefit plan
maintained by Parent or in Parents supplemental retirement plan.

 

(d) Upon the Closing, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to (i)
assume the liabilities and obligations of the Company set forth in the
collective bargaining agreements (as extended) that cover one or more of the
Employees, and (ii) if necessary to effect such assumption, to accept an
assignment of all or a portion of such liabilities and obligations, in each
case to the extent required by such collective bargaining agreements.

(e) Nothing in this Section 5.7, whether express or implied, shall confer
upon any current or former employee of the Company, Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates, any rights or remedies
including any right to employment or continued employment for any specified
period, of any nature or kind whatsoever under or by reason of this Section
5.7. No provision of this Section 5.7 is intended to modify, amend or create
any employee benefit plan of the Company, Parent, Surviving Corporation or any
of their respective Affiliates.

Section 5.8 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cause all rights to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation now existing
in favor of any present or former director, officer or employee of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") as provided
in (i) the Company Organizational Documents or (ii) agreements between
an Indemnified Party and the Company or one of its Subsidiaries (in effect as
of the date of this Agreement), to survive the Merger and to continue in full
force and effect for a period of not less than six years after the Effective
Time or, if longer, for such period as is set forth in any applicable
agreement with an Indemnified Party in effect on the date of this Agreement.

 



44 (b) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, jointly and severally,
indemnify all Indemnified Parties to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law with respect to all acts and omissions arising out of or
relating to their services as directors, officers or employees of the Company,
its Subsidiaries or another Person, if such Indemnified Party is or was
serving as a director, officer or employee of such other Person at the request
of the Company, whether asserted or claimed at or after or occurring before
the Effective Time (including in connection with the negotiation and
execution of this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions or
otherwise). If any Indemnified Party is or becomes involved in any Legal
Action in connection with any matter subject to indemnification hereunder,
then Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, jointly and severally,
advance as incurred any costs or expenses (including legal fees and
disbursements), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or Liabilities ("
_Damages_ ") arising out of or incurred in connection with such Legal Action,
subject to Parents or the Surviving Corporations, as applicable, receipt of
an undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnified Party, if required by the
DGCL, to repay such Damages if it is ultimately determined under applicable
Law that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified. In the
event of any such Legal Action, (i) each of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall cooperate with the Indemnified Party in the defense of any
such Legal Action and (ii) neither of Parent nor the Surviving Corporation
shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any Legal
Action pending or threatened in writing to which an Indemnified Party is a
party (and in respect of which indemnification could be sought by such
Indemnified Party hereunder), unless such settlement, compromise or consent
includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability
arising out of such Legal Action. 

(c) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, jointly and severally,
maintain in effect for at least six years after the Effective Time the
current policies of directors and officers liability insurance maintained by
the Company or policies of at least the same coverage and amounts containing
terms and conditions that are no less advantageous with respect to
claims arising out of or relating to events which occurred before or at the
Effective Time (including in connection with the negotiation and execution of
this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions) so long as Parent and
the Surviving Corporation are not required to pay an annual premium in excess
of 250% of the last annual premium paid by the Company for such insurance
before the date of this Agreement (such 250% amount being the " _Maximum
Premium_ "). If Parent or the Surviving Corporation are unable to obtain the
insurance described in the prior sentence for an amount less than or equal to
the Maximum Premium, then Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, jointly
and severally, instead obtain as much comparable insurance as possible for an
annual premium equal to the Maximum Premium. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in
lieu of the arrangements contemplated by this Section 5.8(c), before the
Effective Time, the Company shall be entitled to purchase a "tail" directors
and officers liability insurance policy covering the matters described in
this Section 5.8(c) and, if the Company elects to purchase such a policy
before the Effective Time, then Parent and the Surviving Corporations
obligations under this Section 5.8(c) shall be satisfied so long as Parent and
the Surviving Corporation cause such policy to be maintained in effect for a
period of six years following the Effective Time.

 



45 (d) The covenants contained in this Section 5.8 are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and
their respective heirs and legal representatives and shall not be deemed
exclusive of any other rights to which an Indemnified Party is entitled,
whether pursuant to Law, Contract or otherwise.

(e) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties
and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, the Surviving
Corporation shall take all necessary action so that the successors or assigns
of the Surviving Corporation shall succeed to the obligations set forth in
this Section 5.8.

 

Section 5.9 _Reasonable Best Efforts_. Subject to Section 5.10, upon the other
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in
accordance with applicable Law, each of the parties to this Agreement shall,
and shall cause its Affiliates to, use its reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable to ensure that the Offer Conditions and
the conditions set forth in Article VI are satisfied and to consummate the
Transactions as promptly as practicable. The terms of this Section 5.9 shall
not limit the rights of the Company set forth in Section 5.4.

Section 5.10 _Consents; Filings; Further Action_.

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and in
accordance with applicable Law, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to as promptly as practicable (i)
obtain any consents, approvals or other authorizations, and make any filings
and notifications, required in connection with the Transactions and (ii)
make any other submissions either required or reasonably deemed appropriate
by Parent or the Company in connection with the Transactions under the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the HSR Act, the DGCL, the Applicable
Exchange rules and regulations and any other applicable Law. Parent and the
Company shall cooperate and consult with each other in connection with the
making of all such filings and notifications, including by providing copies of
all relevant documents (except to the extent containing confidential
information of such party) to the non-filing party and its advisors before
filing.

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing Section 5.10(a), Parent
and the Company shall as promptly as practicable, but in any event within 10
Business Days following the execution and delivery hereof, file with the
United States Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ") and the United States
Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ ") the notification and report form, if
any, required for the Transactions and any supplemental information requested
in connection therewith pursuant to the HSR Act. Any such notification and
report form or filing and supplemental information shall be in substantial
compliance with the requirements of the HSR Act. Parent and the Company shall
furnish to the other such necessary information and reasonable assistance as
the other may request in connection with its preparation of any filing that is
necessary under the HSR Act. Each party shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain any clearance required under the HSR Act for
the consummation of the Transactions.

 



46 (c) Parent and Company shall keep the other apprised of the status of any
communications with, and any inquiries or requests for additional information
from the FTC, the DOJ, or any other Governmental Authority and shall comply as
promptly as practicable with any such inquiry or request and provide any
supplemental information requested in connection with the filings made
hereunder pursuant to the HSR Act or any other applicable Law. No party shall
participate in any meeting or engage in any material substantive conversation
with any Governmental Authority without giving the other party prior notice
of the meeting or conversation. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, (i) Parent shall have, except where prohibited by applicable Law,
responsibility for determining the strategy for dealing with any
Governmental Authority regarding the application of any applicable antitrust
Laws to the Transactions (provided that Parent shall consult with the Company
with respect to such strategy and keep the Company informed on a reasonably
current basis as to developments and changes in such strategy), including
being entitled to direct any proceedings or negotiations with any Governmental
Authority in respect thereof; (ii) Parent shall not be obligated to contest
any final action or decision taken by the FTC or DOJ or any other
Governmental Authority challenging the consummation of the Transactions, and
(iii) in no event shall Parent be required to (A) sell or otherwise dispose
of, hold separate or agree to sell or dispose of, any assets, categories of
assets or businesses of Parent or its subsidiaries, (B) terminate existing
relationships, contractual rights or obligations or (C) amend or terminate
existing licenses or other intellectual property agreements or enter into new
licenses or other intellectual property agreements to avoid, prevent or
terminate any action by the FTC or DOJ or any other Governmental Authority
which would restrain, enjoin or otherwise prevent consummation of the
Transactions. 

(d) The Company shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (i) take all
actions necessary so that no Takeover Law becomes applicable to the
Transactions and (ii) if any such Takeover Law becomes applicable to the
Transactions, take all actions necessary so that the Transactions may be
consummated as promptly as practicable.

 

Section 5.11 _Public Announcements_. Except as provided for in this Agreement
or required by applicable Law, Parent and the Company shall consult with each
other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public
statements (including via social media) about this Agreement or any of the
Transactions. Neither Parent nor the Company, nor any of their
respective Subsidiaries, shall issue any such press release or make any such
public statement prior to such consultation, except to the extent required by
applicable Law or the Applicable Exchange requirements, in which case that
party shall use its reasonable best efforts to provide a meaningful
opportunity to the other parties to review and comment upon such press release
or other public statement, to consult with the other party before issuing any
such release or making any such public

 



47  statement and shall give due consideration to all reasonable additions,
deletions or changes suggested thereto; _provided_ , that the party seeking to
issue or cause the publication of any such press release or other public
statement shall not be required to consult with the other party or provide any
such review or comment to the other party in connection with any disclosure
contemplated by Section 5.4.

 

Section 5.12 _Fees and Expenses_. Except as explicitly provided otherwise in
this Agreement, whether or not the Transactions are consummated, all expenses
(including those payable to Representatives) incurred by any party to this
Agreement or on its behalf in connection with this Agreement and the
Transactions (" _Expenses_ ") shall be paid by the party incurring those
Expenses, except that Expenses incurred in connection with the preparation,
filing, printing and mailing of the Company Proxy Statement and the filing
fees for any filings made under the HSR Act shall be paid by Parent,
irrespective of the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its
terms.

Section 5.13 _Approval of the Merger_. Unless Parent has elected pursuant to
and in accordance with Section 1.3 to pursue consummation of the Merger
without completion of the Offer, the Merger shall be effected in accordance
with Section 251(h) of the DGCL as soon as practicable following the
Acceptance Time without a vote of the stockholders of the Company.
Immediately following the execution of this Agreement, Parent, as sole
stockholder of Merger Sub, shall adopt this Agreement.

 

Section 5.14 _Section 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
(and shall be permitted to) take such steps as may be reasonably required to
cause dispositions of the Companys equity securities (including derivative
securities) pursuant to the Transactions by each individual who is a director

this Agreement shall become void and of no further force and effect, with no
liability (other than as provided in Section 7.6) on the part of any party to
this Agreement (or any stockholder or Representative of such party);

subsequently consummated, in which case payment shall be

 



53  made within five Business Days following the date on which the Company
consummates such transaction provided, however, that in the event that the
Company Termination Fee becomes payable under this Section 7.6(b)(iii), the
amount payable by the Company shall be reduced by the Expense Amount if
previously paid pursuant to Section 7.6(c) below. For purposes of the
foregoing clause (C) only, references in the definition of the term "Takeover
Proposal" to the figure "20%" shall be deemed to be replaced by "80%."

(c) The Company shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, an amount equal to the Expense Amount, if this

pursuant to Section 7.6(b) (it being understood that the Company will not be
required to reimburse the Expense Amount more than once).

(d) Parent and the Company acknowledge that (i) the fees and other provisions
of this Section 7.6 are an integral part of the Transactions, (ii) without
these agreements, Parent and the Company would not enter into this Agreement
and (iii) any amount payable pursuant to this Section 7.6 does not constitute
a penalty. If the Company fails to pay the Termination Fee or Expense Amount
or any portion thereof and Parent or Merger Sub commences a suit which results
in a judgment against the Company for the Termination Fee or Expense Amount or
any portion thereof, the Company shall pay Parent and Merger Sub their costs
and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements) in
connection with such suit, together with interest on the Termination Fee or
Expense Amount, as applicable (or any portion thereof that has not been paid
timely in accordance with this Agreement) and on the amount of such costs and
expenses at the prime rate published in the _Wall Street Journal_ on the date
such payment was required to be made through the date of payment.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Parents right to
receive the Company Termination Fee and/or Expense Amount pursuant to this
Section 7.6 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy (whether at law, in equity,
in contract, tort or otherwise) of such party and its Affiliates, as
applicable, for (x) any Damages suffered as a result of the failure of the
Merger to be consummated and (y) any other Damages suffered as a result of or
under this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
upon payment of the Company Termination Fee and/or Expense Amount in
accordance with this Section 7.6, neither the Company nor any of its
stockholders, directors, officers, agents or other Representatives shall have
any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except in the
case of a willful material breach or intentional material breach of
this Agreement; _provided_ , that the foregoing shall not impair the rights
of Parent and Merger Sub, if any, to obtain an injunction, specific
performance or other equitable relief pursuant to Section 8.14 prior to any
termination of this Agreement. In no event will the Company be obligated to
pay the Company Termination Fee or Expense Amount on more than one occasion
pursuant to this Section 7.6.

Agreement contain all of the terms, conditions and representations and
warranties agreed to by the parties relating to the subject matter of this
Agreement and supersede all prior or contemporaneous agreements,
negotiations, correspondence, undertakings, understandings, representations
and warranties, both written and oral, among the parties to this Agreement

confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies
hereunder, including the right to rely upon the representations and warranties
set forth herein.

 

Section 8.11 _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions of this
Agreement. If any provision of this Agreement, or the application of that
provision to any Person or any circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable,

provision in order to carry out, so far as may be valid and enforceable, the
intent and purpose of the invalid or unenforceable provision and (b) the
remainder of this Agreement and the application of that provision to other
Persons or circumstances shall not be affected by such invalidity or
unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or unenforceability affect the
validity or enforceability of that provision, or the application of that
provision, in any other jurisdiction.

in negotiating and drafting this Agreement. If an ambiguity or a question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if
drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any
provision of this Agreement. Subject to and without limiting the introductory
language to Article III and Article IV, each party to this Agreement has or
may have set forth information in its respective disclosure letter in a
section of such disclosure letter that corresponds to the section of this
Agreement to which it relates. The fact that any item of information is
disclosed in a disclosure letter to this Agreement shall not constitute an
admission by such party that such item is material, that such item has had or
would have a Company Material Adverse Effect or Parent Material Adverse
Effect, as the case may be, or that the disclosure of such be construed
to mean that such information is required to be disclosed by this Agreement.

 



65 Section 8.13 _Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall
inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their permitted successors and
assigns. No party to this Agreement may assign or delegate, by operation of
law or otherwise, all or any portion of its rights or liabilities under this

Agreement, which any such party may withhold in its absolute discretion. Any
purported assignment without such prior written consents shall be void.

specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the
parties to this Agreement shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions
to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the Chosen Courts,
this being in addition to any other remedy at law or in equity, and the
parties to this Agreement hereby waive any requirement for the posting of any
bond or similar collateral in connection therewith. The parties acknowledge
and agree that each party hereto shall be entitled to an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.
Each party hereto agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that
(a) the other party has an adequate remedy at law or (b) an award of specific
performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity. 

Section 8.15 _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be executed in
any number of counterparts, as if the signatures to each counterpart were
upon a single instrument, and all such counterparts together shall be deemed
an original of this Agreement. Facsimile signatures or signatures received as
a pdf attachment to electronic mail shall be treated as original signatures
for all purposes of this Agreement. This Agreement shall become effective
when, and only when, each party hereto shall have received a counterpart
signed by all of the other parties hereto.

of such date, as though made on and as of such date (except for

be true and correct in all respects (other than in the case of de minimis

conditions of the Agreement. The failure by Parent, Merger Sub or any other
Affiliate of Parent at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall
not be deemed a waiver of any such right, the waiver of any such right with
respect to particular facts and circumstances shall not be deemed a waiver
with respect to any other facts and circumstances and each such right shall be
deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any time and from time to
time.

Capitalized terms used in this _Exhibit A_ but not defined herein shall have
the meanings set forth in the Agreement to which it is attached.
