(a) At or prior to the anticipated Effective Time, the Buyer Parties shall
appoint an exchange agent reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "

Merger Consideration in accordance with this _Article III_. Prior to the

provisions as to which Parent and the Company may reasonably agree (which
letter of transmittal shall specify that the delivery of the Merger
Consideration shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only
upon proper delivery of the applicable share certificates to the Exchange
Agent if the applicable shares of Common Stock are certificated) (the "
_Letter of Transmittal_ ") for use in effecting delivery of shares of Common
Stock to the Exchange Agent. No later than 15 Business Days prior to the

with this _Article III_ , evidence of book entry shares or awards to the
extent possible or in the alternative shares in certificated form representing

Consideration and the aggregate Per Share Equity Consideration (such Parent
Shares and cash, together with cash in lieu of fractional shares in accordance
with _Section 3.4_ and any dividends or distributions with respect to the
Parent Shares in accordance with _Section 3.3(h)_, being hereinafter referred
to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ") payable pursuant to _Section 3.3(a)_ in
exchange for outstanding shares of Common Stock. The Exchange Agent shall,
pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the Merger Consideration
contemplated to be paid pursuant to _Section 3.1_ out of the Exchange Fund.
Except as specified in this _Section 3.3_, the Exchange Fund shall not be
used for any other purpose. At the election of Parent, Parent may pay the cash
value of the Per Share Equity Consideration (based on the Parent VWAP) that
would otherwise be issued to a Seller that is a non-accredited investor. If a
Seller delivers, no later than 2 Business Days prior to the anticipated
Closing Date, a properly completed letter of transmittal surrendering such
Sellers shares of Common Stock effective as of the Closing, Parent and EHSI
shall cause the Exchange Agent to pay the Merger Consideration in respect of
such Sellers shares of Common Stock at the Closing.

(c) The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as
directed by Parent on a daily basis in (i) short term direct obligations of
the United States of America with maturities of no more than thirty (30) days
or (ii) short term obligations for which the full faith and credit of the
United States of America is pledged to provide for payment of all principal
and interest; _provided_ , that no gain or loss thereon shall affect the
amounts payable to the holders of Common Stock pursuant to this _Article
III_. If for any reason (including losses) the cash in the Exchange Fund shall
be insufficient to fully satisfy all of the payment obligations to be made in
cash by the Exchange Agent hereunder, Parent and EHSI shall promptly deposit
cash into the Exchange Fund in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in
the amount of cash required to fully satisfy such cash payment obligations.

 

(d) Each holder of shares of Common Stock, Net Option Shares, or Net RSU
Shares that have been converted into a right to receive the
Merger Consideration, upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a properly
completed and validly executed Letter of Transmittal (together with the
certificates representing such securities, if any) in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to
such instructions, will be entitled to receive (i) one or more Parent Shares
(which shall be in uncertificated book entry form to the extent possible or in
the alternative shares in certificated form) representing, in the aggregate,
the whole number of Parent Shares that such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to _Section 3.1_; and (ii) by wire transfer of immediately available
funds an amount equal to the cash portion of the Merger Consideration that
such holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section 3.1_ and the other
provisions contained in this _Article III_ , including cash payable in lieu of
fractional shares in accordance with  _Section 3.4_ and dividends and other
distributions in accordance with _Section 3.3(h)_. No interest shall be paid
or accrued on any Merger Consideration, cash payable in lieu of fractional
shares in accordance with  _Section 3.4_ or

 



20  dividends and other distributions in accordance with _Section 3.3(h)_.
Until so surrendered, each such share of Common Stock shall, after the
Effective Time, represent for all purposes only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, cash payable in lieu of fractional shares in accordance
with _Section 3.4_ and dividends and other distributions in accordance with
_Section 3.3(h)_.

 

(e) If any cash payment is to be made to a Person other than the Person in
whose name the applicable surrendered share of Common Stock is registered, it
shall be a condition of such payment that the Person requesting such payment
shall pay, or cause to be paid, any transfer or other Taxes required by reason
of the making of such cash payment to a Person other than the
registered holder of the surrendered share of Common Stock, or required for
any other reason relating to such holder or requesting Person, or shall
establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been
paid or is not payable. If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be
registered in the name of a Person other than the Person in whose name the
applicable surrendered share of Common Stock is registered, it shall be a
condition to the registration thereof that the surrendered share of Common
Stock shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer
and that the Person requesting such delivery of the Merger Consideration shall
pay, or cause to be paid, to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other Taxes
required as a result of such registration in the name of a Person other than
the registered holder of such share of Common Stock or establish to the
satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not
payable.

 

(f) At the Effective Time, the share transfer books of the Company shall be
closed and thereafter, there shall be no further registration of Transfers of
shares of Company Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time, the holders
of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of Common
Stock except the right to receive the consideration provided for, and in
accordance with the procedures set forth, in this _Article III_ or as
otherwise provided herein or by applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time,
certificates representing shares of Common Stock are presented to the
Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, such certificates shall
be canceled and exchanged for the consideration provided for, and in
accordance with the procedures set forth, in this  _Article III_.

(g) Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any
investments thereof) that remains undistributed to the holders of shares of
Common Stock one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be returned to
Parent, upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged his, her or its
shares of Common Stock for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this
_Section 3.3_ prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent or
Buyer for delivery of the Merger Consideration in respect of such holders
shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Parent, Buyer, Merger Sub, the
Company nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder of shares
of Company Common Stock for any Merger Consideration or other amounts
delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar laws.

(h) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Shares issued
in the Merger shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered shares of
Common Stock until such shares of Common Stock are surrendered as provided in
this _Section 3.3_. Following such surrender, subject to the effect of
escheat, Tax or other applicable Law, there shall be paid, 

 



21  without interest, to the record holder of the Parent Shares issued in
exchange therefor (i) at the time of such surrender, all dividends and other
distributions payable in respect of such Parent Shares with a record date
after the Effective Time and a payment date on or prior to the date of such
surrender and not previously paid and (ii) at the appropriate payment date,
the dividends or other distributions payable with respect to such Parent
Shares with a record date after the Effective Time but with a payment date
subsequent to such surrender. For purposes of dividends or other distributions
in respect of Parent Shares, all Parent Shares to be issued pursuant to
the Merger shall be entitled to dividends pursuant to the immediately
preceding sentence as if issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time.

 

(i) Any portion of the Merger Consideration deposited with the Exchange Agent
pursuant to this _Section 3.3_ to pay for Dissenting Shares for which
appraisal rights shall have been perfected shall be returned to Parent or
Buyer upon the settlement or final and non appealable adjudication of any
claim for appraisal rights asserted with respect to such Dissenting Shares.

 

(j) All Merger Consideration issued and paid to a holder of Company Common
Stock upon conversion of the Company Common Stock in accordance with the
terms hereof (including any cash paid pursuant to _Section 3.3(h)_ or
_Section 3.4_) shall be deemed to have been issued and paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Common Stock.

 

3.4 _Fractional Shares_. No fractional Parent Shares shall be issued in the
Merger. All fractional Parent Shares that a single Stakeholder would be
entitled to receive shall be aggregated and calculations shall be rounded to
three decimal places. In lieu of any such fractional shares, each Stakeholder
otherwise entitled to a fractional interest in a Parent Share shall be
entitled to receive a cash payment in lieu thereof (rounded to the nearest
cent), which payment shall be determined by multiplying (a) the Parent VWAP by
(b) the fractional interest in a Parent Share such holder would otherwise
be entitled to receive pursuant to Section 3.1(a). As soon as practicable
after determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to Stakeholders
in lieu of any fractional Parent Shares, the Exchange Agent shall make
available such amounts, without interest, to the Stakeholders entitled to
receive such cash.

3.5 _Lost Certificates_. If any certificate representing shares of Common
Stock shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Surviving Corporation,
the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as the
Surviving Corporation may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against it with respect to such certificate, the Exchange Agent will
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate the Merger
Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such certificate as contemplated by this _Article III_
(including any cash payable in respect of such shares in lieu of fractional
shares in accordance with _Section 3.4_ and any dividends or distributions
payable in accordance with _Section 3.3(h)_).

 



22 3.6 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, with respect to each share of Common Stock as to which the holder
thereof shall have properly complied with the provisions of Section 262 of the
DGCL as to appraisal rights (each, a " _Dissenting Share_ "), if any, such
holder shall be entitled to payment, solely from the Surviving Corporation,
of the appraisal value of the Dissenting Shares to the extent permitted by and
in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL; provided,
however, that (a) if any holder of Dissenting Shares, under the circumstances
permitted by and in accordance with the DGCL, affirmatively withdraws his, her
or its demand for appraisal of such Dissenting Shares, (b) if any holder of
Dissenting Shares fails to establish his, her or its entitlement to appraisal
rights as provided in the DGCL or (c) if any holder of Dissenting Shares takes
or fails to take any action the consequence of which is that such holder is
not entitled to payment of the appraisal value for his, her or its shares
under the DGCL, such holder or holders (as the case may be) shall forfeit the
right to appraisal of such shares of Common Stock and such shares of Common
Stock shall thereupon cease to constitute Dissenting Shares and such shares
of Common Stock shall be deemed converted as of the Effective Time into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in this _Article III_.
The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands received by the
Company for appraisal of shares of Common Stock, and Parent shall have the
right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such
demands. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of
Parent, (i) voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for
appraisal for Dissenting Shares, (ii) offer to settle any such demands, (iii)
waive any failure to timely deliver a written demand for appraisal in
accordance with the DGCL or (iv) agree to do any of the foregoing.

3.7 _Treatment of Options and RSUs_.

 

(a) _Options_. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall take all necessary
or appropriate actions (and provide reasonable evidence thereof to Parent at
the Closing) so that, at the Closing, each outstanding Option (whether vested
or unvested) shall be cancelled in exchange for (i) an amount of cash equal to
(A) an amount equal to the Per Share Cash Consideration minus the Pro Rata
Escrow Portion minus the Pro Rata Stakeholder Representative Expense Fund
Portion multiplied by (B) the Net Option Shares and (ii) a number of Parent
Shares, subject to _Section 3.4_ of this Agreement, equal to the Per Share
Equity Consideration multiplied by the Net Option Shares ((i) and (ii), the "
_Option Closing Consideration_ "). The Option Closing Consideration shall be
paid to an Option holder in accordance with the provisions of  _Section
3.3_. Any additional consideration, when, as and if it becomes available,
shall be paid in respect of the Net Option Shares in accordance with _Section
3.9_. " _Net Option Shares_ " shall mean the number of shares of Common Stock
that the Option holder would have received had such Option holder exercised
the Option immediately prior to Closing on a net share basis assuming the
surrender of a number of shares of Common Stock with a fair market
value (based on the Parent VWAP) equal to the sum of the Companys unpaid tax
withholding obligation with respect to such exercise (the " _Option Tax
Withholding Obligation_ ") and the exercise price of the Option.

 

(b) _RSUs_. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall take all necessary or
appropriate actions (and provide reasonable evidence thereof to Parent at the
Closing) so that, at the Closing, each outstanding RSU (whether vested or
unvested) shall be cancelled in exchange for (i) an amount of cash equal to
(A) an amount equal to the Per Share 

 



23  Cash Consideration minus the Pro Rata Escrow Portion minus the Pro Rata
Stakeholder Representative Expense Fund Portion multiplied by (B) the Net RSU
Shares and (ii) a number of Parent Shares, subject to _Section 3.4_ of this
Agreement, equal to the Per Share Equity Consideration multiplied by the Net
RSU Shares ((i) and (ii), the " _RSU Closing Consideration_ "). The RSU
Closing Consideration shall be paid to an RSU holder in accordance with the
provisions of _Section 3.3_. Any additional consideration, when, as and if it
becomes available, shall be paid in respect of the Net RSU Shares in
accordance with _Section 3.9_. " _Net RSU Shares_ " shall mean the number of
shares of Common Stock that the RSU holder would have received had such RSU
been settled immediately prior to Closing on a net share basis assuming the
surrender of a number of shares of Common Stock with a fair market value
(based on the Parent VWAP) equal to the Companys unpaid tax withholding
obligation with respect to such exchange (the " _RSU Tax Withholding
Obligation_ " and together with the Option Tax Withholding Obligation, the "
_Equity Award Tax Withholding Obligation_ ").

(c) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall take all necessary or
appropriate actions to ensure that neither any holder of Options and RSUs, nor
any other participant in the Company Stock Plan shall, from and after the
Closing, have any right thereunder to acquire any securities of the Company
or to receive any payment or benefit with respect to any award previously
granted under the Company Stock Plan, except as provided in this _Section
3.7_ the Company shall take all necessary actions to terminate the Company
Stock Plan effective upon the Closing.

3.8 _Closing Statement; Purchase Price Adjustment_.

 

(a) The Company will prepare or cause to be prepared in good faith and
delivered to Parent not later than five (5) Business Days prior to the
anticipated Closing Date the Estimated Closing Date Statement, together with a
written statement of the Company, signed by an executive officer of the
Company, setting forth in reasonable detail (and together with reasonable
supporting documentation) the calculations to be set forth on the Transaction
Consideration Disbursement Schedule. In the event that Parent objects to any
such amounts or calculations, Parent shall notify the Company in writing of
such objections no later than three (3) days prior to the Closing Date.
Parent and the Company shall cooperate in good faith to resolve such
objection(s), if any, prior to the Closing; if such objection(s) is not
resolved within three (3) days following receipt of the objection by the
Company, then the Company shall make a good faith determination with respect
to such objection and shall modify the Estimated Closing Date Statement and
such accompanying calculations, as applicable, as it deems
reasonably appropriate; _provided_ , _however_ , that, no position or
agreement made or taken by any of the parties with respect to the Estimated
Closing Date Statement and/or such accompanying calculations shall preclude
any such party from taking any other position or making any other argument
with respect to the Parent Post-Closing Statement and/or accompanying
calculations, as applicable. The parties agree that in no event shall Closing
be delayed as a result of the discussions contemplated by the preceding
sentence.

 



24 (b) _Post-Closing Date Adjustments_.

 

(i) As soon as reasonably practicable, but in no event later than ninety (90)
days after the Closing Date, Parent and EHSI shall, in good faith, prepare,
or cause to be prepared, and deliver to the Stakeholder Representative a
statement (the " _Parent Post-Closing Statement_ ") setting forth the
calculation of (A) Closing Working Capital, (B) the Cash Amount, (C) the Debt
Amount, and (D) the Company Transaction Expenses (such amounts being referred
to herein as the " _Proposed Amounts_ ").

 

(ii) In connection with Stakeholder Representatives review of the Parent
Post-Closing Statement, Parent and EHSI shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, (A) provide the Stakeholder Representative and its authorized
Representatives with reasonable access to the relevant books and records,
facilities and employees, its and its accountants work papers, schedules and
other supporting data as may be reasonably requested by the Stakeholder
Representative; and (B) otherwise cooperate in good faith with the Stakeholder
Representative and its authorized Representatives, including by providing on
a timely basis all information necessary or useful in the calculation of the
Proposed Amounts.

(iii) If the Stakeholder Representative disagrees with Parents calculation
of any of the Proposed Amounts set forth in the Parent Post-Closing Statement,
the Stakeholder Representative shall promptly, but in no event later than
thirty (30) days following the Stakeholder Representatives receipt of the
Parent Post-Closing Statement (the " _Review Period_ "), deliver to Parent
written notice describing in reasonable detail the dispute by specifying
Proposed Amounts items or amounts as to which the Stakeholder Representative
disagrees, together with the Stakeholder Representatives determination of
such dispute items and amounts (a " _Dispute Notice_ "). Unless the
Stakeholder Representative delivers a Dispute Notice to Parent on or prior to
the expiration of the Review Period, the Stakeholder Representative (on behalf
of the Stakeholders) shall be deemed to have accepted and agreed to the
Proposed Amounts and the Proposed Amounts shall be final, binding and
conclusive on the parties hereto. During the thirty (30) days (the "
_Resolution Period_ ") after the delivery of the Dispute Notice, Parent and
the Stakeholder Representative shall attempt in good faith to resolve
any such dispute and to finally determine the Proposed Amounts. Any
resolution by Parent and the Stakeholder Representative during the Resolution
Period as to any item identified in the Dispute Notice shall be set forth in
writing and will be final, binding and conclusive. If Parent, EHSI and the
Stakeholder Representative are not able to resolve all disputed items
identified in the Dispute Notice within the Resolution Period, then the items
that remain in dispute shall be submitted to a nationally recognized,
independent accounting firm reasonably acceptable to Parent, EHSI and the
Stakeholder Representative, which firm shall be instructed to, within ten (10)
days, select an independent and impartial partner from such firm, who shall
act as an expert (the " _Accountant_ ") to review the issues in dispute.

 



25 (iv) If any remaining issues in dispute are submitted to the Accountant
for resolution, Parent, EHSI and the Stakeholder Representative will be
afforded an opportunity to present to the Accountant any material relating to
the determination of the matters in dispute and to discuss such matters with
the Accountant. Parent, EHSI and the Stakeholder Representative shall give
the Accountant access to all documents, records, work papers, facilities and
personnel of such party and its Subsidiaries as reasonably necessary to
perform its function. The Accountant shall calculate, based solely on the
written submissions of Parent and the Stakeholder Representative, and not by
independent investigation, the items in dispute and shall be instructed that
the Accountants calculation (i) must be made in accordance with the
standards and definitions in this Agreement, and (ii) with respect to each
item in dispute, must be within the range of values established for such
amount as determined by reference to the value assigned to such amount by the
Stakeholder Representative in the Dispute Notice and by Parent and EHSI in the
Parent Post-Closing Statement.

(v) The Accountant shall be instructed to deliver to Parent and the
Stakeholder Representative, as promptly as practicable and in any event within
forty five (45) days after his or her appointment, a written decision setting
forth the Accountants determination of the items in dispute, each as
determined in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Such award shall be
final and binding upon the parties to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law and may be enforced in any court having jurisdiction.
Notwithstanding anything else contained herein, no party may assert that any
award issued by the Accountant is unenforceable because it has not been timely
rendered. The fees and expenses of the Accountant shall be
borne proportionately by Parent and EHSI, on the one hand, and the
Stakeholder Representative (on behalf of the Stakeholders), on the other hand,
on the basis of the discrepancy (in dollars) between the aggregate value
established for all disputed items by each such party as presented to the
Accountant and the aggregate value of the final and binding determination of
such disputed items by the Accountant.

 

(c) The final, binding and conclusive calculation of Closing Working Capital,
Cash Amount, Debt Amount and the Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses based
either upon agreement or deemed agreement by Parent and the Stakeholder
Representative or the written determination delivered by the Accountant, in
each case, in accordance with this _Section 3.8_, will be the "
_Final Working Capital_ ," " _Final Cash Amount_ ," " _Final Debt Amount_ "
or " _Final Company Transaction Expenses_ ," as the case may be (collectively,
the " _Final Amounts_ "), for all purposes of this Agreement.

 



26 (d) On the third (3rd) Business Day after the determination of the Final
Amounts in accordance with this _Section 3.8_:

(i) if the Adjustment Amount is a negative amount, an amount in dollars equal
to the absolute value of such amount (plus interest on such amount from the
Closing Date up to but excluding the date on which such payment is made at a
rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate, calculated on the basis of a
year of 360 days and the actual number of days elapsed) shall be delivered to
Buyer by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated
by Parent from the Purchase Price Escrow Fund, and the remaining amount, if
any, in the Purchase Price Escrow Fund shall be distributed to the
Stakeholders in accordance with _Section 3.9_ and the Purchase Price Escrow
Agreement; or

 

(ii) if the Adjustment Amount is a positive amount, Parent, EHSI or the
Surviving Corporation shall pay an amount in dollars equal to such amount (
_plus_ interest on such amount from the Closing Date up to but excluding the
date on which such payment is made at a rate per annum equal to the Federal
Funds Rate, calculated on the basis of a year of 360 days and the actual
number of days elapsed) to the Stakeholders in accordance with _Section 3.9_,
and the amount in the Purchase Price Escrow Fund shall be distributed to the
Stakeholders in accordance with _Section 3.9_ and the Purchase Price Escrow
Agreement.

3.9 _Additional Merger Consideration_. When, as and if any additional
consideration becomes available for distribution to the Stakeholders in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Purchase Price Escrow
Agreement, it shall be distributed pro rata among the Stakeholders on a Fully
Diluted Shares basis; _provided_ , _however_ , when, as and if such
additional consideration becomes available for distribution to the
Stakeholders in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, holders of
Dissenting Shares shall not be entitled to receive such additional
consideration.

 

3.10 _Further Action_. If at any time after the Effective Time, any further
action is necessary to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title
and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of the Company, the directors and officers of the Surviving
Corporation are fully authorized in the name of the Company and Merger Sub to
take all such lawful and necessary action.

3.11 _Withholding_. Each of Parent, Buyer, Merger Sub and the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Exchange
Agent to deduct and withhold, from any amount payable pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect
to the making of any such payment under the Code or any provision of
applicable Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over
to the appropriate Taxing Authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of shares of Common Stock, Options or RSUs, as applicable, in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, Buyer, Merger Sub,
the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, any compensatory amounts payable in
cash pursuant to or as contemplated by this Agreement for which withholding is
required shall be remitted to the Company or applicable payroll agent for
payment to the applicable Person through their regular payroll procedures, as
applicable.

 



27 3.12 _Purchase Price Escrow Funds_. As of the Closing Date, Parent, Buyer, the
Escrow Agent and the Stakeholder Representative shall execute and deliver the
Purchase Price Escrow Agreement, and Parent or EHSI shall deposit with the
Escrow Agent an amount equal to the Purchase Price Escrow Fund solely for the
purpose of securing certain adjustment payments set forth in _Section 3.8_
of this Agreement. The Purchase Price Escrow Fund shall be held by the Escrow
Agent under, and released pursuant to, the terms of the Purchase Price Escrow
Agreement. The Purchase Price Escrow Fund shall be held in trust and shall
not be subject to any Lien, attachment, trustee process or any other judicial
process of any creditor of any party, and shall be held and disbursed solely
for the purposes and in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Price
Escrow Agreement.

(a) The Parent Shares are registered pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Exchange
Act and Parent is, since March 4, 2014, a "reporting issuer" in each Province
of Canada within the meaning of applicable Canadian Securities Laws and is not
on the list of reporting issuers in default under applicable Canadian
Securities Laws, and no securities commission or similar regulatory authority
has issued any order preventing or suspending trading of any securities of
Parent, and Parent is in compliance in all material respects with applicable
Canadian Securities Laws and requirements under the Exchange Act or the
Securities Act, as the case may be.

(b) Parent is in compliance in all material respects with the requirements of
the TSX and NASDAQ for continued listing of the Parent Shares thereon. Parent
has not taken any action designed to terminate, or likely to have the effect
of terminating, the registration of the Parent Shares under the Exchange Act
or the listing of such shares on the TSX or NASDAQ.

(c) Trading in Parent Shares on the TSX and NASDAQ is not currently halted or
suspended. No delisting, suspension of trading or cease trading order with
respect to any securities of Parent is pending or, to the knowledge of Parent,
threatened. To the knowledge of Parent, as of the date of this Agreement, no
inquiry, review or investigation (formal or informal) of Parent by any
securities commission or similar regulatory authority under the Exchange Act,
the Securities Act, Canadian Securities Laws, the TSX or NASDAQ is in effect
or ongoing or expected to be implemented or undertaken.

 

(d) Except as set forth above in this _Section 5.5_, neither Parent nor any
of its Subsidiaries is subject to continuous disclosure or other public
reporting requirements under any securities Laws.

 



53 (e) Since March 31, 2013 (or, in Canada, since March 4, 2014), Parent has
timely filed all forms, reports, statements and documents, including
financial statements and managements discussion and analysis required to be
filed by Parent under applicable Canadian Securities Laws, the Exchange Act or
the Securities Act, as the case may be and the rules and policies of the TSX
and NASDAQ. The documents in the Parent Public Disclosure Record, as at the
respective dates filed, were in compliance in all material respects with
applicable Canadian Securities Laws, the Exchange Act, the Securities Act
and, where applicable, the rules and policies of the TSX and NASDAQ.

(f) None of the documents in the Parent Public Disclosure Record, as of their
respective dates (and, if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date
hereof, then on the date of such filing), contained any untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

 

5.6 _Financial Statements_.

 

(a) The Parent Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP
applied on a basis consistent with those of previous periods and in
accordance with applicable Laws except as otherwise stated in the notes to
such statements or in the auditors report thereon and subject, in the case of
the Parent Interim Financial Statements, to year-end audit adjustments, which
are not material individually or in the aggregate, and may omit notes which
are not material and are not required by applicable Laws or GAAP. The Parent
Annual Financial Statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of operations,
consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) and consolidated
statements of cash flows of Parent and the Subsidiaries of Parent as of the
respective dates thereof and for the respective periods set forth therein.
All of such documents in the Parent Public Disclosure Record (including any
financial statements included or incorporated by reference therein), as of
their respective dates (and as of the date of any amendment to the respective
document in the Parent Public Disclosure Record), complied as to form in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and
the Exchange Act.

 

(b) Parent has designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused
them to be designed under the supervision of its Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer, to provide reasonable assurance that material
information relating to Parent is made known to the Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer by others within Parent and the Parent Material
Subsidiaries. 

(c) Parent has designed such internal controls over financial reporting, or
caused them to be designed under the supervision of the Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer of Parent, to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. To
the knowledge of Parent, since March 31, 2013: (i) there have been no
significant deficiencies in the design or operation of, or material weaknesses
in, the internal controls over financial reporting of Parent that are
reasonably likely to adversely affect Parents ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial information and (ii) there is and has been no
fraud, whether or not material, involving management or any other employees
who have a significant role in the internal control over financial reporting
of Parent. To the knowledge of

 



54  Parent, since March 31, 2013, Parent has received no (x) complaints from any
source regarding accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters
or (y) written reports from employees of Parent regarding questionable
accounting or auditing matters.

5.7 _Absence of Certain Changes_. From December 31, 2014 to the date hereof,
Parent and each of its Subsidiaries has conducted its business in the ordinary
course in all material respects and in a manner consistent with prior practice
in all material respects. Since December 31, 2014, there has not been any
event or occurrence of any condition that, individually or in the aggregate,
has had a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

5.8 _No Undisclosed Liabilities_. Parent and its Subsidiaries do not have any
obligations or liabilities (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or
otherwise) of a type required by GAAP to be reflected or reserved against on
the Parent Financial Statements (including any footnotes thereto), except (i)
liabilities reflected on the Parent Balance Sheet or disclosed in the
notes thereto, (ii) liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business
since December 31, 2014, and which are not material to Parent and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (iii) liabilities that would not reasonably
be expected to be, individually or in the aggregate, material to Parent and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

5.9 _Compliance with Laws_. The businesses of each of Parent and its
Subsidiaries are being operated and, since March 31, 2013, have been operated,
in compliance in all material respects with and are not in material violation
of, and since March 31, 2013, none of Parent or its Subsidiaries has received
any written notice alleging any material violation by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries with respect to any applicable Laws which apply to the conduct of
the business, or the ownership or operation of the properties or assets, of
Parent and its Subsidiaries.

5.10 _Litigation_. There is no, and since March 31, 2013 there has not been
any Claim, or to Parents Knowledge, investigation or allegation, whether at
law or in equity, before or by any Governmental Entity or any arbitrator,
pending and unsealed against Parent, Buyer, EHSI, Irish Holdco or Merger Sub,
or to Parents Knowledge, pending and sealed or threatened against Parent or
any Subsidiary of Parent, which would, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to be material to Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole. There are no material Orders outstanding against Parent or any
Subsidiary of Parent. Neither Parent, nor any Subsidiary of Parent nor, to
Parents Knowledge, any officer, director or employee, third-party
manufacturer or contract research organization of Parent or any Subsidiary of
Parent has been permanently or temporarily enjoined or otherwise prohibited,
precluded, debarred, or restricted by any Law or Governmental Entity from
engaging in or continuing any conduct or practice in connection with
the business or assets of Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent.

5.11 _Anti-Bribery; Sanctions_. Except as would not be material to Parent and
its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, neither Parent, nor any of its
Subsidiaries, nor to Parents Knowledge, any of their respective
Representatives has, in connection with the operation of their respective
businesses, (i) used or promised any Parent or other funds for unlawful
contributions, payments, gifts or entertainment, or made any unlawful
expenditures relating to political activity to government officials, including
health care professionals employed by government-owned hospitals, candidates
or members of political parties or organizations, or established or

 



55  maintained any unlawful or unrecorded funds in violation of the FCPA, as if
it were applicable to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries at that time, or any
other similar applicable Law, (ii) paid, promised, accepted or received any
unlawful contributions, payments, expenditures or gifts or (iii) violated or
operated in noncompliance with any export restrictions, anti-boycott
regulations, embargo regulations or other applicable domestic or foreign
Laws.

5.12 _Sufficiency of Funds_.

 

(a) Parent has delivered to the Company complete and correct copies of (i) an
executed commitment letter, including all exhibits, schedules and annexes
thereto, from the lenders party thereto (collectively, the " _Lenders_ "),
dated as of May 18, 2015 (the " _Commitment Letter_ ") and (ii) a fee letter
related thereto, dated as of May 18, 2015 ( _provided_ , _however_ , that the
fee amounts, pricing caps and other economic terms, and the rates and amounts
included in the "market flex" provisions (but not covenants), may be redacted,
none of which redacted provisions could adversely affect the conditionality,
enforceability, termination or aggregate principal amount of the Debt
Financing) in each case, as the same may be amended and/or replaced after the
date of this Agreement in accordance with _Section 7.9_ (collectively, the "
_Debt Commitment Letters_ "), pursuant to which the Lenders have, upon the
terms and subject only to the conditions set forth therein, severally agreed
to lend the amounts set forth therein to Subsidiaries of Parent for the
purpose of funding the Transactions (the provision of such funds as set forth
therein, the " _Debt Financing_ "). The Debt Commitment Letters are (i) legal,
valid and binding obligations of Irish Holdco and, to Parents Knowledge,
each of the other parties thereto and (ii) enforceable in accordance with
their respective terms against Irish Holdco, subject to the Bankruptcy and
Equity Exception. Prior to the date hereof, none of the Debt Commitment
Letters have been amended or modified, and there are not contemplated to be
any, and as of the date hereof the respective obligations and commitments
contained in the Debt Commitment Letters have not been withdrawn or rescinded
in any respect and, to Parents Knowledge, as of the date hereof, assuming the
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Sections 8.1_ and _8.2_ , no
event has occurred that would result in any breach or violation of,
or constitute a default under, any Debt Commitment Letter. There are no
conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the funding of the Debt
Financing, other than as set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters. As of the
date hereof, Parent does not have any reason to believe that (i) any party
thereto will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term of the Debt
Commitment Letters, (ii) any of the conditions to the Debt Financing will not
be satisfied or (iii) the Debt Financing will not be available to Irish
Holdco on the Closing Date (except to the extent Irish Holdco incurs a Bond
Financing to replace the Debt Financing on or prior to the Closing Date).
Irish Holdco has fully paid (or caused to be fully paid) any and all
commitment fees or other fees required by the Debt Commitment Letters to be
paid on or before the date of this Agreement. Subject to Irish Holdcos right
to amend or replace the Debt Commitment Letters pursuant to  _Section 7.9_,
there are no, and there are not contemplated to be any, other agreements or
arrangements to which Parent or any of its Affiliates are a party relating to
the Debt Financing.

 

(b) Assuming the Debt Financing is funded in accordance with the conditions
set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters and the satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in _Sections 8.1_ and _8.2_ , the net proceeds
contemplated by the Debt Financing, together with

 



56  other existing financial commitments and resources and cash on hand of
Parent or its Subsidiaries at the Closing, taken together, are and will be
sufficient to enable Parent and Buyer to fulfill their obligations hereunder,
and to pay all amounts to be paid by them hereunder on and after the Closing
Date and any related fees and expenses.

 

5.13 _Brokers_. Except as set forth in _Section 5.13_ of the Parent
Disclosure Schedule, no agent, broker, investment banker, financial advisor
or other firm or Person is or shall be entitled, as a result of any action,
agreement or commitment of Parent or any of its Affiliates, to any brokers,
finders, financial advisors or other similar fee or commission in
connection with the Transactions.

5.14 _Investment Intent_. Each of Parent, Buyer, EHSI, Irish Holdco and Merger
Sub acknowledges that neither the offer nor the sale of Company Stock has
been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or under any
state or foreign securities laws. Parent is acquiring the Company Stock for
its own account for investment, without a view to, or for a resale in
connection with, the distribution thereof in violation of the Securities Act
or any applicable state securities laws and with no present intention of
distributing or reselling any part thereof.

 

5.15 _EXCLUSIVITY OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES_. EXCEPT AS SET FORTH IN
_ARTICLE V_ OF THIS AGREEMENT AND IN THE CERTIFICATES DELIVERED BY PARENT
PURSUANT TO _SECTIONS 8.3(a)_ AND _8.3(b)_ , PARENT, BUYER, EHSI, IRISH HOLDCO
AND MERGER SUB DO NOT MAKE AND HAVE NOT MADE ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY IN
CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. PARENT, BUYER, EHSI,
IRISH HOLDCO AND MERGER SUB EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIONS OR
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND OR NATURE, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED; _PROVIDED_ , _HOWEVER_ ,
THAT THE FOREGOING SHALL NOT BE INTERPRETED TO WAIVE ANY RIGHTS THAT
THE COMPANY, THE SELLERS OR THE STAKEHOLDER REPRESENTATIVE (ON BEHALF OF THE
STAKEHOLDERS) HAVE WITH RESPECT TO RECOVERY FOR BREACHES OF REPRESENTATIONS
AND WARRANTIES IN THIS AGREEMENT.

an outside counsel basis only.

7.4 _Public Disclosure_. Parent and the Company agree that all matters solely
related to the Transactions in the initial press release with respect to the
Transactions shall be reasonably agreed upon by Parent and the Company. Parent
and the Company further agree to communicate with each other and reasonably
cooperate with each other prior to any other disclosure to any third party
(other than Representatives) of these Transactions. Parent and the Company
agree that no disclosure shall be made to any third party (other than their
respective Representatives, the Sellers and their respective Affiliates and
Representatives), and no public release or announcement shall be issued, in
each case concerning the terms of the Transactions, without the prior written
consent of the other parties, except as such release or announcement
(including in any current report on Form 8-K, quarterly report on Form 10-Q or
annual report on Form 10-K required to be filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission or any report or other document required by any United
States securities exchange) may be required by Law or the rules or regulations
of any United States or foreign securities exchange or other Governmental
Entity, in which case (unless otherwise required by Law) the party required
to make the release or announcement shall allow the other parties reasonable
time to review such release or announcement in advance of such issuance. None
of the limitations in this _Section 7.4_ shall apply to the disclosure of
information concerning this Agreement or the Transactions (i) in connection

7.5 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_.

 

(a) If the Closing occurs, the Buyer Parties and the Company agree that all
rights to exculpation, indemnification and all limitations on liability
existing in favor of any officer, director or manager of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, in each case that is an individual (collectively, the "
_Company Indemnitees_ "), as provided in the Certificate, by-laws or other
organizational documents of the Company or any such Subsidiary effective as of
immediately prior to the Closing shall survive the consummation of the
Transactions and continue in full force and effect and be honored by the
Company for at least six (6) years after the Closing. The obligations of the
Company under this _Section 7.5(a)_ shall not be terminated or modified in
such a manner as to adversely affect any Company Indemnitee to whom this
_Section 7.5(a)_ applies without the consent of such affected Company
Indemnitee (it being expressly agreed that the Company Indemnitees to whom
this _Section 7.5(a)_ applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this
_Section 7.5(a)_). If the Closing occurs, the Company shall pay all expenses
to any Company Indemnitee incurred in successfully enforcing the indemnity or
other obligations provided for in this _Section 7.5(a)_.

 



65 (b) The Buyer Parties will cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, at the
Buyer Parties sole expense, for a period of not less than six (6) years from
the Closing Date, to the Persons who are covered by the existing DandO insurance
of the Company and its subsidiaries an insurance and indemnification policy
that provides coverage for events occurring prior to the Closing Date (the "
_D andO Insurance_") that is no less favorable than the Companys existing
policy or, if substantially equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the
best available coverage; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Buyer Parties
shall not be required to pay an annual premium for the DandO Insurance in excess
of three hundred percent (300%) of the last annual premium paid by the Company
prior to the date of this Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ that the Buyer
Parties may, prior to the Closing Date, purchase pre-paid non-cancellable run-
off directors and officers liability insurance on terms substantially
similar to the directors and officers liability policies currently
maintained by the Company, but providing coverage for a period of six years
following the Closing Date with respect to claims arising from or relating to
facts or events which occurred on or prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that in no event shall the Buyer Parties be required to spend
premiums for any insurance referred to in this _Section 7.5(b)_ to the extent
the costs would exceed three hundred percent (300%) of the Companys current
annual premium for directors and officers liability insurance, in which case
Parent shall purchase the maximum amount of insurance available up to the
foregoing limit.

 

(c) In addition to the other rights provided for in this _Section 7.5_ and
not in limitation thereof, from and after the Effective Time, the Buyer
Parties shall cause the Surviving Company (a " _D andO Indemnifying Party_") to,
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, (i) indemnify and hold
harmless (and exculpate and release from any liability to Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries) the Company Indemnitees
against all DandO Expenses and all losses, claims, damages, judgments, fines,
penalties and amounts paid in settlement (" _D andO Losses_") in respect of any
threatened, pending or completed claim, action, inquiry, suit, proceeding,
arbitration or judgment, whether criminal, civil, administrative or
investigative, based on, arising out of, relating to or in connection with the
fact that such Person is or was a director, officer, employee or other
fiduciary of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or of any other Person
arising out of or relating to acts or omissions occurring or existing (or
alleged to have occurred or existed) at or prior to the Effective Time
(including in respect of acts or omissions in connection with this Agreement
or any of the transactions contemplated hereby) (a " _D andO Indemnifiable
Claim_") and (ii) advance, to such DandO Indemnified Persons all DandO Expenses
incurred in connection with any DandO Indemnifiable Claim (including in
circumstances where the DandO Indemnifying Party is otherwise entitled to assume
the defense of such claim and has assumed such defense) promptly after
receipt of statements therefor; _provided_ , that any Company Indemnitee to
whom DandO Expenses are to be advanced provides an undertaking to repay such
advances to the extent it is ultimately and finally determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction that such Company Indemnitee is not entitled to
indemnification. Advance payment of DandO Expenses in connection with any DandO
Indemnifiable Claims shall continue until such DandO Indemnifiable Claim
is disposed of or all judgments, orders, decrees or other rulings in
connection with such DandO

 



66  Indemnifiable Claim become final and nonappealable and are fully and finally
satisfied. For the purposes of this _Section 7.5(c)_, " _D andO Expenses_"
shall include attorneys fees, expert fees, arbitrator and mediator fees, and
all other costs, charges and expenses paid or incurred in connection with
investigating, defending, being a witness in or otherwise participating in
(including on appeal), or preparing to defend, to be a witness in or
participate in, any DandO Indemnifiable Claim, but shall exclude losses, claims,
damages, judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement (which
items are included in the definition of DandO Losses).

(d) If the Surviving Corporation, or any of the Buyer Parties, or any of their
successors or assigns, shall (a) be liquidated and dissolved, (b)
consolidated with or merged into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger, or (c) sell or
otherwise transfer all or a majority of its assets to any other Person,
proper provisions shall be made so that the continuing or surviving entity or
Parent, as applicable, and its successors and assigns shall assume the
obligations set forth in this _Section 7.5_. The provisions of this 
_Section 7.5_ shall survive the Closing and are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each indemnified party described in
this _Section 7.5_ and his or her heirs and representatives, and are in
addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification
or contribution that any such Person may have had by contract or by Law.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any Claim (whether arising
before, at or after the Closing) is made against any Person covered by DandO
Insurance on or prior to the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Closing, the
provisions of this _Section 7.5_ shall continue in effect until the final
disposition of such Claim.

 

7.6 _Notification of Certain Matters_. During the Pre-Closing Period, the
Buyer Parties shall give prompt notice to the Company, and the Company shall
give prompt notice to Parent, of (a) the occurrence of any event which would
or would be reasonably expected to (i) prevent or materially delay the
consummation of the Merger or the other Transactions or (ii) result in the
failure of any condition to the Merger set forth in _Article VIII_ to be
satisfied, (b) the receipt by such party of any written notice or other
written communication from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person
is or may be required in connection with the Transactions, (c) the receipt by
such party of any written inquiry or investigation from any Governmental
Entity that would reasonably be expected to have an adverse impact on the
Companys ability to consummate the Transactions in any material respect, or
(d) to Parents Knowledge or Companys Knowledge, as applicable, a Claim that
arises against or affecting such party (i) that, if it were pending on the
date of the Agreement, would have been required to be disclosed pursuant to
this Agreement, or (ii) that would reasonably be expected to have an adverse
impact on the Companys or Parents ability to consummate the Transactions in
any material respect. Notwithstanding the above, the delivery of, or failure
to deliver, any notice pursuant to this _Section 7.6_ will not expand, limit
or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving
such notice or the conditions to such partys obligation to consummate the
Transactions.

 



67 7.7 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) For a period of one (1) year following the Closing, Parent and EHSI shall
cause the Company to either (i) provide each employee of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries who is employed immediately prior to the Closing (each a
" _Covered Employee_ ") who remains employed during such period by Parent, the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries with compensation and
benefits (excluding equity based compensation) which have a value
substantially comparable in the aggregate to the compensation and benefits
provided to such Covered Employee by the Company and the Companys
Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the Closing or (ii) provide or cause
the Company (or, in such case, its successors or assigns) to provide each
Covered Employee who remains employed during such period by Parent, the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries with compensation and
benefits (excluding equity based compensation) which have a value
substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided to a similarly
situated employee of Parent and its Subsidiaries, _provided_ , that in the
case of either (i) or (ii), the annual salary or base pay, as applicable, of
each Covered Employee as in effect immediately prior to the Closing shall not
be reduced during such period. In addition, for a period of one (1)
year following the Closing, Parent and EHSI shall or shall cause the Company
to provide Covered Employees whose employment is terminated by Parent or the
Company with severance benefits in accordance with such employees individual
employment agreement or, in the absence of any such agreement, in accordance
with the severance policy of the Company or the Companys Subsidiaries, as
applicable, in effect immediately prior to Closing. Notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary, commencing at the Closing, the terms and
conditions of employment for any individual who is employed by the Company or
any Subsidiary of the Company and whose employment is subject to a Collective
Bargaining Agreement shall be governed by such Collective Bargaining
Agreement until its expiration, modification or termination in accordance with
its terms and applicable Laws.

 

(b) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall take all necessary actions to
cause the Companys Retirement Savings Plan (the " _Company 401(k) Plan_ ")
to terminate as of immediately prior to the Closing, unless the Company
receives notification by Parent no later than three days prior to the Closing
Date that the Company 401(k) Plan shall not so terminate. All resolutions,
notices or other documents to be issued, adopted or executed in connection
with such termination shall be provided to Parent in advance. As of the
Closing Date, Parent and EHSI shall have in place a tax qualified
defined contribution retirement plan in which Covered Employees who were
eligible to participate in the Company 401(k) Plan immediately prior to the
Closing Date are eligible to participate (the " _Parent 401(k) Plan_ "). The
Parent 401(k) Plan shall permit each such Covered Employee with an account
balance in the Company 401(k) Plan to make rollover contributions of "eligible
rollover distributions" (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code)
to the Parent 401(k) Plan, in the form of cash or loan promissory notes as
applicable, in an amount equal to all or any portion of the account balance
distributed to such Covered Employee from the Company 401(k) Plan.

 

(c) With respect to any employee benefits that are provided to Covered
Employees from and after the Closing under employee benefits plans of Parent
or its subsidiaries (" _Parent Plans_ "), service accrued by Covered Employees
during employment with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their
predecessors prior to the Closing shall be recognized for all purposes to
the same extent as such service was taken into account under the
corresponding Company Employee Plan. With respect to any medical, dental or
other welfare benefits that are provided under Parent Plans to Covered 

 



68  Employees, Parent and EHSI shall cause to be waived any applicable pre-
existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements or other
similar limitations, eligibility waiting periods and evidence of insurability
requirements to the extent waived or satisfied by a Covered Employee under any
Company Employee Plan as of the Closing Date, and for the plan year in which
the Closing Date occurs, any expenses incurred during the portion of the plan
year in which such Covered Employee participated in a Company Employee Plan
shall be taken into account under such Parent Plan for purposes of satisfying
applicable deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket
provisions. Parent shall have no obligation and the Company shall take no
action that would have the effect of requiring Parent or the Company to
continue any specific plans (except with respect to existing employment
agreements) or to continue the employment of any specific Person. No
provision of this Agreement shall be treated as an amendment to any particular
employee benefit plan of Parent, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries.

 

7.8 _280G Matters_. Following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall
provide Parent with a copy of Section 280G calculations for its disqualified
individuals (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code). If any Person
would be subject to any excise tax imposed under Section 4999 of the Code,
then the Company shall provide such Person(s) with the opportunity to subject
any payments that could constitute a "parachute payment" pursuant to Section
280G of the Code to a stockholder vote in a manner intended to comply with the
stockholder vote requirements under Section 280G of the Code and the
applicable regulations and, if such Person agrees to subject such payments to
such a stockholder vote, the Company shall submit such payment to a
stockholder vote in a manner that satisfies Section 280G of the Code and the
applicable regulations. Prior to providing the Companys stockholders with
any materials necessary to comply with such stockholder vote, the Company
shall provide a copy of such materials to Parent in sufficient time to allow
Parent to comment thereon and shall consider any such comments in good faith;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall have a right to consent (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld) to any description of compensation
arrangements, other than with respect to any Company Employee Plan, that
continue after the Closing Date.

7.9 _Financing_.

 

(a) Each of Parent, Irish Holdco and EHSI shall use its reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange the Debt Financing
on the terms and conditions described in the Debt Commitment Letters, no later
than the Closing Date, including using its reasonable best efforts to (i)
maintain in full force and effect the Debt Commitment Letters, (ii) satisfy on
a timely basis all conditions applicable to Parent and its Subsidiaries in the
Debt Commitment Letters that are within their control, (iii) comply with all
covenants and agreements of Parent and its Subsidiaries set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letters to the extent a breach thereof would result in a failure of
a condition precedent to the Debt Financing or otherwise make the funding of
the Debt Financing less likely to occur; (iv) enter into definitive
agreements with respect to the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters (including the exercise of any
"market flex" provisions in any related fee letter) or on such other terms
that would not be prohibited by clauses (i)  (iii) of _Section 7.9(d)_; and
(v) consummate the Debt Financing at or prior to the Closing. In the event any
portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions
contemplated in the Debt

 



69  Commitment Letters for any reason, Parent, Irish Holdco or EHSI shall
provide written notice thereof to the Company as soon as reasonably
practicable and shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain alternative
financing from alternative sources, as promptly as practicable following the
occurrence of such event; _provided_ , _however_ , that such obligation shall
be limited to obtaining alternative financing on comparable or more favorable
terms, in the aggregate, to Parent and Irish Holdco than as contemplated by
the Debt Commitment Letters (as determined in the reasonable good-faith
judgment of Parent and taking into account the "market flex" provisions
thereof). Each of Parent, Irish Holdco and EHSI shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the lenders and any other Persons providing Debt Financing to
fund on the Closing Date the Debt Financing required to consummate the
Transactions if all conditions to Closing contained in _Section 8.1_ and
_Section 8.2_ are satisfied or waived (by the applicable party that is the
beneficiary of such condition), other than those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Closing (but subject to the fulfillment or
waiver of such condition by the applicable party that is the beneficiary of
such condition). Parent and EHSI shall keep the Company informed upon
reasonable request, in reasonable detail with respect to all material
activity concerning the Debt Financing (including the status thereof). Without
limiting the foregoing, Parent and EHSI agree to notify the Company promptly,
and in any event within two (2) Business Days as the same comes to
the knowledge of Parent, if at any time prior to the Closing Date (i) the
Debt Commitment Letters or any of the commitments with respect to the Debt
Financing thereunder or any definitive financing agreement, as applicable,
shall expire or be terminated for any reason (or if any Person attempts or
purports in writing to terminate the Debt Commitment Letters, whether or not
such attempted or purported termination is valid), (ii) for any reason, all or
a portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable, (iii) any Financing
Source or any other Person that is a party to the Debt Commitment Letters
materially breaches, defaults, terminates or repudiates any provisions
thereunder or threatens in writing to do any of the foregoing or (iv) a
material dispute or disagreement arises between or among any parties to the
Debt Commitment Letters regarding satisfaction of a condition precedent to the
availability of the Debt Financing on the Closing Date.

 

(b) The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to provide to Parent and
Irish Holdco, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause its Subsidiaries
and their respective Representatives to provide to Parent and Irish Holdco
prior to the Closing, such cooperation that may be reasonably requested by
Parent or Irish Holdco and that is reasonably necessary or customary, proper
or advisable in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing or any
capital markets debt financing undertaken in replacement of all or any portion
of the Debt Financing (the " _Bond Financing_ ", and together with the
Debt Financing, the " _Financing_ "), including using reasonable best efforts
with respect to: (i) participation in, and assistance with, the marketing
efforts related to the Financing, including causing its management team and
other representatives to assist in preparation for and to participate in a
reasonable number of meetings, presentations, roadshows, due diligence
sessions, drafting sessions and sessions with rating agencies, in each case,
upon reasonable notice and at mutually agreeable dates and times; (ii) at

Date; (iii) furnishing Parent and the Financing Sources with financial and
other pertinent financial

 



70  information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries as may be reasonably

Required Financial Information; (iv) cause its independent auditors to
cooperate with the Financing consistent with their customary practice,
including by participating in a reasonable number of drafting sessions,
providing customary "comfort letters" (including customary negative
assurances) and customary assistance with the due diligence activities of
Parent, Irish Holdco and the Financing Sources (including by participating in
a reasonable number of accounting due diligence sessions), and request
their customary consents to the inclusion of audit reports in any relevant
marketing materials; (v) assisting Parent, Irish Holdco and the Financing
Sources in the preparation of (A) offering documents, prospectuses,
registration statements, syndication documents and materials, including bank
information memoranda (confidential and public), private placement memoranda,
offering memoranda, lender and investor presentations, prospectuses and
similar documents for the Financing and (B) materials for rating agency

described in the Debt Commitment Letters; and (viii) executing and delivering
any customary certificates or documents and facilitating the delivery of

required to take any action under any such agreement that is not contingent
upon the Closing or that would be effective prior to the consummation of the

Subsidiaries logos in connection with the Financing; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that such logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended to or
reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company or its Subsidiaries or the
reputation or goodwill of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.
Notwithstanding any other provision set forth herein or in any other agreement
between the Company and Parent (or its Affiliates), the Company agrees that
Parent and its Affiliates may share customary projections with respect to the
Company and its business with the Financing Sources identified in the Debt
Commitment Letters, and that Parent and its Affiliates and such
Financing Sources may share such information with potential Financing Sources
in connection with any marketing efforts in connection with the Financing;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the recipients of such information and any other

and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) incurred by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with providing the assistance
contemplated by this _Section 7.9_ and (2) indemnify and hold harmless the
Company and its Subsidiaries and its and their respective directors,
officers, personnel and advisors from and against any and all liabilities,
losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses (including attorneys fees),
interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or incurred in connection
with the Financing or any assistance or activities in connection therewith
(other than (x) arising from fraud, intentional misrepresentation, willful
misconduct, bad faith or gross negligence of the Company, its Subsidiaries or
their respective Representatives or (z) written historical information
provided in writing by the Company specifically for use in connection with the
Financing).

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent and
Irish Holdco shall have the right from time to time to amend, replace,
supplement or otherwise modify, or waive any of its rights under, the Debt
Commitment Letters or any definitive agreements with respect to the Debt
Financing, and/or substitute other debt or equity financing for all or any
portion of the Debt Financing from the same and/or alternative financing
sources; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such amendment, replacement,
supplement or other modification to or waiver of any provision of the Debt
Commitment Letters or the definitive agreements with respect to the Debt
Financing shall not (i) reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing
(such that the aggregate funds that would be available to Parent on the
Closing

 



72  Date would not be sufficient to provide the funds required to be funded on
the Closing Date to consummate the Merger), (ii) add or expand the conditions
precedent or contingencies to the funding on the Closing Date of the Debt
Financing as set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters or (iii) otherwise
expand, amend, modify or waive any provision of the Debt Commitment Letters in
a manner that in any such case would reasonably be expected to (x) delay or
make less likely the funding of the Debt Financing (or satisfaction of the
conditions precedent to the funding of the Debt Financing) on the Closing Date
or otherwise prevent, delay or impair the Transactions contemplated by this
Agreement in any material respect or (y) adversely affect the ability of the
Buyer Parties to timely consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby or enforce Irish Holdcos rights against the other
parties to the Debt Commitment Letters; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent
and Irish Holdco may replace or amend the Debt Commitment Letters to add
lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities
who had not executed the Debt Commitment Letters as of the date hereof. For
the avoidance of doubt, the effectiveness of the Required Amendments (as
defined in Exhibit A to the Commitment Letter), to the extent they reduce any
portion of the Debt Financing as a result thereof, shall also be subject to
the foregoing conditions in clauses (ii) and (iii). In such event, the term "
_Debt Commitment Letters_ " as used herein shall be deemed to include the new
commitment letters entered into in accordance with this _Section 7.9(d)_ or
_Section 7.9(a)_, as applicable, and the terms " _Financing_ ," and " _Debt
Financing_ ," as used herein shall be deemed to include any substitute debt
or equity financing obtained in accordance with this _Section 7.9(d)_ or
_Section 7.9(a)_, as applicable; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event
any portion of the Financing or Debt Financing becomes unavailable on
the terms and conditions contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letters
delivered on the date hereof, the second sentence of _Section 7.9(a)_, and
not this _Section 7.9(d)_ shall govern with respect to the terms of any
replacement financing to be obtained after any portion of the Debt Financing
becomes unavailable as described therein.

(e) Prior to or at the Closing, the Company shall deliver an executed payoff
letter (the " _Debt Payoff Letter_ ") in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Parent for the Par Credit Agreement (a draft of which shall be
provided to Parent no less than 1 business day prior to the anticipated
Closing Date). The Debt Payoff Letter shall (A) confirm the full outstanding
amount then outstanding, along with accrued interest thereon and all fees and
other obligations of the Company accrued under the Par Credit Agreement, (B)
contain payment instructions and (C) evidence the satisfaction, release and
discharge of the debt and liabilities under the Par Credit Agreement and the
agreement by such lenders to release all Liens upon the payment of such
amount in accordance with the payment instructions. Prior to or at the
Closing, the Company shall have obtained documents, including an authorization
to file UCC termination statements upon such payment, executed terminations
and releases of outstanding mortgages, as are reasonably necessary to release
such Liens. The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, cooperate
with Parent, upon Parents reasonable request, so that the Senior Notes may be
called for redemption and satisfied and discharged at the Closing (including
with cash necessary to redeem such notes (using a premium calculated as of the
date of the notice of redemption) deposited with the trustee of such notes).

 



73 (f) In no event shall the receipt or availability of any funds or financing by
or to Parent or any of its Affiliates or any other financing transaction
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Debt Financing or the issuance of
a Bond Financing) be a condition to any of the obligations of Parent, Buyer,
EHSI, Irish Holdco or Merger Sub hereunder.

7.10 _Resignations_. On the Closing Date, the Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause to be delivered to Parent duly signed
resignations (including releases), effective as of the Closing, of the members
of the boards of managers, boards of directors and officers (but not
employment), as applicable, of the Company and its Subsidiaries, other
than those Persons who Buyer specifies to the Company at least five (5)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date.

7.11 _Additional Financial Statements_. For each month ending on or after
June 30, 2015 prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause to be delivered to Parent, within ten (10) days
after delivery to the majority stockholders of the Company, copies of all
monthly management reports and financial statements provided to the majority
stockholders of the Company in the ordinary course of business.

 

7.12 _Termination of Certain Agreements_. All agreements between any Seller or
any Affiliate of any Seller (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries), on
the one hand, and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the other hand,
listed on _Section 7.12_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be
terminated as of the Closing Date, and all obligations and
liabilities thereunder shall be satisfied prior to the Closing with the
Company and its Subsidiaries not being subject to any post-Closing liability
or obligation of any nature with respect thereto (except the indemnity
contained in the Management Services Agreement shall survive in accordance
with its terms).

7.13 _Treatment of Senior Notes_.

 

(a) Subject to _Sections 7.13(b)_ and _7.13(d)_ , the Company shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to, to the extent permitted by the Senior Notes
Indenture, (i) at Parents request, issue a notice of optional redemption (the
" _Redemption Notice_ ") for all of the outstanding principal amount of the
Senior Notes pursuant to the requisite provisions of the Senior Notes
Indenture and (ii) take actions reasonably requested by Parent that are
reasonably necessary for the satisfaction and discharge of the Senior Notes
pursuant to the applicable provisions of the Senior Notes Indenture, and
shall, at Parents request, call for redemption and satisfy and discharge
such Senior Notes at the Closing (including causing cash necessary to redeem
the Senior Notes (using a premium calculated as of the date of the Redemption
Notice) to be deposited with the trustee under the Senior Notes) in
accordance with the terms of the Senior Notes Indenture (the " _Debt
Redemption_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that to the extent that the
redemption can be conditioned on the occurrence of the Closing, it will be so
conditioned, and, on the earlier of (i) the redemption date and (ii) the date
of satisfaction and discharge, the Buyer Parties shall deposit with the
trustee under the Senior Notes Indenture cash or cash equivalents sufficient
to effect such redemption and satisfaction and discharge (and in the event of
any loss with respect to the funds deposited with the trustee, the Buyer
Parties shall deposit additional funds sufficient to satisfy such redemption
and satisfaction and discharge). The parties

 



74  hereto shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, and shall
use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to cause their respective
representatives to, provide cooperation reasonably requested by the other in
connection with the Debt Redemption.

(b) The Buyer Parties shall prepare all necessary and appropriate
documentation in connection with any Debt Redemption, including the Redemption
Notice. The parties hereto shall, and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to, reasonably cooperate with each other in the preparation of
any Redemption Notice. All mailings to the holders of the Senior Notes in
connection with any Debt Redemption shall be subject to the prior review of,
and comment by, the Company and its legal counsel, and shall be reasonably
acceptable to them.

 

(c) During the period prior to Closing, the Company shall, and shall cause
each of its Subsidiaries to, use its reasonable best efforts to take, at the
Buyer Parties expense, all actions required to complete the restructuring
steps set forth on Section 7.13 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule; _provided_
, that the actions to be taken pursuant to this  _Section 7.13(c)_ shall be
conditioned upon the Closing (the " _Restructuring_ ").

(d) The Buyer Parties shall reimburse the Company and its Subsidiaries for
all of their reasonable costs and expenses incurred in connection with any
Debt Redemption promptly following the incurrence thereof. The Buyer Parties
shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and
each of their respective Affiliates, from and against any and all liabilities,
losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and
penalties (excluding, to the extent previously reimbursed, the costs and
expenses referred to in the immediately preceding sentence) suffered or
incurred by any such Person, or to which any such Person may become subject,
that arise out of the Debt Redemption or the Restructuring, or any actions
taken or not taken by the Company, or taken at the request of Parent,
pursuant to _Sections 7.13(a)_ , _7.13(b)_ and _7.13(c)_ or the transactions
contemplated thereby. Nothing in _Sections 7.13(a)_ and _7.13(b)_ shall
require the Company to take, or cause any other Person to take, any action
that is not permitted by the Senior Notes Indenture or applicable Law.

7.14  _Stockholder Consent_. The Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause an executed irrevocable written consent of the stockholders
of the Company, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit D, that constitutes the
Stockholder Consent to be delivered to Parent promptly following execution of
this Agreement.

7.15 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall take
all such steps as may be reasonably necessary to cause any acquisitions of
Parent Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Parent
Common Stock) resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
by each Person who will become subject to the reporting requirements with
respect to Parent, to be exempt under Rule 16b(3) promulgated under the
Exchange Act.

 



75 7.16 _Listing_. Parent shall prepare and submit to NASDAQ a listing
application covering the shares of Parent Shares to be issued in the Merger
prior to the Effective Time and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
such Parent Shares to be authorized for listing on NASDAQ, subject to official
notice of issuance, prior to the Closing Date.

7.17 _DTC Cooperation._ Parent will cooperate with the Sellers, and use
commercially reasonable efforts to take such steps as are requested by the
Sellers, to have the Parent Shares issued in connection with the Merger held
through the Depository Trust Company (" _DTC_ ") in electronic book entry form
and be eligible for DTCs Deposit and Withdrawal Custodian Service, in each
case as promptly as practicable following the Closing.

Closing (with respect to _Sections 9.1(b)_ through 9.1(h), by written notice
by the terminating party to the other party):

(a) by mutual written consent of Parent and the Company; or

  



77 (b) by either Parent, or the Company, in writing if the Merger shall not have
been consummated by November 18, 2015 (the " _Final Date_ ") provided that,
if on the Final Date (A) the condition to Closing set forth in _Section
8.1(a)_ shall not have been satisfied but all other conditions to Closing set
forth in _Article VIII_ shall have been satisfied or waived (other than those
conditions that by their nature can only be satisfied at the Closing, provided

Final Date shall be extended, if Parent or the Company notifies the other
party in writing prior to the Final Date, to February 12, 2016 or (B) if the
Marketing Period has not ended prior to the Final Date, then the Final Date

this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.1(b)_ shall not be available to
any party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement shall

_provided_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this 
_Section 9.1(c)_ shall not be available to any party whose failure to fulfill
any obligation under this Agreement shall have been the primary cause of, or

(d) by Parent, if there has been a breach of or failure to perform any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of the Company
set forth in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i) would
cause the conditions set forth in _Section 8.1_ or _Section 8.2_ not to be
satisfied and (ii) is incapable of being cured prior to the Closing Date by
the Company or shall not have been cured within thirty (30) days following
receipt by the Company of written notice of such breach or failure to perform
from Parent; _provided_ , that Parent shall not have the right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.1(d)_ if it or Merger Sub is then
in breach of any of their respective covenants set forth in this Agreement
that would result in the closing conditions set forth in  _Section 8.1_ or
_Section 8.3_ (other than those conditions which by their terms are to be
satisfied at the Closing, each of which is capable of being satisfied at the
Closing) not being satisfied; or

 

(e) by the Company, if there has been a breach of or failure to perform any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of Parent or
Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i)
would cause the conditions set forth in _Section 8.1_ or _Section 8.3_ not
to be satisfied and (ii) is incapable of being cured prior to the Closing
Date by Parent or shall not have been cured within thirty (30) days following
receipt by Parent of written notice of such breach or failure to perform from

terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.1(e)_ if it is then in
breach of any of its covenants set forth in this Agreement that would result
in the closing conditions set forth in _Section 8.1_ or  _Section 8.2_
(other than those conditions which by their terms are to be satisfied at the
Closing, each of which is capable of being satisfied at the Closing) not being
satisfied; or

 



78 (f) by the Company, if (i) all of the conditions set forth in _Section 8.1_
and  _Section 8.2_ have been satisfied (other than those conditions that by
their terms are to be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing, each of which
is capable of being satisfied at the Closing), (ii) Parent shall have failed
to consummate the Merger by the time set forth in _Section 2.2_ (including
the proviso thereto), and (iii) at the time of such termination, the Company
stood ready and willing to consummate the Merger;

 

(g) by the Company, if (i) all of the conditions set forth in _Section 8.1_
and _Section 8.2_ have been satisfied (other than those conditions that by
their terms are to be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing, each of which
is capable of being satisfied at the Closing), (ii) Parent shall have failed
to consummate the Merger by the date that is two Business Days prior to the
Final Date, and (iii) at the time of such termination, the Company stood ready
and willing to consummate the Merger (regardless of whether a Marketing Period
has been initiated or concluded); or

 

(h) by Parent, if the executed irrevocable written consent of the stockholders
of the Company, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit D, that constitutes
the Stockholder Consent is not delivered to Parent promptly following the
execution of this Agreement.

9.2 _Effect of Termination_.

(a) In the event of the termination of this Agreement as provided in _Section
9.1_, this Agreement shall immediately become void and there shall be no
liability or obligation on the part of Parent, the Company or their respective
officers, directors, stockholders or Affiliates; _provided_ , _however_ , that
(a) any such termination shall not relieve any party from liability for
Fraud, for obligations described under _Section 9.2(b)_ or _Section 9.2(c)_
or otherwise for damages for any Intentional Breach of this Agreement, and (b)
the provisions of  _Sections 6.2_ (Confidentiality) and _9.3_ (Fees and
Expenses), this _Section 9.2_ (Effect of Termination) and _Article X_
(Miscellaneous) of this Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect and survive any termination of this
Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, damages for Intentional Breach of this
Agreement (i) by any party shall include any and all money damages and (ii) by
Buyer, Irish Holdco, EHSI, Merger Sub or Parent shall include, in addition,
the benefit of the bargain lost by holders of Company Stock, Options or RSUs
(taking into consideration all relevant matters, including the expected
premium, other combination opportunities, other strategic alternatives and
the time value of money), and the Company may, on behalf of such holders,
accept damages for any such Intentional Breach. The Buyer Parties shall be
deemed to be in Intentional Breach of this Agreement if the Buyer Parties fail
to consummate the Merger by the time required in _Section 2.2_ (including
the proviso thereto) if all conditions set forth in _Sections 8.1_ and _8.2_
have been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their terms are to
be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing, each of which is capable of
being satisfied at the Closing) and the Company stood ready and willing to
consummate the Merger at such time. The Company shall be deemed to be in
Intentional Breach of this Agreement if a duly executed irrevocable consent
of the stockholders of the Company, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit D,
that constitutes the Stockholder Consent shall not have been delivered to
Parent within 24 hours following the execution of this Agreement.

 



79 (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if this Agreement is terminated by (i)
either Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section 9.1(c)_, (ii) the Company
pursuant to _Section 9.1(f)_ or _Section 9.1(g)_ or (iii) either Parent or
the Company pursuant to _Section 9.1(b)_ and, in the case of this subclause
(iii), at or prior to the time of such termination all of the conditions to
the obligations of Parent to consummate the Closing set forth in _Section
8.1(c)_ and _Section 8.2_ shall have been satisfied or waived (other than
those other conditions that, by their nature, cannot be satisfied until the
Closing, but which conditions would be capable of satisfaction if the Closing
were to occur on the date of termination), then Parent or EHSI shall pay to
the Company a fee of Seven Hundred Fifty Million Dollars ($750,000,000) (the
" _Reverse Termination Fee_ ") (which fee shall be payable within two (2)
Business Days after written notice of such termination, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by the
Company).

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary (but subject
to and without limitation of _Section 10.12_ and the proviso to this
sentence), the Company agrees that in the event that this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with _Section 9.1_ and the Reverse Termination Fee
is payable pursuant to _Section 9.2(b)_ and the Reverse Termination Fee is
paid to the Company pursuant to _Section 9.2(b)_ and accepted by the Company,
(i) the payment of such Reverse Termination Fee, together with any
amounts payable pursuant to the last sentence of _Section 7.9(c)_ and
_Section 9.2(d)_, shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company
Related Parties against the Parent Related Parties and (ii) in no event will
the Company Related Parties be entitled to recover any other money damages or
any other remedy based on a claim in law or equity with respect to (A) the
loss suffered as a result of any failure of the Merger to be consummated, (B)
any breach of, or failure to perform, any representation, warranty, agreement
or obligation under this Agreement, (C) the termination of this Agreement or
(D) any other losses, damages, obligations or liabilities suffered as a result
of or under this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; _provided_ , however, that, notwithstanding the foregoing or any
other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, irrespective of whether the
Reverse Termination Fee is payable or has been paid, the Company and Sellers
shall be entitled to pursue, and Parent, Buyer, Irish Holdco, EHSI and Merger
Sub shall be responsible for any and all money damages (or, to the extent the
Reverse Termination Fee is received by the Company, the excess, if any, of
such money damages over such Reverse Termination Fee) arising out of,
resulting from or relating to Parents, Buyers, Irish Holdcos, EHSIs or
Merger Subs Intentional Breach of this Agreement, including _Section 7.3_
and, in any determination of such damages, the court shall be permitted to
award the Company and the Sellers, if proven, their respective damages
(including those damages set forth in the second sentence of  _Section
9.2(a)_).

(d) Each of the Company, Parent, Buyer, Irish Holdco, EHSI and Merger Sub
acknowledges that (i) the agreements contained in this _Section 9.2_ are an
integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) the
Reverse Termination Fee is not a penalty, but is liquidated damages in an
amount that the Company is willing to accept notwithstanding the fact that
actual damages suffered by Sellers and the Company may be in an amount higher
than the Parent Termination Fee and (iii) without these agreements, the
parties would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if Parent or EHSI
fails to timely pay the Reverse Termination Fee when due pursuant to this
_Section 9.2_, (1) Parent or EHSI shall pay to the Company interest on such
amount at the prime rate as published in the Wall Street Journal in

 



80  effect on the date such payment was required to be made through the date
such payment was actually received and (2) if in order to obtain such payment,
the Company commences a Proceeding which results in a judgment of all or a
portion of the Reverse Termination Fee, Parent or EHSI shall pay the Companys
costs and expenses (including attorneys fees and expenses of enforcement) in
connection with such Proceeding.

 

9.3 _Fees and Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in this
Agreement, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring
such fees and expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated. Parent and
EHSI, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall share all
fees and expenses relating to all filing fees pursuant to the HSR Act in
equal proportion.

9.4 _Survival_. The parties, intending to modify any applicable statute of
limitations, agree that (a)(i) the representations and warranties in this
Agreement and in any certificate delivered pursuant hereto and (ii) the
covenants in this Agreement only requiring performance prior to the Closing
shall, in each case, terminate effective as of the Closing and shall not
survive the Closing for any purpose, and thereafter there shall be no
liability on the part of, nor shall any claim be made by, any party or any
partys Affiliates in respect thereof and (b) the covenants in this Agreement
that contemplate performance after the Closing or expressly by their terms
survive the Closing shall survive the Closing in accordance with their
respective terms. The parties agree that neither the foregoing nor any other
provision of this Agreement shall limit the liability of any party, any Parent
Related Party or any Company Related Party in the case of Fraud relating to
the subject matter of any of the representations and warranties in _Article
IV_ or _Article V_ , as applicable.

Any party to this Agreement may give any notice or other communication
hereunder using any other means (including personal delivery,
messenger service, ordinary mail or electronic mail), but no such notice or
other communication shall be deemed to have been duly given unless and until
it actually is received by the party for whom it is intended. Any party to
this Agreement may change the address to which notices and other
communications hereunder are to be delivered by giving the other parties to
this Agreement notice in the manner herein set forth.

 

10.2 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Company Disclosure
Schedule, the Parent Disclosure Schedule and the other Schedules and Exhibits
hereto and the documents and instruments referred to herein that are to be
delivered at the Closing) and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the
entire agreement among the parties to this Agreement and supersede any
prior understandings, agreements or representations by or among the parties
hereto, or any of them, written or oral, with respect to the subject matter
hereof.

 

10.3 _Amendment_. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, _Sections 9.2_ , _10.5_ , _10.6_ , _10.10_ ,
_10.13_ , _10.15_ and this _Section 10.3_ may not be modified, waived or
terminated in a manner that is adverse in any respect to a Financing Source
without the prior written consent of such Financing Source.

10.4 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Closing Date, the parties
hereto may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties
hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any
agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall
be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such
party. Such extension or waiver shall not be deemed to apply to any time for
performance, inaccuracy in any representation or warranty, or noncompliance
with any agreement or condition, as the case may be, other than that which is
specified in the extension or waiver. The failure of any party to this
Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall
not constitute a waiver of such rights.

 



83 10.5 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except (i) as provided in _Section
7.5_ (with respect to which the Company Indemnitees shall be third party
beneficiaries), (ii) for _Sections 9.2_ , _10.3_ , _10.6_ , _10.10_ , _10.13_
, _10.15_ and this _Section 10.5_ (in each case, which is intended to be
enforceable by the Financing Sources and their Representatives) and (iii) for
the Stakeholders who are express third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement,
this Agreement is not intended, and shall not be deemed, to confer any rights
or remedies upon any person other than the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns, to create any agreement of employment with
any person or to otherwise create any third party beneficiary hereto.

 

10.6 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or delegated, in whole or in
part, by operation of Law or otherwise by any of the parties hereto without
the prior written consent of the other parties, and any such assignment
without such prior written consent shall be null and void, except
that Parent, Merger Sub or Buyer may transfer or assign its rights and
obligations under this Agreement, in whole or from time to time in part, to
one (1) or more of its Subsidiaries, but no such assignment shall relieve
Parent, Merger Sub or Buyer, as applicable, of its obligations hereunder;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Parent, Merger Sub or Buyer shall not assign its
rights or obligations under this Agreement to any Affiliates located in
jurisdictions outside of the United States if any such assignment would
increase the amount of withholding Taxes payable in connection with the
Transactions. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be
binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the
parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

10.7 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid
or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the
validity or enforceability of the term or provision in question in any other
situation or in any other jurisdiction. If a court of competent jurisdiction
declares that any term or provision hereof is invalid or unenforceable, the
parties hereto agree that the court making such determination shall have the
power to limit the term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases, or
to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a term or
provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing
the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this
Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified. In the event such court does
not exercise the power granted to it in the prior sentence, the parties hereto
agree to replace such invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a valid
and enforceable term or provision that will achieve, to the extent possible,
the economic, business and other purposes of such invalid or unenforceable
term.

 

10.8 _Counterparts and Signature_. This Agreement may be executed in two (2)
or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of
which together shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties hereto and
delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all parties need not
sign the same counterpart. This Agreement may be executed and delivered by
facsimile or .pdf transmission.

10.9  _Interpretation_. When reference is made in this Agreement to an
Article or a Section, such reference shall be to an Article or Section of this
Agreement, unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents, table of defined
terms and headings contained in this Agreement are for convenience of
reference only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation
of this Agreement. The language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to be
the

 



84  language chosen by the parties hereto to express their mutual intent, and no
rule of strict construction shall be applied against any party. The parties
have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement.
In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this
Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties, and no
presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party
by virtue of the authorship of any provisions hereof. Whenever the context may
require, any pronouns used in this Agreement shall include the corresponding
masculine, feminine or neuter forms, and the singular form of nouns and
pronouns shall include the plural, and vice versa. Any reference to any
federal, state, local or foreign statute or Law shall be deemed also to refer
to all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the context
requires otherwise. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including"
are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation." The word " _Agreement_ " means this Agreement as
amended or supplemented, together with all Exhibits and Schedules attached
hereto or incorporated by reference, and the words "hereof," "herein,"
"hereto," "hereunder" and other words of similar import shall refer to this
Agreement as a whole and not to any specific provision of this Agreement. Any
reference to "$," "U.S. dollars" or "dollars" shall mean the legal tender of
the United States of America. Any reference to any period of days shall be
deemed to be to the relevant number of calendar days, unless otherwise
specified. It is the intention of the parties that, to the extent possible,
unless provisions are mutually exclusive and effect cannot be given to both
or all such provisions, the representations, warranties, covenants and closing
conditions in this Agreement shall be construed to be cumulative and that each
representation, warranty, covenant and closing condition in this
Agreement shall be given full separate and independent effect. Without
limitation to the foregoing, except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, nothing in any representation or warranty in this Agreement shall
in any way limit or restrict the scope, applicability or meaning of any other
representation or warranty made in this Agreement. Neither any failure nor any
delay by any party in exercising any right, power or privilege under this
Agreement will operate as a waiver of such right, power or privilege, and no
single or partial exercise of any such right, power or privilege will preclude
any other or further exercise of such right, power or privilege or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege.

 

10.10 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and any claim, controversy or dispute
arising under or related to this Agreement, whether in law or in equity,
whether in contract or in tort, by statute or otherwise, shall be governed and
construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware without giving
effect to the principles of conflicts of law thereof or of any
other jurisdiction, except that, notwithstanding the foregoing, all matters
relating to the interpretation, construction, validity and enforcement
(whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort, by statute or otherwise)
against any of the Financing Sources in any way relating to the Debt
Financing, shall be exclusively governed by, and construed in accordance with,
the domestic Law of the State of New York without giving effect to any choice
or conflict of law provision or rule whether of the State of New York or any
other jurisdiction that would cause the application of Law of any jurisdiction
other than the State of New York.

 



85 ---|--- 

(a) Each Stakeholder immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be deemed
to have irrevocably constituted, appointed, authorized, directed and
empowered, effective as of the Closing (and without regard to whether such
Stakeholder has delivered a duly executed Letter of Transmittal), Shareholder
Representative Services LLC as the "Stakeholder Representative", to act as
sole and exclusive agent, attorney-in-fact and representative of the
Stakeholders, with full power of substitution, with respect to all matters
under this Agreement and the agreements ancillary hereto, including giving and
receiving notices hereunder, entering into any amendment or modification
hereof, engaging special counsel, accountants or other advisors or incurring
such other expenses on behalf of the Stakeholders, holding back from
disbursement to any Stakeholder any such funds to the extent it reasonably
determines may be necessary or required under the terms and conditions of this
Agreement or applicable Law, negotiating, settling, compromising or otherwise
resolving any dispute hereunder (including any disputes relating to the
Adjustment Amount) or doing any and all things and taking any and all actions,
in each case that the Stakeholder Representative, in its sole and absolute
discretion, may consider necessary or proper or convenient in connection with
or to carry out the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any other
documents or instruments entered into in connection herewith. The Stakeholder
Representative may resign at any time, in which case the Stakeholders holding
a majority of shares of Common Stock immediately prior to the Closing shall
have the right to appoint a replacement Stakeholder Representative.

 

(b) Neither the Stakeholder Representative nor any of its officers, directors,
managers, employees, agents or representatives shall incur any responsibility
or liability whatsoever to any Stakeholder by reason of any error in judgment
or other act or omission performed or omitted hereunder or in connection with
this Agreement or any such other agreement, instrument or document, except
to the extent any act or failure to act constitutes Fraud or willful
misconduct. The Stakeholder Representative shall be entitled to rely on the
advice of counsel, public accountants or other independent experts experienced
in the matter at issue. The Stakeholder Representative shall not be required
to make any inquiry concerning either the performance or observance of any of
the terms, provisions or conditions of this Agreement. The Stakeholders shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Stakeholder Representative from and
against any and all losses, liabilities, damages, claims, penalties, fines,
forfeitures, actions, fees, costs and expenses (including the fees and
expenses of counsel and experts and their staffs and all expense of document
location, duplication and shipment) (collectively, " _Representative Losses_
") arising out of or in connection with the Stakeholder Representatives
execution and performance of this Agreement and the agreements ancillary
hereto, in each case as such Representative Loss is suffered or incurred;
_provided_ that, in the event that any such Representative Loss is finally
adjudicated to have been directly caused by the Fraud or willful misconduct of
the Stakeholder Representative, the Stakeholder Representative will reimburse
the Stakeholders the amount of such indemnified Representative Loss to the
extent attributable to such Fraud or willful misconduct. If not paid directly
to the Stakeholder Representative by the Stakeholders, any such
Representative Losses may be recovered by the Stakeholder Representative from
(i) the funds in the Stakeholder Representative Expense Fund and (ii) the
amounts in the Purchase Price Escrow Fund at such time as remaining amounts
would otherwise be distributable to the Stakeholders; _provided_ that, while
this _Section 10.11_ allows the Stakeholder Representative to be paid from
the Stakeholder Representative Expense Fund and the Purchase Price Escrow
Fund, this does not relieve the Stakeholders from their obligation to promptly
pay such Representative Losses as they are suffered or incurred, nor does it
prevent the Stakeholder Representative from seeking any remedies available to
it at law or otherwise. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this

 



86  Agreement, in no event will the Stakeholder Representative be required to
advance its own funds on behalf of the Stakeholders or otherwise. The
Stakeholder Representative may consult with counsel of its own choice and
will have full and complete authorization and protection for any action taken
and suffered by it in good faith and in accordance with the opinion of such
counsel. The indemnity obligations of this _Section 10.11_ shall survive the
Closing, the resignation or removal of the Stakeholder Representative or any
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1_. For the avoidance of
doubt, the last sentence of Section 10.16 is not intended to be applicable to
the Stakeholder Representatives rights under this paragraph. In no event
shall Parent or any of its Subsidiaries be responsible for the payment of any
Representative Loss.

 

(c) The Stakeholder Representative shall be entitled to pay and reimburse
itself from the Stakeholder Representative Expense Fund for any third-party,
out-of-pocket expenses, charges or liabilities that the Stakeholder
Representative incurs, or may incur, in the exercise of it rights, or
performance of its duties, under this Agreement.

 

(d) Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall have the right to rely upon all
actions taken or omitted to be taken by the Stakeholder Representative
hereunder or in connection with this Agreement. All decisions, actions,
consents and instructions of the Stakeholder Representative authorized to be
made, taken or given pursuant to this _Section 10.11_ shall be final
and binding upon all the Stakeholders, and no Stakeholder shall have any
right to object, dissent, protest or otherwise contest the same.

 

(e) At the Closing, pursuant to _Section 2.3(a)(iv)_, Parent, EHSI and Merger
Sub shall deliver to such account or accounts as the Stakeholder
Representative shall specify the Stakeholder Representative Expense Fund, to
be held to cover and reimburse the fees, expenses and other monetary
obligations incurred by the Stakeholder Representative in connection with the
carrying out by the Stakeholder Representative of its duties under this
_Section 10.11_. The Stakeholder Representative Expense Fund will be used for
the purposes of paying directly, or reimbursing the Stakeholder Representative
for, any third party expenses pursuant to this Agreement and any agreements
ancillary hereto. The Stakeholders will not receive any interest or earnings
on the Stakeholder Representative Expense Fund and irrevocably transfer and
assign to the Stakeholder Representative any ownership right that they may
otherwise have had in any such interest or earnings. The Stakeholder
Representative will not be liable for any loss of principal of the Stakeholder
Representative Expense Fund other than as a result of its gross negligence or
willful misconduct. The Stakeholder Representative will hold these funds
separate from its corporate funds, will not use these funds for its operating
expenses or any other corporate purposes and will not voluntarily make these
funds available to its creditors in the event of bankruptcy. As soon as
practicable following the completion of the Stakeholder Representatives
responsibilities, the Stakeholder Representative will deliver (or will cause
to be delivered) the balance of the Stakeholder Representative Expense Fund
to the Escrow Agent for further distribution to the Stakeholder Representative
in accordance with _Section 3.9_. In the event that any amount is owed to the
Stakeholder Representative, whether for fees, expense reimbursement or
indemnification, that is in excess of the amounts remaining in the Stakeholder
Representative Expense Fund, the Stakeholder Representative shall be entitled
to be reimbursed by the Stakeholders on a pro rata basis, and the
Stakeholders agree to so reimburse the Stakeholder Representative; _provided_
, that for the avoidance of doubt, the aggregate of the applicable pro rata
shares of all of the Stakeholders shall in all cases sum to 100%. Upon
written 

 



87  notice from the Stakeholder Representative to the Stakeholders as to any
such owed amount, including a reasonably detailed description as to such owed
amount, each Stakeholder shall promptly deliver to the Stakeholder
Representative full payment of his, her or its pro rata share of such owed
amount. For tax purposes, the Stakeholder Representative Expense Fund will be
treated as having been received and voluntarily set aside by the Stakeholders
at the time of Closing.

10.12 _Remedies_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly
conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of
any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and
the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of
any other remedy. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur
in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed
in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. Subject to
_Section 10.12(b)_, it is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the parties
agree that neither Sellers nor the Company shall be entitled to specifically
enforce the obligations of Parent, Buyer, EHSI, Irish Holdco or Merger Sub to
consummate the Merger unless (i) all of the conditions set forth in _Section
8.1_ and _Section 8.2_ have been satisfied (other than those conditions that
by their terms are to be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing, each of
which is capable of being satisfied at the Closing) and (ii) any of the Buyer
Parties shall have received the proceeds of the Financing, or any of the
Buyer Parties shall have received confirmation from the Financing Sources that
upon the simultaneous Closing of the Transactions such Financing Sources will
fund the proceeds of the Financing, in an amount sufficient to consummate the
Merger on the terms and conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters.
The parties agree that, while the Company is entitled to seek both specific
performance (subject to the terms of this Section 10.12(b)) and the Reverse
Termination Fee (subject to the terms of Section 9.2), in no event shall the
Company be entitled to receive both such grant of specific performance and the
Reverse Termination Fee.

 

10.13 _Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_. IN ADDITION, EACH OF
THE PARTIES HERETO (A) CONSENTS TO SUBMIT ITSELF, AND HEREBY SUBMITS ITSELF,

IN CONTRACT OR IN TORT, BY STATUTE OR OTHERWISE) RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR
ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT IN ANY COURT OTHER
THAN THE COURT OF CHANCERY OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE AND ANY FEDERAL COURT
LOCATED IN THE STATE OF DELAWARE, OR, IF NEITHER OF SUCH COURTS HAS SUBJECT
MATTER JURISDICTION, ANY STATE COURT OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE HAVING
SUBJECT MATTER JURISDICTION, AND (D) CONSENTS TO SERVICE OF PROCESS BEING
MADE THROUGH THE NOTICE PROCEDURES SET FORTH IN _SECTION 10.1_. EACH OF THE
PARTIES HERETO HEREBY KNOWINGLY, INTENTIONALLY AND VOLUNTARILY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING
OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY
(INCLUDING ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING AGAINST THE FINANCING SOURCES ARISING OUT OF
OR RELATED TO THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, THE FINANCING OR THE
PERFORMANCE OF SERVICES WITH RESPECT THERETO). NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING IN
THIS AGREEMENT TO THE CONTRARY, EACH OF THE PARTIES AGREES THAT IT WILL NOT
BRING OR SUPPORT ANY ACTION, CAUSE OF ACTION, CLAIM, CROSS-CLAIM OR THIRD-
PARTY CLAIM OF ANY KIND OR DESCRIPTION, WHETHER IN LAW OR IN EQUITY, WHETHER
IN CONTRACT OR IN TORT, BY STATUTE OR OTHERWISE, AGAINST THE FINANCING SOURCES
OR ANY OF THEIR REPRESENTATIVES IN ANY WAY RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY
OF THE TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY DISPUTE ARISING OUT OF
OR RELATING IN ANY WAY TO THE DEBT COMMITMENT LETTERS OR THE PERFORMANCE
THEREOF, IN ANY FORUM OTHER THAN ANY FEDERAL OR STATE COURT LOCATED IN THE
BOROUGH OF MANHATTAN IN THE CITY OF NEW YORK. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING IN
THIS AGREEMENT TO THE CONTRARY, EACH PARTY HERETO AGREES THAT ANY JUDGMENT
ISSUED BY THE COURT OF CHANCERY OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, OR ANY FEDERAL OR
STATE COURT LOCATED IN THE STATE OF DELAWARE, MAY BE RECOGNIZED, RECORDED,
REGISTERED OR ENFORCED IN ANY JURISDICTION IN THE WORLD AND WAIVES ANY AND ALL
OBJECTIONS OR DEFENSES TO THE RECOGNITION, RECORDING, REGISTRATION OR
ENFORCEMENT OF SUCH JUDGMENT IN ANY SUCH JURISDICTION.

 

10.14 _Disclosure Schedules_. The Company Disclosure Schedule and the Parent
Disclosure Schedule shall each be arranged in Sections corresponding to the
numbered Sections contained in _Article IV_ , in the case of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, or _Article V_ , in the case of the Parent Disclosure
Schedule, and the disclosure in any Section shall qualify (a)
the corresponding Section in _Article IV_ or _Article V_ , as the case may
be, and (b) the other Sections in _Article IV_ or _Article V_ , as the case
may be, only to the extent that it is reasonably apparent on the face of
such disclosure that it also qualifies or applies to such other Sections.

 



89 10.15 _Liability of Financing Sources_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, the Company (on behalf of itself and each of its
Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives) agrees that neither it nor
any of its Subsidiaries or respective Representatives nor any Company
stockholder (other than Irish Holdco) shall have any rights or claims against
any Financing Source in connection with this Agreement, the Financing or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, and no Financing Source shall
have any rights or claims against any of the Company, its Subsidiaries or
their respective Representatives in connection with this Agreement, the
Financing or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, whether at law
or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, following consummation of the Acquisition, the foregoing will not limit
the rights of the parties to the Financing under the definitive agreements
with respect thereto.

 

10.16 _Non-Recourse_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, this Agreement may only be enforced against, and any claims or causes
of action that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement, or
the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, may only be made against the entities and
Persons that are expressly identified as parties to this Agreement (or
express guarantors of such parties obligations under this Agreement) in their
capacities as such and no former, current or future stockholders, equity
holders, controlling persons, directors, officers, employees, general or
limited partners, members, managers, agents or Affiliates of any party hereto,
or any former, current or future direct or indirect stockholder, equity
holder, controlling person, director, officer, employee, general or limited
partner, member, manager, agent or Affiliate of any of the foregoing (each, a
" _Non-Recourse Party_ ") shall have any liability for any obligations or
liabilities of the parties to this Agreement or for any claim (whether in
tort, contract or otherwise) based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the
transactions contemplated hereby or in respect of any representations made or
alleged to be made in connection herewith. Without limiting the rights of
any party against the other parties hereto, in no event shall any party or
any of its Affiliates seek to enforce this Agreement against, make any claims
for breach of this Agreement against, or seek to recover monetary damages
from, any Non-Recourse Party.

10.17 _Waiver of Conflicts_. Recognizing that Ropes and Gray LLP has acted as
legal counsel to the Company, the Subsidiaries, certain of the direct and
indirect holders of Company Stock and certain of their respective Affiliates
prior to date hereof, and that Ropes and Gray LLP intends to act as legal
counsel to certain of the direct and indirect holders of Company Stock and
their respective Affiliates (which will no longer include the Company and the
Subsidiaries) after the Closing, each of Parent, Buyer, Merger Sub, EHSI,
Irish Holdco and the Company hereby waives, on its own behalf and agrees to
cause its Affiliates and Subsidiaries to waive, any conflicts that may arise
in connection with Ropes and Gray LLP representing any direct or indirect
holders of the Company Stock, the Stakeholder Representative or their
Affiliates after the Closing as such representation may relate to Parent,
Buyer, Merger Sub, EHSI, Irish Holdco the Company, or their respective
Subsidiaries or the Transactions. In addition, all communications involving
attorney-client confidences between direct and indirect holders of Company
Stock, the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates, on
the one hand, and Ropes and Gray LLP, on the other hand, in the course of the
negotiation, documentation and consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be deemed to be attorney-client confidences that belong solely to
the direct and indirect holders of Company

 



90  Stock and their respective Affiliates (and not the Company or its
Subsidiaries). Accordingly, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not have
access to any such communications or to the files of Ropes and Gray LLP
relating to such Ropes and Gray LLPs representation of the Company and certain
of the direct and indirect holders of Common Stock and their Affiliates in
connection with the Transaction (the " _Engagement_ ") and after the Closing.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, from and after the Closing,
(a) the direct and indirect holders of Company Stock and their respective
Affiliates (and not the Company and its Subsidiaries) shall be the sole
holders of the attorney-client privilege with respect to such engagement, and
none of the Company or its Subsidiaries shall be a holder thereof, (b) to the
extent that files of Ropes and Gray LLP in respect of such engagement
constitute property of the client, only the direct and indirect holders of
Company Stock and their respective Affiliates (and not the Company and its
Subsidiaries) shall hold such property rights and (c) Ropes and Gray LLP shall
have no duty whatsoever to reveal or disclose any such attorney-client
communications or files to the Company related to the Engagement after the
Closing or any of its Subsidiaries by reason of any attorney-client
relationship between Ropes and Gray LLP and the Company prior to the Closing or
any of its Subsidiaries or otherwise. This _Section 10.17_ will be
irrevocable, and no term of this _Section 10.17_ may be amended, waived or
modified, without the prior written consent of Ropes and Gray LLP.
