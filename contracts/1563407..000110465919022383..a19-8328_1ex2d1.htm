 **AGREEMENT**

 



 

The Parties to this Agreement, intending to be legally bound, agree as

 **SECTION 1.** **THE OFFER**

 



 

 **1.1.** **The Offer**.

 



 

 **(a)** **Commencement of the Offer**. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, as promptly as practicable (and in any
event not later than the fifteenth (15th) business day) after the date of this
Agreement (unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company),
Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) commence (within the
meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) the Offer.

 



 

 **(b)** **Terms and Conditions of the Offer**. Each of Parent and Purchaser
shall use its reasonable best efforts to consummate the Offer, subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement. The obligations of Purchaser to, and
of Parent to cause Purchaser to, irrevocably accept for payment, and pay for,
any Shares validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) pursuant to the Offer

prior satisfaction of the Offer Conditions. The Offer shall be made by means
of an offer to purchase that is disseminated to all of the holders of Shares
pursuant to the Exchange Act and contains the terms set forth in this
Agreement, the Minimum Condition, the Termination Condition and the other
Offer Conditions (the " ** _Offer to Purchase_** "). Purchaser reserves the
right to: (i) increase the Offer Price; (ii) waive any Offer Condition (other
than the Minimum Condition, the Termination Condition or conditions (d) (to
the extent such waiver would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the
Companys stockholders, directors or officers or require rescission of the
transactions contemplated hereby under applicable Antitrust Laws) or (f) (to
the extent such order or injunction applies against the Acquired Corporations
or their respective directors or officers) set forth in **Annex I** ); and
(iii) make any other changes in the terms and conditions of the Offer not
inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, without the prior written consent of the
Company in its sole and absolute discretion, Parent and Purchaser shall not:
(A) decrease the Offer Price other than in the manner required by Section
1.1(g); (B) change the form of consideration payable in the Offer; (C)
decrease the maximum number of Shares sought to be purchased in the Offer; (D)
impose conditions or requirements to the Offer in addition to the Offer
Conditions; (E) amend, change or waive the Minimum Condition, the Termination
Condition or conditions (d) (to the extent such amendment, change or waiver
would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the Companys stockholders,
directors or officers or require rescission of the transactions contemplated
hereby under applicable Antitrust Laws) or (f) (to the extent such order or
injunction applies against the Acquired Corporations or their respective
directors or officers) set forth in **Annex I** ; (F) except as provided in
Sections 1.1(c) or 1.1(d), terminate the Offer or accelerate, extend or
otherwise change the Expiration Date; (G) provide any "subsequent offering
period" (or any extension of such "subsequent offering period") within the
meaning of Rule 14d-11 promulgated under the Exchange

 



     

 

 



 

Act; or (H) otherwise modify or amend any of the terms or conditions of the
Offer in a manner that adversely affects, or reasonably could be expected to
adversely affect, any holder of Shares.

 



 

 **(c)** **Expiration and Extension of the Offer**. The Offer shall initially
be scheduled to expire at one minute after 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on the
Initial Expiration Date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, but subject to the Parties respective termination rights
under Section 8: (i) Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause Purchaser to,
extend the Offer from time to time for any period required by any Legal
Requirement, or any interpretation or position of the SEC, its staff or the
NYSE applicable to the Offer; (ii) if, as of the then-scheduled Expiration
Date, any Offer Condition is not satisfied and has not been waived by
Purchaser or Parent, Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause Purchaser to,
extend the Offer on one or more occasions for an additional period of up to
ten (10) business days (calculated as set forth in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the
Exchange Act) per extension to permit such Offer Condition to be satisfied,
but if the sole then-unsatisfied Offer Condition is the Minimum Condition,
Purchaser shall not be required to extend the Offer for more than two
occasions in consecutive periods of ten (10) business days each (each such
period to end at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on the last business day of such
period) (or such other duration as may be agreed to by Parent and the
Company); and (iii) if as of any scheduled Expiration Date (A) all of the
Offer Conditions have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions
that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Offer Acceptance Time, but
which conditions would be capable of being satisfied as of such scheduled
Expiration Date), (B) the full amount of the Debt Financing necessary to pay
the Required Amount has not been funded and will not be available to be funded
at the Offer Closing and at the Closing (other than as a result of a breach or
failure to perform by Parent or Purchaser of any of their representations,
warranties or covenants set forth in Sections 4.13 and 6.11) and (C) Parent
and Purchaser irrevocably acknowledge and agree in writing that (1) the
Company may terminate this Agreement pursuant to, and in accordance with
Section 8.1(i) and receive the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to, and in
accordance with Section 8.3 and (2) solely with respect to both (I) any
payment of the Parent Termination Fee in accordance with subclause (1) of this
Section 1.1(c)(iii)(C) and (II) Purchasers obligation, and Parents
obligation to cause Purchaser, to consummate the Offer, including to accept
and thereafter pay for all Shares validly tendered and not validly withdrawn
pursuant to the Offer and in accordance with this Section 1.1, all Offer
Conditions set forth in clauses (b)(ii)-(v), (c) (other than Fraud or Willful
Breach in respect of such Offer Conditions following the date of delivery of
such notice), (e) (in respect of clauses (b)(ii)-(v) and (c) of **Annex I** )
and (h) of **Annex I** will be deemed to have been irrevocably satisfied or
waived from and at all times after the initial extension of the Offer pursuant
to this Section 1.1(c)(iii), Purchaser may extend the Offer for successive
periods of up to five (5) business days per extension (each such period to end
at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on the last business day of such period) (or such
other duration as may be agreed to by Parent and the Company), the length of
each such period to be determined by Parent in its sole discretion, in order
to permit the funding of the full amount of the Debt Financing necessary to
pay the Required Amount. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall
Purchaser: (x) be required to extend the Offer beyond the Extension Deadline;
or (y) be permitted to extend the Offer beyond the Extension Deadline without
the prior written consent of the Company. Purchaser shall not terminate the
Offer prior to the Extension Deadline unless this Agreement is validly
terminated pursuant to Section 8. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be
deemed to impair, limit or otherwise restrict the right of each of the Parties
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1.

 



     

 

 



 

 **(d)** **Termination of Offer**. If this Agreement is validly terminated
pursuant to _Section 8_, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser
to) immediately, irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer, and
Purchaser shall not acquire any Shares pursuant to the Offer. If the Offer is
terminated or withdrawn by Purchaser, Purchaser shall immediately return, and
shall cause any depository acting on behalf of Purchaser to return, in
accordance with applicable Legal Requirements, all tendered Shares to the
registered holders of such Shares.

 



 

 **(e)** **Offer Documents**. As promptly as practicable on the date of
commencement of the Offer (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange
Act), and following such commencement, Parent and Purchaser shall: (i) file
with the SEC a tender offer statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer
(together with all amendments and supplements to Schedule TO and including
exhibits to Schedule TO, the " ** _Schedule TO_** ") that will contain as an
exhibit the Offer to Purchase and form of the related letter of transmittal
and summary advertisement, if any, and other required or customary ancillary
documents, in each case, with respect to the Offer; and (ii) cause the Offer
to Purchase and related documents to be disseminated to holders of Shares.
Parent and Purchaser shall cause the Schedule TO and all exhibits to the
Schedule TO (together with all amendments and supplements, the " ** _Offer
Documents_** "), to (x) comply in all material respects with the Exchange Act
and other applicable Legal Requirements and (y) not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated in the Offer Documents or necessary in order to make the statements in
the Offer Documents, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no covenant is made by Parent
or Purchaser with respect to information supplied by or on behalf of the
Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Offer Documents.
Each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company shall respond promptly to any
comments of the SEC or its staff and promptly correct any information provided
by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such
information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect.
Parent and Purchaser shall take all steps necessary to cause the corrected
Offer Documents to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to holders of
Shares to the extent required by applicable Legal Requirements. The Company
shall promptly furnish or otherwise make available to Parent and Purchaser, or
Parents legal counsel, all information concerning the Company and the
Companys stockholders reasonably requested in writing by Parent or Purchaser
in connection with any action contemplated by this Section 1.1(e). The Company
hereby consents to the inclusion in the Offer Documents of the Company Board
Recommendation (unless the Company Board shall have effected a Company Adverse
Change Recommendation pursuant to Section 6.1(b)). Parent and Purchaser shall
provide the Company and its counsel reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on the Offer Documents (including any response to any comments
(including oral comments) of the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer
Documents) prior to the filing of the Offer Documents with the SEC. Parent and
Purchaser shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any such
comments made by the Company or its counsel. Parent and Purchaser shall
provide the Company and its counsel with any comments Parent, Purchaser or
their counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer

and good faith consideration to any such comments. Parent and

 



     

 

 



 

Purchaser shall also allow the Company and its counsel to participate in any
discussions with the SEC or its staff regarding such comments. Subject to the
foregoing, each of Parent and Purchaser shall respond promptly to any comments
(including oral comments) of the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer

 **(f)** **Funds**. Without limiting the generality of Section 9.11 and at or
prior to the Offer Closing, Parent shall cause to be provided to the
Depository Agent all of the funds necessary to purchase all Shares that
Purchaser becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer. Parent shall
also cause Purchaser to perform, on a timely basis, all of Purchasers
obligations under this Agreement. Parent and Purchaser shall, and each of
Parent and Purchaser shall use reasonable best efforts to ensure that all of
their respective Affiliates shall, tender all Shares held by them into the
Offer.

 



 

 **(g)** **Adjustments**. If, between the date of this Agreement and the Offer
Acceptance Time, the outstanding Shares are changed into a different number or
class of shares by reason of any stock split, division or subdivision of
shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split, exchange or consolidation of

the Offer Price shall be appropriately adjusted to provide the same economic
effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such change.

 



 

 **(h)** **Acceptance**. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, including the
satisfaction or waiver by Purchaser or Parent of each of the Offer Conditions
(including any deemed satisfaction or waiver of the Offer Conditions pursuant

Purchaser to): (i) promptly (and in any event no later than 9:00 a.m. Eastern
Time on the first business day (determined using Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the

procedures that have not yet been delivered in settlement or satisfaction of
such guarantee, Purchaser shall be under no obligation to make any payment for
such Shares unless and until such Shares are delivered in settlement or
satisfaction of such guarantee.

 



 

 **1.2.** **Company Actions**.

 



 

 **(a)** **Schedule 14D-9**. Concurrently with, or as promptly as practicable
on the date of, the filing of the Schedule TO, the Company shall file with the
SEC and disseminate to holders of Shares a Tender Offer
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with any
exhibits, amendments or supplements to Schedule 14D-9, the " ** _Schedule
14D-9_** ") that, subject to Section 6.1(b), includes the Company Board

omit to state any material fact required to be stated in the Schedule 14D-9 or
necessary in order to make the statements in the Schedule 14D-9, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, no covenant is made by the Company with

 



     

 

 



 

respect to information supplied by or on behalf of Parent or Purchaser for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Schedule 14D-9. Parent and
Purchaser shall promptly furnish or otherwise make available to the Company,
or the Companys legal counsel, all information concerning Parent, Purchaser
or the Guarantors reasonably requested in writing by the Company in connection
with any action contemplated by this Section 1.2(a). The Company shall also
include in the Schedule 14D-9 a notice of appraisal rights, in compliance with
Section 262 of the DGCL, that includes a description of the procedures for the
holders of Dissenting Shares to demand an appraisal of such Dissenting Shares
in accordance with the DGCL. The Company Board shall set the record date for
determining the Companys stockholders entitled to receive such notice of
appraisal rights as the same date as the Stockholder List Date and shall
disseminate the Schedule 14D-9, including the notice of appraisal rights, to
such stockholders. Each of Parent, Purchaser, the Guarantors and the Company
shall respond promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff and promptly
correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to
the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in any
material respect. The Company shall take all steps necessary to cause the
corrected Schedule 14D-9 to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to
holders of Shares to the extent required by applicable Legal Requirements.
Unless the Company Board has effected a Company Adverse Change Recommendation,
the Company shall provide Parent and its counsel reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 and any amendment to the Schedule
14D-9 (including any response to any comments (including oral comments) of the
SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9) prior to the filing of
the Schedule 14D-9 with the SEC. The Company shall give reasonable and good
faith consideration to any such comments made by Parent or its counsel. The
Company shall provide Parent and its counsel with any comments the Company or
its counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule
14D-9 promptly after receipt of those comments (including oral comments).
Unless the Company Board has effected a Company Adverse Change Recommendation,
the Company shall provide Parent and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to
participate in the formulation of any response to any such comments of the SEC
or its staff, including a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any
such response. The Company shall give reasonable and good faith consideration
to any such comments. The Company shall also allow Parent and its counsel to
participate in any discussions with the SEC or its staff regarding such
comments. Subject to the foregoing, the Company shall respond promptly to any
comments (including oral comments) of the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Schedule 14D-9.

 



 

 **(b)** **Stockholder Lists**. From time to time as reasonably requested by
Purchaser or its agents to disseminate or otherwise communicate the Offer and
the Merger to holders of Shares, the Company shall (and shall instruct its
transfer agent to) promptly furnish Purchaser with a list of its stockholders,
mailing labels and any available listing or computer file containing the names
and addresses of all record holders of Shares and lists of securities
positions of Shares held in stock depositories, in each case, accurate and
complete as of the most recent practicable date. The Company shall also
provide to Purchaser additional assistance and other information as Purchaser
may reasonably request in connection with the Offer. Parent and Purchaser
shall, and shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause their
representatives and agents to: (i) hold in confidence the information
contained in any such labels, listings and files; (ii) use such information
only in connection with the Offer and the Merger; (iii) if this Agreement
shall be terminated, deliver to the Company (or destroy) all copies and any
extracts or summaries from such

 



     

 

 



 

information then in their possession or control; and (iv) if requested by the
Company, promptly certify to the Company in writing that all such material has
been so returned or destroyed.

liabilities and duties of the Company and Purchaser shall become the debts,
liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

 **2.3.** **Closing; Effective Time**.

 



 

 **(a)** Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated pursuant to Section
8, and unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing among the Company, Parent
and Purchaser, the Closing shall take place at the offices of Kirkland and Ellis

any event, no later than the date of, and immediately following, the Offer
Closing. If, however, the condition set forth in Section 7.1 shall not be
satisfied or waived by such date, then the Closing shall occur no later than
the first business day on which the condition set forth in Section 7.1 is

 **(b)** Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as soon as practicable
on the Closing Date, but following the Closing, the Company shall execute and
file or cause to be filed a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State
of the State of Delaware with respect to the Merger, in such form as required
by, and executed and acknowledged in accordance with, the relevant provisions
of the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective upon the Effective Time.

 



 

 **2.4.** **Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws; Directors and Officers**.
As of the Effective Time:

 



 

 **(a)** The certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall
be amended and restated in the form attached as **Exhibit B**, until it is
changed or amended as provided in the certificate of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation or by applicable Legal Requirements.

 



     

 

 



 

 **(b)** The bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated
in the form attached as **Exhibit C**, until they are changed or amended as
provided in the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation or by applicable Legal
Requirements.

 



 

 **(c)** The directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation shall be the
respective individuals who are designated as such on Schedule 2.4(c), until
their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, or their earlier

 **2.5.** **Conversion of Shares**.

 



 

 **(a)** At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
further action on the part of Parent, Purchaser, the Company or any
stockholder of the Company:

 



 

 **(i)** Shares owned immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Company
shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration
shall be delivered in exchange for such Shares;

 



 

 **(ii)** Shares (A) owned as of the commencement of the Offer and immediately
prior to the Effective Time by Parent, Purchaser, or any other direct or
indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent and any direct or indirect wholly-
owned Subsidiary of the Company and (B) irrevocably accepted by Purchaser for
purchase pursuant to the Offer (with all funds necessary to purchase such
Shares having been provided to the Depository Agent pursuant to Section
1.1(f)), shall, in each case of clauses (A) and (B), be cancelled and shall
cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange for such
Shares;

 



 

 **(iii)** except as provided in clauses (i) and (ii) above and subject to
Section 2.5(b), each Share then outstanding (other than any Dissenting
Shares), shall be converted into the right to receive the Offer Price, net to
the seller in cash, without interest (the " ** _Merger Consideration_** "),
subject to the provisions of Section 2.6, including any withholding of Taxes
in accordance with Section 2.6(e); and

 



 

 **(iv)** each share of the common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of
Purchaser then outstanding shall be converted into one share of common stock,
$0.01 par value per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

 **(b)** If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the
outstanding Shares are changed into a different number or class of shares by
reason of any stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend,
reverse stock split, exchange or consolidation of shares, reclassification,
recapitalization or other similar transaction, then the Merger Consideration
shall be appropriately adjusted to provide the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such change.

 



 

 **(c)** At the Effective Time, all holders of Shares that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights as
stockholders of the Company other than, subject to Section 2.7, the right to
receive the Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Section 2.5 **.**

 



     

 

 



 

 **2.6.** **Surrender of Certificates; Stock Transfer Books**.

 



 

 **(a)** Prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, Parent shall designate a U.S.
bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent
(the " ** _Depository Agent_** ") for the holders of Shares to receive the
funds to which holders of such shares shall become entitled pursuant to
Section 1.1. The Depository Agent shall also act as agent (the " ** _Paying
Agent_** ") for the holders of Shares to receive the funds to which holders of
such shares shall become entitled pursuant to Section 2.5. Prior to or at the
Offer Closing, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the
Depository Agent cash sufficient to make payment of the cash consideration
payable pursuant to Section 1.1 at the Offer Closing and with the Paying Agent
cash sufficient to make payment of the cash consideration payable pursuant to
Section 2.5 (together, the " ** _Payment Fund_** "). The Payment Fund shall
not be used for any other purpose. The Payment Fund shall be invested by the
Paying Agent as directed by the Surviving Corporation, subject to the
following restrictions. Such investments shall be in obligations of or
guaranteed by the United States of America in commercial paper obligations
rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and
Poors Corporation, respectively, in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase
agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding
$1 billion, or in money market funds having a rating in the highest investment
category granted by a recognized credit rating agency at the time of
acquisition or a combination of the foregoing. In no event shall any such
instrument have a maturity exceeding three (3) months. Earnings from such
investments shall be the sole and exclusive property of Parent, and no such
investment gain or loss shall affect the amounts payable to holders of Shares.
If for any reason (including losses) the cash in the Payment Fund shall be
insufficient to fully satisfy all of the payment obligations pursuant Section
1.1 and Section 2.5, upon receipt by Parent of notice of such deficiency from
the Paying Agent, Parent or Purchaser shall promptly deposit cash into the
Payment Fund in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in the amount of
cash required to fully satisfy such payment obligations.

 



 

 **(b)** Promptly (but in no event later than three (3) business days) after
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be mailed to each
Person who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of record of the Shares
entitled to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.5, a form
of letter of transmittal. The letter of transmittal shall (i) be in reasonable
and customary form, (ii) specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
the applicable Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu of such
Certificates pursuant to Section 2.6(f)) to the Paying Agent and (iii) request
from each such Person a copy of an executed IRS Form W-9 or relevant IRS Form
W-8, as applicable, and a certificate of non-foreign person status (conforming
to the requirements set forth in Treasury Regulations Section 1.1445-2) if
applicable. The letter of transmittal shall also contain instructions for use
in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. Upon
surrender to the Paying Agent of the applicable Certificates (or effective
affidavits of loss in lieu of such Certificates pursuant to Section 2.6(f)) or
Book-Entry Shares, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed
and validly executed in accordance with the instructions to such letter of
transmittal, and such other documents as may be reasonably required pursuant
to such instructions, the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
shall be entitled to receive in exchange for such Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares the Merger Consideration for each Share formerly evidenced by such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. Such Certificates and Book-Entry Shares
shall then be cancelled. No interest shall accrue or be paid on the Merger
Consideration

 



     

 

 



 

payable upon the surrender of any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. If the
payment of any Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the
Person in whose name the surrendered Certificates formerly evidencing the
Shares is registered on the stock transfer books of the Company, it shall be a
condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be endorsed
properly or otherwise be in proper form for transfer. It shall be a further
condition of payment that the Person requesting such payment shall: (i) have
paid all transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of
the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the
Certificate surrendered; or (ii) have established to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes either have been
paid or are not applicable. Payment of the applicable Merger Consideration
with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose
name such Book-Entry Shares are registered. Until surrendered as contemplated
hereby, each Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed, from and after
the Effective Time, to represent only the right, subject to Section 2.7, to
receive the Merger Consideration in cash as contemplated by this Agreement,
without interest thereon.

 



 

 **(c)** At any time following twelve (12) months after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to
deliver to it any funds which had been made available to the Paying Agent and
not disbursed to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, including all
interest and other income received by the Paying Agent in respect of all funds
made available to it. Upon any such delivery (but subject to abandoned
property, escheat and other similar Legal Requirements), holders shall be
entitled to look to the Surviving Corporation only as general creditors of the
Surviving Corporation with respect to the Merger Consideration that may be
payable upon due surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares held by
them in compliance with the procedures in Section 2.6(b), without interest and
subject to any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Legal Requirements
in accordance with Section 2.6(e). Neither the Surviving Corporation nor the
Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares for the Merger Consideration delivered in respect of such Shares to a
public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or other similar
Legal Requirements. To the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements,
any amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders immediately prior to the time
at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any
Governmental Body shall become the property of the Surviving Corporation or
its designee, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled to such unclaimed amounts.

 



 

 **(d)** At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company with
respect to the Shares shall be closed and following the Effective Time there
shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on the records of the
Company. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificates formerly representing
Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for any
reason, such Certificates shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger
Consideration as provided in this Section 2.6. From and after the Effective
Time, the holders of the Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement or by applicable Legal Requirements.

 



 

 **(e)** Each of the Withholding Agents shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as
it is required by any Legal Requirement to deduct and withhold with respect to
Taxes. Each Withholding Agent shall take all

 



     

 

 



 

action that may be necessary to ensure that any such amounts so withheld are
promptly and properly remitted to the appropriate Governmental Body. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld and timely remitted to the appropriate
Governmental Body, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made.

 



 

 **(f)** If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, then
upon the making of an affidavit by the holder of the Shares formerly
represented by that Certificate, or by a representative of that holder, of
such loss, theft or destruction, the Paying Agent shall pay (less any amounts
entitled to be deducted or withheld pursuant to Section 2.6(e)), in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the applicable Merger
Consideration to be paid in respect of the Shares formerly represented by such
Certificate, as contemplated by this Section 2. As a condition of such payment
and in its sole discretion, the Surviving Corporation may require the
attesting holder to post a bond in such reasonable and customary amount as
Parent may direct (not to exceed the Merger Consideration payable with respect
to the Shares formerly represented by such Certificate) to indemnify against
any claim that might be brought with respect to the Certificate upon which
payment was made.

 



 

 **2.7.** **Dissenters  Rights**. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into the right to
receive Merger Consideration, but shall, by virtue of the Merger, be entitled
to only such consideration as shall be determined pursuant to Section 262 of
the DGCL. If any holder of Shares shall have failed to perfect or shall have
waived, effectively withdrawn or otherwise lost such holders right to
appraisal under the DGCL, such holders Shares shall be deemed to have been
converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as provided in Section 2.5(a)(iii) (less any amounts entitled to
be deducted or withheld pursuant to Section 2.6(e)), and such Shares shall not
be deemed to be Dissenting Shares. The Company shall deliver prompt notice to
Parent of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of any Shares and
shall provide Parent a reasonable opportunity to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of
Parent, in its sole and absolute discretion, make any payment with respect to,
or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the
foregoing. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall not, except with the
prior written consent of the Company, in its sole and absolute discretion,
require the Company to make any payment with respect to any such demands.

 



 

 **2.8.** **Treatment of Company Options, Company Restricted Stock Awards and
Company Cash Awards**.

 



 

 **(a)** Each Company Option that is outstanding as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall accelerate and become fully vested and exercisable
effective immediately prior to, and contingent upon, the Effective Time. As of
the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on
the part of the holders of such Company Options, Parent, Purchaser or the
Company, each Company Option that is then outstanding and unexercised shall be
cancelled and converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to
the product of (i) the total number of Shares subject to such Company Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by (ii) the excess, if
any, of (A) the Merger Consideration over (B) the exercise price payable per
Share under such Company Option, which amount shall be paid in accordance with

 



     

 

 



 

this Section 2.8(a). For the avoidance of doubt, any Company Option that has
an exercise price per Share that is greater than or equal to the Merger
Consideration shall be cancelled at the Effective Time for no consideration or
payment. As of the Effective Time, all Company Options shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically terminate and cease to exist, and each
holder of a Company Option shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the payment contemplated by this Section
2.8 in respect thereof. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective
Time (but no later than the later of (x) five (5) business days after the
Effective Time and (y) the first payroll date after the Effective Time), the
Surviving Corporation shall pay to the holders of Company Options the amounts
provided for in this Section 2.8(a) through the Surviving Corporations
payroll (subject to any required Tax withholdings).

 



 

 **(b)** Each Share subject to a Company Restricted Stock Award that is
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled
and converted at the Effective Time into a right to receive an amount equal to
the Merger Consideration (the " ** _Restricted Stock Consideration_** ").
Fifty percent (50%) of the Restricted Stock Consideration shall be payable as
of the Effective Time, and, unless otherwise agreed by the holder and Parent,
the remaining fifty percent (50%) of the Restricted Stock Consideration shall
be payable as and when such Share would have vested pursuant to the terms of
the applicable Company Restricted Stock Award, subject to satisfaction of such
vesting terms. As of the Effective Time, all Shares subject to a Company
Restricted Stock Award shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically
terminate and cease to exist, and each holder of a Company Stock Award shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
payments contemplated by this Section 2.8 in respect thereof. As soon as
reasonably practicable after the date as of which the Restricted Stock
Consideration is payable (but no later than the later of (i) five (5) business
days after such date or (ii) the first payroll date after such date), the
Surviving Corporation shall pay to the holders of Company Restricted Stock
Awards the amounts provided for in this Sections 2.8(b) through the Surviving
Corporations payroll (subject to any required Tax withholdings).

 



 

 **(c)** Each Company Cash Award that is outstanding as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding and be payable in accordance
with its terms, provided that payment of fifty percent (50%) of each payment
installment of such Company Cash Award shall be payable as soon as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time (but no later than the later of (i) five
(5) business days after such date or (ii) the first payroll date after such
date) through the Surviving Corporations payroll (subject to any required Tax
withholdings).

 



 

 **(d)** Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions
(including obtaining any necessary determinations or resolutions of the
Company Board or a committee of the Company Board) that may be necessary to
effectuate the provisions of this Section 2.8.

 



 

 **2.9.** **Further Action**. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any
further action is reasonably determined by Parent to be necessary or desirable
to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving
Corporation with full right, title and possession of and to all rights and
property of Purchaser and the Company, the officers and directors of the
Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name of
Purchaser, in the name of the Company and otherwise) to take such action.

 



      

 

 



 

 **SECTION 3.** **REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY**

 



 

The Company represents and warrants to Parent and Purchaser as follows (it
being understood that each representation and warranty contained in Section 3
is subject to: (a) exceptions and disclosures set forth in the part or subpart
of the Company Disclosure Letter corresponding to the particular Section or
subsection in this Section 3; (b) any exception or disclosure set forth in any
other part or subpart of the Company Disclosure Letter to the extent it is
reasonably apparent on its face from the wording of such exception or
disclosure that such exception or disclosure is applicable to qualify such
representation and warranty; and (c) disclosure in the Company SEC Documents
filed with the SEC and publicly available not less than one (1) business day
prior to the date of this Agreement (other than any information (other than
statements of historical fact) in (i) the "Risk Factors" or "Forward-Looking
Statements" sections of such Company SEC Documents or (ii) any other section
of such Company SEC Documents relating to forward-looking statements to the
extent they are generally cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in
nature); it being further understood that any matter disclosed in such Company
SEC Documents shall not be deemed disclosed for purposes of Sections 3.1, 3.2,
3.3, 3.5(a)(ii), 3.5(b), 3.18 or 3.20(a)):

 



 

 **3.1.** **Due Organization; Subsidiaries**.

 



 

 **(a)** The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization. The
Company has all necessary power and authority: (i) to conduct its business in
the manner in which its business is currently being conducted; (ii) to own and
use its assets in the manner in which its assets are currently owned and used;
and (iii) to perform its obligations under all Contracts by which it is bound,
in each case of clauses (i)-(iii) (except as set forth in Section 3.18),
except as would not have, and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. The Company is
qualified or licensed to do business as a foreign corporation, and is in good
standing, in each jurisdiction where the nature of its business or the
character or location of the assets owned or used by it requires such
qualification or licensing, except where the failure to be so qualified,
licensed or in good standing does not have, and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

 **(b)** Part 3.1(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter identifies each
Subsidiary of the Company and indicates its jurisdiction of organization.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries owns any capital stock of, or
any other equity interest of, or any equity interest of any nature in, any
other Entity, other than as identified in Part 3.1(b) of the Company
Disclosure Letter. None of the Acquired Corporations has agreed or is
obligated to make, or is bound by any Contract under which it may become
obligated to make, any future investment in or capital contribution to any
other Entity.

 



 

 **(c)** Each Subsidiary of the Company is an Entity duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
organization, except where the failure to be in good standing does not have,
and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. Each Subsidiary of the Company has all
necessary power and authority: (i) to conduct its business in the manner in
which its business is currently being conducted; (ii) to own and use its
assets in the manner in which its assets are

 



     

 

 



 

currently owned and used; and (iii) to perform its obligations under all
Contracts by which it is bound, in each case of clauses (i)-(iii) (except as

employees of the Acquired Corporations who have a significant role in the

in and required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act that are reasonably

processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
rules and forms of the SEC; and (ii) all such information is accumulated and
communicated to the Companys management as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure and to enable each of the principal
executive officer of the Company and the principal financial officer of the
Company to make the certifications required under the Exchange Act with
respect to such reports.

 



     

 

 



 

 **(e)** As of the date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding or

distributed or otherwise disseminated to the Companys stockholders, as
applicable, will comply as to form in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of the Exchange Act. At the time any Company
Disclosure Documents are filed with the SEC or any supplement or amendment to
such Company Disclosure Documents are filed with the SEC and at the time such
Company Disclosure Documents or any supplements or amendments to such Company
Disclosure Documents are first distributed or otherwise disseminated to the
Companys stockholders, such Company Disclosure Documents will not contain any

charges and after giving effect to the maximum amount of "flex" (including
original issue discount flex) provided under the Debt Commitment Letters and

Purchaser to pay all amounts required to be paid by Parent or Purchaser
pursuant to Section 1 and Section 2 and any other amounts required to be paid
by Parent or

Purchaser, any Investor (as defined in the Equity Financing Commitment) or any
Person who controls such Investor owns any Shares.

 



 

 **4.9.** **Solvency**. Neither Parent nor Purchaser is entering into this
Agreement with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud either their present or
future creditors. Assuming satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to
Parents and Purchasers obligations to consummate the Offer and the Merger

warranties of the Company set forth in Section 3, immediately after giving
effect to all of the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
the payment of the aggregate Offer Price and Merger Consideration, and any
other repayment or refinancing of debt that may be contemplated in this
Agreement or the Financing Commitments and payment of any other components of
the Required Amount, the Surviving Corporation will be Solvent as of the Offer

 **4.10.** **Non-Reliance; Acknowledgement by Parent and Purchaser**.

 



 

 **(a)** Neither Parent nor Purchaser is relying or has relied on any of the
information, materials or data referred to in Section 4.10(b) or any
representations or warranties whatsoever regarding the subject matter of this
Agreement, express or implied, except for the representations and warranties
in Section 3 and in the Tender and Support Agreement. Each of Parent and
Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that (i) the representations and warranties
of the Company in Section 3 constitute the sole and exclusive representations
and warranties of the Acquired Corporations in connection with the
Transactions and (ii) neither Parent nor Purchaser has relied upon, and the
Acquired Corporations specifically disclaim, any other representations and
warranties of any kind or nature whether express, implied or statutory made by
or on behalf of the Acquired Corporations.

 



 

 **(b)** In entering into this Agreement, Parent and Purchaser have relied
solely upon their own investigation and analysis and the representations and
warranties contained in Section 3 and in the Tender and Support Agreement.
Parent and Purchaser have been given access to and an opportunity to examine
such documents, materials and information concerning the Acquired Corporations
as Parent and Purchaser have deemed necessary or advisable in order to reach
an informed decision as to the decision to enter into this Agreement and
consummate the Transactions. In connection with such due diligence
investigation of the Acquired Corporations by Parent and Purchaser and their
respective Affiliates, stockholders and Representatives, Parent and Purchaser
and their respective Affiliates, stockholders and Representatives have
received or been provided access to and may continue to receive or be provided
access to (including in any "data rooms") after the date of this Agreement
from the Company, the other Acquired Corporations, and their respective
Affiliates, stockholders and Representatives, certain estimates, projections,
forecasts and other forward-looking information, as well as certain business
plan information, regarding the Acquired Corporations and their respective
businesses and operations.

 



     

 

 



 

Parent and Purchaser acknowledge that there are uncertainties inherent in
attempting to make such estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-
looking statements, as well as in such business plans, and that Parent and
Purchaser will have no claim against the Acquired Corporations, or any of
their respective Affiliates, stockholders or Representatives, or any other
Person with respect to such matters unless any such information is expressly
included in a representation or warranty contained in Section 3. Each of
Parent and Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that neither the Acquired
Corporations nor any of their respective Affiliates, stockholders or
Representatives, nor any other Person, has made or is making any express or
implied representation or warranty with respect to such estimates,
projections, forecasts, forward-looking statements or business plans unless
any such information is expressly included in a representation or warranty
contained in Section 3.

 



 

 **4.11.** **Brokers and Other Advisors**. No broker, finder, investment
banker or financial advisor is entitled to any brokerage, finders or other
similar fee or commission, or the reimbursement of expenses, in connection
with the Transactions based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent,
Purchaser or any of their respective Subsidiaries except for Persons, if any,
whose fees and expenses shall be paid by Parent or Purchaser.

 



 

 **4.12.** **Limited Guarantee** _._ Concurrently with the execution of this
Agreement, Parent has delivered to the Company the duly executed limited
guarantee of the Guarantors, dated as of the date of this Agreement, in favor
of the Company in respect of Parents obligation to pay the Parent Termination
Fee and the other obligations specified therein, up to the aggregate amount
set forth therein (the " ** _Limited Guarantee_** "). The Limited Guarantee is
(a) a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Guarantors, (b) enforceable
against the Guarantors in accordance with its terms, except as such
enforcement may be subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer,
reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws of general applicability
relating to or affecting creditors rights, and by general equitable
principles, and (c) in full force and effect. No event has occurred which,
with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would or would reasonably be
expected to constitute a default or breach on the part of the Guarantors under
the Limited Guarantee.

 



 

 **4.13.** **Financing**.

 



 

 **(a)** Parent and Purchaser have delivered to the Company true, correct,
complete and unredacted copies of (i) executed debt commitment letters,
including all annexes, exhibits, schedules and other attachments thereto (the
" ** _Red Debt Commitment Letters_** "), pursuant to which the lenders party
thereto have agreed to provide debt financing in the amounts set forth
therein, (ii) an executed debt commitment letter, including all annexes,
exhibits, schedules and other attachments thereto (the " ** _Green Debt
Commitment Letter_** " and, together with the Red Debt Commitment Letters, the
" ** _Debt Commitment Letters_** "), pursuant to which the lenders party
thereto have agreed to provide debt financing in the amounts set forth therein
(the debt financing contemplated by the Red Debt Commitment Letters and the
Green Debt Commitment Letter, the " ** _Debt Financing_** "), and (iii) an
executed equity commitment letter from the Guarantors, including all annexes,
exhibits, schedules and other attachments thereto (the " ** _Equity Financing
Commitment_** " and, together with the Debt Commitment Letters, the " **
_Financing Commitments_** "), pursuant to which the Guarantors have committed
to provide equity financing to Parent in an amount set forth therein (the " **
_Equity Financing_** " and, together with the Debt Financing, the

 



     

 

 



 

" ** _Financing_** "). Parent and Purchaser have also delivered to the Company
true, correct and complete copies of the fee letters relating to the Debt
Financing, in which the only redactions are the fee amounts, "flex" terms and
other economic terms customarily redacted pursuant to merger agreements of
this type, and such redactions do not relate to any terms that would be
reasonably likely to adversely affect the conditionality, enforceability,
availability or termination of the applicable Debt Commitment Letter or reduce
the aggregate principal amount of the Debt Financing below the amount required
to pay the Required Amount (collectively, the " ** _Redacted Fee Letters_**
").

 



 

 **(b)** As of the date of this Agreement, none of the Financing Commitments
(i) have been withdrawn, terminated or rescinded in any respect or (ii) have
been amended or modified, and, to the knowledge of each of Parent and
Purchaser, the respective commitments contained therein have not been
withdrawn or rescinded, nor, to the knowledge of each of Parent and Purchaser,
is any such amendment, modification, withdrawal or rescission currently
contemplated other than any amendment or modification to any Debt Commitment
Letter solely to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents
or similar entities (or titles with respect to such entities) who had not
executed such Debt Commitment Letter as of the date of this Agreement. As of
the date of this Agreement, the Financing Commitments are (i) in full force
and effect and constitute the legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent,
in the case of the Equity Financing Commitment, Red Holdings, in the case of
the Red Debt Commitment Letters, and Green Holdings, in the case of the Green
Debt Commitment Letter, and, to the knowledge of each of Parent and Purchaser,
the other parties thereto, and (ii) enforceable in accordance with their
respective terms against Parent, in the case of the Equity Financing
Commitment, Red Holdings, in the case of the Red Debt Commitment Letters, and
Green Holdings, in the case of the Green Debt Commitment Letter, and, to the
knowledge of each of Parent and Purchaser, each of the other parties thereto,
in each case, except to the extent enforcement may be subject to bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and/or other laws
affecting creditors rights generally and by general equitable principles
(regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

 



 

 **(c)** There are no conditions precedent related to the funding or
investing, as applicable, of the amount of the Financing required to pay the
Required Amount, other than as expressly set forth in the Financing
Commitments and the unredacted portions of the Redacted Fee Letters, each in
the form delivered. Other than the Financing Commitments and the unredacted
portions of the Redacted Fee Letters, there are no other Contracts,
arrangements or side letters to which Purchaser or any of its Affiliates is a
party related to the funding or investing, as applicable, of the amount of the
Financing required to pay the Required Amount that would (i) impair the
enforceability of any of the Financing Commitments, (ii) reduce the aggregate
amount of any portion of the Financing such that the aggregate amount of the
Financing would be below the amount required to pay the Required Amount, (iii)
impose new or additional conditions precedent to the Financing, (iv) otherwise
adversely modify any of the conditions precedent to the Financing or (v)
reasonably be expected to prevent, impair or delay the consummation of the
Financing.

 



 

 **(d)** As of the date of this Agreement, (i) no event has occurred that
(with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) would constitute a breach
or default of Parent, Purchaser, Red Holdings or Green Holdings or, to the
knowledge of each of Parent and Purchaser, any other

 



     

 

 



 

parties thereto under the Financing Commitments or would otherwise be
reasonably likely to result in any portion of the Financing necessary to pay
the Required Amount to be unavailable, other than any such default or breach
that has been irrevocably waived by the lenders providing the Debt Financing
or otherwise cured in a timely manner by Parent, Purchaser, Red Holdings
and/or Green Holdings, as applicable, to the satisfaction of such lenders,
(ii) neither Parent nor Purchaser is aware of any fact, event or other
occurrence that makes any of the representations or warranties of each of
Parent, Purchaser, Red Holdings and Green Holdings in any of the Financing
Commitments inaccurate in any material respect, and (iii) assuming
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in **Annex I** , neither
Parent nor Purchaser has any reason to believe that any of the conditions
precedent set forth in the Financing Commitments will fail to be timely
satisfied or that the Required Amount will not be available at the Offer
Closing.

 



 

 **(e)** Purchaser has fully paid, or caused to be paid, any and all
commitment fees or other fees required by the terms of the Financing
Commitments to be paid on or before the date of this Agreement and will
continue to pay in full, or cause to be paid, any such amounts required to be
paid pursuant to the terms of the Financing Commitments as and when they
become due and payable on or prior to the Closing Date.

 



 

 **(f)** Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the
Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that its obligations to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby are not contingent upon its ability to obtain
any third party financing.

 



 

 **SECTION 5.** **CERTAIN COVENANTS OF THE COMPANY**

request. Any such access shall be conducted at Parents expense, at a
reasonable time, under the supervision of appropriate personnel of the
Acquired Corporations, in such a manner as not to unreasonably interfere with
the normal operation of the business of the Acquired Corporations. Such access
shall be subject to the Companys reasonable security measures and insurance
requirements and shall not include the right to perform invasive testing
without the Companys prior written consent, which may be given or withheld in
its sole discretion. Nothing in this Agreement shall require any of the
Acquired Corporations to disclose any information to Parent if the Company
determines, in the Companys reasonable discretion after consultation with
outside legal counsel, that doing so is reasonably likely to: (i) jeopardize
any attorney-client or other legal privilege (so long as the Acquired
Corporations have used commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with
Parent to permit disclosure of such information on a basis that does not waive
such privilege); or (ii) contravene any applicable Legal Requirement or
binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement (including
any confidentiality

 



     

 

 



 

agreement to which an Acquired Corporation or its Affiliate is a party,
provided that the Company shall have used commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain the consent of any applicable third-party to provide such information).

disclosed subject to execution of a joint defense agreement in customary form.
In addition, disclosure may be limited to external counsel for Parent, to the
extent that the Company determines doing so may be reasonably required for the
purpose of complying with applicable Antitrust Laws. With respect to the
information disclosed pursuant to this Section 5.1, Parent shall comply with,

obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement.

Superior Offer, and, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the
failure to take the following actions would be inconsistent with the fiduciary
duties of the Company Board to the Companys stockholders under applicable
Legal Requirements, then the Company and its Representatives may (x) furnish,

obligations owed by any Person to the Acquired Corporations that prohibit such
Person from making, or requesting a modification, waiver or amendment to make,
an Acquisition Proposal from and after the date of this Agreement.

 



 

 **(c)** Following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall: (i) promptly
(and in any event within one (1) business day after knowledge of receipt by an
executive officer or director of the Company) notify Parent if any inquiries,
proposals or offers with respect to an Acquisition Proposal are received by
any Acquired Corporation; (ii) provide to Parent a summary of the material
terms and conditions of any Acquisition Proposal (including a copy thereof and
any financing commitment papers submitted therewith, if such Acquisition
Proposal is in writing), and the identity of the Person or group of Persons
making such Acquisition Proposal; and (iii) keep Parent reasonably informed of
any material developments, discussions or negotiations regarding any
Acquisition Proposal on a reasonably prompt basis (and the Company shall as
promptly as practicable after the receipt thereof (and in any event within one
(1) business day) provide Parent with copies of any written materials relating
to such Acquisition Proposal or any material change to the financial or other
material terms and conditions thereof).

 



 

 **(d)** Nothing in this Section 5.3 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall
prohibit the Company from: (i) taking and disclosing to the stockholders of
the Company a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item
1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act; (ii) making any
"stop, look and listen" communication pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated
under the Exchange Act (it being understood that any "stop, look or listen"
communication that contains only the information set forth in Rule 14d-9(f)
shall not be deemed a Company Adverse Change Recommendation or be deemed to
have the substantive effect of withdrawing or adversely modifying the Company
Board Recommendation) or (iii) making any disclosure to the stockholders of
the Company (A) that is required by applicable Legal Requirements or (B) if
the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the
Companys outside legal counsel, that the failure of the Company Board to make
such disclosure would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company
Board to the Companys stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements;
_provided_ , _however_ , that this Section 5.3(d) shall not be deemed to
permit the Company or the Company Board or any committee thereof to effect a
Company Adverse Change Recommendation.

 



 

 **SECTION 6.** **ADDITIONAL COVENANTS OF THE PARTIES**

 



 

 **6.1.** **Company Board Recommendation**.

 



 

 **(a)** Subject to Section 6.1(b), the Company consents to the inclusion of
the Company Board Recommendation in the Offer Documents. Subject to Section
6.1(b), during the Pre-Closing Period, neither the Company Board nor any
committee of the Company Board shall: (i) (A) withdraw, qualify, modify or
amend, or publicly propose to withdraw, qualify, modify or amend, the Company
Board Recommendation, (B) approve, endorse, recommend or declare

 



 



     

 

 



 

advisable, or publicly propose to approve, endorse, recommend or declare
advisable, any Acquisition Proposal, or (C) fail to include the Company Board
Recommendation in the Schedule 14D-9 or, if any Acquisition Proposal has been
made public or the Company Board has made a disclosure to the stockholders of
the Company pursuant to Section 5.3(d), fail to reaffirm the Company Board
Recommendation upon request of Parent within the earlier of three (3) business
days prior to the then-scheduled Expiration Date or ten (10) business days
after Parent requests in writing such reaffirmation with respect to such
Acquisition Proposal ( _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may make such
request only once with respect to such Acquisition Proposal unless (1) such
Acquisition Proposal is subsequently publicly modified in any material
respect, or (2) the Company subsequently makes a disclosure pursuant to
Section 5.3(d) with respect to such Acquisition Proposal, in which case Parent
may make such request once each time such modification or disclosure is made)
(any action described in this clause (i) being referred to as a " ** _Company
Adverse Change Recommendation_** "); or (ii) approve, endorse, recommend or
declare advisable, or propose to approve, endorse, recommend or declare
advisable, or allow the Company to execute or enter into any Contract with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement entered into as contemplated by Section 5.3(b)).

 



 

 **(b)** Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
at any time prior to the Offer Acceptance Time:

 



 

 **(i)** if the Company has received a _bona fide_ written Acquisition
Proposal that did not result from any breach in any material respect of
Section 5.3 from any Person that has not been withdrawn and, after
consultation with outside legal counsel and financial advisors, the Company
Board shall have determined, in good faith, that such Acquisition Proposal is
a Superior Offer, then: (x) the Company Board may make a Company Adverse
Change Recommendation; or (y) the Company may terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.1(e) to enter into a Specified Agreement with respect to
such Superior Offer. As a condition of electing either option (x) or (y) of
the preceding sentence: (A) the Company Board shall have determined in good
faith, after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel, that the
failure to elect such option would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties
of the Company Board to the Companys stockholders under applicable Legal
Requirements; (B) the Company shall have given Parent written notice of its
intention to make a Company Adverse Change Recommendation or terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(e) at least four (4) business days prior to
making any such Company Adverse Change Recommendation or termination (a " **
_Determination Notice_** ") (which notice shall not itself constitute a
Company Adverse Change Recommendation or termination); (C) the Company shall
have provided to Parent a summary of the material terms and conditions of the
Acquisition Proposal in accordance with Section 5.3(c) and the basis for
determining that such Acquisition Proposal would constitute a Superior Offer;
(D) the Company shall have provided Parent four (4) business days after the
Determination Notice to propose revisions in writing to the terms of this
Agreement, the Financing Commitments and the Limited Guarantee or make another
proposal (which revisions or other proposal, if accepted by the Company, would
be legally binding) so that such Acquisition Proposal would cease to
constitute a Superior Offer and would no longer necessitate a Company Adverse
Change Recommendation; (E) if requested by Parent, the Acquired Corporations
shall have made their Representatives available to discuss with Parents
Representatives any such revisions or other proposal during such four (4)
business day period and (F) after giving effect to such revisions or proposals
made by

 



     

 

 



 

Parent, if any, after consultation with outside legal counsel and financial
advisors, the Company Board shall have determined, in good faith, that such
Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Offer and that, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, the failure to make the Company
Adverse Change Recommendation or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.1(e) would continue to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the
Company Board to the Companys stockholders under applicable Legal
Requirements. The provisions of this Section 6.1(b)(i) shall also apply to any
material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal and require a new Determination
Notice, except that the references to four (4) business days shall be deemed
to be references to two (2) business days; and

 



 

 **(ii)** other than in connection with an Acquisition Proposal, the Company
Board may make a Company Adverse Change Recommendation in response to a Change
in Circumstance if: (A) the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel, that the failure to do
so would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board to the
Companys stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements; (B) the Company
shall have given Parent a Determination Notice (which notice shall not itself
constitute a Company Adverse Change Recommendation) at least four (4) business
days prior to making any such Company Adverse Change Recommendation; (C) the
Company shall have specified the Change in Circumstance in reasonable detail;
(D) the Company shall have provided Parent four (4) business days after the
Determination Notice to propose revisions in writing to the terms of this
Agreement, the Financing Commitments and the Limited Guarantee or make another
proposal (which revisions or other proposal, if accepted by the Company, would
be legally binding) so that such Change in Circumstance would no longer
necessitate a Company Adverse Change Recommendation; (E) if requested by
Parent, the Acquired Corporations shall have made their Representatives
available to discuss with Parents Representatives any such proposed revisions
or other proposal during such four (4) business day period and (F) after
giving effect to the revisions or other proposals made by Parent, if any,
after consultation with outside legal counsel, the Company Board shall have
determined, in good faith, that the failure to make the Company Adverse Change
Recommendation in response to such Change in Circumstance would continue to be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board to the Companys
stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements. The provisions of this
Section 6.1(b)(ii) shall also apply to any material change to the facts and
circumstances relating to such Change in Circumstance and require a new
Determination Notice, except that the references to four (4) business days
shall be deemed to be references to two (2) business days.

 



 

 **6.2.** **Filings, Consents and Approvals**.

 



 

 **(a)** Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, each
of the Parties shall use its respective reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, to file, or cause to be filed, all documents
and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other
Parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable
Antitrust Laws to consummate and make effective the Transactions as soon as
reasonably practicable, and in any event prior to the End Date. Such actions
shall include: (i) the obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions,
waivers, consents, clearances, decisions, declarations, approvals and,
expirations or terminations of waiting periods from Governmental Bodies and
the making of all necessary registrations and filings; (ii) the taking of all
steps as may be necessary to obtain any

 



     

 

 



 

such consent, decision, declaration, approval, clearance or waiver, or
expiration or termination of a waiting period by or from, or to avoid an
action or proceeding by, any Governmental Body in connection with any
Antitrust Law; (iii) the obtaining of all necessary consents, authorizations,
approvals or waivers from third parties; and (iv) the execution and delivery
of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the Transactions.

 



 

 **(b)** By way of illustration and not limitation, the Parties shall promptly
(or shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to): (i) take all actions and
steps requested or required by any Governmental Body as a condition to
granting any consent, permit, authorization, waiver, clearance and approvals,
and to cause the prompt expiration or termination of any applicable waiting
period and to resolve objections, if any, as the FTC, the DOJ, or other
Governmental Bodies of any other jurisdiction for which consents, permits,
authorizations, waivers, clearances, approvals and expirations or terminations
of waiting periods are sought with respect to the Transactions; (ii) obtain
such consents, permits, authorizations, waivers, clearances, approvals or
termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws,
and to avoid the commencement of a lawsuit by the FTC, the DOJ or other
Governmental Bodies under Antitrust Laws; and (iii) take all actions and steps
to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction,
temporary restraining order or other order in any suit or proceeding which
would otherwise have the effect of preventing the Closing or materially
delaying the Offer Acceptance Time or the Closing or delaying the Offer
Acceptance Time beyond the End Date. Such actions and steps shall include: (x)
negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate
order or otherwise, the sale, lease, license, divestiture or disposition of
any assets, rights, product lines, or businesses of Parent, Purchaser, the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries; and (y) otherwise taking or
committing to take any actions with respect to the businesses, product lines
or assets of Parent, Purchaser, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company and the Acquired
Corporations shall be required to take or commit to take any such action, or
agree to any such condition or restriction, only if such action, commitment,
agreement, condition or restriction is binding on the Company and the Acquired
Corporations solely if the Closing occurs. The Parties shall defend through
litigation on the merits any claim asserted in court by any party under
Antitrust Laws in order to avoid entry of, or to have vacated or terminated,
any decree, order or judgment (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent)
that could restrain, delay, or prevent the Closing by the End Date.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such litigation shall in no way limit the
obligation of Purchaser and Parent to take all actions and steps to eliminate
each and every impediment identified in this Agreement.

 



 

 **(c)** Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company
shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries, if applicable, to), on the one hand,
and Parent and Purchaser shall (and shall procure its controlling Persons, if
applicable, to), on the other hand: (i) promptly, but in no event later than
seven (7) business days after the date of this Agreement, make, or have made,
an appropriate filing of all Notification and Report forms as required by the
HSR Act with respect to the Transactions; (ii) as soon as reasonably
practicable, after the date of this Agreement, make, or have made, all other
filings, notifications or other consents as may be required to be made or
obtained under foreign Antitrust Laws in those jurisdictions identified in
Schedule 6.2(c); and (iii) cooperate with each other in determining whether,
and promptly preparing and making, any

 



     

 

 



 

other filings or notifications or other consents are required to be made with,
or obtained from, any other Governmental Bodies in connection with the
Transactions.

 



 

 **(d)** Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this Section
6.2, during the Pre-Closing Period, each Party shall use its reasonable best
efforts to: (i) cooperate (and, in the case of the Company, cause its
Subsidiaries to, and in the case of Parent and Purchaser, procure that its
controlling Persons cooperate) in all respects and consult with each other in
connection with any filing or submission in connection with any investigation
or other inquiry, including allowing the other Party to have a reasonable
opportunity to review in advance and comment on drafts of filings and
submissions; (ii) give the other Parties prompt notice of the making or
commencement of any request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal
Proceeding brought by a Governmental Body or brought by a third party before
any Governmental Body, in each case, with respect to the Transactions; (iii)
keep the other Parties informed as to the status of any such request, inquiry,
investigation, action or Legal Proceeding; (iv) promptly inform the other
Parties of any communication to or from the FTC, DOJ or any other Governmental
Body in connection with any such request, inquiry, investigation, action or
Legal Proceeding; (v) subject to an appropriate confidentiality agreement to
limit disclosure to outside counsel and consultants retained by such counsel,
promptly furnish the other Party with copies of all correspondence from any
Governmental Body in connection with any such request, inquiry, investigation,
action or Legal Proceeding (other than Item "4(c)" and "4(d)" documents as
those terms are used under the HSR Act); (vi) consult in advance and cooperate
with the other Parties and consider in good faith the views of the other
Parties in connection with any communication, analysis, appearance,
presentation, memorandum, brief, argument, opinion or proposal to be made or
submitted in connection with any such request, inquiry, investigation, action
or Legal Proceeding; and (vii) except as may be prohibited by any Governmental
Body or by any Legal Requirement, in connection with any such request,
inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding in respect of the
Transactions, each Party shall provide advance notice of and permit authorized
Representatives of the other Party to be present at each meeting or
teleconference relating to such request, inquiry, investigation, action or
Legal Proceeding and to have access to and be consulted in advance in
connection with any argument, opinion or proposal to be made or submitted to
any Governmental Body in connection with such request, inquiry, investigation,
action or Legal Proceeding. Each Party shall (and in the case of Parent and
Purchaser, shall procure its controlling Persons to) supply as promptly as
practicable such information, documentation, other material or testimony that
may be reasonably requested by any Governmental Body, including by complying
at the earliest reasonably practicable date with any reasonable request for
additional information, documents or other materials received by any Party or
any of their respective Subsidiaries from any Governmental Body in connection
with such applications or filings for the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Purchaser shall pay all filing fees under the HSR Act and for any
filings required under foreign Antitrust Laws. Neither Party shall commit to
or agree with any Governmental Body to stay, toll or extend any applicable
waiting period under the HSR Act, or withdraw any notification filed under the
HSR Act, or other applicable Antitrust Laws, without the prior written consent
of the other.

 



 

 **(e)** Without the prior written approval of the Company, prior to the
Closing, Parent and Purchaser, excluding any Affiliates other than
Subsidiaries, shall not, and shall not encourage or direct any Affiliates to,
negotiate, effect or agree to any business combination

 



     

 

 



 

(whether structured as a merger, business combination, tender offer, exchange
offer or similar transaction) or the acquisition of any assets, licenses,
rights, product lines, operations or businesses of any Person that may compete
with any of the products sold or in development by the Acquired Corporations,
or which business combination or acquisition could reasonably be expected to
prevent, impair or materially delay consummation of the Transactions.

 



 

 **6.3.** **Employee Benefits**. Subject to the terms of any Collective
Bargaining Agreement, for a period of one (1) year following the Effective
Time, Parent shall provide, or cause to be provided, to those employees of the
Acquired Corporations who are employed by any Acquired Corporation as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time and who continue to be actively
employed by the Surviving Corporation (or any Affiliate of the Surviving
Corporation) during such one (1) year period (the " ** _Continuing
Employees_** ") (i) base salary, base wages, annual cash bonus opportunities
and commission opportunities each on a basis no less favorable than that in
effect immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement, and (ii) other
benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the benefits
provided to the Continuing Employees immediately prior to the execution of
this Agreement (excluding remuneration covered in clause (i) of this sentence
and equity compensation and long-term cash incentive opportunities). Without
limiting the foregoing:

 



 

 **(a)** Each Continuing Employee shall be given service credit for all
purposes, including for eligibility to participate, benefit accrual and
vesting under Parent employee benefit plans and arrangements with respect to
his or her length of service with the Company (and its subsidiaries and
predecessors) prior to the Closing Date. Such service shall not be recognized
(i) to the extent that such recognition would result in the duplication of
benefits for the same period of service or (ii) for purposes of any plan or
arrangement that is grandfathered or frozen, _provided_ , that if any such
plan is grandfathered or frozen in part, the Continuing Employees shall be
credited with prior service for purposes of participation in such plan with
respect to the portion(s) of such plan that is not so grandfathered or frozen.

 



 

 **(b)** With respect to any accrued but unused personal, sick or vacation
time to which any Continuing Employee is entitled pursuant to the personal,
sick or vacation policies applicable to such Continuing Employee immediately
prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to and instruct its controlled Affiliates to, as applicable (and
without duplication of benefits), assume the liability for such accrued
personal, sick or vacation time and allow such Continuing Employee to use such
accrued personal, sick or vacation time in accordance with the practice and
policies of the Company and subject to applicable Legal Requirements.

 



 

 **(c)** With respect to any severance plans or policies, Parent shall, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor and assume the Companys
severance plans or policies in which any Continuing Employees are eligible to
participate, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, subject to
the terms of such plans or policies.

 



 

 **(d)** Parent agrees that each Continuing Employee shall be eligible to
continue to participate in the Surviving Corporations health and welfare
benefit plans (to the same extent that such Continuing Employee was eligible
to participate under the applicable Acquired Corporations health and welfare
benefit plans immediately prior to the Effective Time).

 



     

 

 



 

Notwithstanding the foregoing: (i) nothing in this Section 6.3 or elsewhere in
this Agreement shall limit the right of Parent or the Surviving Corporation to
amend or terminate any Surviving Corporation health or welfare benefit plan at
any time; and (ii) if Parent or the Surviving Corporation terminates a
Surviving Corporation health or welfare benefit plan, then each Continuing
Employee shall be eligible to participate in Parents health and welfare
benefit plans to the extent that coverage under such plans is replacing
comparable coverage under an Employee Plan in which such Continuing Employee
participated immediately before the Effective Time. To the extent that service
is relevant for eligibility, vesting or allowances (including paid time off)
under any health or welfare benefit plan of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, then Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to: (A)
waive all limitations as to pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting
periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to
the Continuing Employees, to the extent that such conditions, exclusions and
waiting periods would not apply under a similar employee benefit plan in which
such employees participated prior to the Effective Time; and (B) ensure that
such health or welfare benefit plan shall, for purposes of eligibility,
vesting, deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums and allowances
(including paid time off), credit Continuing Employees for service and amounts
paid prior to the Effective Time with the Company to the same extent that such
service and amounts paid were recognized prior to the Effective Time under the
corresponding health or welfare benefit plan of the Company. Nothing in this
Section 6.3 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be construed to create a
right in any employee to employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
any other Affiliate of the Surviving Corporation and the employment of each
Continuing Employee shall be "at will" employment.

 



 

 **(e)** With respect to each of the Companys bonus plans or programs set
forth in Part 3.5 of the Company Disclosure Letter, Parent shall, or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor and assume each such plan or
program, in each case, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

 **(f)** Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, after the
Effective Time, nothing in this Section 6.3 shall preclude the Surviving
Corporation from terminating the employment of any employee of the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries for any lawful reason.

 



 

 **(g)** The provisions of this Section 6.3 are solely for the benefit of the
Parties. No provision of this Section 6.3 is intended to, or shall, constitute
the establishment or adoption of or an amendment to any employee benefit plan
for purposes of ERISA or otherwise. In addition, no current or former employee
or any other individual associated with the Parties shall be regarded for any
purpose as a third party beneficiary of the Agreement or have the right to
enforce the provisions of this Agreement or confer upon such individual the
right to continue employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or their
respective Subsidiaries following the Effective Time, or interfere with any
right or ability of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or their respective
Subsidiaries to terminate the employment of any employee for any reason or no
reason following the Effective Time.

 



      

 

 



 

 **6.4.** **Indemnification of Officers and Directors**.

 



 

 **(a)** All rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and
exculpation by the Company or any other Acquired Corporation existing in favor
of the Indemnified Persons for their acts and omissions occurring prior to the
Effective Time, as provided in the certificate of incorporation, bylaws and
other charter and organizational documents of the applicable Acquired
Corporation and as provided in any indemnification agreements between the
Acquired Corporations and said Indemnified Persons in effect as of the date of
this Agreement, shall survive the Merger. All such rights and entitlements
shall be observed by the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to the
fullest extent available under applicable Legal Requirements for a period of
six (6) years from the Effective Time, and any claim made requesting
indemnification or advancement of expenses pursuant to such rights within such
six (6)-year period shall continue to be subject to this Section 6.4(a) and
the rights provided under Section 6.4(b) until disposition of such claim. From
the Effective Time until the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time,
the certificate of incorporation, bylaws and other charter and organizational
documents of the Surviving Corporation and each of the other Acquired
Corporations shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of individuals who
were, prior to the Effective Time, Indemnified Persons, than are presently set
forth in the certificate of incorporation, bylaws and other charter and
organizational documents of the Surviving Corporation and each of the other
Acquired Corporations, as amended through the Effective Time. From the
Effective Time until the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, such
provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner
that would adversely affect the rights of any such individuals under such
certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other charter or organizational
documents.

 



 

 **(b)** From the Effective Time until the sixth (6th) anniversary of the date
on which the Effective Time occurs, the Surviving Corporation shall, and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Legal Requirements, indemnify and hold harmless
each Indemnified Person against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities,
fees, expenses, judgments or fines incurred by such Indemnified Person in
connection with any pending or threatened Legal Proceeding based on or arising
out of, in whole or in part, the fact that such Indemnified Person is or was
(i) a director or officer of an Acquired Corporation or (ii) serving at the
request of an Acquired Corporation as an officer or director of another
Person, in each case of clauses (i) and (ii), at or prior to the Effective
Time. Such indemnification and hold harmless provisions shall apply to any and
all matters pending, existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time,
whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time,
including any such matter arising under any claim with respect to the
Transactions. Without limiting the foregoing, from the Effective Time until
the sixth (6th) anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time occurs,
the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Legal
Requirements, advance out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including attorneys
fees) incurred by the Indemnified Persons in connection with matters for which
such Indemnified Persons are eligible to be indemnified pursuant to this
Section 6.4(b), subject to the execution by such Indemnified Persons of
unsecured undertakings in favor of the Surviving Corporation to repay such
advanced costs and expenses if it is ultimately determined in a final and non-
appealable judgment of a court of

 



     

 

 



 

competent jurisdiction that such Indemnified Person is not entitled to be
indemnified under this Section 6.4(b).

 



 

 **(c)** From the Effective Time until the sixth (6th) anniversary of the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, maintain, and shall cause the other Acquired
Corporations to maintain, in effect, the existing policy of directors and
officers liability insurance maintained by the Acquired Corporations as of
the date of this Agreement for the benefit of the Indemnified Persons
currently covered by such existing policy with respect to their acts and
omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time in their capacities as
directors or officers of the Acquired Corporations or another Person at the
request of an Acquired Corporation (as applicable), on terms with respect to
coverage, deductibles and amounts no less favorable than the existing policy.
Unless the Company has purchased a "tail" policy in accordance with this
Section 6.4(c), Parent may substitute therefor policies of a reputable and
financially sound insurance company containing terms and conditions, including
with respect to coverage, amounts, deductibles and exclusions that are,
individually and in the aggregate, no less favorable to any Indemnified
Person. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent shall not substitute any "tail"
policy purchased by the Company in accordance with this Section 6.4(c). In no
event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend an
annual premium in any one (1) year in an amount in excess of 300% of the
annual premium currently payable by the Acquired Corporations with respect to
such current policy (the " ** _Premium Cap_** "). The Parties acknowledge and
agree that if the annual premiums payable for such insurance coverage exceed
the Premium Cap, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available
for a cost equal to the Premium Cap. Notwithstanding the foregoing or
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, prior to the Effective Time, the
Company may at its option elect to, and currently intends to, purchase a six
(6)-year "tail" policy for each existing policy of the Acquired Corporations
effective as of the Effective Time so long as the aggregate premium for all
such "tail" policies do not exceed the Premium Cap. If such "tail" policies
have been obtained, they shall be deemed to satisfy all obligations to obtain
or maintain insurance pursuant to this Section 6.4(c). In the event the
Company elects to purchase such a "tail policy," the Surviving Corporation
shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain all such
"tail" policies in full force and effect for the full term of such policies
and continue to honor the Surviving Corporations obligations thereunder.

 



 

 **(d)** If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or Entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then Parent shall ensure that the
successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may
be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.4.

 



 

 **(e)** The provisions of this Section 6.4 shall survive the acceptance of
Shares for payment pursuant to the Offer and the consummation of the Merger
and are: (i) intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by,
each of the Indemnified Persons and their successors, assigns and heirs; and
(ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution, advancement of expenses or exculpation that
any such Person

 



     

 

 



 

may have by contract or otherwise. Unless required by applicable Legal
Requirement, this Section 6.4 may not be amended, altered or repealed after
the Offer Acceptance Time in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights
of any Indemnified Person or any of their successors, assigns or heirs without
the prior written consent of the affected Indemnified Person.

 



 

 **6.5.** **Securityholder Litigation; Notification of Certain Matters**.
Prior to the earlier of the Effective Time or the termination of this
Agreement, the Company shall control the defense of any Legal Proceedings
brought by stockholders of the Company against the Company or its officers or
directors relating to the Transactions and shall promptly notify Parent of any
such Legal Proceedings and any material developments with respect thereto.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, where legally permissible and reasonably
practicable, the Company shall give Parent and its counsel the right to review
and comment on all material filings or responses to be made by the Company in
connection with any such Legal Proceedings and give reasonable and good faith
consideration to any such comments made by Parent and its counsel. The Company
shall also give Parent and its counsel the right to consult on the settlement,
release, waiver or compromise of any such Legal Proceedings, and the Company
shall in good faith take Parents views into account. No such settlement,
release, waiver or compromise relating to the Transactions shall be agreed to
without Parents prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), except for settlements, releases, waivers
or compromises that (a) relate to Legal Proceedings to which none of Parent,
Purchaser, the Guarantors or their respective Affiliates are a party and (b)
provide solely for (i) money damages and the payment of attorneys fees in an
aggregate amount (together with all other settlements entered into pursuant to
Section 5.2(b)(x) and this Section 6.5) not in excess of amounts equal to the

Red Holdings and Green Holdings, as applicable, to use commercially reasonable
efforts, to take all actions and to do all things necessary to obtain the
Financing on the terms and subject only to the conditions described in the

thereto), including using commercially reasonable efforts to (i) negotiate
definitive agreements on substantially the terms and subject only to the
conditions (including the market "flex" provisions) contained in the
applicable Debt Commitment Letters and related Redacted Fee Letters (or on
other terms that, with respect to conditionality, are not less favorable to
Red Holdings or Green Holdings, as applicable, than the terms and conditions
(including market "flex" provisions) set forth in the applicable Debt
Commitment Letters and related Redacted Fee Letters), (ii) satisfy or cause
the satisfaction of all conditions applicable to Purchaser and its Affiliates
in the Financing Commitments and the definitive agreements for the Financing

Financing to provide such Financing), (vi) enforce its rights under the
Financing Commitments in the event of any breach thereof and (vii) otherwise
comply with Parents, Purchasers, Red Holdings and Green Holdings covenants
and other obligations under the Financing Commitments. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing contained in this Section
6.11 shall require, and in no event shall the commercially reasonable efforts
of Purchaser be deemed or construed to require, Purchaser to (A) seek the
Equity Financing from any source other than the counterparties to, or in any
amount in excess of that contemplated by, the Equity Financing Commitment, or
(B) pay any material fees in excess of those contemplated by the Equity
Financing Commitment or the Debt Commitment Letters and Redacted Fee Letters
(including any market "flex" provisions contained therein).

 



     

 

 



 

 **(b)** In the event any portion of the Debt Financing necessary to pay the
Required Amount becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions (including any
applicable market "flex" provisions) contemplated in the applicable Debt
Commitment Letter and related Redacted Fee Letter, Purchaser shall use
commercially reasonable efforts, as promptly as practicable, to obtain
alternative debt financing in an amount sufficient, together with the amount
of the Equity Financing and Debt Financing that remains available, to fund the
Required Amount with terms and conditions (including market "flex" provisions)
not less favorable to Purchaser or its Affiliates than the terms and
conditions set forth in the applicable Debt Commitment Letter and related
Redacted Fee Letter. Purchaser shall deliver to the Company true and complete
copies of the alternative debt commitment letters (including redacted fee
letters (redacted solely to the same extent as the Redacted Fee Letters)
related thereto) pursuant to which any such alternative source shall have
committed to provide any portion of the Debt Financing. Purchaser shall
deliver to the Company true and complete copies of the alternative debt
commitment letters (including Redacted Fee Letters) pursuant to which any such
alternative source shall have committed to provide any portion of the Debt

 **(c)** Purchaser shall have the right from time to time to amend, replace,
supplement or otherwise modify, or waive any of its rights under, the Debt
Financing. No such amendment, replacement, supplement, modification or waiver
shall, without the prior written consent of the Company (i) reduce the
aggregate amount of the Debt Financing such that the aggregate amount of the
Financing would be below the amount required to pay the Required Amount, (ii)
modify or expand upon any of the conditions precedent to the Debt Financing
from those set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters, or add any new conditions
precedent to the Debt Financing from those set forth in the Debt Commitment
Letters, in each case in a manner that would reasonably be expected to delay
or prevent the funding of the Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to
the Financing), (iii) be reasonably expected to prevent, impede or delay the
availability of the Debt Financing, (iv) agree to any early termination of any
Debt Commitment Letter (unless previously or simultaneously replaced with
alternative financing to the extent necessary to fund the Required Amount) or
(v) adversely impact the ability of Purchaser, Parent, Red Holdings or Green
Holdings, as applicable, to enforce its rights against other parties to the
Financing Commitments (collectively, the " ** _Restricted Commitment Letter
Amendments_** "). Purchaser may, in any event, modify, supplement or amend any
Debt Commitment Letter to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners,
syndication agents or similar entities (or titles with respect to such
entities) who had not executed such Debt Commitment Letter as of the date of
this Agreement. Purchaser shall promptly deliver to the Company a true and
correct copy of any such amendment, replacement, supplement, modification, or
waiver of or under the Debt Financing.

 



 

 **(d)** To the extent that Purchaser obtains alternative financing pursuant
to Section 6.11(b) above, or amends, replaces, supplements, modifies or waives
any of the Debt Financing pursuant to Section 6.11(c), references to the
"Financing" and "Financing

 



     

 

 



 

Commitments" as applicable (and other like terms in this Agreement, including,
as applicable, "Debt Financing," "Debt Commitment Letter" and "Redacted Fee
Letter") shall be deemed to refer to such alternative financing, or the Debt
Financing as so amended, replaced, supplemented, modified or waived. The
representations, warranties, covenants and other restrictions of Purchaser,
Parent, Red Holdings and Green Holdings, as applicable, contained in this
Agreement and any other provisions herein with respect to the Financing and
the Debt Commitment Letters shall apply equally to any replacement Debt
Commitment Letters.

 



 

 **(e)** Upon request by the Company, Purchaser shall keep the Company
reasonably informed on a timely basis (and in any event within two (2)
business days after the date the Company delivers to the Purchaser a request)
of the status of their efforts to obtain the Debt Financing and to satisfy the
conditions thereof, including updating the Company, in a reasonable level of
detail, with respect to status, proposed closing date and material terms of
the definitive documentation related to the Debt Financing, providing copies
of the drafts posted to potential lenders and executed material definitive
documents related to the Debt Financing and giving the Company prompt notice
of any material adverse change with respect to the Debt Financing of which
Purchaser becomes aware. Without limiting the foregoing, Purchaser shall
notify the Company promptly (and in any event within two (2) business days) if
at any time prior to the Effective Time: (i) Purchaser obtains knowledge that
any Financing Commitment expires or is terminated for any reason (or if any
Person attempts or purports to terminate any Financing Commitment, whether or
not such attempted or purported termination is valid), (ii) Purchaser obtains
knowledge of any breach or default (or any event or circumstance that, with or
without due notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to
give rise to any breach or default) by any party to any Financing Commitment,
(iii) Purchaser receives any written notice or other written communication
from any Person with respect to any (A) actual, potential or threatened
breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party to the Financing
Commitments or any definitive agreement related thereto (including any
proposal by any lender named in the Debt Commitment Letters to withdraw its
commitments under such Debt Commitment Letter, terminate such Debt Commitment
Letter or reduce the amount of financing or delay the timing of financing
contemplated by such Debt Commitment Letter) or (B) material dispute or
disagreement between or among any parties to the Financing Commitments or any
definitive agreement related thereto, (iv) any Financing source (including any
Debt Financing Source) refuses to provide or expresses to Purchaser, Red
Holdings or Green Holdings in writing an intent to refuse to provide all or
any portion of the Financing necessary to fund the Required Amount on the
terms contemplated by the Financing Commitments, or (v) Purchaser, for any
reason, no longer believes in good faith that it will be able to obtain all or
any portion of the Financing necessary to fund the Required Amount on the
terms contemplated by the Financing Commitments.

 



 

 **(f)** The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries to use their commercially reasonable efforts

customary practice, reasonable assistance to Purchaser, Red Holdings and Green

nothing shall require such cooperation as described in this Section 6.11 to
the extent it would, in the Companys reasonable judgment, unreasonably

penalties incurred or suffered by them in connection with any actions taken
pursuant to this Section 6.11 at the request of Purchaser, in each case of
clauses (i) and (ii), except to the extent any of the foregoing was suffered
or incurred as a result of bad faith, gross negligence, willful misconduct or
material breach of this Agreement by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
Representatives (clauses (i) and (ii), collectively, the " ** _Reimbursement
and Indemnification Obligations_** "). Any information provided pursuant to
this Section 6.11 shall be used by Parent, Red Holdings, Green Holdings and

keep such information confidential, including pursuant to a customary
confidentiality undertaking contained in marketing materials for the Debt
Financing, a customary "click through" confidentiality undertaking or
otherwise).

 



 

 **(i)** The Company hereby consents to the use of its and its Subsidiaries
logos in connection with the Debt Financing. Parent and Purchaser shall, and
shall cause the Debt Financing Sources and their respective affiliates and
Representatives to, use such logos in a manner that is not intended to and is
not reasonably likely to harm, disparage or otherwise adversely affect the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. None of Parent, Purchaser, Red Holdings,
Green Holdings, the Debt Financing Sources nor any of their respective
affiliates and Representatives shall obtain any rights in such logos prior to
the Closing.

 



 

 **(j)** The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to periodically update any Required Financial
Information provided to Parent, Red Holdings or Green Holdings as may be
necessary so that such Required Financial Information (i) is Compliant and
(ii) meets the applicable requirements set forth in the definition of
"Required Financial Information" throughout the pendency of the Marketing
Period. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent, Red Holdings or Green Holdings
may, to most effectively access the financing markets, require the cooperation
of the Company and its Subsidiaries under this Section 6.11 at any time, and
from time to time and on multiple occasions, between the date of this
Agreement and the Closing. The Marketing Period shall not be applicable as to
each attempt to access the markets. The Company agrees to file all reports on
Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and Form 8-K and all other documents, in each case,
required to be filed with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act prior to the
Closing Date in accordance with the time periods required by the Exchange Act.
In addition, if, in connection with a marketing effort contemplated by any
Debt Commitment Letter, Parent reasonably requests the Company to file a
Current Report on Form 8-K pursuant to the Exchange Act that contains material
non-public information with respect to the Company and its

 



     

 

 



 

Subsidiaries, which Parent, Red Holdings or Green Holdings reasonably
determines to include in customary marketing materials for the Debt Financing,
then the Company shall file a Current Report on Form 8-K containing such
material non-public information.

 



 

 **(k)** Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Purchaser
may enter discussions regarding, and may enter into arrangements and
agreements relating to the Equity Financing to add other equity providers, so
long as in respect of any such arrangements and agreements, the following
conditions are met: (i) the aggregate amount of the Equity Financing is not
reduced; (ii) the arrangements and agreements, in the aggregate, would not be
reasonably likely to delay, impede or prevent the Offer Closing; and (iii) the
arrangements and agreements would not diminish or release the pre-closing
obligations of the parties to the Equity Financing Commitment as of the date
of this Agreement, adversely affect the rights of Purchaser to enforce its
rights against the other parties to the Equity Financing Commitment or
otherwise constitute a waiver or reduction of Purchasers rights under the
Equity Financing Commitment.

 



 

 **(l)** Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to consummate the
Closing is not conditioned upon any Financing being made available to the
Purchaser.

 



 

 **6.12.** **Stock Exchange De-Listing** _._ Prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall cooperate with Parent and shall use its reasonable best efforts
to cause the Shares to be de-listed from NYSE and de-registered under the
Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time.

 



 

 **SECTION 7.** **CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO THE MERGER**

 



 

The obligations of the Parties to effect the Merger are subject to the
satisfaction, at or prior to the Closing, of each of the following conditions:

preliminary or permanent injunction or other order preventing, restraining or
otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the Merger. Nor shall any action

enforced, enacted, issued or deemed applicable to the Merger by any
Governmental Body, which prohibits, makes illegal or otherwise seeks to
restrain, the consummation of the Merger. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
Party shall be permitted to invoke this Section 7.1 if such Party is in
material breach of its obligations set forth in Section 6.6.

 **(b)** by either Parent or the Company, if the Offer Acceptance Time shall
not have occurred by one minute after 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on the End
Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) in the event that the Marketing
Period has commenced, but has not been completed as of the End Date, and the

shall be final and non-appealable, but only if (i) the Party seeking to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(c) is not in material
breach of its obligations set forth in Section 6.6, and (ii) the issuance of

satisfied and such breach or failure cannot be cured by the Company by the End
Date, or if capable of being cured in such time frame, shall not have been
cured within the earlier of the End Date and thirty (30) days of the date

 **(g)** by the Company, if a breach of any representation or warranty
contained in this Agreement or failure to perform any covenant or obligation
in this Agreement on the part of Parent or Purchaser shall have occurred, in

business day after the time period specified in Section 1.1(a), but only if
the Company is not then in material breach of its representations or
warranties or then materially failing to perform its covenants, obligations or

shall any Company Related Party or any of their respective Representatives
seek, directly or indirectly, to recover against the Parent Related Parties,
or compel payment by the Parent Related Parties of, any damages or other
payments whatsoever (including multiple, consequential, indirect, special,
statutory, exemplary or punitive damages) in excess of the Maximum Liability
Amount. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any
other document, instrument or agreement entered in connection herewith,
subject to Section 9.05(c), the maximum aggregate liability of the Company
Related Parties under

 



     

 

 



 

this Agreement or any other document, instrument or agreement entered in

monetary damages in lieu of specific performance), or in connection with the
failure of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby to be consummated,
or in respect of any representation made or alleged to have been made in

tort or otherwise, together with any payment of the Termination Fee and any
other payment in connection with this Agreement or any other document,
instrument or agreement entered in connection herewith, or otherwise, shall

Related Party or any of their respective Representatives seek, directly or
indirectly, to recover against the Company Related Parties, or compel payment
by the Company Related Parties of, any damages or other payments whatsoever
(including multiple, consequential, indirect, special, statutory, exemplary or

 **(ii)** In connection with any loss suffered by any Parent Related Party as
a result of the failure of the Transactions to be consummated or for a breach
or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise, other than in the circumstances
in which Parent is entitled to receive the Termination Fee in accordance with
Section 8.3(b) (in which case Section 8.3(e)(i) shall apply) and the

Related Parties, that the maximum aggregate monetary liability of the Company
and the Company Related Parties, if any, (including monetary damages for fraud
or breach, whether willful, material, intentional, unintentional or otherwise,
or monetary damages in lieu of specific performance) shall be limited to the
aggregate amount of the Termination Fee plus the Enforcement Expenses, and in
no event shall Parent or any Parent Related Party seek or be entitled to

 **(f)** The Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section
8.3 are an integral part of the Transactions and that, without these

Purchaser) for the payment set forth in this Section 8.3, the non-prevailing
Party shall pay the prevailing Party such payment provided for in the
applicable judgment in addition to the prevailing Partys reasonable and

Expenses of such prevailing party pursuant to _Section 8.3(f)_ exceed
$2,500,000.

 



 

 **SECTION 9.** **MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS**

 



 

 **9.1.** **Amendment**. Prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, this Agreement
may be amended with the approval of the respective boards of directors (or
equivalent body) of the Company, Parent and Purchaser at any time. This
Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of each of the Parties. Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary
herein, the provisions set forth in Section 8.2, Section 8.3(d)(ii), Section
8.3(e)(i), this Section 9.1, Section 9.2, Section 9.5(a), Section 9.5(d),
Section 9.5(e), Section 9.5(f), Section 9.6 and Section 9.7 (and the
definitions related thereto and any other provision of this Agreement that
would modify the substance of any of the foregoing sections), in each case,
may not be amended, modified, supplemented or terminated in any manner adverse
to the Debt Financing Sources without the prior written consent of such Debt
Financing Sources.

 



 

 **9.2.** **Waiver**. No failure on the part of any Party to exercise any
power, right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, and no delay on the
part of any Party in exercising any power, right, privilege or remedy under
this Agreement, shall operate as a waiver of such power, right, privilege or
remedy. No single or partial exercise of any such power, right, privilege or
remedy shall preclude any other or further exercise of any power, right,
privilege or remedy. No Party shall be deemed to have waived any claim arising
out of this Agreement, or any power, right, privilege or remedy under this
Agreement, unless the waiver of such claim, power, right, privilege or remedy
is expressly set forth in a written instrument duly executed and delivered on
behalf of such Party. Any such waiver shall not be applicable or have any
effect except in the specific instance in which it is given. At any time prior
to the Offer Acceptance Time, Parent and Purchaser, on the one hand, and the
Company, on the other hand, may: (a) extend the time for the performance of
any of the obligations or other acts of the other; (b) waive any breach of the
representations and warranties of the other contained in this Agreement or in
any document delivered pursuant to this Agreement; or (c) waive compliance by
the other with any of the agreements or covenants contained in this Agreement.
Any such extension or waiver shall be valid

 



     

 

 



 

only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party or parties
to be bound by such extension or waiver. However, such extension or waiver or
failure to insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement
or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to,
any subsequent or other failure. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, Section 8.2, Section 8.3(d)(ii) (other than any election by
the Company not to receive the Parent Termination Fee), Section 8.3(e)(i)
(other than any election by the Company not to receive the Parent Termination
Fee), Section 9.1, this Section 9.2, Section 9.5(a), Section 9.5(d), Section
9.5(e), Section 9.5(f), Section 9.6 and Section 9.7 (and the definitions
related thereto and any other provision of this Agreement that would modify
the substance of any of the foregoing sections), in each case, may not be
waived in any manner adverse to the Debt Financing Sources without the prior
written consent of such Debt Financing Sources.

 



 

 **9.3.** **No Survival of Representations and Warranties**. None of the
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, the Company
Disclosure Letter or in any certificate or schedule or other document
delivered by any Person pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Merger.

 



 

 **9.4.** **Entire Agreement; Counterparts**. This Agreement, the Tender and
Support Agreement, the Financing Commitments, the Limited Guarantee and the
other agreements and schedules referred to in this Agreement constitute the
entire agreement and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both
written and oral, among or between any of the parties thereto, with respect to
the subject matter of this Agreement, the Tender and Support Agreement and the
other agreements and schedules referred to in this Agreement. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall not be superseded and shall
remain in full force and effect. If the Effective Time occurs, the
Confidentiality Agreement shall automatically terminate and be of no further
force and effect. This Agreement may be executed in several counterparts, each
of which shall be deemed an original and all of which shall constitute one and
the same instrument. The exchange of a fully executed Agreement (in
counterparts or otherwise) by PDF shall be sufficient to bind the Parties to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

 



 

 **9.5.** **Applicable Legal Requirements; Jurisdiction; Specific Performance;
Remedies**.

 



 

 **(a)** This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance
with, the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that might
otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws. Subject to
Section 9.5(b), in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or any of the Transactions, each of the Parties: (i) irrevocably and
unconditionally consents and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue
of the Chosen Courts; (ii) irrevocably consents to service of process by first
class certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, to the
address at which such Party is to receive notice in accordance with Section
9.9; and (iii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal
jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Debt Commitment Letters and any action or
proceeding brought against any of the Debt Financing Sources in accordance
with Section 9.5(d) shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with,
the laws of the State of New York.

 



      

 

 



 

 **(b)** A final non-appealable judgment in any such action or proceeding
shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Legal Requirements.

 



 

 **(c)** Irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available,
would not be an adequate remedy, would occur if the Parties do not perform
their obligations under the provisions of this Agreement in accordance with
its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. Subject to the last
two sentences of this Section 9.5(c): (i) the Parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions, specific performance, or other equitable relief, to
prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the Chosen Courts
without proof of damages or otherwise. The foregoing remedies are in addition
to any other remedy to which the Parties are entitled under this Agreement;
and (ii) the right of specific performance is an integral part of the
Transactions and without that right, none of the Parties would have entered
into this Agreement. Subject to the last two sentences of this Section 9.5(c)
the right to specific enforcement of this Agreement shall include the right of
the Company, on behalf of itself and any third party beneficiaries to this
Agreement, to cause Parent and Purchaser to cause the Offer, the Merger and
the other Transactions to be consummated on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement. Subject to the last two sentences of
this Section 9.5(c), each of the Parties agrees that it will not oppose the
granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on
the basis that the other Parties (on behalf of themselves or any third party
beneficiary to this Agreement) have an adequate remedy at law or an award of
specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or
equity. Any Party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or
threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this Section 9.5(c) shall
not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any
such order or injunction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is explicitly
agreed that the right of the Company to seek an injunction, specific
performance or other equitable remedies in connection with enforcing the
Purchasers obligation to cause the Equity Financing to be funded and to fund
the Offer Price or the Merger Consideration or cause the Offer Acceptance Time
to occur and to effect the Closing (but not the right of the Company to seek
such injunctions, specific performance or other equitable remedies for any
other reason) shall be subject to the requirements that (A) all Offer
Conditions shall have been satisfied or waived (including any deemed
satisfaction or waiver of the Offer Conditions pursuant to Section
1.1(c)(iii)(C)(2)) (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Offer Acceptance Time, but subject to the satisfaction of
such conditions at the Offer Acceptance Time), (B) the Debt Financing has been
funded in accordance with the terms of the Debt Commitment Letters or the Debt
Financing Sources have irrevocably confirmed in writing to the Parties that
the Debt Financing will be funded in accordance with the terms thereof at the

 **CONDITIONS TO THE OFFER**

 



 

THE CAPITALIZED TERMS USED IN THIS ANNEX I HAVE THE MEANINGS SET FORTH IN THE
AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER TO WHICH THIS ANNEX I IS ATTACHED

 



 

The obligation of Purchaser to irrevocably accept for payment and pay for
Shares validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) pursuant to the Offer is
subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in clauses (a) through
(h) below. Accordingly, notwithstanding any other provision of the Offer and
in addition to Purchasers rights to extend, amend or terminate the Offer in
accordance with the provisions of the Agreement, Purchaser shall not be
required to irrevocably accept for payment or, subject to any applicable rules
and regulations of the SEC, including Rule 14e-1(c) promulgated under the
Exchange Act, pay for, and may delay the irrevocable acceptance for payment of
or, subject to any such rules and regulations, the payment for, any tendered
Shares, and, to the extent permitted by this Agreement, may terminate the
Offer: (i) upon the valid termination of this Agreement; and (ii) at any
scheduled Expiration Date (subject to any extensions of the Offer pursuant to
_Section 1.1(c)_ of this Agreement), if: (A) the Minimum Condition,
Termination Condition or conditions (d) and (f) below shall not be satisfied
by one minute after 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on the Expiration Date of the
Offer; or (B) any of the additional conditions set forth below shall not be
satisfied or, to the extent permitted by this Agreement, waived in writing by
Parent one minute after 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on the Expiration Date of the
Offer:

 



 

(a) there shall have been validly tendered in the Offer and "received" by the
"depository" (as such terms are defined in Section 251(h) of the DGCL) and not
validly withdrawn Shares that, considered together with all other Shares (if
any) otherwise owned by Purchaser or its "affiliates" (as such term is defined
in Section 251(h) of the DGCL), represent one more Share than 50% of the total
number of Shares outstanding at the time of the expiration of the Offer (the "
** _Minimum Condition_** "). For purposes of determining whether the Minimum
Condition has been satisfied, Shares tendered into the Offer pursuant to
guaranteed delivery procedures that have not yet been "received" by the
"depository" (as such terms are defined in Section 251(h) of the DGCL) shall
not be considered validly tendered and not withdrawn.

 



 

(b) (i) (A) the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in
_Sections 3.3(a)_ , _3.3(c)_ , and _3.3(d)_ shall be true and correct in all
respects (other than any _de minimis_ inaccuracies) at and as of the date of
this Agreement and at and as of the Offer Acceptance Time as if made at and as
of the Offer Acceptance Time (except to the extent any such representation or
warranty expressly relates to an earlier date or period, in which case as of
such date or period) and (B) (x) the representations and warranties of the
Company set forth in _Sections 3.1(a)_ , _3.2_ , _3.3(b)_ , _3.3(e)_ , _3.18_
, _3.19_ and _3.22_ to the extent any such representations are qualified by
materiality or "Material Adverse Effect" shall be true and correct in all
respects at and as of the date of this Agreement and at and as of the Offer
Acceptance Time as if made at and as of the Offer Acceptance Time (except to
the extent any such representation or warranty expressly relates to an earlier
date or period, in which case as of such date or period) and (y) to the extent
any such representations or warranties specified in the foregoing clause (x)
are not qualified by materiality or "Material Adverse Effect", such
representations shall be true and correct in all material respects at and as
of

 



     

 

 



 

the date of this Agreement and at and as of the Offer Acceptance Time as if
made at and as of the Offer Acceptance Time (except to the extent any such
representation or warranty expressly relates to an earlier date or period, in
which case as of such date or period);

 



 

(ii) the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in _Section
3.5(a)(ii)_ shall be true and correct at and as of the date of this Agreement;

 



 

(iii) the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in _Section
3.5(b)_ shall be true and correct at and as of the Offer Acceptance Time as if

Agreement (other than those specifically identified in clauses (i)-(iii)
above) that are qualified by "Material Adverse Effect" shall be true and
correct as so qualified at and as of the date of this Agreement and at and as
of the Offer Acceptance Time as if made at and as of the Offer Acceptance Time
(except to the extent any such representation or warranty expressly relates to
an earlier date or period, in which case as of such date or period);

 



 

(v) the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in the
Agreement (other than those specifically identified in clauses (i)-(iii)
above) that are not qualified by "Material Adverse Effect" shall be true and
correct at and as of the Offer Acceptance Time as if made at and as of such
time (except to the extent any such representation or warranty expressly
relates to an earlier date, in which case as of such date), except where the
failure of such representations and warranties to be true and correct would
not have, and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect;

 



 

(c) the Company shall have complied with or performed in all material respects
the Companys covenants and agreements it is required to comply with or
perform at or prior to the Offer Acceptance Time;

 



 

(d) (i) the waiting period applicable to the Offer under the HSR Act shall
have expired or been terminated and (ii) approval from the Mexican Federal
Economic Competition Commission or the Mexican Federal Institute of
Telecommunications shall have been obtained or deemed to have been obtained
pursuant to Article 90 (V) of the Mexican Federal Economic Competition Law;

 



 

(e) Parent and Purchaser shall have received a certificate executed on behalf
of the Company by its Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer
confirming that the conditions set forth in clauses (b) and (c) of this _Annex
I_ have been duly satisfied;

 



 

(f) There shall not have been issued by any court of competent jurisdiction
and remain in effect any temporary restraining order, preliminary or permanent
injunction or other order preventing, restraining or otherwise prohibiting the
acquisition of or payment for Shares pursuant to the Offer, nor shall any
action have been taken, or any Legal Requirement or order promulgated,
entered, enforced, enacted, issued or deemed applicable to the Offer or the
Merger by any Governmental Body, which prohibits, makes illegal or otherwise
seeks to restrain, the acquisition of or payment for Shares pursuant to the
Offer, or the consummation of the Merger. Parent and

 



     

 

 



 

Purchaser shall not be permitted to invoke this clause (f) if they are then in
material breach of their respective obligations pursuant to Section 6.6;

 



 

(g) this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance with its terms
(the " ** _Termination Condition_** "); and

 



 

(h) the Marketing Period shall have ended.

 



 

The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Purchaser and
(except for the Minimum Condition, the Termination Condition and conditions
(d) (to the extent such waiver would reasonably be expected to adversely
affect the Companys stockholders, directors or officers or require rescission
of the transactions contemplated hereby under applicable Antitrust Laws) and
(f) (to the extent such order or injunction applies against the Acquired
Corporations or their respective directors or officers) above) may be waived
by Parent and Purchaser, in whole or in part at any time and from time to
time, in the sole discretion of Parent and Purchaser. The failure by Parent or
Purchaser at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be
deemed a waiver of any such right and each such right shall be deemed an
ongoing right which may be asserted at any time and from time to time.

 _INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS_

 



 

Section 1. PROCEEDINGS OTHER THAN THOSE BROUGHT BY THE CORPORATION. The
corporation shall indemnify to the maximum extent permitted by law any person
who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened,
pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of
the corporation) by reason of the fact that he is or was a director or officer
of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as
a director or officer of another corporation, partnership, joint venture,
trust or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys fees),
judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably
incurred by him in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if he acted
in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed
to the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal
action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was
unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment,
order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its
equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not
act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably

 



     

 

 



 

believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation,
and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause
to believe that his conduct was unlawful.

 



 

Section 2. PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT BY THE CORPORATION. The corporation shall
indemnify to the maximum extent permitted by law any person who was or is a
party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or
completed action or suit by or in the right of the corporation to procure a
judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he is or was a director or
officer of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the
corporation as a director or officer of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust or other enterprise against expenses (including
attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with
the defense or settlement of such action or suit if he acted in good faith and
in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best
interests of the corporation and except that no such indemnification shall be
made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall
have been adjudged to be liable to the corporation unless and only to the
extent that the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine
upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of
all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably
entitled to indemnity for such expenses which such court shall deem proper.

 



 

Section 3. INDEMNIFICATION AGAINST EXPENSES. To the extent that a director or
officer of the corporation shall be successful on the merits or otherwise in
defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in Sections 1 and 2 of
this Article V, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he shall
be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and
reasonably incurred by him in connection therewith.

 



 

Section 4\. AUTHORIZATION FOR INDEMNIFICATION AGAINST EXPENSES. Any
indemnification under Sections 1 and 2 of this Article V (unless ordered by a
court) shall be made by the corporation only as authorized in the specific
case upon a determination that indemnification of the director or officer is
proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of
conduct set forth in Sections 1 and 2 of this Article V. Such determination
shall be made (1) by a majority vote of the directors who are not parties to
such action, suit or proceeding, even though less than a quorum, or (2) if
there are no such directors, or if such directors so direct, by independent
legal counsel in a written opinion, or (3) by the stockholders. The
corporation, acting through its Board of Directors or otherwise, shall cause
such determination to be made if so requested by any person who is
indemnifiable under this Article V.

 



 

Section 5\. ADVANCEMENT OF EXPENSES. Expenses (including attorneys fees)
incurred by an officer or director in defending any civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative action, suit or proceeding shall be paid by
the corporation as they are incurred and in advance of the final disposition
of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on
behalf of such director or officer to repay such amount if it shall ultimately
be determined that he is not entitled to be indemnified by the corporation as
authorized in this Article V.

 



 

Section 6. INDEMNIFICATION OF EXPENSES NOT EXCLUSIVE. The indemnification and
advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, the other
paragraphs of this Article V shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights
to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be
entitled under any bylaw, agreement,

 



     

 

 



 

vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to
action in his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while
holding such office.

 



 

Section 7. DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS INSURANCE. The Board of Directors may

request of the corporation as a director or officer of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability
asserted against him and incurred by him in any such capacity, or arising out
of his status as such, whether or not the corporation would have the power to
indemnify him against such liability under the provisions of this Article V.

 



 

Section 8\. CORPORATION DEFINED; EFFECTS OF MERGER OR CONSOLIDATION. For the
purposes of this Article V, references to "the corporation" shall include, in
addition to the resulting corporation, any constituent corporation (including
any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which,
if its separate existence had continued, would have had power and authority to
indemnify its directors or officers so that any person who is or was a
director or officer of such constituent corporation, or is or was serving at
the request of such constituent corporation as a director or officer of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise,
shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this Article V with
respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as he would have with
respect to such constituent corporation if its separate existence had
continued.

 



 

Section 9. OTHER ENTERPRISES DEFINED. For purposes of this section, references
to "other enterprises" shall include employee benefit plans; references to
"fines" shall include any excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to an
employee benefit plan; and references to "serving at the request of the
corporation" shall include service as a director or officer of the corporation
which imposes duties on, or involves services by, such director or officer
with respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants or beneficiaries;
and a person who acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to
be in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee
benefit plan shall be deemed to have acted in a manner "not opposed to the
best interests of the corporation" as referred to in this section.

 



 

Section 10. CESSATION OF DIRECTOR OR OFFICER STATUS. The indemnification and
advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, this Article V
shall, unless otherwise provided when authorized or ratified, continue as to a
person who has ceased to be a director or officer and shall inure to the
benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.

 



 

Section 11. PROCEEDINGS INITIATED BY INDIVIDUAL. The corporation shall be
required to indemnify a person in connection with an action, suit or
proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person only if the action, suit
or proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors of

certificate may be a facsimile. In case any officer, transfer agent, or
registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a

before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the corporation with
the same effect as if he were such officer, transfer agent, or registrar at
the date of issue.

 



 

Section 3. LOST CERTIFICATES. The Board of Directors may direct a new
certificate or certificates to be issued in place of any certificate or
certificates theretofore issued by the corporation alleged to have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming the certificate of stock to be lost, stolen or destroyed.
When authorizing such issue of a new certificate or certificates, the Board of
Directors may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance
thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate or
certificates, or his legal representative, to advertise the same in such
manner as it shall require and/or to give the corporation a bond in such sum
as it may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the
corporation with respect to the certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen
or destroyed.

 



 

Section 4. TRANSFERS OF STOCK. Upon surrender to the corporation, or the
transfer agent of the corporation, of a certificate for shares duly endorsed
or accompanied by proper evidence of succession, assignation or authority to
transfer, it shall be the duty of the corporation to issue a new certificate
to the person entitled thereto, cancel the old certificate and record the
transaction upon its books.

 



 

Section 5. FIXED RECORD DATE. In order that the corporation may determine the
stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of the
stockholders, or any adjournment thereof, or entitled to receive payment of

or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix
a record date which shall not be more than sixty nor less than ten days before
the date of such meeting, nor more than sixty days prior to any other action.
A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at
a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting;
provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for
the adjourned meeting. In order that the corporation may determine the
stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a
meeting, the Board of Directors may fix a record

 



     

 

 



 

date which shall not be more than ten days after the date upon which the
resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors.

 



 

Section 6. REGISTERED STOCKHOLDERS. The corporation shall be entitled to
treat the holder of record of any share or shares of stock as the holder in
fact thereof and accordingly shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or
other claim or interest in such share on the part of any other person, whether

been duly authorized by all necessary entity actions on the part of each of
Parent and Purchaser. Each of Parent and Purchaser has all requisite power and
authority to execute and deliver, and perform its obligations under, this
Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(b) This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by Parent
and Purchaser. Assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by
Holder of this Agreement this Agreement constitutes a valid and binding
agreement of Parent and Purchaser, enforceable against Parent and Purchaser in
accordance with its terms, except as enforcement may be limited by general
principles of

 



     

 

 



 

equity (whether applied in a court of law or a court of equity) and by
bankruptcy, insolvency, and similar laws affecting creditors rights and
remedies generally.

 



 

(c) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by each of Parent and
Purchaser, and the performance by Parent and Purchaser of its respective
obligations hereunder, does not violate: (A) any Legal Requirement to which
such party is subject; or (B) any charter, bylaw or other organizational
document of Parent or Purchaser.

 



 

(d) To the knowledge of Parent and Purchaser, there is no Legal Proceeding
pending against, or threatened in writing against Parent or Purchaser that
would prevent, delay or impair the consummation by Parent or Purchaser of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or otherwise impair its ability
to perform its respective obligations hereunder.

 



 

6. _No Solicitation_. From the date of this Agreement and until the Expiration Time, each Holder shall not, and shall direct its Representatives not to: (a) continue any solicitation, knowing encouragement, discussions or negotiations with any Persons that may be ongoing with respect to an Acquisition Proposal; (b) solicit, initiate or knowingly facilitate or knowingly encourage any inquiries regarding, or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal; (c) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person (other than Parent, Purchaser or any of their respective designees) any non-public information in connection with or for the purpose of knowingly encouraging or knowingly facilitating, an Acquisition Proposal or any proposal or offer that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal; or (d) enter into or agree to enter into any letter of intent, acquisition agreement, agreement in principle or similar agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or any proposal or offer that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal. Without limiting the foregoing, the parties hereby acknowledge and agree that a breach in any material respect of the restrictions in this _Section 6_ applicable to such Holder by any of such Holders Representatives, to the extent acting at such Holders direction, shall be deemed to be a breach of this _Section 6_ by such Holder. Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit any Holder or any of its Representatives from taking any action that the Company or its Representatives are permitted to take under Section 5.3 of the Merger Agreement.

 



 

7. _No Exercise of Appraisal Rights; Actions_. Each Holder: (a) waives and agrees not to exercise any appraisal rights (including pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL) in respect of such Holders Shares that may arise with respect to the Offer and the Merger; (b) agrees not to commence or join in, and agrees to take all actions necessary to opt out of any class in any class action with respect to, any claim, derivative or otherwise, against Parent, Purchaser, the Company or any of their respective successors (i) challenging the validity of, or seeking to enjoin the operation of, any provision of this Agreement (other than in connection with any breach of this Agreement by Parent or Purchaser) or (ii) alleging breach of any fiduciary duty of any Person in connection with the negotiation and entry into the Merger Agreement; and (c) shall notify Parent of any development occurring after the date hereof that, to such Holders knowledge, causes any breach of any of the representations and warranties of such Holder set forth in _Section 4_.

 



 

8. _Termination_. This Agreement shall terminate automatically, and shall have no further force and effect as of the earliest to occur of: (a) the Effective Time; (b) the valid termination of the Merger Agreement; (c) the date of any modification or amendment to, or the waiver of any provision of, the Merger Agreement, as in effect on the date hereof, that reduces the amount, changes the form of consideration payable, or otherwise adversely affects all of the stockholders of the Company in any material respect; (d) the making of a Company Adverse Change Recommendation; or (e) the effectiveness of a written agreement executed by the parties to this Agreement to terminate this Agreement (the earliest of such times, the " _Expiration Time_ "). Upon the valid termination or expiration of this Agreement in accordance with

 



     

 

 



 

this _Section 8_, no party shall have any further obligations or liabilities
under this Agreement. The provisions of _Section 10_ shall survive any
termination of this Agreement.

 



 

9. _FIRPTA_. Prior to the Effective Time, each Holder shall deliver to Purchaser a certificate, dated as of the Closing Date, conforming to the requirements set forth in Treasury Regulations Section 1.1445-2, attesting that such Holder is not a "foreign person" for United States federal income tax purposes. Purchasers sole right if a Holder fails to provide such certificate shall be to make the appropriate withholding with respect to such Holder to the extent required by Section 1445 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

 



 

10. _Miscellaneous_.

 



 

(a) _Entire Agreement; Amendments and Waivers_. This Agreement, together with
_Schedule 1_ and the other documents and certificates delivered pursuant
hereto, constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all prior agreements
and understandings, both written and oral, among or between any of the parties
with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement. Any provision of this
Agreement may be amended or waived if such amendment or waiver is in writing
and is signed, in the case of an amendment, by each party to this Agreement
or, in the case of a waiver, by each party against whom the waiver is to be
effective. No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or
privilege under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall
any single or partial exercise of such right, power or privilege preclude any
other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or
privilege. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement by any party shall be
deemed a waiver of any other provision by such party, nor shall any such
waiver be deemed a continuing waiver of any provision by such party. Any
amendment or waiver effected in accordance with this _Section 10_ shall be
binding upon the parties and their respective successors and assigns.

 



 

(b) _Governing Law; Venue_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed
in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws
that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws.
In any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each of the parties:
(i) irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction and venue of the Delaware Court of Chancery located in Wilmington
Delaware and any appellate court therefrom (the " _Chosen Courts_ "); (ii)
irrevocably consents to service of process by first class certified mail,
return receipt requested, postage prepaid, to the address at which such party
is to receive notice in accordance with _Section 10(f)_; and (iii) agrees
that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by
motion or other request for leave from the Chosen Courts. A final non-
appealable judgment from the Chosen Courts in any such action or proceeding
shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Legal Requirements.

 



 

(c) _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL
RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING BETWEEN THE PARTIES (WHETHER
BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE), INCLUDING ANY COUNTERCLAIM, ARISING OUT
OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS. Each party: (i) makes
this waiver voluntarily; and (ii) acknowledges that such party has been
induced to enter into this Agreement by, among other things, the mutual
waivers contained in this _Section 10(c)_.

 



 

(d) _Counterparts_. This Agreement and any amendments may be executed in one
or more counterparts, all of which will be considered one and the same
agreement. This Agreement and any amendments will become effective when one or
more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the
other parties. Each of the parties also agrees that all parties need not sign
the same

 



     

 

 



 

counterpart. Any such counterpart, to the extent delivered by electronic
delivery, will be treated in all manner and respects as an original executed
counterpart and will be considered to have the same binding legal effect as if
it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person. No party may
raise the use of an electronic delivery to deliver a signature, or the fact
that any signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated
through the use of an electronic delivery, as a defense to the formation of a
contract. Each party waives any such defense, except to the extent such
defense relates to lack of authenticity.

 



 

(e) _Titles and Subtitles_. The titles and subtitles used in this Agreement
are used for convenience only and are not to be considered in construing or
interpreting this Agreement.

 



 

(f) _Notices_. Any notice or other communication required or permitted to be
delivered to any party under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be
deemed properly delivered, given and received: (i) upon receipt when delivered
by hand; (ii) two (2) business days after being sent by registered mail or by
courier or express delivery service; (iii) if sent by email transmission prior
to 6:00 p.m. recipients local time, upon transmission when receipt is
confirmed; or (iv) if sent by email transmission after 6:00 p.m. recipients
local time and receipt is confirmed, the business day following the date of
transmission, as follows: (A) if to Parent or Purchaser, in accordance with
the provisions of the Merger Agreement and (B) if to a Holder, to such
Holders address, facsimile number or e-mail address set forth on a signature
page hereto, or to such other address, facsimile number or e-mail address as
such party may hereafter specify in writing for the purpose by notice to each
other party hereto.

 



 

(g) _Severability_. If any term or provision of this Agreement is invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced by any Legal Requirement or public
policy, as determined by a final judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Transactions are not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner
in order that the Transactions be consummated as originally contemplated to
the fullest extent possible.

 



 

(h) _Binding Effect and Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and
inure to the benefit of, the respective parties and their permitted
successors, assigns, heirs, executors, administrators, and other legal
representatives, as the case may be. This Agreement may not be assigned by any
party without the prior written consent of the other parties to this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent may assign its rights and
obligations under this Agreement to any Affiliate of Parent.

 



 

(i) _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is not intended, and shall
not be deemed, to confer any rights or remedies upon any Person other than the
parties to this Agreement and their respective successors and permitted
assigns, or otherwise create any third-party beneficiary.

 



 

(j) _Specific Performance_. The parties to this Agreement agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event any provision of this Agreement
was not performed in accordance its terms or was otherwise breached.
Accordingly, the parties shall be entitled to specific performance as the sole
and exclusive remedy for any breach of this Agreement. In furtherance of the
grant of specific performance as the sole and exclusive remedy for breaches of
this Agreement, the parties agree that the non-breaching party may seek (and
the breaching party hereby agrees not to contest the non-breaching partys
ability to obtain) the equitable remedy of injunctive relief including,
without limitation, an injunction or injunctions to prevent and enjoin such
breaches in the courts specified in _Section 10(b)_. In any Proceeding for
specific performance, the parties will waive the defense of adequacy of a
remedy at law,

 



     

 

 



 

and the parties waive any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond
in connection with the remedies referred to in this _Section 10(j)_.

 



 

(k) _Disclosure_. Subject to the terms of this paragraph, each Holder shall
permit the Company, Parent and Purchaser to publish and disclose in all
documents and schedules filed with the SEC, and any press release or other
disclosure document that Parent or Purchaser reasonably determines to be
necessary in connection with the Merger and any other transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, such Holders identity and ownership of
Shares and the nature of such Holders commitments, arrangements, and
understandings under this Agreement. The Company, Parent or Purchaser, as
applicable, shall give the Holders reasonable advance notice prior to any such
disclosure or publication and provide at the same time a copy of any such
disclosure or publication to the Holders to the extent reasonably practicable
and permitted by applicable Law. Each of Parent and Purchaser shall accept all
reasonable comments provided by the Holder with respect to any such disclosure
or publication. Each Holder acknowledges that, subject to the terms of this
paragraph, Parent and Purchaser may, in Parents sole discretion, file this
Agreement or a form hereof with the SEC or any other Governmental Body. Each
Holder agrees to promptly notify Parent of any required corrections with
respect to any written information supplied by it specifically for use in any
such disclosure document, if and to the extent that such Holder shall become
aware that any such information shall have become false or misleading in any
material respect. Except as required by applicable Legal Requirements, no
Holder shall make any public announcement regarding this Agreement, the Merger
Agreement or the Transactions without the prior written consent of Parent
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).
Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit any Holder from amending any Schedule
13D or Schedule 13G in respect of this Agreement.

 



 

(l) _No Agreement Until Executed_. Irrespective of negotiations among the
parties or the exchanging of drafts of this Agreement, this Agreement shall
not constitute or be deemed to evidence a contract, agreement, arrangement or
understanding between the parties to this Agreement unless and until: (i) the
Merger Agreement is executed by all parties to the Merger Agreement; and (ii)
this Agreement is executed by all parties to this Agreement.

 



 

(m) _Directors and Officers_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement
to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement shall limit or restrict a Holder,
or any affiliate, employee or designee of a Holder, who is a director or
officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries from acting in such capacity
or fulfilling the obligations of such office, including by voting, in his or
her capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, in the Holders, or its affiliates, employees or
designees, sole discretion on any matter. In this regard, a Holder shall not
be deemed to make any agreement or understanding in this Agreement in such
Holders capacity as a director or officer of the Company. Each Holder is
executing this Agreement solely in the Holders capacity as a record or
beneficial holder of Shares.

 



 

(n) _Non-Recourse_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement or otherwise, this Agreement may only be enforced against, and any
claims or causes of action that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to
the non-performance this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or
performance of this Agreement, may only be made against the entities and
persons that are expressly identified as parties in their capacities as such.
No former, current or future stockholders, equity holders, controlling
persons, directors, officers, employees, general or limited partners, members,
managers, agents or affiliates (other than the parties to the Merger
Agreement) of any party to this Agreement, or any former, current or future
direct or indirect stockholder, equity holder, controlling person, director,
officer, employee, general or limited partner, member, manager, agent or
affiliate of any of the foregoing (each, a " _Non-Recourse Party_ ") shall
have any liability for any obligations or liabilities of the parties or for
any claim (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) based on, in respect of, or
by reason of, this Agreement or in respect of any representations made or
alleged to be made in connection with this

 



     

 

 



 

Agreement. Without limiting the rights of any party against the other parties
to this Agreement, in no event shall any party or any of its affiliates seek
to enforce this Agreement against, or make any claims for breach of this
Agreement against, any Non-Recourse Party. Nothing in this Agreement precludes
the parties or any Non-Recourse Parties from exercising any rights, and
nothing in this Agreement shall limit the liability or obligations of any Non-
Recourse Party, in each case under the Merger Agreement or any other agreement
to which they are specifically a party or an express third party beneficiary
thereof. This _Section 10(n)_ is subject to, and does not alter the scope or
application of, _Section 10(j)_.

 



 

(o) _Expenses_. All fees and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring such
expenses, whether or not the Offer or the Merger is consummated.

 



 

(p) _No Ownership Interest_. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be
deemed to vest in Parent or Purchaser any direct or indirect ownership or
incidence of ownership of or with respect to the Shares. All rights, ownership
and economic benefits of and relating to the Shares shall remain vested in and
belong to each applicable Holder. Neither Parent nor Purchaser shall have any
authority to manage, direct, restrict, regulate, govern, or administer any of
the policies or operations of the Company or exercise any power or authority
to direct such Holder in the voting of any of the Shares, except as otherwise
provided in this Agreement.

 



 

(q) _Holder Obligations Several and Not Joint_. The obligations of each Holder
hereunder shall be several and not joint, and no Holder shall be liable for
any breach of the terms of this Agreement by any other Holder.

 



 

(r) _Mutual Drafting_. Each party has participated in the drafting of this
Agreement, which each party acknowledges is the result of extensive
negotiations between the parties. Accordingly, in the event an ambiguity or
question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed
as if drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof
shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of
any provisions of this Agreement.

 



 

(s) _Further Assurances_. Parent, Purchaser and each Holder will execute and
deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, all further documents and
instruments necessary under applicable Legal Requirements, to perform their
respective obligations under this Agreement.
