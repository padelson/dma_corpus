-1- AGREEMENT

 

The parties to this Agreement, intending to be legally bound, agree as
follows:

 

ARTICLE 1

The Offer 

Section 1.1 _The Offer_.

 

(a) Provided that this Agreement has not been terminated in accordance with
_Article 8_ , as promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement,
but in no event more than ten (10) Business Days after the date of this
Agreement, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) commence
(within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) the Offer.

(b) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
including the prior satisfaction of the Minimum Condition and the
satisfaction or waiver by Purchaser of the other conditions set forth in
_Annex I_ (collectively, the " _Offer Conditions_ "), Purchaser shall (and
Parent shall cause Purchaser to), as promptly as practicable after the
Expiration Date (as it may be extended in accordance with this _Section_ __ _
1.1_), consummate the Offer in accordance with its terms and accept for
payment and promptly thereafter (and in any event within three (3) Business
Days of the Expiration Date) pay for all Shares validly tendered and not
validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer.

 

(c) The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the " _Offer to
Purchase_ ") in accordance with the terms set forth in this Agreement, the
Minimum Condition and the other Offer Conditions. Purchaser expressly reserves
the right to (i) increase the Offer Price, (ii) waive any Offer Condition
other than the Minimum Condition, and (iii) make any other changes in the
terms and conditions of the Offer not inconsistent with the terms of this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that unless otherwise provided by this
Agreement, without the prior written consent of the Company (which
the Company may withhold in its sole discretion), Purchaser shall not (A)
decrease the Offer Price, (B) change the form of consideration payable in the
Offer, (C) decrease the maximum number of Shares subject to the Offer, (D)
impose conditions to the Offer in addition to the Offer Conditions, (E) amend
or modify any of the Offer Conditions in any manner that adversely affects
holders of Shares, (F) amend or modify the Minimum Condition, or (G) extend or
otherwise change the Expiration Date in a manner other than as required or
permitted by this Agreement. Parent and Purchaser may waive the Minimum
Condition only with the prior written consent of the Company, which may be
granted or withheld in the Companys sole discretion. The Offer may not be
terminated or withdrawn prior to the Expiration Date, unless this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with _Article 8_.

 

(d) Unless extended pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, the Offer shall expire at midnight (i.e., one minute after 11:59
pm) (New York City time) on the date that is twenty (20) Business Days (for
this purpose calculated in accordance with Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange
Act) after the date on which the Offer is first commenced (within the meaning
of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act), or, in the event the Offer has been
extended beyond the initial expiration date pursuant to and in accordance with
this Agreement, the date and time to which the Offer has been so extended
(such initial expiration date, or such later date and time to which the Offer
has been extended pursuant to and in accordance with this Agreement, the "
_Expiration Date_ ").

 



2 (e) Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause Purchaser to, extend the Offer
from time to time as follows: (i) if on the applicable Expiration Date, any
of the Offer Conditions (including the Minimum Condition) have not been
satisfied or, to the extent waivable by Parent or Purchaser pursuant to this
Agreement, waived by Parent or Purchaser, then Purchaser shall extend the
Offer for successive periods of not more than ten (10) Business Days each (as
determined by Purchaser), or such other period as may be agreed by Parent and
the Company, to permit the satisfaction of such Offer Conditions; and (ii)
Purchaser shall extend the Offer for the minimum period required by applicable
Legal Requirements, interpretation or position of the SEC or its staff or
NASDAQ or its staff. Nothing in this  _Section_ __ _ 1.1(e)_ shall (A)
require Purchaser to, and without the Companys prior written consent
Purchaser shall not be permitted to, extend the Offer beyond the End Date, or
(B) be deemed to impair, limit or otherwise restrict in any manner the right
of the parties to terminate this Agreement pursuant to the terms of _Section_
__ _ 8.1_. Neither Parent nor Purchaser shall extend the Offer in any manner
other than pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of this
_Section_ __ _ 1.1(e)_ without the prior written consent of the Company.

(f) The Offer Price shall be adjusted appropriately and proportionately to
reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend
(including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Company
Common Stock but excluding vesting of Company Stock Options, Company
Restricted Stock Awards or Other Company Stock-Based Awards), reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other
like change with respect to Company Common Stock occurring on or after the
date hereof and at or prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, and such adjustment
to the Offer Price shall provide to the holders of Company Common Stock the
same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action;
_provided_ _that_ nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 1.1(f)_ shall be construed
to permit the Company to take any action, including with respect to its
securities, that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement. 

(g) Neither Parent nor Purchaser shall terminate or withdraw the Offer prior
to any applicable Expiration Date unless this Agreement is validly terminated
in accordance with the terms hereof. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant
to the terms hereof, then Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser
to) promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours of
such termination), irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer, shall
not acquire any Shares pursuant to the Offer, and shall cause any depository
acting on behalf of Purchaser to return, in accordance with applicable Legal
Requirements, all tendered Shares to the registered holders thereof.

(h) As promptly as practicable on the date of commencement of the Offer
(within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act), Parent and
Purchaser shall (i) file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO
with respect to the Offer (together with all amendments and supplements
thereto and including exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule TO_ ") that shall
contain or incorporate by reference the Offer to Purchase and form of the
related letter of transmittal and summary advertisement, if any, and
any other ancillary Offer documents and

 



3  instruments pursuant to which the Offer shall be made and (ii) cause the
Offer to Purchase and related documents to be disseminated to all holders of
Shares. Parent and Purchaser agree that they shall cause the Schedule TO and
all exhibits, amendments or supplements thereto (collectively, the " _Offer
Documents_ ") filed by either Parent or Purchaser with the SEC to comply in
all material respects with the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder and other applicable Legal Requirements. Each of Parent, Purchaser
and the Company shall promptly correct any information provided by it or any
of its Representatives for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent
that such information shall have become false or misleading in any material
respect, and to supplement the information contained in the Offer Documents to
include any information that shall become necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, and Parent and Purchaser further shall use reasonable best efforts
to promptly cause the Offer Documents as so corrected or supplemented to be
filed with the SEC and to promptly be disseminated to holders of Shares, in
each case as and to the extent required by applicable Legal Requirements. The
Company shall promptly furnish or otherwise make available in writing to
Parent and Purchaser or Parents legal counsel all information concerning the
Acquired Companies and the Companys stockholders that is required or is
reasonably requested by Parent to be included in the Offer Documents. The
Company and its counsel shall be given reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on the Offer Documents prior to the filing thereof with the SEC and
Parent and Purchaser shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any
such comments. Parent and Purchaser agree to provide the Company and its
counsel with any comments (whether written or oral) Parent, Purchaser or
their counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer
Documents promptly after receipt of such comments. Each of Parent and
Purchaser shall respond promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff with
respect to the Offer Documents or the Offer in coordination with the Company.

(i) Parent shall cause to be provided to Purchaser on a timely basis all of
the funds necessary to purchase any Shares that Purchaser becomes obligated to
purchase pursuant to the Offer, and shall cause Purchaser to perform, to the
extent required and on a timely basis, all of Purchasers obligations under
this Agreement.

in accordance with the requirements of the DGCL including Section 251(h),
(iii) resolved to recommend that stockholders of the Company accept the Offer

such Section 203) shall not apply to the execution, delivery or performance
of this Agreement and the consummation of the Offer, the Merger and the other
Transactions. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.3_, the Company hereby consents
to the inclusion of a description of the Company Board Recommendation in the
Offer Documents.

 



4 (b) As promptly as practicable on the day that the Offer is commenced, the
Company shall, following the filing of the Schedule TO, file with the SEC and
disseminate to all holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent
required by applicable Legal Requirements, a Tender Offer
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with any
exhibits, amendments or supplements thereto, the " _Schedule_ __ _ 14D-9_")
that, subject to  _Section_ __ _ 5.3_, shall reflect the Company Board
Recommendation and contain a notice to the Companys stockholders informing
such stockholders of their rights of appraisal in respect of such Shares in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL. The Company agrees that it shall
cause the Schedule 14D-9 to comply in all material respects with the Exchange
Act and other applicable Legal Requirements. Each of Parent, Purchaser and
the Company shall respond promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff and
to promptly correct any information provided by it or its Representatives for
use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that such information shall
have become false or misleading in any material respect or as otherwise
required by applicable Legal Requirements and to supplement the information
contained in the Schedule 14D-9 to include any information that shall become
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. The Company further shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected or
supplemented to promptly be filed with the SEC and to promptly be disseminated
to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required
by applicable Legal Requirements. Parent and Purchaser shall promptly furnish
or otherwise make available in writing to the Company or the Companys legal
counsel all information concerning Parent and Purchaser that is required or
may reasonably be requested by the Company to be included in the Schedule
14D-9. Parent and its counsel shall be given reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 and any amendment thereto prior to the
filing thereof with the SEC, and the Company shall give reasonable and good
faith consideration to any such comments, in each case. The Company shall
provide Parent and its counsel with any comments (whether written or oral)
the Company or its counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect
to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt of such comments. The Company
shall respond promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff with respect to
the Schedule 14D-9 in coordination with Parent and Purchaser.

 

(c) In connection with the Offer, the Company shall, or shall cause its
transfer agent to, promptly (and in any event within seven (7) Business Days
of the date hereof) furnish Parent with a true and complete list of its

containing the names and addresses of all record holders of Shares and lists

Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the right to receive the Merger Consideration therefor, subject to any

7 Section 2.7 _Surrender of Certificates; Stock Transfer Books_.

 

(a) Prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust
company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent (the " _Paying
Agent_ ") for the holders of Shares to receive the funds to which holders of
such Shares shall become entitled pursuant to this Agreement. At the Closing,
Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent funds
that, when taken together with available cash of the Acquired Companies that
is deposited with the Paying Agent at the Effective Time, are sufficient to
pay the aggregate Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Shares
(the " _Payment Fund_ "). To the extent the Payment Fund diminishes for any
reason below the level required to make prompt payment of the amounts
described in the preceding sentence, Parent and Purchaser shall, or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly replace or restore the lost
portion of such fund so as to ensure that it is maintained at a level
sufficient to make such payments. The Payment Fund shall be invested by the
Paying Agent as directed by Parent;  _provided_ _that_ (i) no such investment
or losses thereon shall relieve Parent from making the payments required by
this _Article 2_ or affect the amount of Merger Consideration payable in
respect of the Shares and following any losses Parent shall promptly provide
additional funds to the Paying Agent in the amount of any such losses, (ii) no
such investment shall have maturities that could prevent or delay payments to
be made pursuant to this Agreement, and (iii) such investments shall be in
short-term obligations of the United States of America with maturities of no
more than thirty (30) days or guaranteed by, and backed by the full faith and
credit of, the United States of America. Any and all interest or other
amounts earned with respect to such funds shall be paid to Parent. The Payment
Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. The Surviving Corporation shall
(and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) pay all charges and
expenses, including those of the Paying Agent, in connection with the exchange
of Shares and the payment of the applicable Merger Consideration in respect of
the Shares.

 

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each Person who was, immediately
prior to the Effective Time, a holder of record of Shares entitled to receive
the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.6(a)(iii)_, (i) a form
of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent) and (ii) instructions
for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares pursuant to such letter of transmittal. Upon surrender to the Paying
Agent of (A) Certificates, together with such letter of transmittal, duly
completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto,
and such other documents as may be reasonably required pursuant to such
instructions, or (B) receipt of an "agents message" by the Paying Agent (or
such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably
request) in the case of Book-Entry Shares, the holder of such Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the Merger Consideration for each Share formerly evidenced by such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, and such Certificates and
Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, shall then be canceled. No interest shall
accrue or be paid on the Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of
any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for the benefit of the holder thereof.
If the payment of any Merger

 



8  Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name
the surrendered Certificates formerly evidencing Shares are registered on the
stock transfer books of the Company, it shall be a condition of payment that
the Certificate so surrendered shall be endorsed properly or otherwise be in
proper form for transfer as deemed by the Surviving Corporation in its
reasonable discretion and that the Person requesting such payment shall have
paid all transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of
the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the
Certificate surrendered, or shall have established to the satisfaction of the
Surviving Corporation that such Taxes either have been paid or are not
applicable. Payment of the applicable Merger Consideration with respect to
Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose name such Book-
Entry Shares are registered.

(c) At any time following the one hundred eightieth (180th) day after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the
Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds which had been made available to the
Paying Agent and not disbursed to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
(including all interest and other income received by the Paying Agent in
respect of all funds made available to it), and, thereafter, such holders
shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to
abandoned property, escheat and other similar Legal Requirements) as general
creditors thereof with respect to any Merger Consideration that may be
payable upon due surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares held by
them. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Surviving Corporation nor the
Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares for any Merger Consideration properly delivered in respect of any such
share to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or
other similar Legal Requirements. If any Certificate or Book-Entry Share has
not been surrendered or transferred prior to the date on which any Merger
Consideration in respect thereof would otherwise escheat to or become the
property of any Governmental Body, then any such Merger Consideration in
respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall become, to the extent
permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, the property of the Surviving
Corporation, free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto.

 

(d) No dividends or other distributions with respect to capital stock of the
Surviving Corporation with a record date on or after the Effective Time shall
be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

(e) At the close of business on the day of the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company with respect to Shares shall be closed and
thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on
the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have
any rights with respect to such Shares except as otherwise provided herein or
by applicable Legal Requirements. If, after the Effective Time, any
Certificate or Book-Entry Share is presented to the Surviving Corporation,
Parent or the Paying Agent for surrender or transfer, as applicable, it shall
be cancelled and exchanged for the cash amount in immediately available funds
to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
2.7_.

 



9 (f) Each of the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent and Purchaser shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold (or cause the Paying Agent to deduct and
withhold) from any amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement, such amounts as
it is required by any Legal Requirement to deduct and withhold with respect to
Taxes. To the extent paid over to the appropriate Governmental Body in
accordance with applicable Legal Requirements, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person
in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

(g) If any Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, then, upon the
making of an effective affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, which includes an agreement to
indemnify and defend and hold harmless Parent, the Surviving Corporation and
the Paying Agent to their reasonable satisfaction from and against any
and all costs, claims, losses, judgments, damages, counsel fees, expenses and
liabilities whatsoever which each may suffer, sustain or incur in connection
with the failure of any statement, representation or warranty set forth in
such affidavit, any payment for or transfer, exchange or delivery of such
Certificate and such Persons inability to locate such Certificate, and, if
required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount
as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to
such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate a check in the amount (after giving effect to
any required Tax withholdings as provided in  _Section_ __ _ 2.7(f)_) equal
to the number of Shares represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate that have been surrendered multiplied by the Merger Consideration.

 

Section 2.8 _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, the Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
and held by a holder who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal
for such Shares in accordance with and complies in all respects with Section
262 of the DGCL (such Shares, the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be
converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration and shall entitle
such holder only to the rights with respect to such Dissenting Shares as may
be provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, unless such holder fails to perfect
or properly withdraws or otherwise loses such holders right to appraisal of
such holders Shares. If, after the Effective Time, such holder fails to
perfect or properly withdraws or loses such holders right to appraisal, then
each such Dissenting Share shall be treated as if it had been converted as of
the Effective Time into a right to receive the Merger Consideration without
any interest thereon (less any amounts entitled to be deducted or
withheld pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.7(f)_). The Company shall give Parent
prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of Shares,
and Parent shall have the right to participate in and direct all negotiations
and proceedings with respect to such demands. Except pursuant to applicable
Legal Requirements, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent
of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any
such demands, or negotiate regarding or agree to do any of the foregoing.
Parent shall not, except with the prior written consent of the Company,
require the Company to make any payment with respect to any demands for
appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands, unless any such
payment is made or settlement is effective following the Effective Time.

cancellation, the holder thereof shall automatically (and without any further
action being required of such holder) receive from or on behalf of the
Surviving Corporation, at, or as soon as practicable but in no event more than
thirty (30) days following, the Effective Time, an amount in cash equal to (i)
the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such In-the-
Money Company Stock Option, multiplied by (ii) the excess of (A) the Merger
Consideration over (B) the per share exercise price for such In-the-Money
Company Option, without interest and subject to any applicable Tax withholding
in accordance with Section 2.7(f).

 

(ii) _Treatment of Other Company Stock Options_. All Company Stock Options
that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether vested
or unvested) and that are not In-the-Money Company Stock Options will
terminate and cease to be outstanding at the Effective Time without any
further action by the holder thereof in accordance with the terms of the
Company Equity Plan or any agreement evidencing such Company Stock Options, as
applicable, without the payment of any consideration in respect thereof.

 

(b) _Treatment of Company Restricted Stock Unit Awards_. Effective as of the
Effective Time, each Company Restricted Stock Unit Award outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and, in
substitution for such cancelled Company Restricted Stock Unit Award, the
holder thereof shall automatically (and without further action being required
of such holders) at the Effective Time become entitled to receive (subject to
the conditions described below) an amount in cash from the Surviving
Corporation equal to (i) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such cancelled Company Restricted Stock Unit Award, multiplied by
(ii) the Merger Consideration, without interest and subject to any applicable
Tax withholding in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.7(f)_ (a " _Substituted
Cash Award_ "). Each Substituted Cash Award will (A) vest in installments on
the same schedule as the vesting schedule set forth in the applicable
cancelled Company Restricted Stock Unit Award, and continuous employment with
or services provided to the Company and Demand Media, Inc. (and its
Affiliates, as defined in the Employee Matters Agreement) will be credited to
the holder for purposes of determining the vesting of the Substituted Cash
Award after the Effective Time in a manner consistent with the Employee
Matters Agreement and (B) maintain all other terms and conditions (including
settlement timing and vesting acceleration) as were applicable to the
cancelled Company Restricted Stock Unit Award under the applicable documents
evidencing such cancelled Company Restricted Stock Unit Award immediately
prior to the Effective Time. The Substituted Cash Awards will be administered
in a manner intended to comply with the "short-term deferral" exemption under
Section 409A of the Code. Any Substituted Cash Awards that are vested as of
the Effective Time will be settled at, or as soon as practicable but in no
event more than thirty (30) days following, the Effective Time.

 



11 (c) _Required Actions_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will take all
actions (i) necessary or desirable to provide for and give effect to the
transactions contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 2.9_, including satisfying
all applicable requirements of Rule 16b-3(e) promulgated under the Exchange
Act and (ii) necessary to terminate the Company Equity Plan effective as of
the Effective Time. The Company shall provide Parent with drafts of, and a
reasonable opportunity to comment upon, all resolutions, written
communications to any participant under the Company Equity Plan and other
written actions as may be required or desirable to give effect to the
provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 2.9_.

cause the Merger to become effective as soon as practicable following the
Offer Acceptance Time without a meeting of the Companys stockholders, as
provided in Section 251(h) of the DGCL. If, at any time after the Effective
Time, any further action is reasonably determined by Parent to be necessary
or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the
Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession of and to all
rights and property of Purchaser and the Company, then the officers and
directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be fully authorized (in the name
of Purchaser, in the name of the Company and otherwise) to take such action.

16 Section 3.6 _SEC Filings; Financial Statements_.

 

(a) Since January 1, 2015, the Company has filed on a timely basis all
reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents (including exhibits
and all other information incorporated therein) required to be filed with or
furnished to the SEC by the Company (such documents, together with any
documents filed with or furnished to the SEC after the date of this
Agreement, the " _Company SEC Documents_ "). As of their respective dates,
the Company SEC Documents complied, or if filed or furnished subsequent to the
date of this Agreement, will comply, in all material respects with the
requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be,
and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to
such Company SEC Documents. Except to the extent that information contained in
any Company SEC Document has been revised, amended, modified or superseded by
a later filed Company SEC Document (prior to the date of this Agreement), none
of the Company SEC Documents when filed or furnished contained, and any
Company SEC Document filed with or furnished to the SEC subsequent to the
date of this Agreement will not contain, any untrue statement of a material
fact or omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
representation is made by the Company with respect to any information supplied
in writing by Parent, Purchaser or any of their Affiliates for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in any Company SEC Document. The Company will file
prior to the Effective Time all reports, schedules, forms, statements and
other documents required to be filed or furnished by it with the SEC prior to
such time. To the extent not available on the SEC website, the Company has
delivered or made available to Parent true and complete copies of the Company
SEC Documents. No other Acquired Company is required to file any forms,
reports, statements, schedules or other documents with the SEC.

(b) The financial statements (including any related notes and schedules)
contained or incorporated by reference in the Company SEC Documents: (i)
complied, or if filed with or furnished to the SEC subsequent to the date of
this Agreement, will comply, as to form in all material respects with the
published rules and regulations of the SEC applicable thereto; (ii) were
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States (" _GAAP_ ") applied on a consistent basis throughout the
periods covered (except as may be indicated in the notes to such financial
statements or, in the case of unaudited financial statements, as permitted by
Form 10-Q, Form 8-K or any successor form under the Exchange Act, and except
that the unaudited financial statements may not contain footnotes and are
subject to normal and recurring year-end adjustments that will not be material
in amount or effect); and (iii) fairly present, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position of the Company and its consolidated
Subsidiaries as of the respective dates thereof and the consolidated
statements of operations and cash flows of the Company and its consolidated
Subsidiaries for the periods covered thereby. No financial statements of any
Person other than the Acquired Companies are required by GAAP to be included
in the consolidated financial statements of the Company. The books and records
of the Acquired Companies have been, and are being, maintained in all
material respects in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis
throughout the periods covered.

 

(c) The Company has established and maintains a system of "internal controls
over financial reporting" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the
Exchange Act) that is sufficient to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP.

 



17 (d) The Companys "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) are reasonably designed to ensure
that all information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports
that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and
forms of the SEC. Since January 1, 2015, neither the Company nor, to the
knowledge of the Company, the Companys independent auditors, has identified
or become aware of (i) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in
the design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting that
could adversely affect in any material respect the Companys ability to
record, process, summarize and report financial information, or (ii) any
fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees
who have a significant role in the Companys internal controls over financial
reporting. For purposes of this Agreement, the terms "significant deficiency"
and "material weakness" will have the meaning assigned to them in Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board Auditing Standard 2, as in effect on the
date of this Agreement.

(e) The Company is in compliance in all material respects with all current
listing and corporate governance requirements of NASDAQ applicable to the
Company.

(f) None of the Acquired Companies is a party to or has any obligation or
other commitment to become a party to any securitization transaction, off-
balance sheet partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract
relating to any transaction or relationship between or among the Acquired
Companies, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate, including any
structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose Entity, on the other
hand, or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of
Regulation S-K under the Securities Act)) where, to the knowledge of the
Company, the result, purpose or intended effect of such Contract is to avoid
disclosure of any material transaction involving, or material liabilities of,
any Acquired Company in any Acquired Companys published financial statements
or other Company SEC Documents. 

(g) Other than as publicly available in the Electronic Data Gathering,
Analysis and Retrieval database of the SEC, there have been no written
inquiries, interrogatories or comments with respect to any of the Company SEC
Documents from the SEC received by the Company since January 1, 2015, and the
Company has not been made aware of any such inquiries, interrogatories
or comments that were oral. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no
outstanding or unresolved comments in comment letters received from the SEC
with respect to the Company SEC Documents. To the knowledge of the Company, as
of the date of this Agreement, there are no Legal Proceedings by the SEC or
any internal investigations pending or threatened, in each case regarding any
accounting practices of the Acquired Companies.

 

(h) Except as permitted by the Exchange Act, including Sections 13(k)(2) and
(3), since the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, neither the
Company nor any of its Affiliates acting on behalf of any of the Acquired
Companies has made, arranged, modified (in any material respect) or forgiven
personal loans to any executive officer or director of the Acquired Companies.

 

(i) Since January 1, 2015, (i) none of the Acquired Companies or, to the
knowledge of the Company, any Company Associate, auditor, accountant or
representative of the Acquired Companies, has received notice of any material
complaint, allegation, assertion or claim regarding the accounting or auditing
practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of 

 



18  the Acquired Companies or their respective internal accounting controls
relating to periods after January 1, 2011, including any material complaint,
allegation, assertion or claim that any Acquired Company has engaged in
questionable accounting or auditing practices (except for any of the foregoing
after the date of this Agreement which would not have a Material Adverse
Effect), and (ii) to the knowledge of the Company, no attorney representing
any Acquired Company, whether or not employed by any Acquired Company, has
reported evidence of a material violation of securities Legal Requirements
relating to periods after January 1, 2011 by the Company or any
Company Associate or agents to the Company Board or any committee thereof or,
to the knowledge of the Company, to any director or officer of the Company
(except for any of the foregoing after the date of this Agreement which would
not have a Material Adverse Effect).

Section 3.7 _Absence of Changes_. Since the date of the unaudited balance
sheet in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31,
2017 (the " _Balance Sheet_ ") filed by the Company with the SEC, and through
the date of this Agreement, (a) the Acquired Companies have operated in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practices, except for actions
taken in respect of this Agreement, and there has not occurred any Material
Adverse Effect, and (b) except for actions taken in connection with
this Agreement and the Transactions contemplated hereby, none of the Acquired
Companies has taken any action which, had such action been taken after the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and before the Closing, would have
required Parents consent pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 5.2_.

Section 3.8  _Title to Assets_. The Acquired Companies have good and valid
title, free and clear of any Encumbrances (other than Permitted Encumbrances),
to all material assets owned by them as of the date of this Agreement,
including all assets (other than capitalized leases) reflected on the Balance
Sheet (except for assets sold or otherwise disposed of in the ordinary course
of business since the date of such Balance Sheet).

 

Section 3.9 _Real Property; Equipment_.

 

(a) The Acquired Companies do not own any real property. No Acquired Company
is a party to any agreement or option to purchase any material real property
or interest therein.

(b) _Part 3.9(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_ sets forth a true and
complete list of each material lease or material sublease pursuant to which
any of the Acquired Companies leases real property to or from any other Person
(the " _Leased Real Property_ "). _Part 3.9(b) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule_ contains a true and complete list of all Contracts for personal
property leased, subleased, licensed or otherwise conveyed to or by any
Acquired Company involving annual payments in excess of $100,000 (" _Leased
Personal Property_ "). True and complete copies of all such leases or
subleases with respect to all Leased Real Property and all Leased Personal
Property have been provided to Parent and each such lease or sublease is in
full force and effect. The Company or the applicable Subsidiary holds a valid
and existing leasehold interest in each Leased Real Property and each Leased
Personal Property.

 



19 (c) To the Companys knowledge, the Leased Real Property is structurally
sound, with no material defects, and all building systems contained therein
are in good operating condition and repair, subject to ordinary wear and tear.
There are no subleases, sublicenses, occupancy agreements or other contractual
obligations that grant the right to use or the occupancy of any of the Leased
Real Property to any Person other than the Acquired Companies.

(d) The Leased Real Property comprises all of the material real property used
or intended to be used in the business of the Acquired Companies.

(e) All material items of equipment and other tangible assets owned by or
leased to the Acquired Companies are adequate for the uses to which they are
being put and are in good and safe operating condition and repair (ordinary
wear and tear excepted).

 

Section 3.10 _Intellectual Property_.

 

(a) _Part 3.10(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_ sets forth a list of all
domestic and foreign Registered IP owned or purported to be owned by any
Acquired Company, otherwise registered or the subject of any application for
registration in the name of any Acquired Company, or exclusively licensed to
any Acquired Company, and for each such items of Registered IP, such
Schedule identifies (i) the current owner, (ii) the jurisdiction of
application/registration, (iii) the application or registration number, and
(iv) the date of filing or issuance (the Registered IP set forth in this 
_Section_ __ _ 3.10(a)_ is referred to collectively as, the " _Company
Registered IP_ ", and the Company Registered IP that is owned or purported to
be owned by any Acquired Company is referred to as the " _Company Owned
Registered IP_ "). There are no Legal Proceedings, filings or payments that
must be taken or made on or before one hundred twenty (120) days after the
date of this Agreement to maintain any such application or registration,
other than in the ordinary course of business. As of the date of this
Agreement, no cancellation, derivation, interference, opposition, reissue, or
reexamination, ex parte reexamination, reissue or interference proceeding,
other  _inter partes_ legal proceedings, including _inter partes_ reexam,
inter partes review, post grant review, or covered business method review or
any other proceeding is pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened, in which the validity, enforceability or ownership of any Company
Owned Registered IP, or to the knowledge of the Company, any other Company
Registered IP, is being contested or challenged (other than office actions or
similar communications issued by any Governmental Body in the ordinary course
of prosecution of any pending applications for registration of any such
Company Registered IP). Each of the patents and patent applications included
in the Company Owned Registered IP identifies by name each inventor of the
claims thereof as determined in accordance with the Legal Requirements of the
jurisdiction in which such patent is issued or such patent application is
pending. As of the date of this Agreement, (A) all registration,
renewal, maintenance and other similar payments that have become due with
respect to the Company Owned Registered IP, and with respect to any other
Company Registered IP to the extent any Acquired Company is responsible for
the prosecution or maintenance of such Company Registered IP or the costs
thereof (together with the Company Owned Registered IP, the " _Company Managed
IP_ "), have been timely paid by or on behalf of the Company or another
Acquired Company, and (B) except with respect to any applications for Company
Managed IP, the Company Managed IP is subsisting, and to the Companys
knowledge, valid and enforceable and in full force and effect and has not
lapsed (except for any patents within the Company Managed IP having lapsed or
expired at the end of their statutory term), been abandoned, been disclaimed,
been cancelled or been forfeited.

 



20 (b) The Company or another Acquired Company is the sole and exclusive owner of
all right, title and interest (including Intellectual Property Rights other
than any inalienable moral right or any other inalienable right or interest
retained pursuant to the applicable Legal Requirements) in the Company Owned
IP, free and clear of all Encumbrances (other than Permitted Encumbrances and
other than the Outbound Licenses or any non-exclusive license entered into in
the ordinary course of business that is not reasonably likely to
adversely interfere in any material respect with the existing or intended use
or value of the property or assets subject to such license). Except as set
forth on _Part 3.10(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_ , no Acquired
Company has received, in the three (3) year period before the date of this
Agreement, a written notice from any third party (including any employee or
consultant) pursuant to which such third party claims to own or have any right
or interest in or to ( including, without limitation, any inalienable moral
right or any other inalienable right or interest retained pursuant to the
applicable Legal Requirements), or to have any right to receive any royalty or
other material payment for such Acquired Companys use or exploitation of,
any Company Owned IP. To the knowledge of the Company, the Acquired Companies
own, or hold a license or other right to use, all Intellectual Property Rights
necessary for the conduct of the Acquired Companies business as currently
conducted. All assignments made to an Acquired Company of any Company Owned IP
are, to the knowledge of the Company, valid and enforceable and, with respect
to Company Owned Registered IP, have been recorded in compliance with
applicable Legal Requirements. Nothing set forth in this _Section_ __ _
3.10(b)_ will constitute a representation or warranty regarding the
infringement, misappropriation or violation of any Intellectual Property Right
owned by another Person, and the sole representation with respect to
infringement, misappropriation or violation of any Intellectual Property Right
owned by another Person is set forth in _Section_ __ _ 3.10(e)_.

 

(c) _Part 3.10(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_ identifies (i) each
Contract pursuant to which any Intellectual Property Rights or Intellectual
Property of another Person (other than an Affiliate of the Company), in each
case that is material to the business of an Acquired Company as currently
conducted, is licensed to any Acquired Company (other than licenses to
COTS Software, licenses granted by employees contractors pursuant to
employment or contractor Contracts for services of such employees or
contractors, and licenses granted under nondisclosure Contracts) (each, an "
_Inbound License_ "), and (ii) each Contract pursuant to which any material
Company Owned IP is licensed to another Person (other than another Acquired
Company) other than any non-exclusive license entered into in the
ordinary course of business that is not reasonably likely to adversely
interfere in any material respect with the existing or intended use or value
of the property or assets subject to such license (each, an " _Outbound
License_ "). To the knowledge of the Company, each of the Inbound Licenses
and the Outbound Licenses (collectively, " _IP Licenses_ ") is valid and
binding on all parties thereto and enforceable in accordance with its terms.
To the knowledge of the Company, there exists no event or condition that does
or will result in a material violation or breach of, or constitute (with or
without due notice or lapse of time or both) a default by any of the Acquired
Companies thereunder, and there exists no event or condition caused by or in
the control of the Acquired Companies or other fact or condition that does or
will result in a material violation or breach of, or constitute (with or
without due notice or lapse of time or both) a material default by any other
party thereunder, except as would not reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect. Each Acquired Company is in material compliance with,
and has not materially breached any term of any such IP Licenses and, to
the knowledge of the Company, all other parties to such

 



21  IP Licenses are in compliance with, and have not materially breached any
term of, such IP Licenses, except as would not reasonably be expected to
result in a Material Adverse Effect. The consummation of the Transactions
will not result in the breach, modification, cancellation, termination,
suspension of, acceleration of any payments with respect to, or loss,
reduction or termination of rights under any IP Licenses, except as would not
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. The
consummation of the Transactions will not, under the terms of any Contract of
any Acquired Company, result in or require Parent or any of its Affiliates
that are in existence before the consummation of the Transactions to license
or grant equivalent rights to any Person under the Intellectual Property
Rights of Parent or any of those Affiliates. Following the Closing, the
Acquired Companies will be permitted to exercise all of their respective
rights under such IP Licenses to the same extent they would have been able to
had the Transactions not occurred and without the payment of any material
additional amounts or consideration other than ongoing fees, royalties
or payments which the Acquired Companies would otherwise be required to pay
(except to the extent arising from any Contract to which Parent or its
Affiliates is a party and to which no Acquired Company is a party).

 

(d) None of the Company Owned IP is subject to any pending or outstanding
injunction, directive, order, decree, award, settlement, judgment or other
disposition of dispute that would reasonably be expected to restrict the use,
transfer, registration or licensing of any such Company Owned IP by the
Acquired Companies, or otherwise would reasonably be expected to materially
adversely affect the validity or enforceability of any such Company Owned IP.

(e) To the knowledge of the Company, the operation of the business of
the Acquired Companies as currently conducted does not infringe,
misappropriate or otherwise violate any Intellectual Property Rights owned by
another Person in any material respect. Except as set forth on _Part_ __ _
3.10(e)_ _of the Company Disclosure Schedule_ , (i) no Legal Proceeding has
been asserted during the past five (5) years, is pending or, to the knowledge
of the Company, is being threatened, against any of the Acquired Companies
relating to any infringement, misappropriation or violation of any
Intellectual Property Rights of another Person by any of the Acquired
Companies, and (ii) none of the Acquired Companies has received, during the
past five (5) years, any written notice (including any written offers to
license) alleging any infringement, misappropriation or violation of any
Intellectual Property Rights of another Person by any of the Acquired
Companies.

 

(f) To the knowledge of the Company, no other Person is infringing,
misappropriating or otherwise violating any Company Owned IP.

 

(g) To the knowledge of the Company, each Person who is or was involved in the
creation or development of any Company Owned IP has signed an agreement
containing an assignment of all Intellectual Property Rights (other than any
inalienable moral right or any other inalienable right or interest retained
pursuant to the applicable Legal Requirements) in or arising from such
Intellectual Property to the Acquired Companies and confidentiality
provisions protecting such Intellectual Property which, to the Companys
knowledge, has not been breached by any such Person. The Acquired Companies
have taken reasonable actions to maintain the confidentiality of the material
proprietary information held by any of the Acquired Companies, or purported to
be held by any of the Acquired Companies, as a trade secret. To the
knowledge 

 



22  of the Company, no material trade secrets or proprietary information
included in the Company Owned IP have been disclosed to or used by any Person
except pursuant to a non-disclosure agreement which, to the knowledge of the
Company, has not been breached by any such Person.

 

(h) No funding, facilities or personnel of any Governmental Body or any
university, college, research institute or other educational institution has
been used to create any material Company Owned IP, except for any such funding
or use of facilities or personnel that has not resulted in such Governmental
Body or institution obtaining ownership of, or options or exclusive
rights with respect to, such Company Owned IP.

(i) Except as would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect, no software included in the Company Owned IP contains any Open Source
Materials, and no Open Source Materials have been used in, incorporated into,
integrated or bundled with any current products or services of any of the
Acquired Companies. Each Acquired Company has used its reasonable best
efforts to: (i) identify such Open Source Materials; and (ii) avoid the
release of the source code of the software owned by or exclusively licensed to
such Acquired Company. There has been no material deviation from such efforts
and procedures of the Acquired Companies with respect to Open Source
Materials.

(j) None of the patents included within the Company Owned IP is subject to
any express (i) licensing or similar obligations owed to a standards body,
patent pool or any similar organization, or (ii) other commitment or
obligation, in each case that would require the Acquired Companies to grant
licenses or other rights to third parties on a reasonable and
nondiscriminatory basis, no fee basis, or under any other compulsory licensing
commitment.

directly or indirectly, to a Person for the purpose of influencing any act or
decision of a Governmental Body in their official capacity, securing any
improper advantage, or assisting the Acquired Company or any of its

Representations and Warranties of Parent and Purchaser

 

Parent and Purchaser hereby represent and warrant to the Company as follows:

 

Section 4.1 _Due Incorporation_. Except with respect to matters that,

Parents or Purchasers ability to consummate the Transactions, each of Parent
and Purchaser is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good

corporate power and authority to: (a) conduct its business in the manner in
which its business is currently being conducted; and (b) own and use its
assets in the manner in which its assets are currently owned and used.
Parent has delivered to the Company or the Companys Representatives prior to

incorporation and bylaws of each of Parent and Purchaser, including all
amendments thereto. Neither Parent nor Purchaser is in material violation of
their respective articles of incorporation or bylaws.

Purchaser has the corporate power and authority to execute and deliver and
perform their respective obligations under this Agreement. The execution,
delivery and performance by Parent and Purchaser of this Agreement have been
duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part
of Parent and Purchaser and their respective boards of directors, and no
other corporate proceedings on the part of Parent or Purchaser are necessary
to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the Transactions, other than the

the sole stockholder of the Purchaser. This Agreement constitutes the legal,
valid and binding obligation of each of Parent and Purchaser, and assuming due
authorization, execution and delivery by the Company, is enforceable against
them in accordance with its terms, subject to the Enforceability Exceptions.

 

Section 4.4 _Non-Contravention; Consents_. The execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement by Parent and Purchaser, and the consummation
by Parent and Purchaser of the transactions as contemplated by this Agreement,
will not: (a) result in a breach or violation of, or default under, any of the
provisions of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of Purchaser or
Parent; (b) result in a breach or violation by Parent or Purchaser of any
Legal Requirement applicable to Parent or Purchaser, or to which either of
them is subject; or (c) with or without notice or lapse of time or both,
result in a breach or violation of, a termination (or right of termination) or
default under, any change in or acceleration or creation of any obligations or
the creation of any Encumbrance on the assets of Parent or Purchaser, or
change or loss of rights pursuant to any Contract, in each case, that would be
binding upon Parent or Purchaser, except as, individually or in the aggregate,
would not materially and adversely affect Parents or Purchasers ability to
consummate the Transactions. Except as may be required by the Exchange Act,
blue sky Legal Requirements and Takeover Laws, the DGCL, and the rules and
regulations of NASDAQ, neither Parent nor Purchaser, nor any of Parents
other Affiliates, is required to make any filing with or give any notice or

Closing in connection with the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement by Parent or Purchaser or the consummation by Parent or Purchaser
of the Transactions, except those that the failure to make or obtain,
individually or in the aggregate, would not materially and adversely affect
Parents or Purchasers ability to consummate the Transactions. No additional
vote of Parents stockholders is necessary to approve this Agreement or any of
the Transactions.

 

Section 4.5 _Information in the Offer Documents_ _and Schedule 14D-9_. None of
the information with respect to Parent or Purchaser supplied or to be
supplied by or on behalf of Parent or Purchaser for inclusion in the Schedule
14D-9, and so included therein, shall, at the time of the filing of the
Schedule 14D-9, at any time it is amended or supplemented (following any

38  behalf), or at the time of any distribution or dissemination of the Schedule

statements or omissions included or incorporated by reference in the Offer
Documents based upon information supplied to Parent or Purchaser by the
Acquired Companies or any of their Representatives specifically for inclusion
therein.

Section 4.6  _Absence of Litigation_. As of the date of this Agreement, there
is no Legal Proceeding pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened
against Parent or Purchaser that would materially and adversely affect
Parents or Purchasers ability to consummate the Transactions. As of the
date of this Agreement, neither Parent nor Purchaser is subject to any
continuing order of, consent decree, settlement agreement or similar written
agreement with, or, to the knowledge of Parent, continuing investigation by,
any Governmental Body, or any order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree,
determination or award of any Governmental Body that would materially and
adversely affect Parents or Purchasers ability to consummate the
Transactions.

Section 4.7 _Solvency_. Neither Parent nor Purchaser is entering into this
Agreement with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or
future creditors of the Parent, Purchaser, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries of Affiliates. Assuming (i) satisfaction or waiver of
the Offer Conditions, (ii) the accuracy of the representations and warranties
made by the Company in _Article 3_ and (iii) compliance with the Company with
the covenants and agreements set forth herein, immediately after giving effect
to the Transactions and the transactions contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letters, Parent and the Acquired Companies (on a consolidated basis) will,
after giving effect to the Merger or any other Transactions, including the
funding of the Financing, payment of the Merger Consideration, and payment of
all other amounts required to be paid in connection with the consummation of
the Merger or any other Transaction and the payment of all related fees and
expenses, be Solvent at and immediately after the Closing. As used in
this Section 4.7, the term "Solvent" shall mean, with respect to a particular
date, that on such date, (a) the sum of the assets, at a fair valuation, of
Parent and the Acquired Companies (on a consolidated basis) will exceed
their debts, (b) Parent and the Acquired Companies (on a consolidated basis)
have not incurred and do not intend to incur debts beyond their ability to pay
such debts as such debts mature, and (c) Parent and the Acquired Companies (on

to conduct their business. For purposes of this Section 4.7, "debt" means any

not such a right is reduced to judgment, liquidated, unliquidated, fixed,
contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, legal, equitable,
secured or unsecured, and (ii) any right to an equitable remedy for breach
of performance if such breach gives rise to a payment, whether or not such
right to an equitable remedy is reduced to judgment, fixed, contingent,
matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, secured or unsecured.

 



39 Section 4.8 _Financing_. Parent has delivered to the Company true and complete
copies of (a) a fully executed commitment letter dated on or about the date
of this Agreement from the Financing Sources (together with all exhibits,
annexes, schedules and term sheets attached thereto and as amended, modified,
supplemented, replaced or extended from time to time after the date of this
Agreement in compliance with _Section_ __ _ 6.14(b))_, and (b) a fully
executed fee letter (which may be redacted solely to omit the fee amounts and
other economic terms and the "market flex" provisions thereof, none of which
would adversely affect the amount, conditionality, availability or termination
of the Financing contemplated thereby)(the " _Redacted Fee Letter_ ") dated on
or about the date of this Agreement from the Financing Sources (together with
all exhibits, annexes, schedules and term sheets attached thereto and as
amended, modified, supplemented, replaced or extended from time to time after
the date of this Agreement in compliance with _Section_ __ _ 6.14(b)_,
collectively, the " _Financing Letters_ ") providing, subject to the terms and
conditions therein, for debt financing in the amounts set forth therein (being
collectively referred to as the " _Financing_ "). As of the date of this
Agreement, none of the Financing Letters has been amended or modified, and, to
the knowledge of Parent, no such amendment or modification is contemplated,
and, to the knowledge of Parent, none of the respective obligations and
commitments contained in such letters have been withdrawn, terminated or
rescinded in any respect and, to the knowledge of Parent, no such withdrawal,
termination or rescission is contemplated. Parent or Purchaser has fully
provided for any and all commitment fees or other fees in connection with the
Financing Letters that are payable on or prior to the date of this Agreement
and shall continue to provide in full for any such amounts required to be
paid pursuant to the terms of the Financing Letters as and when they become
due and payable on or prior to the Closing Date. The net proceeds contemplated
by the Financing Letters (after netting out applicable fees, expenses,
original issue discount and similar premiums and charges and after giving
effect to the maximum amount of flex (including original issue discount flex)
provided under the Financing Letters), together with any available cash of the
Parent, the Company and their respective Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date
(taking into account, with respect to any cash of the Acquired Companies, the
limitations set forth in clause (C) of the last sentence of Section 6.14(a)),
will in the aggregate be sufficient for Purchaser and the Surviving
Corporation to pay the aggregate Offer Price and Merger Consideration and any
other amounts required to be paid in connection with the consummation of the
Transactions (including all amounts payable in respect of Company Stock
Options and Company Awards under this Agreement) and to pay all related fees
and expenses payable by them in connection with the Transactions, including
the Financing (such amount collectively, the " _Required Amount_ "). The
Financing Letters are (x) legal, valid and binding obligations of Parent and
Purchaser, as applicable, and, to the knowledge of Parent, each of the other
parties thereto, (y) enforceable in accordance with their respective terms
against Parent and Purchaser, as applicable, and, to the knowledge of Parent,
each of the other parties thereto, in each case subject to the Enforceability
Exceptions and (z) as of the date of this Agreement, in full force
and effect. As of the date of this Agreement, no event has occurred that,
with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to
constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent or Purchaser or, to the
knowledge of Parent, any other parties thereto under the Financing Letters.
As of the date of this Agreement, assuming satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions to Parents and Purchasers obligations to consummate the Offer and
the Merger, Parent and 

 



40  Purchaser do not have any reason to believe that the conditions precedent
set forth in the Financing Letters will not be satisfied or that the Required
Amount will not be available on the Closing Date. As of the date of this
Agreement, there are no side letters or other Contracts or arrangements to
which Parent or any of its Affiliates is a party related to the Financing
other than as contained in the Financing Letters delivered to the Company
prior to the date of this Agreement that would (A) impair the enforceability
of any of the Financing Letters, (B) reduce the aggregate amount of any
portion of the Financing (including by increasing the amount of fees to be
paid or original issue discount as compared to the fees and original issue
discount contemplated by the Financing Letters on the date of this Agreement)
such that the aggregate amount of the Financing would be below the amount
required to pay the Required Amount, (C) impose new or additional conditions
precedent to the Financing, (D) otherwise adversely modify any of the
conditions precedent to the Financing or (E) reasonably be expected to
prevent, impair or delay the consummation of the Financing.

Section 4.9 _Ownership of Company Common Stock_. Except as set forth on
_Schedule_ __ _ 4.9_, as of the date of this Agreement none of Parent or any
of Parents Subsidiaries or any of their affiliates and associates owns
(within the meaning of Section 203 of the DGCL), and all times for the past
five (5) years, neither Parent nor any of Parents Subsidiaries or any of
their affiliates and associates has owned (within the meaning of Section 203
of the DGCL), any Shares or any securities, contracts or obligations
convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for Shares. Neither Parent
nor Purchaser is, nor at any time during the past three (3) years has been, an
"interested stockholder" of the Company as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL.

 

Section 4.10 _No Other Representations_. In connection with the due diligence
investigation of the Company by Parent and Purchaser, Parent and Purchaser
have received and may continue to receive from the Company certain estimates,
projections, forecasts and other forward-looking information, as well as
certain business plan and cost-related plan information, regarding
the Acquired Companies and their respective business and operations. Parent
and Purchaser hereby acknowledge that there are uncertainties inherent in
attempting to make such estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-
looking information, with which Parent and Purchaser are familiar, that
Parent and Purchaser are taking full responsibility for making their own
evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, projections,
forecasts and other forward-looking information, as well as such business
plans and cost-related plans, so furnished to them. Accordingly, except for
the representations and warranties contained in _Article 3_ and except in the
case of fraud, Parent and Purchaser acknowledge that neither the
Acquired Companies nor any Representative of the Acquired Company makes, and
Parent and Purchaser acknowledge that it has not relied upon or otherwise been
induced by, any other express or implied representations or warranties with
respect to the Acquired Companies or with respect to any other information,
including as to the accuracy or completeness of such information, provided or
made available to Parent or Purchaser in connection with the Transactions,
including any information, documents, estimates, projections, forecasts or
other material made available to Parent, Purchaser or their respective
Representatives in certain "data rooms" or management presentations in
expectation of the Transactions.

45 (xix) agree or commit to take any of the actions described in clauses (i)
through (xviii) of this _Section_ __ _ 5.2(b)_.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall give to Parent
or Purchaser, directly or indirectly, rights to control or direct the
operations of the Acquired Companies prior to the Offer Acceptance Time.

 

Section 5.3 _No Solicitation_.

 

(a) During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall not, and shall cause the
other Acquired Companies and their respective directors and officers not to,
and shall not authorize or direct, and shall use reasonable best efforts to
cause its and their respective other Representatives not to, directly or
indirectly: (i) solicit, initiate, or knowingly take any action to induce,
facilitate or encourage the submission or announcement of any Acquisition
Proposal (including by granting any waiver under Section 203 of the DGCL) or
any inquiry, indication of interest, proposal or offer that could reasonably
be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal; (ii) furnish any information
regarding any of the Acquired Companies to any Person in connection with or in
response to an Acquisition Proposal or an inquiry, indication of interest,
proposal or offer that could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition
Proposal (except to state they are not permitted to engage in such discussions
or negotiations pursuant to the terms of this Agreement); (iii) participate
or engage in discussions or negotiations with any Person with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal or an inquiry, indication of interest, proposal or offer
that could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal; (iv)
adopt, approve, recommend, submit to stockholders or declare advisable any
Acquisition Proposal; (v) enter into any agreement in principle, letter of
intent, term sheet, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement
or similar document or any Contract contemplating or otherwise relating to
any Acquisition Transaction or modify or amend any provision in any Contract
in connection with any Acquisition Proposal (other than entry into an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement); or (vi) release or permit the release
during the Pre-Closing Period of any Person from, or waive or permit the
waiver of any provision of, any confidentiality, "standstill", or similar
provision of any agreement to which any of the Acquired Companies is a party;
_provided_ , ___however_ , that prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, this
_Section_ __ _ 5.3_ shall not prohibit the Company or any Representative of
the Company from furnishing information regarding the Acquired Companies to,
or entering into or participating in discussions or negotiations with, any
Person (and waiving such Persons noncompliance with the provisions of
any "standstill" agreement) in response to a bona-fide written Acquisition
Proposal that is submitted after the date of this Agreement to the Company by
such Person (and not withdrawn) if (A) such Acquisition Proposal was not
solicited in breach of this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_, (B) the Company Board
concludes in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and
its financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, that (1) such bona-
fide written Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Offer or would
reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Offer and (2) the failure to take
such action would be reasonably likely to constitute a breach of the fiduciary
duties of the Company Board to the Companys stockholders under applicable
Legal Requirements, (C) concurrently with furnishing any such information to,
or entering into discussions with, such Person, Parent receives written notice
from the Company stating the identity of such Person and the Companys
intention to furnish information to, or enter into discussions with, such
Person, (D) prior to furnishing such information, the Company receives from
such Person an executed confidentiality agreement in a

 



46  customary form that is no less restrictive to the other party than the
Confidentiality Agreement is to Parent, _provided_ that such confidentiality
agreement need not contain any "standstill" provision (each, an " _Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement_ "), and (E) the Company concurrently furnishes all
such information to Parent (to the extent such information has not been
previously furnished or made available by the Company to Parent or Parents
Representatives). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Company acknowledges and agrees that any breach of any of the restrictions set
forth in the preceding sentence by any Representative of the Company or any
Acquired Company, whether or not such Representative is purporting to act on
behalf of the Company or any Acquired Company, shall be deemed to constitute a
breach of this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_ by the Company.

(b) During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall promptly (and in no event
later than the later to occur of (A) twenty-four (24) hours or (B) noon of
the next Business Day after receipt thereof) advise Parent orally and in
writing of any bona fide Acquisition Proposal, any inquiry, indication of
interest, proposal, offer or request that would reasonably be expected to
lead to an Acquisition Proposal or any request for nonpublic information
relating to any of the Acquired Companies in connection with an Acquisition
Proposal, including (i) the identity of the Person making or submitting such
Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, indication of interest, proposal, offer or
request, (ii) an unredacted copy of all written materials provided in
connection with such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, indication of interest,
proposal, offer or request and (iii) a written summary of all material oral
communications made by any Person during the Pre-Closing Period with respect
thereto. After receipt of the Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, indication of
interest or request, the Company shall promptly (and in any event within the
later to occur of (A) twenty-four (24) hours or (B) noon of the next Business
Day) keep Parent informed orally or in writing of any material change in the
status, terms and pertinent details of any such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry,
indication of interest, proposal, offer or request (including by providing
prompt notice of all material amendments or proposed material amendments
thereto) and shall promptly (and in any event within the later to occur of (A)
twenty-four (24) hours or (B) noon of the next Business Day) provide to Parent
an unredacted copy of all written materials subsequently provided in
connection with such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, indication of interest,
proposal, offer or request.

(c) As of the date of this Agreement, the Company shall immediately cease and
cause to be terminated any existing discussions with any Person that relate to
any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry, indication of interest, proposal,
offer or request that could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition
Proposal. The Company shall promptly (but in no event later than forty-eight
(48) hours following the execution of this Agreement) demand that each Person
that has heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement with the Company or
any of its Affiliates or Subsidiaries or any of its or their Representatives
with respect to such Persons consideration of a possible Acquisition Proposal
to immediately return or destroy (and shall demand such destruction
subsequently be certified in writing by such Person to the Company if such
Person is required to do so pursuant to the terms of the non-disclosure or
confidentiality agreement between such Person and the Company) all
confidential information heretofore furnished by the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of its or their Affiliates or Representatives to such
Person, its Subsidiaries or any of its or their Affiliates
or Representatives, in each case pursuant to the terms of such
confidentiality agreement.

 



47 (d) None of the Company, the Company Board or any committee thereof shall
(i)(A) withhold, fail to include in (or remove from) the Schedule 14D-9,
withdraw, qualify or modify (or resolve, determine or propose to withhold,
fail to include in (or remove from) the Schedule 14D-9, withdraw, qualify or
modify), in each case in a manner adverse to Parent or Purchaser, the Company
Board Recommendation or (B) approve, recommend, submit to stockholders or
declare advisable (or resolve, determine or propose to approve, recommend,
submit to stockholders or declare advisable) any Acquisition Proposal (any
action described in this clause (i) being referred to as an " _Adverse Change
Recommendation_ "), (ii) subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.3(e)_, fail to publicly
recommend against any Acquisition Proposal, or fail to publicly reaffirm the
Company Board Recommendation, within the later of four (4) Business Days after
receipt of written request by Parent or ten (10) Business Days following the
commencement by a third party of any tender offer or exchange offer related to
the Shares, or (iii) approve, recommend, submit to stockholders or declare
advisable (or resolve, determine or propose to approve, recommend, submit to
stockholders or declare advisable), or allow any Acquired Company to execute
or enter into, any Contract (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement) constituting or related to, or that is intended to or would be
reasonably likely to lead to, an Acquisition Transaction, or requiring or
reasonably likely to cause the Company to abandon, terminate, delay or fail to
consummate, or that would otherwise materially impede, interfere with or be
inconsistent with, the Transactions (any such Contract, an " _Alternative
Acquisition Agreement_ "), except as expressly permitted by _Section_ __ _
5.3(a)_ or _5.3(e)_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither (1) the
confidential determination in and of itself by the Company Board (or a
committee thereof) that an Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or would
reasonably be expected to likely to lead to a Superior Proposal, nor (2)
the delivery in itself by the Company to Parent of any notice contemplated by
_Section_ __ _ 5.3(e)_ will constitute an Adverse Change Recommendation or
violate this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at
any time prior to Purchaser accepting, for the first time, for payment Shares
validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer (the "
_Offer Acceptance Time_ "), the Company Board may make an Adverse Change
Recommendation or terminate this Agreement to enter into a
Specified Agreement if and only if: (i) in the event of a Superior Offer,
such Superior Offer was not solicited in breach of _Section_ __ _ 5.3_; (ii)
the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with
the Companys outside legal counsel and its financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation, that the failure to make the Adverse Change
Recommendation or terminate this Agreement to enter into a Specified Agreement
would be reasonably likely to constitute a breach of the fiduciary duties of
the Company Board to the Companys stockholders under applicable Legal
Requirements; (iii) Parent shall have received from the Company prior written
notice of the Companys intention to make an Adverse Change Recommendation or
terminate this Agreement to enter into a Specified Agreement at least four (4)
Business Days prior to making any Adverse Change Recommendation or terminating
this Agreement to enter into a Specified Agreement (a " _Change of
Recommendation Notice_ "); and (iv) the Company shall comply with clauses (A)
through (E) as follows: (A) prior to giving effect to clauses (B) through (E),
the Company Board shall have determined in good faith, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel and its financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation, that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Offer; (B)
the Company shall have provided to Parent in writing the material terms and
conditions of such Acquisition Proposal and unredacted copies of all material
documents relating to such Acquisition Proposal in accordance with _Section_
__ _ 5.3_; (C) 

 



48  the Company shall have given Parent the four (4) Business Day period
following Parents receipt of the Change of Recommendation Notice to propose
revisions to the terms of this Agreement or make other proposals and shall,
if requested by Parent, have negotiated in good faith with Parent (and caused
its Representatives to negotiate with Parent) during the four (4) Business Day
period provided in the foregoing clause (iii) of this _Section_ __ _ 5.3(e)_
with respect to such proposed revisions or other proposals, if any, so that
the Acquisition Proposal would no longer constitute a Superior Offer; (D)
after considering the results of negotiations with Parent and taking into
account the proposals made by Parent, if any, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and its financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation, the Company Board shall have determined in good faith that such
Acquisition Proposal remains a Superior Offer and that the failure to make the
Adverse Change Recommendation or terminate this Agreement to enter into a
Specified Agreement would be reasonably likely to constitute a breach of
the fiduciary duties of the Company Board to the Companys stockholders under
applicable Legal Requirements; and (E) if the Company intends to terminate
this Agreement to enter into a Specified Agreement, the Company shall have
complied with  _Section_ __ _ 8.1(e)_. For the avoidance of doubt, the
provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.3(e)_ shall also apply to any material
amendment to any Acquisition Proposal or any successive Acquisition
Proposals (except that any reference to four (4) Business Days shall instead
be two (2) Business Days). Nothing contained in this _Section_ __ _ 5.3(e)_
shall prohibit the Company Board from (x) taking and disclosing to
the stockholders of the Company a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act or making a statement contemplated by Item
1012(a) of Regulation M-A or Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange
Act, or (y) making any disclosure to the Companys stockholders that the
Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal
counsel) that the failure to make such disclosure would be reasonably likely
to constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders
under applicable Legal Requirements;  _provided_ ___that_ , in either case,
any such disclosure does not contain an Adverse Change Recommendation. Neither
the Company nor the Company Board shall be permitted to recommend that the
Company stockholders tender any securities in connection with any tender or
exchange offer or otherwise approve, endorse or recommend any Acquisition
Proposal, unless in each case, in connection therewith, the Company Board
effects an Adverse Change Recommendation in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, at any time prior to the
Offer Acceptance Time, the Company Board may make an Adverse Change
Recommendation with respect to an Intervening Event if and only if: (i) the
Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the Companys
outside legal counsel, that the failure to make the Adverse Change
Recommendation would be reasonably likely to constitute a breach of the
fiduciary duties of the Company Board to the Companys stockholders under
applicable Legal Requirements; (ii) Parent shall have received from
the Company a Change of Recommendation Notice at least four (4) Business Days
prior to making any Adverse Change Recommendation, describing the Intervening
Event in reasonable detail; (iii) during such four (4) Business Day period,
the Company shall have negotiated in good faith with Parent (and caused its
Representatives to negotiate with Parent) with respect to any proposed
revisions to this Agreement or other proposals made by Parent, if any, that
would obviate the need to make an Adverse Change Recommendation; and (iv)
after considering the results of negotiations with Parent and taking into
account the proposals made by Parent, if any, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel, the Company Board shall have determined in good faith
that the failure to

 



49  make the Adverse Change Recommendation would be likely to constitute a
breach of the fiduciary duties of the Company Board to the Companys
stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements. The provisions of this
_Section_ __ _ 5.3(f)_ shall also apply to any material change to the facts
and circumstances relating to an Intervening Event, in which case such change
shall require a new Change of Recommendation Notice and the Company shall be
required to comply again with the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.3(f)_.

(g) Except immediately prior to the entry into a Specified Agreement that is
entered into in compliance with the terms of this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_ and
_Section_ __ _ 8.1(e)_, the Company shall not waive the application of any
Takeover Law or similar Legal Requirement.

the registry agreements between ICANN, on the one hand, and the
Acquired Companies, on the other hand, with respect to top-level domains
owned or otherwise held by the Acquired Companies (collectively, the "
_Registry Agreements_ ").

 

(b) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this _Section_ __

Subsidiaries that appears in any filing made with, or written materials
submitted to, any Governmental Body or ICANN in connection with the Offer and
the Transactions and shall consider in good faith all comments reasonably
proposed by Parent or the Company, as the case may be. In addition, each party

authorized Representatives of the other party to have reasonable access
to and be consulted in connection with any proposed written material
communication to any Governmental Body or ICANN in connection with the
Transactions, and (B) as circumstances reasonably permit, consult with the
other party in advance of any meeting or conference with a Governmental Body
or ICANN relating to the Transactions and give the other party the opportunity

judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of
the Merger (any such action in (i) or (ii), an " _Antitrust Required Action_
"), in each case unless taking such Antitrust Required Action would reasonably
be expected to either (x) materially and adversely affect Parent taken
together with its Subsidiaries (excluding for the avoidance of doubt the
Company and its Subsidiaries) or (y) materially and adversely affect the
benefits to be obtained by virtue of the Transactions (any of the foregoing
having such an effect, an " _Antitrust Restraint_ "), _provided_ , that
nothing contained in this _Section_ __ _ 6.1(c)_ or elsewhere in this
Agreement shall require the sale, divestiture, license or other disposition of
any or all of the capital stock or other equity or voting interests, assets
(whether tangible or intangible), rights, products or businesses of Parent and
Purchaser (and their respective Affiliates, if applicable), on the one hand,
and the Company and its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, and _provided_
_further_ , that for purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 6.1(c)_, the terms
"materially" and "adversely" shall not be governed by the definition
of "Material Adverse Effect" contained in Exhibit A to this Agreement.

Section 6.2 _Indemnification of Officers and _ _D_ _irectors_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time until the six (6)-year anniversary of
the Closing, the Surviving Corporation shall (and if the Surviving
Corporation for any reason cannot, Parent shall) (i) indemnify and hold
harmless the individuals who at any time prior to the Effective Time were
directors or officers of any Acquired Company (collectively, the "
_Indemnified Parties_ ") against any costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees and disbursements), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
settlements, damages or liabilities in connection with actions or omissions
occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the Effective Time and
advance expenses with respect thereto, and (ii) honor and maintain in effect
for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time (A) all rights to
advancement of expenses and indemnification of each Indemnified Party, in each
case as provided, as applicable, in the certificates of incorporation and
bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) of the Acquired Companies, and
(B) all rights to advancement of expenses and indemnification in any

 



51  indemnification agreements between such Acquired Company and any Indemnified
Party entered into prior to the date hereof and a copy of which has been
provided to Parent. The certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation shall contain the provisions with respect to
indemnification and advancement of expenses set forth in the Company Charter
and the Company Bylaws, and any indemnification agreements between
the Company and any Indemnified Party shall survive the Merger and shall
continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms, and such
provisions and agreements shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified
for a period of six (6) years after the Closing Date in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of the Indemnified Parties, unless such
modification is required by applicable Legal Requirements or approved in
writing by the applicable Indemnified Party.

(b) Parent shall cause to be maintained in effect for not less than six (6)
years from the Effective Time the policies of directors and officers
liability insurance maintained by the Acquired Companies as of the date hereof
(or such other insurance policy with substantially similar coverage and with
terms and conditions that are not less advantageous in any material respect
than the Acquired Companys existing policies) for the Indemnified Parties and
any other employees, agents or other individuals otherwise covered by such
insurance policies prior to the Effective Time with respect to matters
occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the Effective Time
(including the Transactions); _provided_ , _however_ , that, in lieu of the
purchase of such insurance by Parent or the Surviving Corporation,
the Company may at its option prior to the Effective Time instruct its
authorized insurance broker to procure for the Company a fully prepaid, non-
cancellable six (6)-year run-off program for directors and officers
liability insurance providing the same coverage with respect to matters
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and obtained from the same or
similar insurance carriers that currently provide the Companys director and
officer liability insurance; _provided_ _that_ if the aggregate annual
premiums for such run-off program exceeds two hundred fifty percent (250%) of
the per annum rate of premium paid by the Company as of the date hereof for
their existing officers and directors liability insurance policies, then the
Company shall procure the maximum coverage that shall then be available at an
equivalent annual premium equal to two hundred fifty percent (250%) of such
rate; _provided_ _further_ , that the Companys procurement of such fully
prepaid run-off policy in accordance with this sentence shall be deemed to
satisfy in full the obligations of Parent and Surviving Corporation pursuant
to this _Section_ __ _ 6.2(b)_.

 

(c) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the
continuing or surviving Person of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfers or conveys all or a majority of its properties and assets to any
Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that
the successors, assigns and transferees of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation or their respective successors or assigns, as the case may be,
assume the obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.2_.

 

(d) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.2_ shall survive the acceptance
of Shares for payment pursuant to the Offer and the consummation of the
Merger and are (i) intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable
by, each of the Indemnified Parties and their successors, assigns and heirs
and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have by contract or
otherwise.

 



52  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (A) the obligations of
Parent and the Surviving Corporation or their respective successors shall be
subject to any limitation imposed by applicable Legal Requirements (including
any limitation on the Companys ability to indemnify its own directors and
officers and others), and (B) Parent shall have no obligation to maintain the
existence of the Surviving Corporation following the Effective Time.

Section 6.3 _Securityholder Litigation_. The Company shall promptly notify
Parent of any Legal Proceeding brought, or threatened, against the Company or
members of the Company Board with respect to any of the Transactions (other
than by Parent or Purchaser) and shall give Parent the opportunity to consult
with the Company with regard to, and participate in but not control, the
defense and settlement of any such litigation. Without limiting the foregoing,
but subject to _Section_ __ _ 6.1_, the Company shall give Parent the right
to review and comment on all material filings or responses to be made by the
Company in connection with any such Legal Proceeding against the Company, the
Company Board or any officer or director of an Acquired Company (or any
similar Legal Proceeding involving any of the Acquired Companies) relating to
the Transactions, and the right to consult on the settlement with respect to
such Legal Proceeding, and the Company shall in good faith take such comments
into account, and, no such settlement shall be agreed to without Parents
prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

Section 6.4 _Payoff of Indebtedness_. As Parent may require, no fewer than
five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to
Parent a draft payoff letter relating to the repayment of any indebtedness of
the Company and each other Acquired Company then outstanding (including
principal, interest, fees, expenses and other amounts payable) under the
Credit Agreement by and among the Company, the other loan parties thereto and
Silicon Valley Bank, and, unless otherwise directed by Parent in writing no
fewer than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, (a) immediately
prior to the Closing the Company shall cause the foregoing payoff letter to be
duly executed and delivered to Parent and (b) Purchaser shall repay, or cause
to be repaid, for the account of the Company and each other Acquired Company,
by wire transfer of immediately available funds, all such amounts owed under
the foregoing credit agreement, as directed by the administrative agent
thereunder, and terminate any liens and guarantees with respect to such
indebtedness.

Section 6.5 _Third Party Consents_. The Company shall use reasonable best
efforts, and shall cause each other Acquired Company to use reasonable best
efforts, to obtain waivers and consents from any and all third parties with
respect to each Contract listed in  _Part 6.5 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule_ ; _provided_ _that_ , in connection with obtaining such waivers and
consents, the Company shall not agree to any change to such Contracts that
would be materially adverse to the interest of the Company, its Subsidiaries
or, after the Merger, Parent or Surviving Corporation, in each case without
the prior written consent of Parent.

 

Section 6.6 _Publicity_. Parent and the Company shall consult with each other
and provide each other the reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon
any press release or other public announcement with respect to the Offer, the
Merger or any of the other Transactions before issuing any such press release
or public announcement, and such party shall consider such comments in good
faith; _provided_ _that_ the foregoing shall not apply to: (a) any press
release or public announcement made with respect to the Transactions that is
not inconsistent with, and not 

 



53  more expansive in any material respect than, any prior press release or
public announcement validly made in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 6.6_;
(b) any press release or public announcement to enforce a partys rights or
remedies under this Agreement; and (c) communications permitted by the Company
or Company Board pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 5.3_, including any release or
announcement made with respect to an Superior Offer or Adverse Change
Recommendation, or communications by Parent or Purchaser directly in response
to an Adverse Change Recommendation. The press release announcing this
Agreement and the Transactions shall be jointly agreed by Parent and the
Company.

Section 6.7 _Takeover Laws_. If any Takeover Law becomes, or purports to
be, applicable to the Transactions, then the Company and the Company Board
shall grant such approvals and take all reasonable actions as are necessary so
that the Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the
terms and conditions contemplated hereby and otherwise act to mitigate the
effect of any Takeover Law on any of the Transactions.

Section 6.8  _Notification of Changes_. Prior to the Effective Time, each of
the Company and Parent shall give prompt notice to the other (and shall
subsequently keep the other informed of any material developments related to
such notice) upon its becoming aware of the occurrence or existence of any
change, event, occurrence, fact, circumstance, effect or other matter that (a)
(i) with respect to the Company, would result in a Material Adverse Effect and
(ii) with respect to Parent or Purchaser, had or would reasonably be expected
to have any material adverse effect with respect to the ability of Parent or
Purchaser to consummate the Transactions, or (b) is reasonably likely to
result in any of the conditions set forth in  _Article 7_ or in _Annex I_ not
being able to be satisfied prior to the End Date; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.8_ shall
not cure any breach of any representations or warranties requiring disclosure
of such matter prior to the date of this Agreement or otherwise limit or
affect the remedies available hereunder to any party hereto; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that, so long as the party entitled to notice was not prejudiced
by such failure, the failure to deliver any notice pursuant to this _Section_
__ _ 6.8_ shall not be deemed to be a failure to satisfy a closing condition
unless the underlying facts had caused such condition not to be satisfied.

Section 6.9 _Section_ __ _ 16 Matters_. The Company Board shall, to the
extent necessary, take appropriate action, prior to or as of the Offer
Acceptance Time, to approve, for purposes of Section 16(b) of the Exchange
Act, the disposition of Shares (including derivative securities with respect
to Shares) in the Offer and the Merger by applicable individuals.

by the Surviving Corporation of the Shares from NASDAQ and the deregistration
of the Shares under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time, and in any event no more than ten (10) days after the Closing

54 Section 6.11 _Rule 14d-_ _10_. Prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, the
Company (acting through the Compensation Committee of the Company Board)
shall take all such steps as may be required to cause to be exempt under Rule

date hereof by the Company, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates with
current or future directors, officers or employees of the Company, Surviving
Corporation and their Affiliates and to ensure that any such arrangements
fall within the safe harbor provisions of such rule.

Company Board, or any applicable committee thereof, shall take all actions
necessary or required under the applicable documents evidencing each Company

and Company Restricted Stock Unit Awards as set forth in  _Section_ __ _

and the Company Board, or any applicable committee thereof, shall take all
actions necessary or required under the applicable plan and Legal Requirements

Section 6.13 _Employee Benefits_.

(a) The Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) comply with employment
Contracts that were in effect as of the Effective Time for employees of the
Acquired Companies that become Continuing Employees (as defined below). For a
period of six (6) months following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) maintain or provide for the benefit of
each employee of the Acquired Companies who continues his or her
employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of the
Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time (each a "Continuing Employee")
compensation and benefit plans and arrangements (other than the opportunity to
participate in equity-based benefits and individual employment agreements)
that are, at Parents discretion, either (i) at levels that are no less
favorable, in the aggregate, than those in effect for such Continuing Employee
at the Acquired Companies on the date of this Agreement, or (ii) at levels
that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, than those provided to similarly
situated employees of the Parent. Such compensation and benefit plans and
arrangements shall be maintained, at Parents discretion, by either (1) the
Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, (2) Parent or any of its
ERISA Affiliates, or (3) a combination of (1) and (2).

 

(b) The Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) cause to be granted to
such Continuing Employee credit for all service with the Acquired Companies
and its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time for purposes of eligibility
and vesting in the benefit and compensation arrangements determined under
subsection (a) above. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Surviving Corporation will use commercially reasonable efforts
to ensure that each Continuing Employee will be immediately eligible to
participate, without any 

 



55  waiting period, in the compensation and benefit arrangements determined
under subsection (a) above. For purposes of each benefit plan providing
medical, dental, pharmaceutical, vision, disability or other welfare benefits
to any Continuing Employee, the Surviving Corporation will use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause all waiting periods, pre-existing conditions or
limitations, physical examination requirements, evidence of insurability
requirements and actively-at-work or similar requirements of such benefit plan
to be waived for such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents.
The Surviving Corporation shall further use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause any eligible expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee and his or
her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the old benefit
plans ending on the date that such Continuing Employees participation in the
corresponding new benefit plan begins to be given full credit pursuant to such
new benefit plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, co-payments,
coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such
Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan
year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such new benefit plan
determined pursuant to subsection (a) above. Any vacation or paid time off
accrued but unused by a Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time will be credited to such Continuing Employee following the
Effective Time.

(c) Between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the Acquired
Companies shall use reasonable best efforts to assist Parent in entering into
Parents standard "on-boarding" documents with each of the Continuing
Employees, which documents shall be effective at the Effective Time and shall
constitute (i) at-will agreements, (ii) proprietary information and inventions
agreements, (iii) mutual agreements to arbitrate claims, and (iv) background
check agreements, copies of which have previously been provided to the
Company.

 

(d) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to (i) terminate each Employee Plan that is intended to
constitute a 401(k) plan of any Acquired Company (each, a " _Company 401(k)
Plan_ ") effective no later than the day immediately preceding the Closing
Date, (ii) adopt any and all amendments to each Company 401(k) Plan as may be
necessary to ensure compliance with all applicable requirements of the Code
(including all qualification requirements), and (iii) take such other actions
in connection with the termination of any Company 401(k) Plan as Parent
may reasonably request, unless Parent notifies the Company in writing at
least five (5) days prior to the Closing Date that termination of such Company
401(k) Plan is not necessary. Unless Parent provides the notice described in
the preceding sentence to the Company, the Company shall, prior to the
Closing Date, provide Parent with evidence reasonably satisfactory to Parent
that (x) each Company 401(k) Plan has been terminated effective no later than
the day before the Closing Date pursuant to resolutions of the Company Board
or the board of directors (or equivalent governing body) of the sponsoring
Subsidiary, as applicable, (y) each Company 401(k) Plan has been amended as
described above, and (z) all other actions requested by Parent have been
completed (and the form and substance of the resolutions and amendments
referred to herein shall be subject to the prior review and approval of
Parent).

 

(e) Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 6.13_ or elsewhere in this Agreement,
whether express or implied, is intended nor shall be construed to (i) be
treated as an amendment to any particular Employee Plan, (ii) prevent Parent
from amending or terminating any of its benefit plans in accordance with their
terms at any time, (iii) create a right in any employee to 

 



56  employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any other Subsidiary of
the Surviving Corporation and the employment of each Continuing Employee shall
be "at will" employment or (iv) create any third-party beneficiary rights in
any employee of the Acquired Companies or the Surviving Corporation, any
beneficiary or dependent thereof, or any collective bargaining representative
thereof, with respect to the compensation, terms and conditions of employment
or benefits that may be provided to any Continuing Employee by Parent,
Surviving Corporation or any Acquired Company or under any benefit plan which
Parent, any Acquired Company or the Surviving Corporation may maintain.

(f) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary
to effectuate this  _Section_ __ _ 6.13_ (including providing any required
notices and obtaining any required consents).

(g) The Company shall provide Parent with drafts of, and a reasonable
opportunity to comment upon, all resolutions and other written actions as may
be required to effectuate the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.13_. For
purpose of the foregoing sentence, a reasonable opportunity shall mean at
least five (5) Business Days prior to the adoption of the resolution or taking
of the action.

 

Section 6.14 _Financing Activities_.

 

(a) Upon request of Parent or Purchaser, the Company shall provide reasonable
cooperation and assistance to Parent and Purchaser in connection with the
arrangement of the Financing as may be reasonably requested by Parent or
Purchaser and that is necessary, customary or advisable in connection with
Parents and Purchasers efforts to obtain the Financing ( _provided_  
_that_ such requested cooperation and assistance does not unreasonably
interfere with the ongoing business of the Company), including the following
actions by the Company: (i) participating in a reasonable number (taking into
account the nature of the Financing) of meetings with (including using its
reasonable best efforts to participate in a reasonable number of one-on-one
meetings with) the Financing Sources and any other prospective lenders and
purchasers of the Financing (and using its reasonable best efforts to cause
the members of senior management and Representatives of the Company to
participate in such meetings), and due diligence sessions, in each case in
connection with all or any portion of the Financing; (ii) assisting Parent and
Purchaser and their Financing Sources in the preparation of customary
presentations, offering documents, bank information memoranda, financial
information as reasonably requested by Parent to prepare business projections
of the Surviving Corporation, lender and investor presentations, prospectuses
and other similar customary materials to the extent such information is of the
type and form customarily included in bank information memoranda; (iii)
cooperating reasonably with the Financing Sources customary due diligence;
(iv) assisting Parent with the preparation of (but not execution of) any
guarantee, pledge and security documents reasonably requested by Parent or
the Financing Sources and otherwise reasonably facilitating the provisions of
guarantees, pledging of collateral and granting of security interests (it
being understood that such documents will not take effect until the Closing);
(v) requesting its independent accountants to provide reasonable assistance to
Parent and Purchaser consistent with their customary practice (including to
provide consent to Parent and Purchaser to prepare and use their audit
reports relating to the Company on customary terms in connection with the
Financing); (vi) cooperating reasonably in connection with the pay-off of 

 



57  existing indebtedness and the release of related encumbrances, and Parents
and Purchasers efforts to effect the replacement or backing of any
outstanding letter of credit maintained or provided by the Company at and
effective as of the Closing; (vii) at least five (5) Business Days prior to
the Closing, providing all documentation and other information required by
regulatory authorities under applicable "know your customer" and anti-money
laundering rules and regulations, including the USA PATRIOT Act, that has been
requested in writing at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing; and
(viii) cooperating reasonably with Parent to cause the Companys Subsidiary
DMIH Limited to transfer up to Fifteen Million Dollars ($15,000,000) to the
Company as of the Closing Date in a manner that minimizes the incurrence of
any applicable Taxes and the utilization of Tax assets or attributes in
accordance with applicable Legal Requirements. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing in this Agreement will require the Acquired Companies to (A) waive or
amend any terms of this Agreement or agree to pay any fees or reimburse any
expenses prior to the Effective Time, (B) enter into any definitive agreement
that will be effective prior to the Effective Time, (C) give any indemnities
that are effective prior to the Effective Time, or (D) provide
any information the disclosure of which is prohibited or restricted under
Applicable Law, is legally privileged or would result in a violation or breach
of, or default under, any agreement to which an Acquired Company is a party.
In addition, (1) no action, liability or obligation of any Acquired Company
or any of their respective Representatives pursuant to any certificate,
agreement, arrangement, document or instrument relating to the Financing will
be effective until the Effective Time, and none of the Acquired Companies
will be required to take any action pursuant to any certificate, agreement,
arrangement, document or instrument (including being an issuer or other
obligor with respect to the Financing) that is not contingent on the
occurrence of the Closing or that must be effective prior to the Effective
Time, and (2) any bank information memoranda or offering prospectuses or
memoranda required in relation to the Financing will contain disclosure
and financial statements reflecting the Surviving Corporation or its
Subsidiaries as an obligor. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, nothing in this Agreement will require (A) any officer or
Representative of the Company to execute or deliver any Definitive Debt
Documents or any other related documents, certificates or opinions in
connection with the Financing, (B) any officer or Representative of any of the
Companys Subsidiaries to execute or deliver any Definitive Debt Documents or
any other related documents, certificates or opinions in connection with the
Financing, or take any other action in connection with the Financing that
could reasonably be expected to result in personal liability to such officer
or Representative, (C) the members of the Company Board as of the date hereof
to approve the Financing or any alternative financing or Definitive Debt
Documents related thereto, or (D) any of the Acquired Companies to take
any actions that become effective prior to the Effective Time with respect to
their respective cash or other investment assets, including the deposit of
cash with the Paying Agent (or any actions necessary to fund such deposit), if
such actions would result in any material Taxes or losses attributable to the
utilization by any of the Acquired Companies of any Tax assets or attributes
(provided that the restriction set forth in this clause (D) shall not apply to
the extent Parent agrees to indemnify the Acquired Companies in full for such
Taxes and losses in the event that the Closing Date does not occur).

(b) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate and obtain the Financing on the terms and
conditions described in the Financing Letters, including using reasonable
best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Financing Letters and, if

 



58  entered into prior to the Closing, the definitive documentation with respect
to the Financing contemplated by the Financing Letters (the " _Definitive Debt
Documents_ "), (ii) comply with its obligations under the Financing Letters
and the Definitive Debt Documents, (iii) negotiate, execute and deliver the
Definitive Debt Documents on terms and conditions (including flex provisions)
contemplated by the Financing Letters, (iv) satisfy on a timely basis all
conditions to funding that are applicable to Parent and Purchaser in the
Financing Letters and Definitive Debt Documents, (v) consummate the Financing
contemplated by the Financing Letters and Definitive Debt Documents and (vi)
enforce its rights under the Financing Letters and Definitive Debt Documents
in the event of a breach by the Financing Sources that impedes, prevents or
unreasonably delays the Closing. Purchaser shall not agree to any amendment
or modification of the Financing Letters after the date of this Agreement that
would reasonably be expected to impede, prevent, unreasonably delay or
otherwise adversely affect Purchasers ability to perform its obligations
under this Agreement or to enforce its rights against the other parties to
the Financing or the Definitive Debt Documents. In the event that all
conditions to the Financing have been satisfied, Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Financing Sources to fund such Financing
in order to close the Merger. In furtherance and not in limitation of the
foregoing, in the event that any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable
on the terms and conditions (including the flex provisions) of the Financing
Letters, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain alternative
financing from alternative sources on terms and conditions not materially less
favorable in the aggregate to Parent, Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation
than those set forth in the Financing Letters and in an amount that is
adequate (taking into account all other financial resources of Parent and
Purchaser, including cash on hand and marketable securities of Parent,
Purchaser, the Company and their respective Subsidiaries on the Closing Date)
to fund the Required Amount (and in such an event, any reference herein to
"Financing Letters" or "Definitive Debt Documents" shall be deemed to include
such alternative financing to the extent then in effect).

(c) Parent shall (i) keep the Company fully informed on a reasonably
current basis of the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing, and (ii)
provide the Company with copies of all executed Definitive Debt Documents.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub shall
promptly upon becoming aware thereof notify the Company (A) of any breach (or
threatened breach) or default (or any event or circumstance that, with notice
or lapse of time or both, could reasonably be expected to give rise to any
breach or default) by any party to the Financing Letters or Definitive Debt
Documents, (B) of any material dispute or disagreement between or among any
parties to a Financing Letter or the Definitive Debt Documents, and (C) if for
any reason Parent or Purchaser at any time believes that it will not be able
to obtain all or any portion of the Financing on the terms, in the manner or
from the sources contemplated by the Financing Letters (subject to the flex
provisions contained therein) or Definitive Debt Documents.

(d) Parent agrees to (i) indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Acquired
Companies and their Representatives from and against any loss, damages,
claim, cost, liability, obligation or expense suffered or incurred in
connection with the arrangement of the Financing or any alternative financing
and any information provided in connection therewith, except (A) historical
information relating thereto or any other information furnished in writing by
or on behalf of the Acquired Companies for use therein and (B) to the extent
arising from the willful misconduct, gross negligence, fraud or intentional
misrepresentation of the Acquired Companies and (ii) promptly, upon request of
the Company, reimburse the Acquired Companies for all reasonable out-of-
pocket costs incurred by the Acquired Companies in connection with this
Section 6.14. The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.14(d)_ shall survive
the termination of this Agreement.

 



59 Section 6.15 _No Financing Condition_ (a) . Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, including _Section_ __ _ 6.14_, Parent and
Purchaser each acknowledge and agree that obtaining the Financing is not a
condition to the consummation of the Offer or the Merger. In the event that
the Financing has not been obtained, Parent and Purchaser will each continue
to be obligated, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, including the satisfaction of the Minimum Condition
and the satisfaction or waiver by Purchaser of the other Offer Conditions, to
consummate the Offer, and Parent and Purchaser will each continue to be
obligated, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth
in Section 7.1, to consummate the Merger.

 

ARTICLE 7

Conditions Precedent to The Merger

Section 7.1 _Conditions_. The obligations of the parties to effect the Merger
are subject to the satisfaction, at or prior to the Closing, of each of the
following conditions, any and all of which may be waived in whole or part, to
the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, by a writing signed by
each of Parent and the Company:

 

(a) _No Restraints_. No temporary restraining order, preliminary or permanent
injunction or other order preventing the consummation of the Merger shall
have been issued by any Governmental Body of competent jurisdiction and remain

(b) _Consummation_ _of Offer_. Purchaser (or Parent on Purchasers behalf)
shall have accepted for payment all of the Shares validly tendered pursuant
to the Offer and not validly withdrawn.

Section 7.2 _Frustration of Conditions_. None of the Company, Parent or
Purchaser may rely on the failure of any condition set forth in _Section_ __ _

in good faith or use reasonable best efforts to consummate the Transactions,
including as required by and subject to _Section_ __ _ 6.1_.

ARTICLE 8

Section 8.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated prior to the

60 (b) by either Parent or the Company by written notice to the other if a court
of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Body has issued a final and

the effect of permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the
acceptance for payment of Shares pursuant to the Offer or the Merger or
making consummation of the Offer or the Merger illegal;

Acceptance Time, if, whether or not permitted to do so, (i) the Company, the
Company Board or any committee thereof has made an Adverse Change

any binding agreement in principle, letter of intent, term sheet, option
Contract or similar Contract with any third party that contemplates or
requires an Acquisition Transaction (in each case other than an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement), (iii) the Company Board fails to
publicly reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation within the earlier of three
(3) Business Days prior to the then-scheduled Expiration Date or ten (10)
Business Days after receipt of a written request by Parent to provide such
reaffirmation following the commencement by a third party of a tender offer or
exchange offer related to the Shares or public disclosure of an Acquisition
Proposal other than a commenced tender offer or commenced exchange offer (
_provided_ _that_ , if any such request is made by Parent within three (3)
Business Days of the then-scheduled Expiration Date, as promptly as
practicable), or (iv) within ten (10) Business Days following the
commencement by a third party of any tender offer or exchange offer related to

pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 8.1(d)_ if a breach by such party of any
provision of this Agreement shall have proximately caused the failure of the
Offer Acceptance Time to have so occurred;

 

(e) by the Company by written notice to Parent at any time prior to the Offer
Acceptance Time, to accept a Superior Offer and enter into the Specified

(f) by Parent by written notice to the Company at any time prior to the Offer
Acceptance Time, if a breach of any representations or warranties or failure
to perform any covenant or obligation contained in this Agreement on the part
of the Company shall have occurred that would cause a failure of the
conditions in _Annex I_ to be satisfied; _provided_ , _however_ , that, for
purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 8.1(f)_, if such a breach by its nature is
curable and can be cured by the Company within the earlier of the End Date and
thirty (30) days of the date Parent gives the Company notice of such breach
and the Company is continuing to use reasonable best efforts to cure such
breach, then Parent may not terminate this Agreement under this _Section_ __ _
8.1(f)_ on account of such breach unless such breach remains uncured upon the
earlier of the End Date and the expiration of such thirty (30)-day period; or

 



61 (g) by the Company by written notice to Parent at any time prior to the Offer
Acceptance Time, if a breach of any representations or warranties has had or
would reasonably be expected to have a material and adverse effect on Parents

uncured upon the earlier of the End Date and the expiration of such
thirty (30)-day period.

Section 8.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement as provided in _Section_ __ _ 8.1_, this Agreement shall be of no
further force or effect; _provided_ , _however_ , that: (a) the final sentence
of _Section_ __ _ 5.1(a)_,  _Section_ __ _ 6.14(d)_, this _Section_ __ _
8.2_, _Section_ __ _ 8.3_ and _Article 9_ shall survive the termination of
this Agreement and shall remain in full force and effect; (b)
the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement
and shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms; and
(c) the termination of this Agreement shall not relieve any party from any
liability for any willful and intentional breach prior to the date of
termination (which, with regard to clause (c), the parties acknowledge and
agree shall not be limited to reimbursement of expenses or out-of-pocket
costs, and may include the benefit of the bargain lost by (x) the Company or
its stockholders (taking into consideration relevant matters, including the
total amount payable to such stockholders under this Agreement and the time
value of money), which shall be deemed in such event to be damages to the
Company, or (y) Parent, as applicable).

 

Section 8.3 _Expenses; Termination Fee_.

 

(a) Except as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.3(b)_, all fees and expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions shall be paid
by the party incurring such expenses, whether or not the Offer and the Merger
are consummated.

(b) If (i) (A) this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(d)_, (B) after the date of this Agreement and prior to
the time of the termination of this Agreement an Acquisition Proposal
shall have been publicly made, commenced or submitted or announced and not
withdrawn at least five (5) Business Days prior to termination, and (C) the
Company consummates or signs a definitive agreement with respect to such
Acquisition Transaction within twelve (12) months after such termination,
(ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section_ __ _
8.1(c)_, or (iii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 8.1(e)_, then the Company shall pay to Parent, at the time
specified in the next sentence, a nonrefundable fee in the amount equal to the
Termination Fee; _provided_ _that_ , solely for purposes of  _Section_ __ _
8.3(b)_, all references to "fifteen percent (15%)" or to "eighty-five percent
(85%)" in the definition of Acquisition Transaction shall be deemed to be
references to "fifty 

 



62  percent (50%)." Any Termination Fee shall be paid: (x) in the case of clause
(i) of the preceding sentence of this _Section_ __ _ 8.3(b)_,
substantially concurrently with the consummation of, or execution of a
definitive agreement with respect to, an Acquisition Transaction, (y) in the
case of clause (ii) of the preceding sentence of this _Section_ __ _ 8.3(b)_,
within two (2) Business Days following termination of this Agreement, and (z)
in the case of clause (iii) of the preceding sentence of this _Section_ __ _
8.3(b)_, concurrently with a termination of this Agreement under  _Section_
__ _ 8.1(e)_.

(c) Any Termination Fee due under this _Section_ __ _ 8.3_ shall be paid
by the Company by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated in writing by Parent. For the avoidance of doubt, the Termination
Fee shall be payable only once and not in duplication even though the
Termination Fee may be payable under one or more provisions hereof. The
Company and Parent acknowledge and agree that (i) the agreements contained in
this _Section_ __ _ 8.3_ are an integral part of the Transactions, (ii) the
Termination Fee is not a penalty, but are liquidated damages, in a reasonable
amount that shall compensate Parent in the circumstances in which it is
payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone
while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the Transactions, which amount would
otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision, and (iii) without these
agreements, Parent would not have entered into this Agreement. Accordingly,
if the Company fails promptly to pay any amount due pursuant to this _Section_
__ _ 8.3_, and, to obtain such payment, Parent commences a Legal Proceeding
that results in a judgment against the Company for the Termination Fee, the
Company shall pay to Parent its additional costs and expenses (including
attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such Legal Proceeding,
together with interest on the amount of the Termination Fee, from the
date such payment was required until the date of payment at the prime rate,
as published in _The Wall Street Journal_ on the date such payment was
required to be made. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, upon payment of the Termination Fee as required pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 8.3_, and subject to the requirement that the Acquired
Companies bear their own fees and expenses under Section 8.3(a), none of the
Company or any of its Representatives shall have any further liability or
obligations to Parent, Purchaser or their Subsidiaries relating to or arising
out of this Agreement or the Transactions.

with all covenants and obligations that the Company is required to comply with
or to perform under the Agreement prior to the Expiration Date;

any of its Affiliates effectively to exercise full rights of ownership of the
