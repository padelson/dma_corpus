result of a development or change in circumstances that occurs or arises after

ARTICLE III

  

 _CONVERSION OF SECURITIES; TREATMENT OF COMPANY OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED STOCK_

  

  

Section 3.1. _Conversion of Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent,
Merger Sub or any holder of any share of capital stock of the Company, Parent
or Merger Sub:

  

  

(a) _Common Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, par value $1.00
per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into and become one (1) validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $1.00 per share,
of the Surviving Corporation.

  

  

(b) _Cancellation of Certain Shares_. All Shares that are issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and owned by any of
Parent, Merger Sub and any other Subsidiary of Parent, including each Share
contributed to Parent by the Rollover Investors in accordance with the Support
Agreement and each Share contributed to Parent by the Additional Rollover
Stockholders in accordance with the Additional Rollover Agreements (if any),
and all Shares held in the treasury of the Company or owned by any Company
Subsidiary shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

 

  

    

(c) _Conversion of Shares_. Each Share issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than any Shares to be cancelled in
accordance with Section 3.1(b) and any Dissenting Shares) shall be converted
into the right to receive $19.50 in cash, payable to the holder thereof in
accordance with this Article III without interest (the " _Merger
Consideration_ "), upon surrender and exchange of a Certificate. All such
Shares when so converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
certificate (a " _Certificate_ ") that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented any such outstanding Share (other than any Dissenting Share) shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
Merger Consideration therefor upon the surrender of such Certificate in
accordance with Section 3.2.

  

  

(d) _Certain Adjustments_. Without limiting the other provisions of this
Agreement, if, at any time during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the number of Shares shall
occur as a result of a reclassification, recapitalization, stock split
(including a reverse stock split), or combination, exchange or readjustment of
shares, or any stock dividend or stock distribution (including any dividend or
distribution of securities convertible into or exchangeable for Shares) with a
record date during such period, then the Merger Consideration shall be
equitably adjusted to reflect such change.

  

  

(e) _Rollover_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, it is contemplated
that the Rollover Investors shall contribute the Shares owned by them to
Parent pursuant to the Support Agreement and the Additional Rollover
Stockholders shall contribute the Shares owned by them to Parent pursuant to
the Additional Rollover Agreements (if any), as the case may be. Subsequent to
the receipt by Parent of the Shares from the Rollover Investors or the
Additional Rollover Stockholders (if any), such Shares shall be automatically
cancelled, by virtue of the Merger, in accordance with Section 3.1(b).

  

    

(f) _Additional Rollover Shares_. From the date of this Agreement until the
date that is two (2) Business Days prior to the date of the Stockholders'
Meeting, Parent may from time to time enter into one or more rollover
agreements, on the same terms and conditions as the terms and conditions set
forth in the Support Agreement (other than any terms and conditions set forth
in Sections 9, 10 and 16 or as otherwise agreed by the Company (the "
_Additional Rollover Agreements_ "), pursuant to which no more than fifty (50)
employees of the Company as agreed between Parent and the Company (the "
_Additional Rollover Stockholders_ ") agree to contribute to Parent, subject
to the terms and conditions therein, the number of Shares set forth in such
agreements.

  

  

Section 3.2. _Exchange of Certificates_.

  

  

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank
or trust company (the " _Paying Agent_ ") reasonably acceptable to the Company
to act as paying agent for the payment of the Merger Consideration in
accordance with this Article III, pursuant to an agreement providing for the
matters set forth in this Section 3.2 and such other matters as may be
appropriate and the terms of which shall be mutually acceptable to Parent and
the Company. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or cause
to be deposited with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of holders of
Certificates, funds sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration
payable upon conversion of Shares pursuant to Section 3.1(c). For purposes of
determining the aggregate amount to be so deposited, Parent shall assume that
no stockholder of the Company shall perfect any right to appraisal of his, her
or its Shares. If for any reason (including losses) such funds are inadequate
to pay all amounts to which holders of Shares shall be entitled under Section
3.1(c), Parent shall promptly deposit or cause the Surviving Corporation
promptly to deposit additional cash with the Paying Agent sufficient to make
all payments required under this Agreement, and Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall in any event be liable for payment thereof. Such funds shall
not be used for any purpose other than as set forth in this Article III, and
shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation solely in (i) direct obligations of the United States of America,
(ii) obligations for which the full faith and credit of the United States of
America is pledged to provide for the payment of principal and interest, (iii)
commercial paper rated at least P-1 by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or A-1
by Standard and Poor's Corporation, (iv) money market funds substantially all
assets of which consist of cash and the foregoing securities or obligations or
(v) a combination of any of the foregoing. Any net profit resulting from, or
interest or income produced by, such investments will be payable to the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, as Parent directs.

  

  

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, but in any event
not more than three (3) Business Days after the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Paying Agent to mail or otherwise deliver to each holder of record
of a Certificate representing Shares which were converted pursuant to Section
3.1(c), (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall
be effected, and risk of loss and title to each Certificate shall pass, only
upon delivery of such Certificate to the Paying Agent and shall be in such
form and have such other customary provisions as Parent and the Company shall
mutually agree) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
each such Certificate in exchange for payment of the total amount of Merger
Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this
Agreement. Upon proper surrender of a Certificate to the Paying Agent,
together with the related letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other
documents as may be reasonably required pursuant to such instructions, the
holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor
the Merger Consideration (subject to subsection (e) of this Section 3.2) for
each Share formerly represented by such Certificate, to be mailed within five
(5) Business Days of receipt of such Certificate and letter of transmittal by
the Paying Agent, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. No interest shall be paid or accrue on the cash payable upon
surrender of any Certificate. If payment of any Merger Consideration is to be
made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered
Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition of payment of such Merger
Consideration that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed
or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person
requesting such payment shall have paid to the Paying Agent in advance any Tax
required by reason of the payment of such Merger Consideration to a Person
other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or shall have
established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax
either has otherwise been paid or is not applicable. Subject to Section 3.3,
until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.2, each Certificate
representing one or more Shares that were converted pursuant to Section 3.1(c)
shall at all times after the Effective Time represent only the right to
receive, in cash, the Merger Consideration (subject to subsection (e) of this
Section 3.2) for each Share formerly represented by such Certificate as
contemplated by this Section 3.2.

  

    

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares_. After the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and
there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on the records
of the Company. After the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates
evidencing ownership of Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares, except as
otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law and, without limitation of
the foregoing, subject to the Surviving Corporation's obligation to pay any
and all dividends with a record date prior to the Effective Time which may
have been declared by the Company on Shares prior to the Effective Time. If,
after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided
in this Article III.

  

  

(d) _Termination of Fund; No Liability_. At any time following eighteen (18)
months after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled
to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest
received with respect thereto) which had been made available to the Paying
Agent for the payment of Merger Consideration and which have not been
disbursed to holders of Certificates, and thereafter such holders shall be
entitled (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Law) to look
only to Parent and the Surviving Corporation, which shall thereafter act as
the Paying Agent, as general creditors thereof with respect to the payment of
any Merger Consideration that may be payable upon surrender of any
Certificate, as determined pursuant to this Agreement. Notwithstanding any
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, neither Parent, the Surviving
Corporation nor the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of a
Certificate for Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant
to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

  

  

 

(e) _Withholding Taxes_. The right of any Person to receive payment or
consideration payable upon surrender of a Certificate pursuant to the Merger
will be subject to any applicable requirements with respect to the withholding
of any Tax. To the extent amounts are so withheld by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent, (i) such withheld amounts shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the
Certificate(s) in respect of which the deduction and withholding was made and
(ii) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent, as the case may be, to promptly pay over such withheld amounts to the
appropriate Governmental Entity.

  

  

(f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact, reasonably acceptable to the Paying Agent, by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if requested by Parent
or the Surviving Corporation, the delivery by such Person of a bond (in such
amount as Parent or the Surviving Corporation may reasonably direct) as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against the Paying Agent, Parent
or the Surviving Corporation on account of the alleged loss, theft or
destruction of such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the total amount of Merger
Consideration deliverable in respect thereof as determined in accordance with
this Article III.

 

  

    

Section 3.3. _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, Shares which are issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than Shares to be cancelled pursuant to
Section 3.1(b)) and which are held by holders who shall have complied with the
provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not
be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and holders
of such Dissenting Shares shall only be entitled to receive payment of the
fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of
Section 262 of the DGCL, unless and until the applicable holder fails to
comply with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL or effectively withdraws
or otherwise loses such holder's rights to receive payment of the fair value
of such holder's Shares under Section 262 of the DGCL or if a court of
competent jurisdiction determines that such holder is not entitled to the
appraisal provided by Section 262 of the DGCL. If, after the Effective Time,
any such holder fails to comply with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL
or effectively withdraws or loses such right or if a court of competent
jurisdiction determines that such holder is not entitled to the appraisal
provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, such Dissenting Shares shall thereupon be
deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration, without interest thereon. The Company shall give
Parent prompt written notice of any written demands for appraisal of Shares
received by the Company under Section 262 of the DGCL, any withdrawal of any
such demand and any other written demand, notice or instrument delivered to
the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to DGCL that relates to such
demand, and shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in negotiations
and Proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall not, except
with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any
such demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands.

  

  

Section 3.4. _Treatment and Satisfaction of Company Options and Unvested
Restricted Stock_.

  

  

(a) _Stock Options_. Each outstanding option (" _Company Option_ ") to buy
Shares (other than a Co-Invest Award) granted under any of the Company Equity
Plans to any individual who is or was an employee, officer or director of, or
consultant or advisor to, the Company, whether or not such Company Option is
then exercisable and vested, shall be cancelled and, in consideration of such
cancellation, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay
to the holder of such Company Option or the agent designated by the holder,
whether or not such Company Option is then exercisable and vested, an amount
in cash (without interest) in respect thereof equal to the product of (x) the
excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per Share
of such Company Option and (y) the number of Shares subject thereto (such
payment, if any, to be net of applicable withholding and excise taxes). The
Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to) make all payments in accordance with this Section 3.4(a) promptly after
(and in any event on the same Business Day as) the Effective Time. All Company
Options with a per Share exercise price greater than the Merger Consideration
will be cancelled at the Effective Time and the holders of such Company
Options will not have any right to receive any consideration in respect
thereof.

  

  

(b) _Restricted Stock and RSUs_. Restricted stock (" _Restricted Stock_ ") and
restricted stock units (" _RSUs_ ") (other than Co-Invest Awards) granted
under any of the Company Equity Plans to any individual who is or was an
employee, officer or director of, or consultant or advisor to the Company that
are not vested immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be fully vested
and free of any forfeiture restrictions immediately prior to the Effective
Time, whereupon the Shares represented thereby (net of any Shares withheld to
cover applicable withholding and excise taxes) shall be converted into the
right to receive in cash the Merger Consideration per Share in accordance with
Section 3.1(c). For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of the immediately
preceding sentence with respect to performance-based Restricted Stock and RSUs
as to which the performance period has not yet been completed, the number of
Shares represented thereby shall be equal to the number of Shares that the
holder would have been eligible to receive had performance criteria applicable
thereto been achieved at target levels.

  

    

(c) _Co-Investment Awards_. Section 3.4(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule
designates the percentage and name of the applicable individual, as such
schedule may be updated from time to time by Parent with the written consent
of the applicable individual, of each tranche of Company Options, Restricted
Stock and/or RSUs granted under any of the Company Equity Plans to a listed
employee award holder and any Additional Rollover Stockholders (subject to the
written consent of the applicable individual) that shall not be treated in
accordance with Sections 3.4(a) and (b) of this Agreement, which percentage
shall be rounded up to the nearest round number (collectively, " _Co-Invest
Awards_ ") and may be updated from time to time by Parent with the written
consent of the applicable individual to identify the specific Company Options,
Restricted Stock and/or RSUs that will be Co-Invest Awards. As soon as
reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company (or
any committee thereof administering the Company Equity Plans), shall adopt
such resolutions or take such other actions as may be required to provide
that, at the Effective Time, each Co-Invest Award that is outstanding and
unexercised, if applicable, immediately prior to the Effective Time shall as
of the Effective Time, except as otherwise agreed by an individual employee
award holder and Parent, become fully vested and free of any forfeiture
restrictions, if applicable, and cease to represent a right to Shares of the
Company and be eligible to be assumed by Parent. Parent shall assume all such
Co-Invest Awards as of the Effective Time and convert each such Co-Invest
Award as of the Effective Time into Parent awards. It is intended that such
conversion satisfy the requirements of Section 409A of the Code. After the
Effective Time, the Co-Invest Awards will otherwise continue to be subject to
the same terms and conditions as were applicable to them immediately prior to
the effective time and such additional terms and conditions as the Surviving
Corporation and the holders of the Co-Invest Awards may agree in writing and
as are permitted under the requirements of Section 409A of the Code.

  

  

Section 3.5. _Tax Effect_. The parties agree that (a) the reverse subsidiary
merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company pursuant to this Article III
shall be treated for Tax purposes as the acquisition of Shares by Parent for
cash, and (b) the conversion or exchange of Shares held by the Rollover
Investors for or into shares in Parent shall be treated as a contribution of
such Shares pursuant to Section 721 of the Code.

  

  

ARTICLE IV

  

 _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY_

  

  

Except (i) as set forth in the corresponding section or subsection of the
disclosure schedule delivered by the Company to Parent and Merger Sub
simultaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement (the "
_Company Disclosure Schedule_ "), and (ii) as disclosed in the SEC Documents
filed or furnished prior to the date of this Agreement (excluding "risk
factors" and "forward-looking statements" sections); _provided_ , that in no
event shall any disclosure in such SEC Documents qualify or limit the
representations and warranties in Sections 4.2(a), 4.3, 4.4(a) or 4.19 of this
Agreement, the Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as
follows:

  

    

Section 4.1. _Corporate Organization_.

  

 

  

(a) The Company is a corporation, duly incorporated, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, and has the requisite
corporate power and authority to own or lease all of its properties and assets
and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. Each Company
Subsidiary is a corporation duly incorporated (or formed, as the case may be),
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of
its incorporation, and each has the requisite corporate power and authority to
own or lease all of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as
it is now being conducted, except for the failure to have such power and
authority or be in good standing as would not constitute, individually or in
the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company and the
Material Company Subsidiaries is duly licensed or qualified to do business in
each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the
character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes
such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so
licensed or qualified would not constitute, individually or in the aggregate,
a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has furnished to Parent a true
and complete copy of the joint venture agreement or other organizational
documents of each of the Company Subsidiaries organized and existing under the
laws of China and such joint venture agreements or other organizational
documents are valid and have been duly approved or registered (as required) by
competent Governmental Entities of China.

  

 

  

(b) The Company has furnished to Parent true and complete copies of the
Company's Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (the " _Company
Certificate_ "), and By-Laws, as amended (the " _Company By-Laws_ "), as in
effect as of the date of this Agreement.

  

  

Section 4.2. _Capitalization_.

  

  

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of (i) 28,200,000
shares of Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the " _Shares_ "),
including 3,200,000 shares designated as Class B Common Stock, and (ii)
500,000 shares of Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the " _Preferred
Shares_ "). At the close of business on February 7, 2014, (i) 18,096,138
Shares, including 1,162,500 shares of Class B Common Stock were issued and
outstanding, (ii) no Preferred Shares were issued and outstanding and (iii) no
Shares were held in the Company's treasury. At the close of business on
February 7, 2014, there were outstanding Company Options to acquire a total of
1,074,489 Shares, 415,122 unvested shares of Restricted Stock and 339,928
unvested shares subject to RSUs. All of the issued and outstanding Shares have
been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid, nonassessable and
free of any preemptive rights. As of the date of this Agreement, except (i) as
provided in this Agreement and (ii) for the Company Options, Restricted Stock,
RSUs and the rights issued by the Company under the Rights Plan, there are no

requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be,
and none of the SEC Documents as of such dates contained any untrue statement

promulgated under the Securities Act that have not been disclosed in the SEC

control over financial reporting (as such terms are defined in paragraphs (e)
and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) as required by
Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act. The Company's disclosure controls and
procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all material information
required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or
submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that
all such material information is accumulated and communicated to the
management of the Company as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure and to make the certifications required pursuant to
Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The management of the Company
completed its assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal
control over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of
Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the fiscal year ended December 31,
2012, and such assessment concluded that as of December 31, 2012 such controls
were effective. The Company's principal executive officer and its principal
financial officer have disclosed, based on their most recent evaluation, to
the Company's auditors and the Audit Committee of the Company Board (x) all
significant deficiencies, if any, in the design or operation of internal
control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to materially
adversely affect the Company's ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial data and have identified to such auditors any material
weaknesses in internal controls and (y) any fraud, whether or not material, of
which there is Company Knowledge and that involves management or other
employees of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries who have a

or any of the statements set forth in the Equity Commitment Letters
inaccurate, (b) result in any of the conditions in the Equity Commitment
Letter not being satisfied, (c) cause the Equity Commitment Letter to be
ineffective or (d) otherwise result in the Equity Commitment Letter not being
available on a timely basis in order to consummate the Transactions. For the
avoidance of doubt, _provided_ that Significant Stockholder shall have
complied with all of its obligations under Section 9(b) of the Support
Agreement, any failure in and of itself to obtain the Requisite Significant
Stockholder Stockholder Approval shall not be deemed as a default or breach of
any term under its Equity Commitment Letter or this Agreement by Significant
Stockholder. As of the date of this Agreement, neither Sponsor nor Significant
Stockholder has notified Parent of its intention to terminate such Sponsor's
Equity Commitment Letter. Parent has paid in full any and all commitment or
other fees required by any Equity Commitment Letter that are due as of the
date of this Agreement, and will pay, after the date of this Agreement, all
such commitments and fees as they become due. There are no side letters,
understandings or other agreements or arrangements relating to any Equity
Commitment Letter to which Parent or any of its Affiliates is a party other
than as set forth in such Equity Commitment Letter. Each Equity Commitment
Letter contains all of the conditions precedent or other contingencies to the
obligations of the parties thereunder to make Equity Financing available to
Parent and Merger Sub on the terms therein. Subject to the satisfaction of the
conditions contained in Sections 7.1 and 7.2, as of the date of this Agreement
Parent and Merger Sub have no reason to believe that any of the conditions
precedent to the Equity Financing as set forth in any Equity Commitment Letter
will not be satisfied in connection with the consummation of the Transactions
or that the Equity Financing will not be available to Parent on the Closing
Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that it is agreed that it is not a condition to
Closing under this Agreement, for Parent to obtain the financing pursuant to
the Equity Commitment Letters or any alternative financing. Parent and Merger
Sub have obtained the consent of the other parties under the Equity Commitment
Letters to publicly file the Equity Commitment Letters with the SEC if
requested by the SEC or required by Law.

  

    

Section 5.6. _Solvency_. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is entering into the
Transactions with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or
future creditors. As of the Effective Time and immediately after the
consummation of the Transactions, assuming (a) the accuracy in all material
respects of the representations and warranties of the Company contained in
Article IV as if made as of the Effective Time and (b) the performance in all
material respects by the Company of its obligations hereunder, and giving
effect to all of the Transactions, the payment of the aggregate Merger
Consideration pursuant to Article III, the payments in respect of the Company
Options and Restricted Stock pursuant to Section 3.4, and payment of all fees,
expenses and other amounts related to the Transactions, each of Parent and the
Surviving Corporation (i) will be able to pay its debts as they become due and
shall own property having a fair saleable value greater than the amounts
required to pay its debts and other liabilities (including a reasonable
estimate of the amount of all contingent liabilities) as they become due; and
(ii) shall not have an unreasonably small amount of capital to carry on the
businesses in which is it engaged or proposed to be engaged. For all purposes
of this Agreement, clauses (i) and (ii) shall mean that each of Parent and the
Surviving Corporation will be able to generate enough cash from operations,
asset dispositions or refinancing, or a combination thereof, to meet its
obligations as they become due.

  

  

Section 5.7. _Ownership of Shares_. Other than as a result of (a) the Stock
Purchase Agreement, dated June 14, 2010, among the Company, Significant
Stockholder and Significant Stockholder Parent, which was approved by the
Company Board, and (b) this Agreement, the Support Agreement and the
Additional Rollover Agreements (if any) or any agreement, arrangement or
understanding between Parent or Merger Sub, on the one hand, and any of the
Rollover Investors, on the other hand, in the form approved by the Transaction
Committee, none of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates is, or at any
time during the last three (3) years has been, an "interested stockholder" (as
defined in Section 203 of the DGCL) of the Company.

  

    

Section 5.8. _Other Agreements_. Except as set forth in Section 5.8 of the
Parent Disclosure Schedule, neither Parent, Merger Sub nor any other Affiliate
of Parent has entered (or committed to enter) into any agreement or
arrangement with (i) any officer or director of the Company in connection with
any of the Transactions or otherwise or (ii) pursuant to which any stockholder
of the Company would be entitled to receive consideration of a different
amount or nature than the Merger Consideration or pursuant to which any
stockholder of the Company agrees to vote to adopt this Agreement or agrees to
vote against (or refrain from voting in favor of) any Superior Proposal.
Parent has, prior to the date of this Agreement, delivered or made available
to the Company a complete and correct copy (or, in the case of any oral
agreement or arrangement, a written summary) of any agreement or arrangement
required to be disclosed on the Parent Disclosure Schedule pursuant to the
preceding sentence.

  

  

  

Section 5.9. _Litigation_. Except (i) as would not constitute, individually
or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect and (ii) for any
Proceeding (or threatened Proceeding) concerning this Agreement, any of the
Transactions, or any agreement or arrangement referred to in Section 5.8 of
the Parent Disclosure Schedule, there is no Proceeding (with respect to
investigations, to the Parent's Knowledge) pending or, to Parent's Knowledge,
threatened in a writing delivered to Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, against Parent or Merger Sub or any of their
respective Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets or any
of their respective officers or directors (in their capacity as officers or
directors of Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries)
before any Governmental Entity. Except as would not constitute, individually
or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect, neither Parent nor
Merger Sub is subject to any outstanding judgment, order, writ, injunction or
decree of any Governmental Entity.

  

  

Section 5.10. _Acknowledgments of Parent and Merger Sub_. Each of Parent and
Merger Sub acknowledges, understands and agrees to Section 4.21 and
acknowledges and agrees that (i) Parent has conducted its own independent
investigation and analysis of the business, assets, condition and operations
of the Company and its Subsidiaries and (ii) in entering into this Agreement,
it has relied solely upon Parent's own investigation and analysis and the
representations and warranties, covenants and agreements of the Company
contained in this Agreement. Without limitation of the foregoing, in
connection with the due diligence investigation of the Company by Parent and
Merger Sub and their respective Representatives, Parent and Merger Sub and
their respective Representatives have received and may continue to receive
after the date of this Agreement from the Company and its Representatives
certain estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-looking
information, as well as certain business plan information, regarding the
Company and its business and operations. Accordingly, each of Parent and
Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees that (i) there are uncertainties inherent
in attempting to make such estimates, projections, forecasts and other
forward-looking statements, as well as in such business plans, with which
Parent and Merger Sub are familiar, (ii) Parent and Merger Sub are taking full
responsibility for making their own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of
all estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-looking information,
as well as such business plans, so furnished to them (including the
reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections,
forecasts, forward-looking information or business plans), (iii) Parent and
Merger Sub will have no claim against the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries, or any of their respective Representatives with respect thereto
and (iv) none of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, nor any of
their respective Representatives, has made or is making any express or implied
representation or warranty with respect to such estimates, projections,
forecasts, forward-looking statements or business plans (including the
reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections,
forecasts, forward-looking statements or business plans).

  

    

Section 5.11. _Broker 's Fees_. Except for Goldman, Sachs and Co. (whose fees
shall be paid by Parent), neither Parent nor Merger Sub nor any of their
Affiliates, nor any of their respective officers or directors on behalf of
Parent or Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates, has employed any financial
advisor, broker or finder in a manner that would result in any liability for
any broker's fees, commissions or finder's fees in connection with any of the
Transactions.

  

  

Section 5.12. _No Other Representations or Warranties_. EXCEPT FOR THE
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES EXPRESSLY CONTAINED IN THIS ARTICLE V (GIVING
EFFECT TO THE PARENT DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE), NEITHER PARENT NOR MERGER SUB NOR
ANY OTHER PERSON MAKES ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY ON
BEHALF OF PARENT OR MERGER SUB WITH RESPECT TO PARENT, MERGER SUB, THEIR

this Agreement; it being understood that the Company shall have the right to
waive any provision prohibiting submission of Alternative Proposals or
amendments thereto in effect as of the date of this Agreement), by way of
furnishing to such Person(s) and its/their Representatives, Affiliates and

such Person(s) and its/their Representatives, Affiliates and prospective
financing sources access to, the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and their

(b) Except as permitted by this Section 6.2, after the Solicitation Period End
Time (or, as may relate to any Excluded Person, immediately after the Cut-Off

(the " _Cut-Off Date_ ") with respect to any Person or group of Persons that
has made (or, in the case of any group of Persons, any one or more members of
which has made, either individually or as a member of a group) an Alternative
Proposal prior to the Solicitation Period End Time if, in the good faith
judgment of the Transaction Committee (after consultation with the Transaction
Committee's financial advisor and outside counsel), such Alternative Proposal
constitutes, or is reasonably likely to lead to, a Superior Proposal (such
Person or group of Persons, an " _Excluded Person_ "); _provided_ , _however_
, that any such Person(s) shall cease to be an Excluded Person immediately at
such time, if any, as the Alternative Proposal made by such Person(s) is
withdrawn or terminates (it being understood and agreed that any modification
or amendment or such Alternative Proposal shall not constitute the withdrawal
or termination thereof).

  

    

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary (but subject to
the final sentence of Section 6.2(b)), after the Solicitation Period End Time
until the earlier of the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement
in accordance with Section 8.1, the Company (directly or through its
Representatives) may:

  

  

(i) until receipt of the Company Stockholder Approvals, engage in substantive
discussions or negotiations with a Person or group of Persons that makes a
bona fide Alternative Proposal that did not result from any material breach of
this Section 6.2 and may furnish to such Person(s) and its/their
Representatives information concerning, and may afford such Person(s) and
its/their Representatives access to, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
and their businesses, properties, assets, books and records, if (x) in the
good faith judgment of the Transaction Committee (after consultation with the
Transaction Committee's financial advisor and outside counsel), such
Alternative Proposal constitutes, or is reasonably likely to lead to, a
Superior Proposal, and (y) prior to furnishing such information or access to,
or entering into substantive discussions (except as to the existence of this
Section 6.2 or to ask such Person(s) to clarify the terms and conditions of
such Alternative Proposal) or negotiations with, such Person(s), (A) the
Company receives from such Person(s) an executed Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement (or such Person(s) is/are subject to a confidentiality agreement
with the Company entered into prior to the Solicitation Period End Time; it
being understood that the Company shall have the right to waive any provision
prohibiting the making of Alternative Proposals or amendments thereto in
effect as of the date of this Agreement) and (B) the Company notifies Parent
promptly (and, in any event, within forty-eight (48) hours) to the effect that
it intends to furnish information or access to, or intends to enter into
substantive discussions or negotiations with, such Person(s); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company shall promptly make available to Parent and
Merger Sub any material non-public information concerning the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries that is made available to such Person(s) which was not
previously made available to Parent and Merger Sub;

  

  

(ii) comply with Rules 14e-2(a) and 14d-9 and Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A
promulgated under the Exchange Act with regard to a tender or exchange offer
(after consultation with the Company's outside counsel); _provided_ , that
neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall effect a Change in
Recommendation unless the applicable requirements in Section 6.2(d) shall have
been satisfied;

  

  

(iii) make "stop-look-and-listen" communications with respect to an
Alternative Proposal in compliance with the exemption contained in Rule
14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act; and

  

  

(iv) make any other disclosure to the Company's stockholders if the
Transaction Committee determines in good faith (after consultation with the
Transaction Committee's outside counsel) that the failure to make such
disclosure would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with applicable
Law.

  

    

(d) The Transaction Committee and the Company Board may not (i) withdraw or
modify, or publicly propose or resolve to withdraw or modify, in a manner
adverse to Parent, or fail to include in the Proxy Statement, their approval
or recommendation of the Merger or this Agreement (except as set forth in
clause (y) of the proviso in Section 2.6(a)(ii) or as set forth below in this
Section 6.2(d)), (ii) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or
recommend, to the stockholders of the Company an Alternative Proposal, (iii)
after the Solicitation Period End Time (or, if there are any Excluded Persons,
the Cut-Off Date) fail to publicly reaffirm their approval or recommendation
of the Merger or this Agreement within five (5) Business Days after Parent so
requests in writing if an Alternative Proposal (or any material modification
thereto) shall have been made public or sent or given to the stockholders of
the Company (or any Person shall have publicly announced an intention, whether
or not conditional, to make an Alternative Proposal), (iv) fail to recommend,
in a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9, against any
Alternative Proposal subject to Regulation 14D under the Exchange Act within

Recommendation_ ") or (v) cause the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries
to enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition
agreement or other similar agreement related to any Alternative Proposal
(other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, at any time prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approvals,
if the Transaction Committee (after consultation with the Transaction
Committee's financial advisor and outside counsel) determines in good faith
that any Alternative Proposal referred to in Section 6.2(a), the final
sentence of Section 6.2(b) or clause (i) of Section 6.2(c) constitutes a
Superior Proposal, the Transaction Committee and the Company Board (acting
upon the recommendation of the Transaction Committee) may:

  

  

(w) withdraw or modify, or publicly propose or resolve to withdraw or modify,
or fail to include in the Proxy Statement, its approval or recommendation of
the Merger and this Agreement;

  

  

(x) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, such
Superior Proposal;

  

  

(y) cause the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to enter into a
binding written agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal (a "
_Superior Proposal Agreement_ ") (and take the actions contemplated by Section
4.17 in connection therewith); and

  

  

(z) terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.1(e);

  

  

 _provided_ , _however_ , that (A) prior to taking such action, the Company
shall give Parent at least three (3) Business Days' notice thereof (except as
provided in the final sentence of this Section 6.2(d)), describing in
reasonable detail the reasons for such Change in Recommendation or termination
and attaching the proposed Superior Proposal Agreement (or, if applicable, the
latest draft thereof), including the identity of the Person or group of
Persons making such Superior Proposal, if applicable, which notice need only
be given once with respect to any Superior Proposal, unless such Superior
Proposal is modified in any material respect, and (B) if, within such three
(3) Business Days period, Parent makes a bona fide offer that the Transaction
Committee and the Company Board (acting upon the recommendation of the
Transaction Committee) determine in good faith (after consultation with the
Company's financial advisor and outside counsel) is more favorable to the
stockholders of the Company (other than Parent and its Affiliates, Merger Sub
and its Affiliates, the Rollover Investors and the Additional Rollover
Stockholders), from a financial point of view, than such Superior Proposal
(taking into account, among other things, (I) the terms of such offer and (II)
such legal, financial, regulatory, timing, financing, conditionality (i.e.,
closing conditions), likelihood of consummation and other aspects of such
offer (including the Person(s) making such offer and any termination fee and
expense reimbursement provisions) and the Merger which the Transaction
Committee and the Company Board (acting upon the recommendation of the
Transaction Committee) deem relevant (including any stockholder litigation in
connection with the Merger), and Parent agrees in writing to all adjustments
in the terms and conditions of this Agreement as are necessary to reflect such
offer, then the Company's notice of Change in Recommendation or termination,
as applicable, with respect to such Superior Proposal shall be deemed to be
rescinded and of no further force and effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
in the event of any modification in any material respect to any Superior
Proposal, the Company shall deliver a new written notice to Parent and comply
with the requirements of this Section 6.2(d) with respect to such written
notice; _provided_ , _however_ , that any new notice of Change in
Recommendation or termination given by the Company under this Section 6.2(d)
shall require only at least two (2) Business Days' notice before taking effect
and, accordingly, all references above in this Section 6.2(d) to three (3)
Business Days shall instead be deemed to be two (2) Business Days.

  

    

(e) After the Solicitation Period End Time until the earlier of the Effective
Time or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.1, the
Company shall promptly (and, in any event within three (3) calendar days)
advise Parent in writing of the receipt of any Alternative Proposal, and any
inquiry or request for information from, or any negotiations sought to be
initiated or continued with, the Company or its Representatives concerning an
Alternative Proposal. The Company's notice shall include a written summary of
the material terms and conditions (including the basic financial terms) of
such Alternative Proposal, inquiry or request, including the identity of the
Person making any such Alternative Proposal, inquiry or request. The Company
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to keep Parent reasonably informed
of the status and material terms and conditions (including any change agreed
to in writing to the financial terms or any other material term thereof) or
developments of any such Alternative Proposal, inquiry or request.

  

  

Section 6.3. _Publicity_. The initial press release with respect to the
execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release reasonably
acceptable to Parent and the Company. Thereafter, so long as this Agreement is
in effect, none of the Company, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates
shall issue or cause the publication of any press release or other
announcement with respect to the Merger, this Agreement or any of the other
Transactions without the prior written approval of the Company and Parent,
except as may be required by Law or by the rules of any applicable securities
exchange as determined in the good faith judgment of the party wanting to make
such release or announcement, in which event such party shall, to the extent
practicable under the circumstances, use its reasonable best efforts to
provide a meaningful opportunity to the other party to review and comment upon
such press release or announcement prior to making it. For the avoidance of
doubt, the Company shall not be required to obtain the prior written approval
of Parent in connection with any press release or public announcement that the
Transaction Committee or the Company Board has taken any action in accordance
with (a) clause (y) of the proviso in Section 2.6(a)(ii), (b) the proviso in
Section 2.6(a)(iii), (c) Section 6.2(a) or (d) Section 6.2(d).

  

    

Section 6.4. _Access to Information_.

  

  

(a) During the period prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall afford to
the officers, employees, accountants, counsel and other Representatives of
Parent access to senior executives of the Company to answer Parent's questions
concerning the business, operations, financial performance, monthly key
performance indicators and affairs of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
and access to the Company's and each of the Company Subsidiaries' properties,
books, Contracts, commitments and records, in each case, as reasonably
requested by Parent; _provided_ , that in each case, such access shall be
given at reasonable times and upon reasonable notice, and Parent and its
Representatives shall conduct any such activities in such a manner as not to
interfere unreasonably with the business, operations or personnel of the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries (it being agreed that such access shall in
no way include any Phase II environmental investigation or other invasive
procedure or investigation, including any sampling, testing or the removal of
materials from the offices and properties of the Company). Notwithstanding any
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, neither the Company nor any of
the Company Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose
information if such access or disclosure would violate or infringe on a third-
party confidentiality obligation, jeopardize the work product privilege or the
attorney‑client privilege of the institution in possession or control of such
information, compromise the value of any trade secret, or contravene any Law
(including antitrust laws), fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into
prior to the date of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that in each
such case the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize
the effects of such restriction or, to the extent feasible and practical to
provide a reasonable alternative to such access.

  

  

(b) Without limitation of the foregoing, all requests for access shall be made
to such Representatives of the Company as it shall designate, who shall be
solely responsible for coordinating all such requests and access thereunder.
Prior to the Effective Time, each of Parent and Merger Sub shall not, and
shall cause their respective Representatives and Affiliates not to, contact or
otherwise communicate with the respective employees of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries regarding the businesses of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, this Agreement or any of the Transactions without first
obtaining the consent of the Company in writing (such consent not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).

  

  

(c) No investigation pursuant to this _Section 6.4_ shall affect any
representation or warranty in this Agreement of any party hereto or any
condition to the obligations of the parties hereto.

  

  

(d) The Company makes no representation or warranty as to the accuracy of any
information provided pursuant to Section 6.4(a), and neither Merger Sub nor
Parent may rely on the accuracy of any such information, other than as
expressly set forth in the Company's representations and warranties in Article
IV.

  

    

(e) The information provided pursuant to Section 6.4(a) will be used solely
for the purpose of effecting the Transactions and will be governed by the
terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

  

  

Section 6.5. _Further Assurances; Regulatory Matters_.

  

  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to,
cooperate with each other and use (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to use)
commercially reasonable efforts (i) to take, or cause to be taken, all actions
necessary, proper or advisable to comply promptly with all legal requirements
which may be imposed on such party with respect to the Merger or the other
Transactions and, subject to the conditions set forth in Article VII, to
consummate the Transactions as promptly as practicable and (ii) promptly to
prepare and file all necessary documentation, to effect all necessary
applications, notices, petitions, filings and other documents, and to use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, as soon as practicable after the
date of this Agreement, all necessary permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of all Governmental Entities necessary or advisable in
connection with consummating the Transactions, including the Company Required
Governmental Approvals and Parent Required Governmental Approvals. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing provisions of this Section 6.5(a),
Parent shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, (i) as soon as reasonably
practicable after the date of this Agreement, submit to MOFCOM a draft of the
requisite filing for the Transactions pursuant to the AML and (ii) as promptly
as practicable, file all necessary documentation required pursuant to
additional requests for information to obtain termination of applicable
waiting periods for the Transactions under the AML. The Company shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates to, provide all information and necessary
assistance reasonably requested by Parent for completion of AML filing as
required by the PRC Law.

  

  

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
hereto contained in Section 6.5(a), each of the parties hereto shall use (and
Parent shall cause its Affiliates to use) commercially reasonable efforts to
resolve all objections, if any, to the Transactions by any Governmental Entity
under the AML and ensure the expiration of all waiting periods under the AML.
In connection with the foregoing, if any Proceeding, including any Proceeding
by a private Person, is instituted (or threatened to be instituted)
challenging any of the Transactions as violative of the AML or any other
antitrust Law or other Law in any jurisdiction, the parties hereto shall
cooperate with each other and use (and Parent shall cause its Affiliates to
use) their respective commercially reasonable efforts to contest and resist
any such Proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any
judgment or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is
in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of any of the
Transactions, including defending through litigation on the merits any claim
asserted in any such Proceeding by any Person.

  

  

Section 6.6. _Employee Benefit Plans_.

  

  

(a) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to, honor and perform in accordance with their terms all the
Benefit Plans.

  

    

(b) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, for at
least twelve (12) months following the Closing, Parent shall, and shall cause
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, provide employees of the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries considered as a group with base
salary or wages, incentive compensation opportunities and employee benefits
(other than equity or equity-based incentive plans or change of control
agreements) which, in the aggregate, are no less favorable to such employees
than the salary, wages, incentive compensation and employee benefits (other
than equity or equity-based incentive plans or change of control agreements)
in effect for such employees of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Closing.

  

  

(c) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to, (i) credit all service with the Company and any of the
Company Subsidiaries (including service recognized by the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries for service with other Persons) for all purposes
(other than benefit accrual under a "defined benefit plan" within the meaning
of Section 3(35) of ERISA) under any employee benefit plan, policy or program
applicable to employees of the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries after the Closing, (ii) waive any waiting period, pre-existing
condition or limitation or exclusion and any actively-at-work requirement with
respect to employees of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries and
their dependents under any group health plan or other welfare benefit plan,
and (iii) recognize the dollar amount of all expenses incurred by employees of
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries and their dependents in the
plan year in which the Closing occurs for purposes of deductibles, co-payments
and maximum out-of pocket limits under any group health plan.

  

  

(d) Without limiting the foregoing provisions of this Section 6.6, Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, pay
severance benefits to persons who were employees of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time and whose employment with the
Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries is
terminated other than for cause, by the Company, the Surviving Corporation or
any of their respective Subsidiaries within twelve (12) months following the
Effective Time in amounts no less favorable than the amount of severance
benefits to which such persons would have been entitled under the terms of the
Company's or the Company Subsidiaries' severance plans, programs, policies and
agreements in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  

  

(e) Nothing herein expressed or implied is intended to confer on any Person
other than the parties hereto or their respective successors and permitted
assigns any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by reason of
this Section 6.6, including any right to benefits or employment, or continued
benefits or employment, for any specified period, of any nature or kind
whatsoever by reason of this Agreement or shall be construed to establish,
amend or modify any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement.

  

    

Section 6.7. _Indemnification and Insurance_.

  

  

(a) All rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses existing in
favor of, and all exculpations and limitations of the personal liability of,
the directors, officers, employees, fiduciaries and agents of any of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries in the Company Certificate or Company By-
Laws (or comparable organizational documents of the Company Subsidiaries) as
in effect as of the date of this Agreement or Contracts as in effect as of the
date of this Agreement in the form previously filed with the SEC with respect
to acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including
the Merger and the other Transactions, shall survive the Merger and shall
continue in full force and effect thereafter, without any amendment thereto,
for a period of six (6) years. For a period of six (6) years after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall not, and Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation not to, transfer substantially all of its assets
(other than pursuant to Section 6.7(f)), or voluntarily liquidate the
Surviving Corporation, in a manner that would render the Surviving Corporation
unable to satisfy any of its obligations pursuant to this Section 6.7. For a
period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) indemnify, defend
and hold harmless, to the fullest extent authorized or permitted under the
DGCL or other applicable Law, each Person who is now, or has been at any time
prior to the date of this Agreement or who becomes such prior to the Effective
Time, an officer or director of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries
(individually, an " _Indemnified Party_ " and, collectively, the "
_Indemnified Parties_ ") against any and all losses, claims, damages, costs,
expenses (including attorneys' fees and disbursements), obligations (including
experts' fees, travel expenses, court costs, retainers, transcript fees,
duplicating, printing and binding costs, as well as telecommunications,
postage and courier charges), fines, liabilities, judgments, and amounts that
are paid in settlement (collectively, " _Indemnified Liabilities_ "), paid or
incurred in connection with investigating, defending, serving as a witness
with respect to or otherwise participating in (and including preparation for
any of the foregoing) any pending, threatened, asserted or completed
Proceeding (including any Proceeding brought by an Indemnified Party under
this Section 6.7, any action on appeal, or any arbitration or other
alternative dispute resolution mechanism), whether civil or criminal, and
whether instituted by the Company, the Surviving Corporation, any Governmental
Entity or any other party (each, an " _Indemnity Proceeding_ "), based in
whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining in
whole or in part to (i) the fact that such Person is or was an officer,
director, employee, fiduciary or agent of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries (or served at the request of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary as a director, officer, employee, fiduciary, agent or trustee of
another Person (including any employee benefit plan)) or (ii) matters
occurring or existing at or prior to the Effective Time (including acts or
omissions occurring in connection with this Agreement, any of the Transactions
or any Benefit Plan), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after, the
Effective Time. Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
promptly advance all out-of-pocket expenses of each Indemnified Party in
connection with any Indemnity Proceeding as such expenses (including
attorneys' fees and disbursements) are incurred upon receipt from such
Indemnified Party of a request therefor (accompanied by invoices or other
relevant documentation), _provided_ (if and to the extent required by the DGCL
or other applicable Law) that such Indemnified Party undertakes to repay such
amount if it is ultimately determined that such Indemnified Party is not
entitled to be indemnified under the DGCL or other applicable Law with respect
to such Indemnity Proceeding. In the event any Indemnity Proceeding is brought
against any Indemnified Party (and in which indemnification could be sought by
such Indemnified Party hereunder), Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
each use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate in the vigorous defense
of such Indemnity Proceeding, _provided_ that neither Parent nor the Surviving
Corporation shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment
in such Indemnity Proceeding without the prior written consent of such
Indemnified Party if and to the extent the terms of the proposed settlement,
compromise or judgment involve any non-monetary relief from such Indemnified
Party.

  

    

(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, maintain in effect the
existing directors' and officers' liability insurance policies maintained by
or for the Company and/or the Company Subsidiaries for the benefit of those
Persons who are covered by such policies as of the Effective Time with respect
to claims arising in whole or in part from matters occurring or allegedly
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time ( _provided_ that the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries may substitute therefor policies of at least
the same coverage containing terms and conditions that are at least as
beneficial to the beneficiaries of the current policies and with reputable
carriers having a rating comparable to the Company's current carrier);
_provided_ , _however_ , that each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries to, first use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a
"tail" policy on substantially the same terms and conditions for claims
arising out of acts or conduct occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and
effective for claims asserted prior to or during the six (6) year period
referred to above (and, with respect to claims made prior to or during such
period, until final resolution thereof), and only if Parent and the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries are unable, after exerting commercially
reasonable efforts, to obtain such a "tail" policy, then Parent or the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will be required to obtain such
coverage from such carriers in annual policies; and, _provided_ , _further_
that (i) if the existing policies expire or are terminated or cancelled during
such six (6)-year period, each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain policies of at
least the same coverage containing terms and conditions that are at least as
beneficial to the beneficiaries of the current policies with reputable
carriers having a rating comparable to the Company's current carrier, (ii)
Parent or the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, as the case may be,
shall not be required to spend as an annual premium therefor an amount in
excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the annual premium therefor as of
the date of this Agreement and (iii) if, during such six (6)-year period, such
insurance coverage cannot be obtained at all or can be obtained only for an
amount in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the current annual premium
therefor, Parent or the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, as the
case may be, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be obtained
as much directors' and officers' liability insurance coverage as can be
obtained for an amount equal to three hundred percent (300%) of the current
annual premium therefor, on terms and conditions substantially similar to the
Company's and the Company Subsidiaries' existing directors' and officers'
liability insurance.

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, prior to
the Effective Time the Company shall be permitted to purchase prepaid "tail"
policies in favor of the individuals referred to in Section 6.7(b) with
respect to the matters described therein ( _provided_ that the annual premium
therefor shall not exceed three hundred percent (300%) of the annual premium
therefor as of the date of this Agreement). If and to the extent such policies
have been obtained prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, maintain such policies in effect and continue to
honor the obligations of the Company thereunder.

  

    

(d) The Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, honor and perform in accordance with their terms all
indemnification agreements in effect as of the date of this Agreement between
the Company, on the one hand, and any director or officer of the Company, on
the other hand.

  

  

(e) The provisions of this Section 6.7 (i) are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each Person who is now, or who has been at
any time prior to the date of this Agreement or who becomes prior to the
Effective Time, an Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and his or her personal
representatives, (ii) shall be binding on Parent and the Surviving Corporation
and their respective successors and assigns, (iii) are in addition to, and not
in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that
any such Person may have, whether pursuant to Law, Contract, any Benefit Plan,
the Company Certificate or Company By-Laws (or comparable organizational
documents of the Company Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation), or
otherwise and (iv) shall survive the consummation of the Merger and shall not
be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any
Indemnified Party without the consent of such Indemnified Party.

  

  

(f) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or permitted assigns (each, an " _Indemnifying Party_ ")
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger,
or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that
the successors and assigns of such Indemnifying Party assume all the
obligations of such Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Section 6.7. In
addition, if upon or following any merger, consolidation or sale of assets any
Indemnifying Party is or becomes a direct or indirect Subsidiary of another
Person, the ultimate parent entity of such Indemnifying Party shall guarantee
the obligations of such Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Section 6.7.

via merger, consolidation, stock or asset purchase or otherwise), or agree to
so acquire, substantially all of the assets or equity interests of any company
or other Person operating high-end hospitals of the same type as those
operated by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries in the cities in China
where the Company and the Company Subsidiaries operate their hospitals if such
acquisition would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on
the obtaining of the AML approval for the Merger.

  

    

Section 6.9. _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
Board shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any dispositions

requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company
to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

  

  

Section 6.10. _Resignation of Directors_. At the Closing, if requested by

writing delivered to any party hereto (or any of the Subsidiaries of such
party), against any party hereto or any of such party's respective
Subsidiaries or any of the directors of the foregoing (" _Transaction
Litigation_ "), such party shall promptly notify the other parties in writing
of such Transaction Litigation and shall keep the other parties informed on a
reasonably current basis with respect to the status thereof, in each case,
only to the extent that providing such information would not, in the
reasonable judgment of such party, jeopardize any privilege with respect
thereto regarding any such Transaction Litigation. The Company and Parent
shall give each other a reasonable opportunity to participate in the defense,
settlement and prosecution of any Transaction Litigation (in each case, at
such party's own expense), and neither the Company nor Parent shall settle any
Transaction Litigation without the prior written consent of Parent or the
Company, as the case may be (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned).

  

  

Section 6.13. _Delisting_. Prior to the Closing, the Company agrees to

delisting of the Shares from NASDAQ and the termination of the Company's
registration under the Exchange Act after the Effective Time.

prompt notice to the Company, of (i) the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any
event of which such party's Board of Directors has actual knowledge and which,

comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied
with or satisfied by it under this Agreement of which such party's Board of
Directors has actual knowledge and which, if not cured, would reasonably be
expected to cause any condition to the obligation of any party to effect the

to have been disclosed by such Person pursuant to any of such Person's

such Proceeding shall be entitled to recover from Parent all costs and
reasonable attorneys' fees incurred by it in connection therewith. In some
instances, the representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent
an allocation among the parties hereto of risks associated with particular
matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto.
Consequently, Persons other than the parties hereto may not rely upon the
representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any
other date.

  

  

Section 9.7. _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid,
void, unenforceable or against its regulatory policy, the remainder of the
terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected,
impaired or invalidated. Upon such determination that any term, provision,
covenant or restriction is invalid, illegal, void, unenforceable or against
regulatory policy, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify
this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties hereto as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the Transactions are
consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

  

  

Section 9.8. _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware that apply to
agreements made and performed entirely within the State of Delaware, without
regard to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof or of any other
jurisdiction.

  

  

Section 9.9. _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder may be assigned by any of the parties
hereto, in whole or in part (whether by operation of law or otherwise),
without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit
of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. Any purported assignment in violation of the provisions of
this Agreement shall be null and void _ab_ _initio_.

  

  

Section 9.10. _Schedules_.

  

  

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, a
disclosure set forth under one Section of a Disclosure Schedule shall be
deemed to be disclosed in any other Section or Sections of such Disclosure
Schedule to the extent that it is reasonably apparent from a reading of such
disclosure that it is relevant or applicable to such other Section(s). Cross-
references have been added for convenience and do not waive or diminish the
Company's rights. It is understood and agreed that (i) nothing in any
Disclosure Schedule is intended to broaden the scope of any representation or
warranty of any party contained in this Agreement and (ii) the fact that any
information is disclosed in a Disclosure Schedule shall not be construed to
mean that such information is required to be disclosed by this Agreement.
Without limiting the foregoing, the information set forth in a Disclosure
Schedule, and the dollar thresholds set forth in this Agreement, shall not be
used as a basis for interpreting the terms "material" or "Company Material
Adverse Effect" or other similar terms in this Agreement.

  

    

(b) The inclusion of, or the reference to, any item within any particular
Section of a Disclosure Schedule does not constitute an admission by Parent,
Merger Sub or the Company that such item meets any or all of the criteria set
forth in the Agreement for inclusion in such Section. The disclosure of any
matter in any Section of a Disclosure Schedule shall expressly not be deemed
to constitute a waiver by Parent, Merger Sub or the Company of any attorney-
client privilege, any protection afforded by the work-product doctrine or any
similar privileges and protections. Nothing disclosed in a Disclosure Schedule
constitutes an admission of liability or obligation of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or any Company Subsidiary or is an admission against the interest of
Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries. All
section headings are inserted for convenience of reference only and will not
affect the meaning or interpretation of the Disclosure Schedules.

  

  

Section 9.11. _Expenses_. Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement,
whether or not the Merger is consummated, all fees, costs and expenses
incurred by any party to this Agreement or on its behalf in connection with
this Agreement and the Transactions expressly contemplated by this Agreement
shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses; _provided_ , that (i)
Parent shall pay all filing fees for the filings required under the AML and
(ii) the costs and expenses incurred in connection with the filing, printing
and mailing of the Proxy Statement (including any SEC filing fees) shall be
borne equally by the Company and Parent.

  

  

Section 9.12. _Submission to Jurisdiction; Waivers_.

  

  

(a) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub irrevocably agrees that any
Proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the
Transactions shall be brought and determined in the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware or, if exclusive jurisdiction over the matter is vested in
the federal courts, any court of the United States located in the State of
Delaware (and each such party shall not bring any Proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or any of the Transactions in any court other than
the aforesaid courts), and each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub hereby
irrevocably submits with regard to any such Proceeding for itself and in
respect to its property, generally and unconditionally, to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts (it being understood and agreed that any
Proceeding arising out of or relating to the Guarantee for Significant
Stockholder and the Equity Commitment Letter for Significant Stockholder shall
be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration in accordance with the
provisions thereof). Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub hereby
irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense,
counterclaim or otherwise, in any such Proceeding, (i) any claim that it is
not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts for any
reason other than the failure to lawfully serve process, (ii) that it or its
property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of such court or from any legal
process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice,
attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment,
execution of judgment or otherwise), and (iii) that (x) such Proceeding in any
such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (y) the venue of such
Proceeding is improper and (z) this Agreement, the Transactions or the subject
matter hereof or thereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts.

  

    

(b) EACH PARTY HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY
ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT
ISSUES AND, THEREFORE, EACH PARTY HERETO IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY
WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS. EACH
PARTY HERETO CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY
OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY
WOULD NOT SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER IN THE EVENT OF ANY SUCH
PROCEEDING, (II) SUCH PARTY HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER,
(III) SUCH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN
INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL
WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 9.12(b).

  

  

(c) Each party agrees that the prevailing party shall be entitled to
reimbursement of all costs and expenses, including all attorney's fees, in
connection with any Proceeding arising out of or relating to a willful breach
of this Agreement or any Guarantee on the part of the other party (or, in the
case of any Guarantee, Sponsor or Significant Stockholder, as applicable).

  

  

Section 9.13. _Specific Performance_.

  

  

(a) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event
that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance
with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed
that each of the parties hereto shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement in addition to any other remedy to
which such party is entitled at law or in equity. Each of the parties hereto
(i) agrees that it shall not oppose the granting of any such relief; and (ii)
hereby irrevocably waives any requirement for the security or posting of any
bond in connection with any such relief (it is understood that clause (i) of
this sentence is not intended to, and shall not, preclude any party hereto
from litigating on the merits the substantive claim to which such remedy
relates). If, prior to the End Date, any party brings any action (whether
before a court or an arbitral tribunal) to enforce specifically the
performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement, the Equity
Commitment Letters or the Support Agreement by any other party hereto or
thereto, the End Date shall automatically be extended by such time period
established by the court or the arbitral tribunal, as applicable, presiding
over such action (it being agreed that any such court or arbitral tribunal is
hereby expressly authorized to establish such extension period as it may deem
appropriate). Without limitation of the foregoing and subject to the second
sentence immediately following this sentence, the parties hereby further
acknowledge and agree that prior to the earlier of the consummation of the
Closing or the valid termination of this Agreement, the Company shall be
entitled to seek specific performance to cause Parent and/or Merger Sub to
draw down the full proceeds of each Equity Financing, only if (A) all
conditions in Sections 7.1 and 7.2 (other than those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Closing have been satisfied, (B) the Company
has delivered to Parent an irrevocable commitment in writing that it would be
ready, willing and able to consummate the Closing if each Equity Financing is
funded and (C) Parent and Merger Sub fail to complete the Closing by the date
the Closing is required to have occurred pursuant to Section 2.2. For the
avoidance of doubt, under no circumstances will the Company be entitled to
money damages from Parent, Merger Sub, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective former, current or future Representatives, stockholders or
Affiliates in excess of the amount of the Parent Termination Fee in cash. In
addition, under no circumstances shall the Company be permitted or entitled to
receive both (x) a grant of specific performance of the type contemplated by
this Section 9.13 and (y) any money damages (or, if applicable, the Parent
Termination Fee). In the event that the Company Termination Fee becomes
payable to Parent after Parent has received money damages due to a breach of
this Agreement by the Company, Parent shall continue to be entitled to receive
the Company Termination Fee (net of any money damages previously received by
Parent for such breach) and Parent shall not be obligated to return any money
damages previously received for such breach in the event the money damages are
in excess of the Company Termination Fee. In the event that the Parent
Termination Fee becomes payable to the Company after the Company has received
money damages due to a breach of this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub, the
Company shall continue to be entitled to receive the Parent Termination Fee
(net of any money damages previously received by the Company for such breach)
and the Company shall not be obligated to return any money damages previously
received for such breach in the event the money damages are in excess of the
Parent Termination Fee. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub
acknowledges that (1) the agreements contained in this Section 9.13 are an
integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (2) the
Parent Termination Fee is not a penalty, and constitutes liquidated damages,
in a reasonable amount that will compensate the Company in the circumstances
in which such Parent Termination Fee is payable and (3) without these
agreements, the parties would not enter into this Agreement.

  

    

(b) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, but
subject to the Company's right under Section 9.13(a), the Equity Commitment
Letters and the Guarantees to seek specific performance, the Company agrees
that payment of the Parent Termination Fee, if such payment is payable and
actually paid, shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company against
Parent, Merger Sub, any of their respective former, current or future
Representatives, stockholders or Affiliates, and none of Parent, Merger Sub or
any of their respective former, current or future Representatives,
stockholders or Affiliates shall have any further liability or obligation
relating to, arising out of or with respect to this Agreement or any of the
Transactions (whether relating to, arising out of or with respect to any
matter(s) forming the basis for such termination or otherwise).

  

  

(c) The parties hereto further agree that (x) by seeking the specific
performance provided for in this Section 9.13, a party shall not in any
respect waive its right to seek any other form of relief that may be available
to a party under this Agreement (including damages) in the event that this
Agreement has been terminated or in the event that the specific performance
provided for in this Section 9.13 is not available or otherwise is not
granted, and (y) nothing set forth in this Agreement shall require any party
hereto to institute any Proceeding for (or limit any party's right to
institute any Proceeding for) specific performance under this Section 9.13
prior or as a condition to exercising any termination right under Article VIII
(and pursuing damages, fees or expenses after such termination).

  

  

Section 9.14. _Construction of Agreement_.

  

  

(a) The terms and provisions of this Agreement represent the results of
negotiations among the parties hereto, each of which has been represented by
counsel of its own choosing, and none of which has acted under duress or
compulsion, whether legal, economic or otherwise. Accordingly, the terms and
provisions of this Agreement shall be interpreted and construed in accordance
with their usual and customary meanings, and each of the parties hereto hereby
waives the application in connection with the interpretation and construction
of this Agreement of any Law to the effect that ambiguous or conflicting terms
or provisions contained in this Agreement shall be interpreted or construed
against the party whose attorney prepared the executed draft or any earlier
draft of this Agreement.

  

    

(b) All references in this Agreement to Sections, Articles and Schedules
without further specification are to Sections and Articles of, and Schedules
to, this Agreement.

  

  

(c) The Table of Contents and the captions in this Agreement are for
convenience only and shall not in any way affect the meaning, interpretation
or construction of any provisions of this Agreement.

  

  

(d) Unless the context otherwise requires, "or" is not exclusive.

  

  

(e) Unless the context otherwise requires, "including" means "including but
not limited to".

  

  

(f) The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular
as well as the plural forms of such terms and to the masculine as well as the
feminine and neuter genders of such term.

  

  

(g) Time is of the essence in the performance of the parties' respective
obligations under this Agreement.
