 2.8 _Exchange of Certificates_. 

  

 (a) _Payment Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall select a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as the payment agent for the Merger (the " _Payment Agent_ "). 

   

 (b) _Exchange Fund_. At the Closing, Parent shall deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Payment Agent, for payment to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_, an amount of cash equal to the aggregate consideration to which holders of Company Common Stock and holders of Company Stock-Based Awards and Company Options become entitled under this _Article II_. Until disbursed in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, such funds shall be invested by the Payment Agent, as directed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America or obligations of an agency of the United States of America which are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America (such cash amount being referred to herein as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to the Surviving Corporation. To the extent that there are any losses with respect to any investments of the Exchange Fund, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for any reason below the level required for the Payment Agent to promptly pay the cash amounts contemplated by this _Article II_, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly replace or restore the cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient for the Payment Agent to make such payments contemplated by this _Article II_. 

   

 (c) _Payment Procedures_. Promptly following the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Payment Agent to mail to each holder of record (as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) of (i) a certificate or certificates (the " _Certificates_ ") which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (other than Dissenting Company Shares) and (ii) uncertificated shares of Company Common Stock (other than Owned Company Shares) (the " _Uncertificated Shares_ "), in each case, whose shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.7_ (A) a letter of transmittal in customary form (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Payment Agent), and/or (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates and Uncertificated Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_. Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Payment Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, the holders of such Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock represented by such 

   ##### 

  

   

Certificate that were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to  _Section 2.7_, by (y) the Merger Consideration
(less any applicable withholding taxes payable in respect thereof), and the
Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. Upon receipt of an
"agents message" by the Payment Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of
transfer as the Payment Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-
entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the holders of such Uncertificated
Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash
equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the aggregate number of
shares of Company Common Stock represented by such holders transferred
Uncertificated Shares that were converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.7_, by (y) the Merger
Consideration (less any applicable withholding taxes payable in respect
thereof), and the transferred Uncertificated Shares so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled. The Payment Agent shall accept such Certificates and
transferred Uncertificated Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms
and conditions as the Payment Agent may impose to effect an orderly
exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. No interest
shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates and
Uncertificated Shares on the Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender
of such Certificates and Uncertificated Shares pursuant to this  _Section
2.8_. Until so surrendered, outstanding Certificates and Uncertificated
Shares shall be deemed from and after the Effective Time, to evidence only
the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest thereon,
payable in respect thereof pursuant to the provisions of this _Article
II_. 

   

 (d) _Transfers of Ownership_. In the event that a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock is not registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company, or if the Merger Consideration is to be paid in a name other than that in which the Certificates or Uncertificated Shares surrendered in exchange therefor are registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company, the Merger Consideration may be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate or Uncertificated Share so surrendered is registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company only if such Certificate or Uncertificated Shares is properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for surrender and transfer and the Person requesting such payment has paid to Parent (or any agent designated by Parent) any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Shares, or established to the satisfaction of Parent (or any agent designated by Parent) that such transfer or other similar Taxes have been paid or are otherwise not payable. 

   

 (e) _Required Withholding_. Each of the Payment Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation and their respective agents shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any cash amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former holder of shares of Company Common Stock, Company Stock-Based Awards and Company Options such amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under United States federal or state, local or foreign Tax Laws. To the extent that such amounts are so deducted or withheld and timely paid over to the appropriate Government Authority, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid. 

     ##### 

  

     

 (f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, none of the Payment Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any other party hereto shall be liable to a holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. 

   

 (g) _Distribution of Exchange Fund to Parent_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or Uncertificated Shares on the date that is twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent upon demand, and any holders of shares of Company Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger who have not theretofore surrendered their Certificates or Uncertificated Shares representing such shares of Company Common Stock for exchange pursuant to the provisions of this  _Section 2.8_ shall thereafter look for payment of the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares solely to the Surviving Corporation for payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, upon due surrender of their Certificates or Uncertificated Shares pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_. 

   

 2.9 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. From and after the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled, retired and cease to exist, and each holder of a Certificate or Uncertificated Shares theretofore representing any shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable therefor upon the surrender thereof in accordance with the provisions of _Section 2.8_. The Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this _Article II_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of the Company Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the records of the Company or the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than transfers to reflect, in accordance with customary settlement procedures, trades effected prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this _Article II_. 

  

 2.10 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Payment Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Payment Agent or reasonably requested by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate (and such affidavit of loss shall not be deemed effective without the posting of such bond if required hereunder), the Payment Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section 2.7_. 

   ##### 

  

  

 2.11 _Necessary Further Actions_. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Acquisition Sub, the directors and officers of the Company and Acquisition Sub shall take all such lawful and necessary action.

 5.2 _Solicitation_. 

  

 (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, during the period beginning on the date of this Agreement and continuing until 11:59 pm (Eastern) on March 29, 2010 (the "No-Shop Period Start Date"), the Company and its Representatives may directly or indirectly: (i) initiate, solicit or encourage the submission of Acquisition Proposals from one or more Persons, including by way of providing access to non-public information pursuant to the prior execution of a confidentiality agreement with any such Person; _provided_ , that the Company shall promptly provide to Parent any non-public information concerning the Company that is provided to any such Person or its Representatives which was not previously provided to Parent; and (ii) participate in discussions or negotiations regarding, and take any other action to facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal. 

   

 (b) Subject to _Section 5.2(c)_, following the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company shall immediately cease or cause to be terminated any activities that would otherwise be a violation of the restrictions set forth in this _Section 5.2(b)_ conducted theretofore by the Company or its Representatives with respect to any Acquisition Proposal; _provided, however_  that notwithstanding such restrictions the Company may continue discussions or negotiations with any Person pursuant to and in accordance with _Section 5.2(c)_ that has made an Acquisition Proposal on or prior to the No-Shop Period Start Date if the Companys Board of Directors determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal. Subject to _Section 5.2(c)_, at all times following the No-Shop Period Start Date and continuing until the earlier to occur of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article IX_ and the Effective Time, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not, nor shall they authorize or knowingly permit their respective directors, officers or other employees, controlled affiliates, or any investment banker, attorney or other agent or representative retained by any of them (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or induce the making, submission or announcement of, or knowingly encourage, facilitate or assist, an alternative Acquisition Proposal, (ii) furnish to any Person (other than Parent, Acquisition Sub or any designees of Parent or Acquisition Sub) any non-public information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or afford to any Person (other than Parent, Acquisition Sub or any designees of Parent or Acquisition Sub) access to the business, properties, assets, books, records 

    ##### 

  

    

or other non-public information, or to any personnel, of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, in any such case with the intent to induce the making,
submission or announcement of, or to encourage, facilitate or assist, an
Acquisition Proposal or any inquiries or the making of any proposal that
would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal,
(iii) participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with any Person
with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, (iv) approve, endorse or recommend
an Acquisition Proposal, or (v) enter into any letter of intent, memorandum

The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis of the status, terms and substance of any material discussions or negotiations (including the amendments and proposed amendments) of any such Acquisition Proposal or other inquiry, offer, proposal or request. 

   

 5.3 _Company Board Recommendation_. Subject to the terms of _Section 5.3(a)_ and  _Section 5.3(b)_, the Company Board shall recommend that the holders of Company Shares adopt this Agreement in accordance with the applicable provisions of Delaware Law (the " _Company Board Recommendation_ ") at the Company Stockholder Meeting. 

  

 (a) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall withhold, withdraw, amend or modify in a manner adverse to Parent, or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, amend or modify in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Board Recommendation (a " _Company Board Recommendation Change_ "); _provided, however_ , that a "stop, look and listen" communication by the Company Board to the Company Stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act, or any substantially similar communication, shall not be deemed to be a Company Board Recommendation Change. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, at any time prior to receipt of the Requisite Stockholder Approval, the Company Board may effect a Company Board 

     ##### 

  

    

Recommendation Change if: (i) the Company shall have received a Superior
Proposal that was not solicited in breach of _Section 5.2(b)_; (ii) the
Company Board shall have determined in good faith (after consultation with
outside legal counsel) that the failure to effect such Company Board
Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
Delaware Law; (iii) the Company has notified Parent in writing that it
intends to effect such Company Board Recommendation Change (a "
_Recommendation Change Notice_ ") (it being understood that the
Recommendation Change Notice shall not constitute a Company Board
Recommendation Change for purposes of this Agreement); (iv) if requested by
Parent, the Company shall have made its Representatives available to discuss
with Parents Representatives any proposed modifications to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement during the five (5) Business Day period
following delivery by the Company to Parent of such Recommendation Change
Notice; and (v) if Parent shall have delivered to the Company a written,
binding and irrevocable offer capable of being accepted by the Company to
alter the terms or conditions of this Agreement during such five (5) Business
Day period, the Company Board shall have determined in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel), after
considering the terms of such offer by Parent, that the Superior Proposal
giving rise to such Recommendation Change Notice continues to be a Superior
Proposal. 

   

 (b) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company Board from (i) taking and disclosing to the Company Stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or complying with the provisions of Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act, and (ii) making any disclosure to the Company Stockholders that the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the failure to make such disclosure would reasonably be expected to be a breach of its fiduciary duties to the Company Stockholders under Delaware Law; _provided_ that, in either such case, any such statement(s) or disclosures made by the Company Board will be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including the provisions of _Article IX_; _provided, further,_ that the Company Board shall not recommend that the Company Stockholders tender their shares of Company Common Stock in connection with such tender or exchange offer (or otherwise approve or recommend any Acquisition Proposal) unless such tender or exchange offer constitutes a Superior Proposal and the applicable requirements of  _Section 5.2_ shall have been satisfied. 

   

 5.4 _Company Stockholder Meeting_. The Company shall establish a record date for, call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of the Company Stockholders (the " _Company Stockholder Meeting_ ") as promptly as practicable following the date hereof for the purpose of voting upon the adoption of this Agreement in accordance with the DGCL (the " _Company Voting Proposal_ "). 

  

 (a) Each of Parent and Acquisition Sub shall vote all Company Shares beneficially owned by it or any of its respective Subsidiaries as of the applicable record date in favor of the adoption of this Agreement in accordance with the DGCL at the Company Stockholder Meeting or otherwise. Parent shall vote all of the shares of capital stock of Acquisition Sub beneficially owned by it, or sign a written consent in lieu of a meeting of the 

      ##### 

  

    

stockholders of Acquisition Sub, in favor of the adoption of this Agreement in
accordance with the DGCL. 

   

 (b) Unless otherwise required by applicable Law or Order, the Company shall not postpone the Company Stockholder Meeting after the date on which the Proxy Statement is first disseminated to Company stockholders, or adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting, unless there are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock present in person or represented by proxy at the Company Stockholder Meeting in order to conduct business at the Company Stockholder Meeting. The Company shall solicit from the Company stockholders proxies in favor of the Company Voting Proposal, and unless the Company Board has effected a Company Board Recommendation Change, the Company Board shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Requisite Company Stockholder Vote at the Company Stockholder Meeting or any postponement or adjournment thereof. At the Company Stockholder Meeting, the Company shall submit to a vote of its stockholders the Company Voting Proposal. The Company shall not propose for consideration or submit for a vote any matters at the Company Stockholder Meeting other than the Company Voting Proposal (or an adjournment of the Company Stockholder Meeting if permitted hereunder) without the prior written consent of Parent. The Company shall not establish a record date for, call, give notice of, convene or hold any meeting of the Company stockholders unless and until the Company Stockholder Meeting has been held, a vote of the Company stockholders has been taken on the Company Voting Proposal and the Company Stockholder Meeting has been adjourned. 

   

 5.5  _Access_. At all times during the period commencing with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article IX_ and the Effective Time, the Company shall afford Parent and its financial advisors, business consultants, legal counsel, accountants and other agents and representatives reasonable access during normal business hours, upon reasonable notice, to the properties, books and records and personnel of the Company (including, without limitation, if reasonably requested by Parent, consistent on-site access to senior management and such other key personnel as Parent reasonably requests); _provided, however_ , that the Company may restrict or otherwise prohibit access to any documents or information to the extent that (i) any applicable Law requires the Company to restrict or otherwise prohibit access to such documents or information, (ii) access to such documents or information would give rise to a material risk of waiving any attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable privilege applicable to such documents or information, or (iii) access to a Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or otherwise bound would violate or cause a default under, or give a third party the right terminate or accelerate the rights under, such Contract; and _provided further_ , that no information or knowledge obtained by Parent in any investigation conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by this _Section 5.5_ shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty of the Company set forth in this Agreement or otherwise impair the rights and remedies available to Parent and Acquisition Sub hereunder. Any investigation conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by this _Section 5.5_ shall be conducted in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries or create a risk of damage or destruction to any property or assets of the 

   ##### 

  

 

Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Any access to the Companys properties
shall be subject to the Companys reasonable security measures and insurance
requirements and shall not include the right to perform invasive testing. The
terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement shall apply to any
information obtained by Parent or any of its financial advisors, business
consultants, legal counsel, accountants and other agents and representatives
in connection with any investigation conducted pursuant to the access
contemplated by this _Section 5.5_. 

   

 5.6 _Certain Litigation_. The Company shall promptly advise Parent of any litigation commenced after the date hereof against the Company or any of its directors or officers (in their capacity as such) by any Company Stockholders (on their own behalf or on behalf of the Company) relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and shall keep Parent reasonably informed regarding any such litigation. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to consult with the Company regarding the defense or settlement of any such stockholder litigation and shall consider Parents views with respect to such stockholder litigation. The Company shall not settle any such stockholder litigation without Parents prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld). 

  

 5.7 _Section 16(b) Exemption_. The Company shall take all actions reasonably necessary to cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and any other dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including derivative securities) in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is a director or executive officer of the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act. 

  

 5.8 _Financing_. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Companys and its Subsidiaries respective Representatives to, provide to Parent and Acquisition Sub all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent that is necessary, proper, advisable or desirable in connection with the arrangement of the Financing, including (i) participating in a reasonable number of meetings, presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions and sessions with rating agencies and assisting Parent in obtaining ratings as contemplated by the Debt Financing; (ii) assisting with the preparation of materials for rating agency presentations, bank information memoranda, and similar documents required in connection with the Debt Financing, including execution and delivery of customary representation letters in connection with bank information memoranda; _provided_ , that any such memoranda or prospectuses shall contain disclosure and financial statements with respect to the Company or the Surviving Corporation reflecting the Surviving Corporation and/or its Subsidiaries as the obligor; (iii) as promptly as reasonably practical, furnishing Parent and its Debt Financing sources with financial and other information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries as may be reasonably requested by Parent to prepare the bank information memoranda contemplated by the Debt Financing Letter (including in connection with Parents preparation of pro forma financial statements), (all such information in this clause (iii), the " _Required Information_ "); (iv) using reasonable best efforts to obtain appraisals, surveys, engineering reports, environmental and other inspections (including providing reasonable access to Parent and its agents to all Owned Real Property for such purposes), title insurance and other documentation and items relating to the Debt Financing as reasonably 

   ##### 

  

    

requested by Parent and, if requested by Parent or Acquisition Sub, to
cooperate with and assist Parent or Acquisition Sub in obtaining such
documentation and items; (v) providing assistance to obtain a solvency
opinion from an independent investment bank or valuation firm of nationally
recognized standing; (vi) using reasonable best efforts to provide monthly
financial statements (excluding footnotes) within fifteen (15) days of the
end of each month prior to the Closing Date; (vii) using reasonable
best efforts to obtain consents of accountants for use of their reports in
any materials relating to the Debt Financing and reasonably facilitating the
pledging or the re-affirmation of the pledge of collateral (including
cooperation in connection with the pay-off of existing Indebtedness and
the release of related Liens); (viii) taking commercially reasonable actions
necessary to (A) permit the prospective lenders involved in the Debt
Financing to evaluate the Companys current assets, cash management and
accounting systems, policies and procedures relating thereto for the
purposes of establishing collateral arrangements as of the Effective Time and
(B) assist Parent to establish or maintain, effective as of the Effective
Time, bank and other accounts and blocked account agreements and lock box
arrangements in connection with the Debt Financing; (ix) using
reasonable best efforts to assist Parent to obtain waivers, consents,
estoppels and approvals from other parties to material leases, encumbrances
and contracts to which any Subsidiary of the Company is a party and to
arrange discussions among Parent, Acquisition Sub and their financing sources
with other parties to material leases, encumbrances and contracts as of the
Effective Time; and (x) taking all corporate actions, subject to the
occurrence of the Effective Time, reasonably requested by Parent that are
necessary or customary to permit the consummation of the Financing, and
to permit the proceeds thereof, together with the cash at the Company and its
Subsidiaries (not needed for other purposes), to be made available to the
Company on the Closing Date to consummate the Merger; _provided_ , that none
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any of their
respective officers, advisors or representatives shall incur any liability in
connection with the Financing prior to the Effective Time; _provided,
further,_ that such requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere
with the ongoing operations of the Company and its Significant
Subsidiaries. The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to
periodically update any such Required Information provided pursuant to clause
(iii) of the foregoing sentence as may be necessary such that such Required
Information does not contain any untrue statement of material fact or omit
to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements
contained therein not misleading. For the avoidance of doubt, if requested by
Parent to most effectively access the financing markets, the Company shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cooperate with this _Section 5.8_ at any
time, and from time to time and on multiple occasions, between the date hereof
and the Effective Time. In addition, the Company agrees that if reasonably
requested by Parent it will supplement and use reasonable best efforts to
keep current the Required Information so that Parent may most effectively
access the financing markets. If, in connection with a marketing
effort contemplated by the Debt Financing Letter, the Parent reasonably
requests the Company to file a report on Form 8-K pursuant to the Exchange
Act that contains material non-public information with respect to the Company
and its subsidiaries, which the Parent reasonably determines to include in
a customary offering memorandum for such debt, then, upon the Companys
review of and satisfaction with such filing (it being acknowledged and
agreed that such filing shall contain any and all reasonable comments of the
Company), the 

   ##### 

  

    

Company shall file such report on Form 8-K; _provided, however_ , that the
Company shall not be required to file any information on Form 8-K that
the Company reasonably determines are reasonably likely to be competitively
harmful to the Company, it being understood that publication of an adjusted
EBITDA number will not be deemed to be competitively harmful to the Company.
All non-public or otherwise confidential information regarding the Company or
its Subsidiaries obtained by Parent, Acquisition Sub or their
respective officers, advisors or representatives shall be kept confidential
in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement. The Company shall deliver
to Parent as promptly as reasonably practicable following the end of each
fiscal quarter ending on or after December 31, 2009, the unaudited
consolidating balance sheets and combined statements of income reflecting the
financial condition as of the last day of each fiscal quarter and the results
of operations during such quarter and for the elapsed portion of the fiscal
year together with a comparison to the comparable period from the prior
fiscal year, in each case, of the Company and prepared in accordance
with GAAP (except for the absence of footnotes and subject to year-end
adjustments). Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its
Significant Subsidiaries and their respective officers, directors, employees,
agents and representatives from and against any and all losses, damages,
claims, costs or expenses suffered or incurred by any of them of any type in
connection with the arrangement of the Financing (other than to the extent
such losses arise from the misconduct of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries
or their respective officers, advisors and representatives) and any
information used in connection therewith, and the foregoing obligations shall
survive termination of this Agreement.

 (b) Without limiting the generality of the provisions of _Section 6.1(a)_, during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnified Person from and against any costs, fees and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and investigation expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, to the extent such claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry arises directly or indirectly out of or pertains directly or indirectly to (i) any action or omission or alleged action or omission in such Indemnified Persons capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or other Affiliates (regardless of whether such action or omission, or alleged action or omission, occurred prior to, at or after the Effective Time) so long as any such action or omission or alleged action or omission satisfies the provisions set forth in Section 145 of the DGCL, or (ii) any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided, however_ , that if, at any time prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, any Indemnified Person delivers to Parent a written notice asserting a claim for indemnification under this _Section 6.1(b)_, then the claim asserted in such notice shall survive the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time until such time as such claim is fully and finally resolved. In addition, during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) advance, prior to the final disposition of any claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry for which indemnification may be sought under this Agreement, promptly following request by an Indemnified Person therefor, all costs, fees and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and investigation expenses) incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with any such claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry upon receipt of an undertaking by such Indemnified Person to repay such advances if it is ultimately decided in a final, non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction that such Indemnified Person is not entitled to indemnification. In the event of any such claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry, (i) the Surviving Corporation shall have the right to control the defense thereof after the Effective Time (it being understood that, by electing to control the defense thereof, the Surviving Corporation will be deemed to have waived any right to object to the Indemnified Persons entitlement to indemnification hereunder with respect thereto), (ii) each Indemnified Person shall be entitled to retain his or her own counsel, whether or not the Surviving Corporation shall elect to control the defense of any such claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry, (iii) the Surviving Corporation shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of any counsel retained by an Indemnified Person, promptly after statements therefor are received, whether or not the Surviving Corporation shall elect to control the defense of any such claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry, and (iv) no Indemnified Person shall be liable for any settlement effected without his or her prior express written consent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this _Section 6.1(b)_ or elsewhere in this Agreement, neither the Surviving Corporation nor any of its Affiliates (including Parent) shall settle or otherwise compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment or otherwise seek termination with respect 

   ##### 

  

   

to any claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry for which indemnification
may be sought by an Indemnified Person under this Agreement unless such
settlement, compromise, consent or termination includes an unconditional
release of all Indemnified Persons from all liability arising out of such
claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry. For the avoidance of doubt,
nothing contained in this  _Section 6.1(b)_ should increase or enhance
indemnity protections currently provided to any Indemnified Person. 

   

 (c) During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain in effect the Companys current directors and officers liability insurance (" _D andO Insurance_") in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, covering each person covered by the DandO Insurance, on terms with respect to the coverage and amounts that are equivalent to those of the DandO Insurance; _provided, however_ , that in satisfying its obligations under this _Section 6.1(c)_, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to pay annual premiums in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the amount paid by the Company for coverage for its last full fiscal year (such three hundred percent (300%) amount, the " _Maximum Annual Premium_ ") (which aggregate premium amounts the Company represents and warrants to be as set forth in _Section 6.1(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter); _provided_ that, if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Annual Premium. Prior to the Effective Time, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the Company may purchase a six-year "tail" prepaid policy on the DandO Insurance; _provided_ , _however_ , the Company shall provide Parent with reasonable advance notice prior to purchasing any such "tail" policy;  _provided_ , _further_ , in no event shall the Company pay in excess of $750,000 for any such "tail" policy. In the event that the Company elects to purchase such a "tail" policy prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain such "tail" policy in full force and effect and continue to honor their respective obligations thereunder, in lieu of all other obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under the first sentence of this _Section 6.1(c)_ for so long as such "tail" policy shall be maintained in full force and effect. 

   

 (d) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation set forth in this _Section 6.1_. 

   

 (e) The obligations set forth in this _Section 6.1_ shall not be terminated, amended or otherwise modified in any manner that adversely affects any Indemnified Person (or any other person who is a beneficiary under the DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in _Section 6.1(c)_ (and their heirs and representatives)) without the prior written consent of such 

   #####

(and other persons who are beneficiaries under the DandO Insurance or the

in substitution for, any other rights that such persons may have under
the certificates of incorporation, bylaws or other equivalent organizational
documents, any and all indemnification agreements of or entered into by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or applicable Law (whether at law or in
equity).

 (b) To the extent that a Company Plan or Comparable Plan is made available to any Continuing Employee on or following the Effective Time, Parent shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) cause to be granted to such Continuing Employee credit for all service with the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and entitlement to benefits where length of service is relevant (including for purposes of vacation accrual and severance pay entitlement, but excluding benefit 

   ##### 

  

   

accrual);  _provided, however_ , that such service need not be credited to
the extent that it would result in duplication of coverage or benefits. In
addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing: (i) each
Continuing Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without
any waiting time, in any and all employee benefit plans sponsored by the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries (other than the Company Plans)
(such plans, collectively, the " _New Plans_ ") to the extent coverage under
any such New Plan replaces coverage under a comparable Company Plan in which
such Continuing Employee participates immediately before the Effective Time
(such plans, collectively, the " _Old Plans_ "); and (ii) for purposes of
each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical, vision and/or
disability benefits to any Continuing Employee, the Surviving Corporation
shall, subject to any reasonably required approval by the applicable
insurance provider, cause all waiting periods, pre-existing condition
exclusions, evidence of insurability requirements and actively-at-work or
similar requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such Continuing
Employee and his or her covered dependents, and the Surviving Corporation
shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee and
his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old
Plan ending on the date such employees participation in the corresponding
New Plan begins to be given full credit under such New Plan for purposes
of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket
requirements applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or her covered
dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in
accordance with such New Plan, and (iii) credit the accounts of
such Continuing Employees under any New Plan which is a flexible spending
plan with any unused balance in the account of such Continuing Employee under
the applicable Company Plan. Any vacation or paid time off accrued but unused
by a Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be credited to such Continuing Employee following the Effective Time. 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, no provision of this Agreement shall or shall be deemed to (i) guarantee employment for any period of time for, or preclude the ability of Parent or the Surviving Corporation to terminate, any Continuing Employee for any reason, or (ii) (a) amend, any Employee Plan, (b) provide any person not a party to this Agreement with any right, benefit, or remedy with regard to any Employee Plan or a right to enforce any provision of this Agreement, or (c) limit in any way the ability of Parent or the Surviving Corporation to amend or terminate any Employee Plan at any time. 

   

 6.4 _Financing_. 

  

 (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of Parent and Acquisition Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Financing Letters (including any applicable lender flex provisions contained in any related fee letter) and shall not permit any amendment or modification (including any replacement of any portion of the Debt Financing as a result of Acquisition Subs election to issue a portion of the Debt Financing with mezzanine notes as provided pursuant to the terms of the Debt Financing Letter as in effect as of the date hereof) to be made to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy under, the Financing Letters, if such amendment, 

   ##### 

  

   

modification or waiver (x) reduces the aggregate amount of the Financing or
(y) imposes new or additional conditions or otherwise expands, amends
or modifies any of the conditions to the receipt of the Financing in a manner
that would reasonably be expected to (I) delay or prevent the Merger, (II)
make the funding of the Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to
obtaining the Financing) less likely to occur or (III) adversely affect the
ability of Parent, Acquisition Sub or the Company, as applicable, to enforce
its rights against other parties to the Financing Letters or the
definitive agreements with respect thereto; _provided_ , that Parent and
Acquisition Sub may (i) amend the Debt Financing Letter to add lenders, lead
arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities who had not
executed the Debt Financing Letter as of the date of this Agreement or
(ii) otherwise replace or amend the Debt Financing Letter so long as (x) such
action would not reasonably be expected to delay or prevent the Closing, (y)
the terms are not materially less beneficial to Parent or Acquisition Sub,
with respect to conditionality, than those in the Debt Financing Letter as in
effect on the date of this Agreement and (z) otherwise satisfies the
terms and conditions of a New Debt Commitment Letter as set forth in the
third sentence of _Section 6.4(b)_ below. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, Parent and Acquisition Sub may enter discussions
regarding, and may enter into arrangements and agreements relating to the
Financing to add other equity providers, so long as in respect of any
such arrangements and agreements, the following conditions are met: (i) the
aggregate amount of the Equity Financing is not reduced, (ii) the
arrangements and agreements, in the aggregate, would not be reasonably likely
to delay or prevent the Closing and (iii) the arrangements and
agreements would not diminish or release the pre-Closing obligations of the
parties to the Equity Financing Letters, adversely affect the rights of
Parent to enforce its rights against the other parties to the Equity
Financing Letters or otherwise constitute a waiver or reduction of Parents
rights under the Equity Financing Letters. 

   

 (b) Each of Parent and Acquisition Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts (I) to maintain in effect the Financing Letters, (II) to satisfy all conditions to such definitive agreements and consummate the Financing at or prior to the Closing (taking into account the expected timing of the Marketing Period), (III) to comply with its obligations under the Financing Letters, and (IV) to enforce its rights under the Financing Letters. Parent shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably current basis and in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing and provide to the Company copies of all definitive documents related to the Financing (provided that any fee letter related to the Financing shall be provided in a redacted form). If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the Debt Financing Letter (including any applicable lender flex provisions contained in any related fee letter) or the Debt Financing Letter shall be terminated or modified in a manner materially adverse to Parent or Acquisition Sub for any reason, Parent shall make reasonable inquiries over the ensuing twenty (20) Business Days to obtain alternative financing from banks of nationally recognized standing which customarily provide leverage financing for transactions similar to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on terms not materially less favorable to Parent or Acquisition Sub as those contained in the Debt Financing Letter and in an amount not less than the aggregate amount of Debt Financing provided for in the Debt Financing Letter as in effect on the date of this Agreement (" _Alternate Financing_ ") and, if available, use reasonable best efforts to obtain such Alternative Financing 

   ##### 

  

   

and, if obtained, will provide the Company with a copy of, a new financing
commitment letter that (I) provides for at least the same amount of
financing as provided under the Debt Financing Letter originally issued, (II)
does not impose new or additional conditions that were not contained in the
Debt Financing Letter originally issued, or otherwise expands, amends or
modifies any of the conditions that were contained in the Debt Financing
Letter originally issued to the receipt of the Financing in a
manner reasonably expected to (x) delay or prevent the Merger, (y) make the
funding of the Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the
Financing) less likely to occur, and (III) on terms and conditions not
materially less favorable to Parent or Acquisition Sub than those included in
the Debt Financing Letter originally issued (the " _New Debt Financing Letter_
"). To the extent applicable, each of Parent and Acquisition Sub shall use
its reasonable best efforts (I) to maintain in effect the New Debt Financing
Letter, (II) to satisfy all conditions to the definitive agreements with
respect to and consummate the Alternate Financing at or prior to the
Closing (taking into account the expected timing of the Marketing Period),
(III) to comply with its obligations under the New Debt Financing Letter, and
(IV) to enforce its rights under the New Debt Financing Letter. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent and Acquisition Sub shall
give the Company as promptly as reasonably practicable notice and in any event
within two (2) Business Days: (i) of any breach or default by any party to
any Financing Letters or definitive document related to the Financing of
which Parent and Acquisition Sub become aware; (ii) of the receipt of any
written notice or other written communication from any Financing source with
respect to any: (A) breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party
to any Financing Letters or any definitive document related to the Financing
of any provisions of the Financing Letters or any definitive document related
to the Financing or (B) material dispute or disagreement between or among any
parties to any Financing Letters or any definitive document related to the
Financing; and (iii) if for any reason Parent or Acquisition Sub believes in
good faith that it will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the
Financing on the terms, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by the
Financing Letters or the definitive documents related to the Financing.
As soon as reasonably practicable, but in any event within two (2) Business
Days of the date the Company delivers Parent or Acquisition Sub a written
request, Parent and Acquisition Sub shall provide any information reasonably
requested by the Company relating to any circumstance referred to in clause
(i), (ii) or (iii) of the immediately preceding sentence. 

   

 (c) Parent and Acquisition Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause the lenders and any other Persons providing Financing to fund on the Closing Date (taking into account the expected timing of the Marketing Period) the Financing required to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement if all conditions to closing contained in  _Article VIII_ are satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions). 

   

 (d) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Marketing Period_ " shall mean the first period of thirty (30) consecutive calendar days after the date Parent and its financing sources have received from the Company the Required Information.

 (d) by the Company, in the event that (i) the Company is not then in material breach of its covenants, agreements and other obligations under this Agreement which material breach would result in a failure of the condition set forth in _Section 8.2(b)_, and (ii) Parent, Acquisition Sub and/or Guarantor shall have breached or otherwise violated any of their 

  ##### 

  

    

respective material covenants, agreements or other obligations under this
Agreement or the Equity Financing Letter, or any of the representations and
warranties of Parent and Acquisition Sub set forth in this Agreement shall
have become inaccurate, which breach, violation or inaccuracy, individually or
in the aggregate with other such breaches, violations or inaccuracies, (i)
would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in _Section 8.3(a)_
or _Section 8.3(b)_ and (ii) (x) cannot be cured by Parent, Acquisition Sub
and/or Guarantor prior to the Termination Date or (y) if capable of being
cured, shall not have been cured (A) within thirty (30) calendar days

violation or inaccuracy or (B) any shorter period of time that remains

binding and irrevocable offer capable of being accepted by the Company to
alter the terms or conditions of this Agreement during such five (5) Business
Day period, the Company Board shall have determined in good faith, after

giving rise to such Superior Proposal Notice continues to be a Superior
Proposal and resolves to accept such Superior Proposal; _provided_ , that any
termination pursuant to this _Section 9.1(g)_ by the Company shall be
conditioned on and subject to the payment by the Company to Parent of the
Company Termination Fee payable to Parent pursuant to _Section 9.3(b)(i)_; 

   

 (h) by Parent, in the event that (i) the Company Board or any committee thereof shall have effected a Company Board Recommendation Change, or (ii) a tender or exchange offer for Company Common Stock that constitutes an Acquisition Proposal (whether or not a Superior Proposal) is commenced by a Person unaffiliated with Parent and, within ten (10) Business Days after the public announcement of the commencement of such Acquisition Proposal, the Company shall not have filed a Schedule 14D-9 pursuant to Rule 14e-2 and Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act recommending that the Company Stockholders reject such Acquisition Proposal and not tender any shares of Company Common Stock into such tender or exchange offer; or

 9.3 _Fees and Expenses_.

 (ii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section 9.1(g)_ , the Company shall pay to Parent a cash fee equal to the Company Termination Fee, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated in writing by Parent, concurrently with such termination by the Company.

 (c) _Parent Payment_. In the event this Agreement is terminated (i) by either Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section 9.1(b)_ because of Parents inability or failure to obtain the proceeds of the financings described in the Debt Financing Letter or Alternate Financing, where it would have otherwise been obligated to do so due to satisfaction or waiver of the requisite conditions to closing set forth in Article VIII (excluding the conditions that cannot be satisfied until the Closing but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the Closing), prior to such date, or (ii) by the Company pursuant to _Section 9.1(d)_, Parent shall pay to the Company a cash fee equal to $25,356,000 (the " _Parent Termination Fee_ "), by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated in writing by the Company, within two Business Days after such termination.

  ##### 

  

    

applicable, may be payable under more than one provision of this Agreement at
the same or at different times and the occurrence of different events. 

   

 (e) _Liquidated Damages_. 

   

 (i) In the event that Parent shall be entitled to the Company Termination Fee (including reimbursement of Parents Transaction Expenses) pursuant to _Section 9.3(a)_ or _Section 9.3(b)_ , the delivery of such fee shall be deemed to be liquidated damages for any and all losses or damages suffered or incurred by Parent, Acquisition Sub or any of their respective Affiliates or any other Person in connection with or related to or arising out of this Agreement (and the termination thereof), the transactions contemplated hereby (and the abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such termination, and none of Parent, Acquisition Sub, any of their respective Affiliates or any other Person shall be entitled to bring or maintain any other claim, action or proceeding against the Company arising out of this Agreement (and the termination thereof), the transactions contemplated hereby (and the abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such termination. 

  

 (ii) In the event that Company shall be entitled to the Parent Termination Fee (including reimbursement of the Companys Transaction Expenses) pursuant to _Section 9.3(c)_, the delivery of such fee shall be deemed to be liquidated damages for any and all losses or damages suffered or incurred by the Company or any of its respective Affiliates or any other Person in connection with or related to or arising out of this Agreement (and the termination thereof), the transactions contemplated hereby (and the abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such termination, and none of the Company, any of its respective Affiliates or any other Person shall be entitled to bring or maintain any other claim, action, or proceeding against Parent, Acquisition Sub or any of their respective Affiliates or any financing sources (including the parties to the transactions contemplated by the Debt Financing Letter) or their respective Affiliates (each a " _Lender Related Party_ " and collectively, the " _Lender Related Parties_ ") arising out of this Agreement (and the termination thereof), the transactions contemplated hereby (and the abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such termination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is explicitly agreed that Parent shall have no right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(b)_ during the pendency of a Legal Proceeding by the Company for specific performance of this Agreement or the Equity Financing Letters. 

  

 9.4 _Amendment_.

 10.5 _Third Party Beneficiaries_.

 10.7 _Remedies_. 

  

 (a) Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other 

  ##### 

  

    

remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the
exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any
other remedy. 

   

 (b) The parties hereto hereby agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with its specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that money damages or other legal remedies would not be an adequate remedy for any such damages.
