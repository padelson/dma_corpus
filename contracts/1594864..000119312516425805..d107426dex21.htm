agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of its directors, stockholders, partners, officers, employees, and Affiliates that the Company, and not any of its individual Securityholders, is the client of DLA Piper LLP (US) (the &#147;Firm&#148;). After
the Closing, it is possible that the Firm will represent the Securityholders, the Securityholders&#146; Representative and their respective Affiliates (individually and collectively, the &#147;Seller Group&#148;) in connection with the transactions
contemplated herein or in the Escrow Agreement, the Escrow Fund and any claims made thereunder pursuant to this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement. Parent and the Company hereby agree that the Firm (or any successor) may represent the Seller Group
after the Closing in connection with issues that may arise under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, the administration of the Escrow Fund and any claims that may be made thereunder pursuant to this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement. After the
Closing, the Firm (or any successor) may serve as counsel to all or a portion of the Seller Group or any director, stockholder, partner, officer, employee, representative, or Affiliate of the Seller Group, in connection with any litigation, claim or
obligation arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, or the transactions contemplated hereby. Each of the parties hereto consents thereto, and waives any conflict of interest arising from such representation, and each such
party shall cause any Affiliate thereof to consent to waive any conflict of interest arising from such representation. Each such party acknowledges that such consent and waiver is voluntary, that it has been carefully considered, and that the
parties have consulted with counsel or have been advised they should do so in this connection. The foregoing agreement and conflict of interest waiver set forth in this Section&nbsp;11.11 will become effective upon receipt by Parent at the address
set forth in Section&nbsp;11.4, addressed to the attention of the General Counsel, of written confirmation from the Firm that: (1)&nbsp;it will not disclose or use any confidential information that it has obtained from the Company without the prior
consent of Parent and will not otherwise use or disclose any such confidential information in connection with any representation of the Seller Group and (2)&nbsp;it will deliver the Company&#146;s files (excluding accounting records or other
internal Firm documents, e-mails or communications or drafts of any documents) upon request by Parent or the Surviving Company. </P>

counsel, the Firm, on the other hand, to the extent that the privileged communications relate to this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements or to the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. The parties agree that only the Securityholders
shall be entitled to assert or waive such attorney-client privilege in connection with such communications following the Closing. The files generated and maintained by the Firm as a result of the Firm&#146;s representation of the Company in
connection with this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be and become the exclusive property of the Securityholders and shall be segregated from the Firm&#146;s files related
