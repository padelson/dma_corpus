Procedures</I>. Promptly after a person receives notice of a claim or the commencement of an action for which the person intends
to seek indemnification under Section 8(a), the person will notify the indemnifying party in writing of the claim or commencement
of the action, suit or proceeding; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that failure to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve
the indemnifying party from liability under Section 8(a), except to the extent it has been materially prejudiced by the failure
to give notice. The indemnifying party will be entitled to participate in the defense of any claim, action, suit or proceeding
as to which indemnification is being sought, and the indemnifying party may (but will not be required to) assume the defense against
the claim, action, suit or proceeding with counsel satisfactory to it. After an indemnifying party notifies an Indemnified Party
that the indemnifying party wishes to assume the defense of a claim, action, suit or proceeding, the indemnifying party will not
be liable for any legal or other expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense against the claim,
action, suit or proceeding except that if, in the opinion of counsel to the indemnifying party, one or more of the Indemnified
Parties should be separately represented in connection with a claim, action, suit or proceeding, the indemnifying party will pay
the reasonable fees and expenses of one separate counsel for the Indemnified Parties. Each Indemnified Party, as a condition to
receiving indemnification as provided in Section 8(a), will cooperate in all reasonable respects with the indemnifying party in
the defense of any action or claim as to which indemnification is sought. No indemnifying party will be liable for any settlement
of any action effected without its prior written consent. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an Indemnified
Party shall have requested (by written notice provided in accordance with Section 10) an indemnifying party to reimburse the Indemnified
Party for fees and expenses of counsel, such indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of the nature
contemplated hereby effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 45 days after receipt
by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall have received written notice of the terms
of such settlement at least 30 days prior to such settlement being entered into and (iii) such indemnifying party shall not have
reimbursed such Indemnified Party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No indemnifying party
will, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, effect any settlement of a pending or threatened action with
respect to which an Indemnified Party is, or is informed that it may be, made a party and for which it would be entitled to indemnification,
unless the settlement includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability and claims which are the subject
matter of the pending or threatened action.</FONT></P>
