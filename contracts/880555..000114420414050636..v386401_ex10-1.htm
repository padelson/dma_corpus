WHEREAS, AMI and each Investor are entering into and delivering this
Agreement in reliance upon the exemption from securities
registration afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the " _Securities Act_ "), and Rule 506 of Regulation D ("
_Regulation D_ ") as promulgated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission (the " _SEC_ ") under the Securities Act.

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the premises, and other good and
valuable consideration the receipt and sufficiency of all of which is hereby
acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

  



  

1. _Purchase and Sale of Securities_. Subject to the terms, conditions and limitations set forth herein, on the Closing Date (as defined below), AMI agrees to issue and sell to each Investor and each Investor severally, but not jointly, agrees to purchase from AMI, such Investor's pro rata share, as set forth on _Schedule A_ hereto, of the Additional Note Principal Amount (it being understood that in no event shall any Investor be required to purchase more than its pro rata share of Additional Notes).

  



  

2. _Closing_. This purchase and sale of the Additional Notes on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement is referred to herein as the " _Closing_ ," and the date of the Closing is referred to herein as the " _Closing Date_." The Closing shall take place at the offices of Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer and Feld LLP in New York, New York. The Closing shall occur simultaneously with (x) the closing of the Transactions pursuant to the Merger Agreement and (y) the delivery of the consents or waivers and amendments described in Section 7(b)(iii), assuming the satisfaction or waiver of all conditions to the Closing set forth herein (other than conditions which by their nature can be satisfied only at the Closing).

  



  

3. _Purchase Price_. Each Investor shall pay $1,000 per $1,000 of principal amount of Additional Notes to be purchased by such Investor at the Closing plus accrued interest thereon from the most recent date to which interest has been paid on the then outstanding Second Lien PIK Notes. For the avoidance of doubt, the aggregate purchase price payable by the Investors to AMI will be $12.5 million.

Guarantors is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under
the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, has the requisite corporate
power and authority, to own, lease and operate its assets and to carry on its
business as now conducted. AMI and each of the Guarantors is qualified to do
business in, and is in good standing in, every jurisdiction where such
qualification is required, except where the failure to be so qualified or
licensed or to be in good standing, would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect (as such
term is defined in the Merger Agreement).

  



  

(b) _Authority, Enforceability_. AMI and each of the Guarantors has
the requisite corporate power and authority to enter into and perform
this Agreement and, in the case of AMI, to issue and sell the Additional
Notes in accordance with the terms hereof. The execution, delivery and
performance by AMI and each of the Guarantors of this Agreement and the
consummation by them of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly
and validly authorized by all necessary corporate action and no further
consent or authorization of AMI, AMI's board of directors (the " _Board of
Directors_ "), any of the Guarantors, the board of directors (or any
equivalent governing body) of any of the Guarantors, AMI's stockholders or the
stockholders or other equity holders of any of the Guarantors is required.
This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by AMI and each of
the Guarantors and constitutes a valid and legally binding obligation of AMI
and each of the Guarantors enforceable against AMI and each of the Guarantors
in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, liquidation,
conservatorship, receivership, or similar laws relating to, or affecting
generally the enforcement of, creditor's rights and remedies or by other
equitable principles of general application (the "
_Enforceability Exceptions_ ").

  



  

(c) _Issuance of Additional Notes_. The Second Lien PIK Notes
Indenture has been duly and validly authorized by AMI and the Guarantors,
and constitutes a valid and legally binding obligation of each of AMI and the
Guarantors, enforceable against each of them in accordance with its terms,
subject to the Enforceability Exceptions. The Additional Notes to be issued
under this Agreement have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary
corporate action on the part of AMI. The Additional Notes, upon authentication
by a duly authorized signatory of the Trustee in accordance with the terms of
the Second Lien PIK Indenture, will have been duly executed, issued and
delivered by AMI, and when paid for in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, will be the valid and legally binding obligation of AMI,
enforceable against AMI in accordance with their terms, subject to the
Enforceability Exceptions, and entitled to the benefits provided by the

each Guarantor has been duly authorized by such Guarantor. When the
Additional Notes are delivered and paid for pursuant to this Agreement, and
issued, executed and authenticated in accordance with the terms of the Second
Lien PIK Notes Indenture, the Guarantee of each Guarantor endorsed thereon

to the Enforceability Exceptions.

  



  

(e) _No Registration Rights_. Other than the Stockholders'
Agreement, dated as of December 22, 2010, as amended, among AMI
its stockholders party thereto, there are no contracts, agreements or
understandings between AMI or any Guarantor and any person granting such
person the right to require AMI or such Guarantor to file a registration

or any Guarantor of this Agreement, and the consummation by AMI or the
Guarantors of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the issuance and

Guarantors, do not and shall not (i) result in a violation of any provision of
the charter or bylaws or other organizational documents of AMI or any
Guarantor, (ii) conflict with, constitute a default (or an event which, with
notice or lapse of time or both, would become a default) under, or give rise

lease agreement, instrument or obligation to which AMI or any Guarantor is a
party or is bound, (iii) create or impose a lien, charge or encumbrance on

violations, conflicts, breaches, defaults, violations or liens would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company

representations and warranties in Section 6 of this Agreement, AMI is not
required under any applicable federal law, rule or regulation to obtain any
consent, authorization or order of, or make any filing or registration with,

or perform any of its obligations under this Agreement, or to issue and sell

(h) _Absence of Defaults and Conflicts._ No event or condition
which constitutes a default (or an event which, with notice or lapse of
time or both, would become a default) under this Agreement has occurred and
is continuing, except such as has been validly cured or waived.

  



  

(i) _Securities Act_. Assuming the accuracy of the representations
and warranties of each Investor contained in Article 5 and the compliance of
such parties with the agreements set forth herein, it is not necessary, in
connection with the issuance and sale of the Additional Notes to the
Investors (and the issuance of the Guarantees by each Guarantor), in the
manner contemplated by this Agreement, to register the offer and sale of the
Additional Notes under the Securities Act or to qualify an indenture in
respect of the Additional Notes or the Guarantees under the Trust Indenture
Act of 1939, as amended. Neither AMI nor any Guarantors, nor any of their
respective affiliates, nor any person acting on its or their behalf (other
than the Investors, as to whom no representation or warranty is made) has
engaged directly or indirectly in any form of "general solicitation" or
"general advertising" in connection with the offering of the Additional Notes
(as those terms are used in Regulation D) under the Securities Act or in any
manner involving a public offering within the meaning of Section 4(a)(2) under
the Securities Act. Neither AMI nor any Guarantor has entered or will enter
into any arrangement or agreement with respect to the distribution of the
Additional Notes, except for this Agreement. AMI and each Guarantor have
complied with all applicable federal and state securities laws in
connection with the offer, issuance and sale of the Additional Notes and the
Guarantees contemplated by this Agreement. From and after the date hereof and
prior to the completion of the distribution of the Additional Notes, AMI shall
not distribute any offering material in connection with the offering and sale

into and perform its obligations under this Agreement. The execution
and delivery of this Agreement by such Investor and the consummation by such
Investor of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by
all requisite action on behalf of such Investor, and no further consent or
authorization is required by such Investor, its board of directors (or any
equivalent governing body) or its stockholders or other equity owners for the
performance by such Investor of its obligations hereunder. This Agreement has
been duly and validly executed and delivered on behalf of such Investor and
constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of such Investor
enforceable against such Investor in accordance with its terms, subject to
the Enforceability Exceptions.

are being offered in transactions not involving any public offering within the
meaning of the Securities Act, that the initial offering and issuance of the
Additional Notes has not been registered under the Securities Act or any

accordance with any applicable securities laws of the states and other
jurisdictions of the United States, and (ii) it will, and each
subsequent holder of any of the Additional Notes that it purchases in this
offering is required to, notify any subsequent purchaser of such Additional
Notes from it or subsequent holders, as applicable, of the resale restrictions
referred to in clause (i) of this sentence. The Additional Notes will contain
a restrictive legend as set forth in the Form of Note attached as Exhibit A to
the Second Lien PIK Indenture.

resale in connection with, any distribution thereof, and such Investor has no
present intention of selling, granting any participation in, or otherwise
distributing the same.

  



  

(d) No broker, investment banker, finder or other person has been
retained by or authorized to act on behalf of any Investor in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby, and no commission or other remuneration

meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20(a) of the Exchange
Act (each, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") from and against all losses,
claims, damages, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable costs of
defense and investigation and all reasonable attorneys' fees) to which each
Indemnified Party may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise,
insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses arise out
of or are based upon (a) any violation of United States federal or state
securities laws in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement by AMI or any of its affiliates, officers, directors or employees,
(b) any misrepresentation or breach of any representation or warranty made by
AMI in this Agreement or any other certificate, instrument or document
contemplated hereby, (c) any breach of any agreement or obligation of AMI
contained in this Agreement or any other certificate, instrument or document
contemplated hereby or (d) any cause of action, suit or claim brought or made
against an Indemnified Party by a third party (including for these purposes a
derivative action brought on behalf of AMI) and arising out of or resulting
from (i) the execution, delivery, performance or enforcement of this Agreement
or any other certificate, instrument or document contemplated hereby, (ii)
any transaction financed or to be financed in whole or in part, directly or
indirectly, with the proceeds of the issuance of the Additional Notes, or
(iii) the status of each Investor as an investor in AMI pursuant to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the related documents
contemplated hereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that AMI shall not be liable
under this Section 8(a) to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction
shall have determined by a final judgment (from which no further appeals are
available) that such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense
resulted directly from any such acts or failures to act, undertaken or
omitted to be taken by such Indemnified Party through its bad faith or
willful misconduct. AMI shall reimburse the Indemnified Party promptly upon
written demand (with accompanying presentation of documentary evidence) for
all legal and other costs and expenses reasonably incurred by the Indemnified
Party in investigating, defending against, or preparing to defend against any
such claim, action, suit or proceeding with respect to which it is
entitled to indemnification; _provided_ , _however_ , that AMI shall not be
liable for such reimbursement to the extent that a court of competent
jurisdiction shall have determined by a final judgment (from which no further
appeals are available) that such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense
resulted directly from any such acts or failures to act, undertaken or omitted
to be taken by such Indemnified Party through its bad faith or willful
misconduct.

(b) _Indemnification Procedures_. Promptly after a person receives
notice of a claim or the commencement of an action for which the person
intends to seek indemnification under Section 8(a), the person will notify
the indemnifying party in writing of the claim or commencement of the action,
suit or proceeding; _provided_ , _however_ , that failure to notify the
indemnifying party will not relieve the indemnifying party from liability
under Section 8(a), except to the extent it has been materially prejudiced by
the failure to give notice. The indemnifying party will be entitled to
participate in the defense of any claim, action, suit or proceeding as to
which indemnification is being sought, and the indemnifying party may (but
will not be required to) assume the defense against the claim, action, suit
or proceeding with counsel satisfactory to it. After an indemnifying party
notifies an Indemnified Party that the indemnifying party wishes to assume
the defense of a claim, action, suit or proceeding, the indemnifying party
will not be liable for any legal or other expenses incurred by the
Indemnified Party in connection with the defense against the claim, action,
suit or proceeding except that if, in the opinion of counsel to the
indemnifying party, one or more of the Indemnified Parties should be
separately represented in connection with a claim, action, suit or proceeding,
the indemnifying party will pay the reasonable fees and expenses of one
separate counsel for the Indemnified Parties. Each Indemnified Party, as a
condition to receiving indemnification as provided in Section 8(a), will
cooperate in all reasonable respects with the indemnifying party in the
defense of any action or claim as to which indemnification is sought. No
indemnifying party will be liable for any settlement of any action effected
without its prior written consent. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if
at any time an Indemnified Party shall have requested (by written notice
provided in accordance with Section 10) an indemnifying party to reimburse the
Indemnified Party for fees and expenses of counsel, such indemnifying party
agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated
hereby effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered
into more than 45 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the
aforesaid request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall have received written
notice of the terms of such settlement at least 30 days prior to such
settlement being entered into and (iii) such indemnifying party shall not
have reimbursed such Indemnified Party in accordance with such request prior
to the date of such settlement. No indemnifying party will, without the prior
written consent of the Indemnified Party, effect any settlement of a pending
or threatened action with respect to which an Indemnified Party is, or is
informed that it may be, made a party and for which it would be entitled to
indemnification, unless the settlement includes an unconditional release of
the indemnified party from all liability and claims which are the
subject matter of the pending or threatened action.

  



  

If for any reason the indemnification provided for in this Agreement is not
available to, or is not sufficient to hold harmless, an Indemnified Party in
respect of any loss or liability referred to in Section 8(a) as to which such
Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification thereunder, each
indemnifying party shall, in lieu of indemnifying the Indemnified Party,
contribute to the amount paid or payable by the Indemnified Party as a result
of such loss or liability, (i) in the proportion which is appropriate to
reflect the relative benefits received by the indemnifying party, on the one
hand, and by the Indemnified Party, on the other hand, from the sale of
Additional Notes which is the subject of the claim, action, suit or proceeding
which resulted in the loss or liability or (ii) if the allocation provided by
clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is
appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause
(i) above, but also the relative fault of the indemnifying party, on the one
hand, and the Indemnified Party, on the other hand, with respect to the
statements or omissions which are the subject of the claim, action, suit or
proceeding that resulted in the loss or liability, as well as any other
relevant equitable considerations.

exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be
available to any indemnified person at law or in equity.

_however_ , that (i) in no event shall any such termination relieve a party
hereto from liability for its breach or non-performance of its obligations
hereunder prior to the date of such termination, notwithstanding any
termination of this Agreement by any party hereto, and (ii) Section 8 shall
survive termination of this Agreement. Upon the termination of this Agreement,

Any such extension or waiver will be valid only if set forth in a writing signed by the party to be bound thereby. No waiver by any party of any default, misrepresentation, or breach of warranty or covenant hereunder, whether intentional or not, may be deemed to extend to any prior or subsequent default, misrepresentation, or breach of warranty or covenant hereunder or affect in any way any rights arising because of any prior or subsequent such occurrence. Neither the failure nor any delay on the part of any party to exercise any right or remedy under this Agreement will operate as a waiver thereof, nor will any single or partial exercise of any right or remedy preclude any other or further exercise of the same or of any other right or remedy.

17. _Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the internal laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to the principles of conflict of laws that would require the application of the law of any other jurisdiction. By its execution and delivery of this Agreement, each of the Parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees for itself that any legal action, suit or proceeding against it with respect to any matter under or arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment rendered in any such action, suit or proceeding, may be brought in either a state or federal court of competent jurisdiction in the State and County of New York.

18. _Independent Nature of Obligations_. The obligations of each Investor under this Agreement are several and not joint with the obligations of any other Investor, and no Investor shall be responsible in any way for the performance of the obligations of any other Investor under this Agreement. The failure or waiver of performance under this Agreement by any Investor shall not excuse performance by any other Investor.
