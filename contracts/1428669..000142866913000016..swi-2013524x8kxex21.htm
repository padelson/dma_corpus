ARTICLE III

MERGER CONSIDERATION AND CLOSING

3.1 Payment. At the Closing, upon the terms and subject to the conditions
contained in this Agreement, in consideration for the Merger and in full
payment therefor, SolarWinds will make the payments specified in Section
3.5(b) below.

3.2 Adjustments to the Purchase Price.

(a) Initial Adjustment to Estimated Closing Balance Sheet. Not less than two
(2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, N-able shall deliver to
SolarWinds N-able's estimated unaudited consolidated balance sheet as of the
Closing Date (the "Estimated Closing Balance Sheet") and an estimate of the
Closing Working Capital Amount as of the close of business on the Closing Date
(the "Estimated Working Capital Amount"), together with all appropriate
supporting documentation. The Estimated Closing Balance Sheet shall be
prepared by N-able in good faith and in accordance with ASPE (other than with
respect to any unbilled Accounts Receivable, which cannot be determined in
accordance with ASPE).

(b) Closing Balance Sheet. SolarWinds will deliver a proposed Closing Balance
Sheet, prepared in a manner consistent with Section 3.2(a) above (the
"Proposed Closing Balance Sheet"), which Proposed Closing Balance Sheet will
include SolarWinds' determination of the Closing Working Capital Amount as of
the Closing Date, to the Equity Holder Representatives within ninety (90)
calendar days after the Closing Date. If, within fifteen (15) calendar days
following delivery of the Proposed Closing Balance Sheet, the Equity Holder
Representatives have not given SolarWinds notice of their objection to the
Closing Working Capital Amount (including a statement in reasonable detail of
the basis of any such objection), then such Closing Working Capital Amount
shall be considered final. If the Equity Holder Representatives give notice of
an objection, SolarWinds and the Equity Holder Representatives shall use their
respective good faith efforts to resolve any dispute by negotiation. If such
dispute cannot be settled by negotiation within thirty (30) calendar days
after receipt by SolarWinds of the Equity Holder Representatives' notice, the
dispute shall be resolved in accordance with the financial issue resolution
process set forth in Section 3.2(c) below. The Closing Working Capital Amount
as finally determined in accordance with this Section 3.2 shall be referred to
herein as the "Final Working Capital Amount"; the Proposed Closing Balance
Sheet as finally determined in accordance with this Section 3.2 shall
constitute the "Closing Balance Sheet."

(c) Financial Issue Resolution Process. Disputes between SolarWinds and the
Equity Holder Representatives regarding the Final Working Capital Amount that
cannot be resolved by negotiation within thirty (30) calendar days after
receipt by SolarWinds of the Equity Holder Representatives' notice in
accordance with Section 3.2(b) above shall be referred by SolarWinds and the
Equity Holder Representatives, no later than such 30th calendar day, for
decision to a nationally recognized independent public accounting firm
mutually acceptable to the Equity Holder Representatives and SolarWinds (the
"Auditor"), which shall act as arbitrator and determine a resolution of the
dispute, based solely on presentations by the Equity Holder Representatives
and SolarWinds and only with respect to the remaining differences so
submitted. 

The Auditor shall deliver its written determination to SolarWinds and the
Equity Holder Representatives no later than the 30th calendar day after the
remaining differences underlying the dispute are referred to the Auditor, or
such longer period of time as the Auditor determines is necessary. The
Auditor's determination shall be final and binding upon the Parties and not
subject to appeal. The Auditor will determine the allocation of its fees,
costs and expenses in determining the Final Working Capital Amount based upon
the percentage which the portion of the contested amount not awarded to each
Party bears to the amount actually contested by such Party. SolarWinds and the
Equity Holder Representatives shall make readily available to the Auditor all
relevant information, books, records and any work papers relating to the
dispute and all other items reasonably requested by the Auditor (excluding
documents subject to the attorney-client privilege). In no event may the
Auditor's resolution of any difference be for an amount that is outside the
range of SolarWinds' and the Equity Holder Representatives' disagreement.

(d) Finalization and Payment of the Final Purchase Price. The Purchase Price
will be adjusted upwards or downwards by comparing the Final Working Capital
Amount to the Estimated Working Capital Amount. If the Final Working Capital
Amount is greater than the Estimated Working Capital Amount (the amount by
which the Final Working Capital Amount exceeds the Estimated Working Capital
Amount being referred to herein as the "Excess Working Capital Amount"),
SolarWinds shall, within three (3) Business Days after the Final Working
Capital Amount is finally determined pursuant to this Section 3.2, pay to the
Paying Agent for distribution to the N-able Equity Holders, in immediately
available funds, the Excess Working Capital Amount with such amount to be paid
to the N-able Equity Holders, in accordance with each N-able Equity Holder's
Pro Rata Share. If the Final Working Capital Amount is less than the Estimated
Working Capital Amount (the amount by which the Estimated Working Capital
Amount exceeds the Final Working Capital Amount being referred to herein as
the "Working Capital Shortfall Amount"), the Equity Holder Representatives
shall, within three (3) Business Days after the Final Working Capital Amount
is finally determined pursuant to this Section 3.2, pay or cause to be paid to
SolarWinds the Working Capital Shortfall Amount in immediately available funds
out of the Escrow Fund established pursuant to Section 7.4, in accordance with
each N-able Equity Holder's Pro Rata Share as set forth in the Spreadsheet. In
the event that the Equity Holder Representatives for any reason fail to make
any payment contemplated above, then SolarWinds may bring an indemnification
claim under Article VII. The obligations of the N-able Equity Holders under
this Section 3.2 are not subject to the limitations set forth in Section 7.3
hereof.

(e) Currency. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, and
notwithstanding any amounts in the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet, the
Proposed Closing Balance Sheet or the Closing Balance Sheet, or any supporting
documentation thereto, that are reflected in Canadian Dollars, any amounts
determined or adjustments made pursuant to this Section 3.2 shall be made in
U.S. Dollars in accordance with the Bank of Canada Canadian Dollar noon spot
exchange rate for U.S. Dollars on the day that the Estimated Closing Balance
Sheet is delivered.

consummated (the "Closing") at the offices of Squire Sanders (US) LLP, 8000

respect thereof an amount equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the

Common Per Share Amount and the applicable exercise price per share for each
Option Share (the "Option Proceeds"). In addition to the foregoing, each

distributed from the Escrow Fund in accordance with Section 7.4 hereof, such
payments shall be made by SolarWinds and deducted from the Escrow Fund.

(c) Warrants to Purchase N-able US Common Stock.

(i) Prior to the Effective Time, N-able shall have taken all actions necessary
with respect to the Warrants (including providing any required notices
thereunder and delivering with any such notices a warrant cancellation
agreement providing, among other things, that the Warrant Holder agrees that

and cancelled at the Effective Time.

the product obtained by multiplying (A) the number of shares of N-able US
Common Stock underlying such Warrant Holder's Warrants (the "Warrant Shares")
by (B) the positive difference between the Common Per Share Amount and the
applicable exercise price per share for each Warrant Share (the "Warrant
Proceeds"). In addition to the foregoing, each Warrant Holder shall be
entitled to receive, when, if and to the extent paid pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement, such Warrant Holder's Pro Rata Share of (x) the Escrow Cash in

per share, of the Surviving Corporation, and each certificate evidencing
ownership of shares of the Merger Sub's common stock shall evidence ownership
of such shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

3.8 Payment for Options and Warrants and Payment for, and Surrender of,
Shares.

(a) The Paying Agent shall act as paying agent in effecting the exchange of
cash for Shares (or, in the case of a Warrant Holder or an Option Holder, a
Warrant Cancellation Agreement or an Option Cancellation Agreement, as
applicable) entitled to payment pursuant to Section 3.6. As soon as
practicable (and in any event within one (1) Business Day) (i) after the date
hereof, N-able shall provide to each Option Holder who is an employee of
N-able as of the date hereof a properly completed letter of transmittal in
substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit K (the "Letter of
Transmittal") and (ii) after the Effective Time, SolarWinds shall instruct the
Paying Agent to mail to each Stockholder, Warrant Holder and holder of Non-
Employee Options a properly completed Letter of Transmittal, in each case
together with instructions for use of the Letter of Transmittal in effecting
the surrender of (x) in the case of a Stockholder, certificates or instruments
that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented issued and
outstanding N-able US Common Stock or Series E Shares, as applicable, that
were converted into the right to receive consideration pursuant to Section 3.6
(the "Certificates"), (y) in the case of an Option Holder, an Option
Cancellation Agreement and (z) in the case of a Warrant Holder, a Warrant
Cancellation Agreement, in each case in exchange for the applicable portion of
the Closing Cash Consideration. The Letter 

of Transmittal shall include a release of N-able, SolarWinds and the Merger
Sub as well as customary representations and warranties by each N-able Equity
Holder, and shall specify that delivery of the Certificates shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon receipt
thereof by SolarWinds (or, in the case of any lost Certificate, compliance
with Section 3.9), together with a properly completed and duly executed Letter
of Transmittal, duly executed on behalf of each Person effecting the surrender
of such Certificates. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation or a
duly executed Option Cancellation Agreement or Warrant Cancellation Agreement
to the Paying Agent together with such Letter of Transmittal, duly executed,
and such other customary documents as may be required pursuant to such
instructions, the holder of such Certificate or party to an Option
Cancellation Agreement or Warrant Cancellation Agreement shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor a check (or via wire transfer if so elected)
representing the then-applicable portion of the Closing Cash Consideration to
which such Stockholder, Option Holder or Warrant Holder is entitled under
Section 3.6, determined pursuant to this Agreement and as set forth on the
Spreadsheet, and any Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.
Until so surrendered, each outstanding Certificate that, prior to the
Effective Time, represented shares of N-able US Common Stock or Series E
Shares, as applicable, will be deemed, from and after the Effective Time, for
all corporate purposes, to represent only the right to receive upon surrender
the then-applicable portion of the Closing Cash Consideration, in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement and as set forth on the Spreadsheet.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of any N-able Equity Holder holding
greater than five percent (5%) of the Common Equivalents, so long as such
N-able Equity Holder delivers a duly executed Letter of Transmittal no later
than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date and delivers its
Certificates no later than one (1) Business Day prior to the Closing Date, the
Equity Holder Representatives will cause the Paying Agent to use commercially
reasonable efforts to wire the payment payable to any such N-able Equity
Holder pursuant to Section 3.5(b) in immediately available funds on the
Closing Date.

(b) Option and Warrant Cancellation Agreements. As a condition to the payment
to any Option Holder of the Option Proceeds or to any Warrant Holder of the
Warrant Proceeds, such Option Holder or Warrant Holder, as applicable, shall
have executed an Option Cancellation Agreement with respect to such Option
Holder's Options or a Warrant Cancellation Agreement with respect to such
Warrant Holder's Warrants, as applicable, and delivered any such Option
Cancellation Agreement to the Company and any such Warrant Cancellation
Agreement to the Paying Agent.

(c) Closing of Transfer Books. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books
of N-able US shall be closed and there shall not be any further registration
of transfers of any Shares thereafter on the records of N-able US. From and
after the Effective Time, the holders of N-able US' Capital Stock immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to
such shares, except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law. If,
after the Effective Time and through the one-year anniversary of the Effective
Time, Certificates representing any such Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation, they shall be canceled and exchanged for any payment due as
provided in this Article III. No N-able Equity Holder shall be entitled to
receive interest on any amount payable upon the surrender of Certificates. 

(d) Late Surrender. If any N-able Equity Holder fails to surrender and
exchange Certificate(s) by the one (1) year anniversary of the Effective Time,
thereafter such holders shall only be entitled to look to the Surviving
Corporation as general, unsecured creditors thereof (subject to abandoned
property, escheat or similar Laws) to receive amounts payable upon due
surrender of the Certificates and shall not be entitled to receive any
interest thereon.

(e) Escheat, Etc. None of SolarWinds, the Merger Sub or the Surviving
Corporation shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash delivered to
a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law. If any Certificate(s) shall not have been surrendered prior to
seven (7) years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier
date on which any Purchase Price or any dividends or distributions payable to
the holder of such Certificate(s) would otherwise escheat to, or become the
property of, any Governmental Entity), any such Purchase Price or cash,
dividends or distributions in respect of such Certificates shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto.

3.9 Lost Certificates. In the event a Stockholder claims a certificate
representing a Share has been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent will
forward additional documentation and instructions necessary to be completed in
order to effectively surrender the Shares represented by such lost or
destroyed Certificate(s) (including instructions relating to payment by holder
of such lost or destroyed Certificate of an indemnity/surety bond fee equal to
2.25% of the cash value of the Shares represented by such Certificate and a
$150.00 handling fee).

3.10 Dissenting Shares.

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, each
share of N-able US Common Stock or Series E Share that, immediately before the
Effective Time, was held by any Person who has duly exercised in connection
with the Merger the appraisal rights afforded to Dissenting Stockholders
pursuant to the DGCL (such shares, collectively, "Dissenting Shares") will be
converted into the right to receive the fair value of such shares determined
in accordance with the provisions of the DGCL and shall not be converted into
the right to receive the Purchase Price in accordance with this Article III
hereof.

(b) N-able shall generally keep SolarWinds reasonably informed of the status
of any demands for appraisal received by N-able, which shall specifically
include that N-able shall give SolarWinds prompt notice of any demands for
appraisal received by N-able, withdrawals of such demands, and any other
instruments related thereto served pursuant to the DGCL and received by
N-able; provided, however, that N-able shall have the right in its sole
discretion to conduct any such negotiations or proceedings with respect to
demands for appraisal under the DGCL.

(c) If there are any Dissenting Stockholders, SolarWinds shall withhold from
the Closing Cash Consideration the Dissenting Stockholders' Amount. The
Surviving Corporation shall be solely responsible for payment of all amounts
in the event that appraisal and payment rights with respect to any Dissenting
Shares are duly exercised pursuant to Section 262 of the 

DGCL or for paying the Purchase Price to such Stockholders in the event that
appraisal rights were not duly exercised or were withdrawn.

3.11 Equity Holder Representatives.

(a) Gavin Garbutt and David Cusimano are hereby appointed as the N-able Equity
Holders' true and lawful joint representatives, proxies, agents and attorneys-
in-fact (the "Equity Holder Representatives") for a term that shall be
continuing and indefinite and without a termination date except as otherwise

Indemnified Parties on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties, in the name of the
Equity Holder Representatives and (viii) to take all actions and execute such
documents as are or may be necessary or appropriate in the joint opinion of
the Equity Holder Representatives for the accomplishment of the foregoing.
Such agency may be changed at any time and from time to time by the action of
N-able Equity Holders holding more than 50% of the issued and outstanding
Shares that approved the Merger, and shall become effective upon not less than
thirty (30) calendar days' prior written notice to SolarWinds. Except as
provided in the foregoing sentence, in the event that for any reason any
Equity Holder Representative shall no longer be serving in such capacity,
including, without limitation, as a result of the death, resignation, or
incapacity of such Equity Holder Representative, either (A) the outgoing
Equity Holder Representative shall appoint a successor Equity Holder
Representative to serve jointly with the existing Equity Holder Representative
or (B) if the outgoing Equity Holder Representative is unable, unwilling or
otherwise fails to appoint a successor Equity Holder Representative to serve
jointly with the existing Equity Holder Representative, then N-able Equity
Holders holding more than 50% of the issued and outstanding Shares that
approved the Merger shall designate another Person to act as an Equity Holder
Representative, such that, at all times, to the extent practicable, there will
be two Equity Holder Representatives with the authority provided hereunder
acting jointly in all respects. Any change in an Equity Holder Representative
pursuant to the foregoing sentence shall become effective upon delivery of
written notice of such change to SolarWinds. The Equity Holder Representatives
shall not receive compensation for their services. The authority conferred
under this Section 3.11 is an agency coupled with an interest and, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, all authority conferred hereby is
irrevocable and not subject to termination by the undersigned 

or by operation of law, whether by the death or incapacity of any of the
N-able Equity Holders, or the occurrence of any other event.

(b) No Equity Holder Representative shall be liable for any act done or
omitted hereunder in his capacity as Equity Holder Representative in the
absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on his part. The N-able
Equity Holders shall, severally and not jointly, indemnify the Equity Holder
Representatives and hold the Equity Holder Representatives harmless from and
against any and all damages, actions, proceedings, demands, liabilities,
losses, taxes, fines, penalties, costs, claims and expenses (including,
without limitation, reasonable fees of counsel) of any kind or nature
whatsoever (whether or not arising out of third-party claims and including all
amounts paid in investigation, defense or settlement of the foregoing) which
may be sustained or suffered by any Equity Holder Representative as a result
of any good faith error of judgment on the part of any Equity Holder
Representative or for any other act done or omitted in good faith by such
Equity Holder Representative in connection with the administration of his
duties hereunder, except where such losses arise from or are the result of
such Equity Holder Representative's gross negligence or willful misconduct.

(c) Any decision, act, consent or instruction taken or given by the Equity
Holder Representatives pursuant to this Agreement shall be taken jointly
between the Equity Holder Representatives, shall constitute a decision, act,
consent or instruction of all N-able Equity Holders and shall be final,
binding and conclusive upon each such N-able Equity Holder. SolarWinds and the
Merger Sub, and, following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation may
rely upon any such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Equity Holder
Representatives as being the decision, act, consent or instruction of each and
every N-able Equity Holder and shall have no duty to inquire as to the acts
and omissions of the Equity Holder Representatives. The Merger Sub, SolarWinds
and, following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation are hereby
relieved from any liability to any Person for any acts done by them in
accordance with, or otherwise with respect to any aspect of, such decision,
act, consent or instruction of the Equity Holder Representatives.

(d) All expenses, if any, reasonably incurred by the Equity Holder
Representatives in connection with the performance of their duties as the
Equity Holder Representatives will be borne and paid by the N-able Equity
Holders according to their respective Pro Rata Shares. The Equity Holder
Representatives shall establish, on or prior to the Closing Date, a segregated
account with a third party financial institution over which the Equity Holder
Representatives shall have joint control (the "Equity Holder Representative
Account"), into which the Expense Escrow Cash shall be deposited by SolarWinds
at the Effective Time in accordance with Section 3.5(b)(ii). The Equity Holder
Representatives may use the Expense Escrow Cash in their sole discretion, at
any time and from time to time between the date of this Agreement and the
conclusion of the Escrow Period, in connection with the performance of their
duties as the Equity Holder Representatives. Within ten (10) Business Days
following the conclusion of the Escrow Period, any and all of the remaining
Expense Escrow Cash shall be released by the Equity Holder Representatives
from the Equity Holder Representative Account to the N-able Equity Holders in
accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares. 

(e) Notices given to the Equity Holder Representatives in accordance with
Section 9.1 shall constitute notice to the N-able Equity Holders for all
purposes under this Agreement.



ARTICLE IV

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF N-ABLE

N-able US represents and warrants to SolarWinds and the Merger Sub, and
acknowledges that SolarWinds and the Merger Sub are relying upon such
representations and warranties in connection with the Merger and the
consummation of the Contemplated Transactions, that the statements contained
in this Article IV are true and correct as of the date hereof, except as set
forth in the N-able Disclosure Schedule delivered to SolarWinds and the Merger
Sub concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and
attached hereto as Exhibit L (the "N-able Disclosure Schedule"), which
disclosure shall provide an exception to, or otherwise qualify, the
representations or warranties of N-able contained in the section of this
Agreement corresponding by number to such disclosure and to any other
representation or warranty in this Agreement to which the applicability of
such disclosure is reasonably apparent on its face or if the items are
expressly cross-referenced.

4.1 Corporate Organization; Standing and Power. Each of N-able US, N-able
Canada and N-able Direct is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and
in good standing under all applicable Laws. Other than N-able Canada and
N-able Direct, N-able has no subsidiaries. Each of N-able US, N-able Canada
and N-able Direct has the corporate power to own its properties and to carry
on its respective portion of the Business as it is now being conducted and is
duly qualified to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in
which the failure to be so qualified and in good standing would have an N-able
Material Adverse Effect. Section 4.1 of the N-able Disclosure Schedule lists
each of the jurisdictions in which each of N-able US, N-able Canada and N-able
Direct is qualified to do business. N-able has previously furnished to
SolarWinds a complete and correct copy of the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws (or equivalent documents) of each of N-able US, N-able Canada and
N-able Direct, each as amended to date (the "N-able Charter Documents"). None
of N-able US, N-able Canada and N-able Direct is in violation of any of the
provisions of the applicable N-able Charter Documents. Other than N-able US'
ownership of N-able Canada and N-able Canada's ownership of N-able Direct,
none of N-able US, N-able Canada and N-able Direct owns, directly or
indirectly, any equity or similar interest in, or any interest convertible
into or exchangeable or exercisable for, any equity or similar interest in,
nor controls directly or indirectly, any corporation, partnership, joint
venture, limited liability company or other business association, whether
incorporated or unincorporated.

4.2 Capitalization. Section 4.2 of the N-able Disclosure Schedule (a) sets
forth all of the holders of Capital Stock of each of N-able US, N-able Canada
and N-able Direct, who are the sole registered and beneficial holders of all
of the issued and outstanding securities of any kind of any of N-able US,
N-able Canada and N-able Direct (voting or otherwise) and the class and number
of securities held by each holder and (b) specifically identifies any options
or warrants 

that are expected to be exercised or converted on or prior to the Closing
Date. Except as set forth in Section 4.2 of the N-able Disclosure Schedule,
there are no other equity securities of any kind, no options, rights,
warrants, preemptive rights, calls, subscriptions, commitments, stockholder
agreements or other instruments, understandings or contracts (whether oral or
written) outstanding giving any person or entity the right to acquire from any
of N-able US, N-able Canada and N-able Direct or any N-able Equity Holder
(whether by exercise, conversion or otherwise) any securities of any kind of
any of N-able US, N-able Canada and N-able Direct (voting or otherwise) nor
are there any commitments to issue or execute any of the foregoing. None of
the outstanding Shares has been issued in violation of any preemptive rights
of any security holder of N-able or in violation of applicable securities Laws
or any other Law of any jurisdiction applicable to such issuance.

4.3 Authority.

(a) Each of N-able US, N-able Canada and N-able Direct has all requisite
corporate power and authority to enter into this Agreement and the Paying
Agent Agreement (the "Transaction Documents") and to consummate the
Contemplated Transactions. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and
the other Transaction Documents and the consummation of the Contemplated
Transactions have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on
the part of each of N-able US, N-able Canada and N-able Direct. This Agreement
and the other Transaction Documents have been duly executed and delivered by
each of N-able US, N-able Canada and N-able Direct and (assuming due
authorization, execution and delivery by each other party thereto) constitute
the legal, valid and binding obligations of each of N-able US, N-able Canada
and N-able Direct enforceable against each of them in accordance with their
respective terms, subject to (i) Laws of general application relating to
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and the relief of debtors
or similar Laws affecting creditors' rights generally, and (ii) the
availability of specific performance, injunctive relief and other equitable
remedies (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding at law or in
equity).

(b) Except as set forth in Section 4.3(b) of the N-able Disclosure Schedule,
the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Transaction Documents by
each of N-able US, N-able Canada and N-able Direct does not, and the
performance of this Agreement and the Transaction Documents by any of N-able
US, N-able Canada or N-able Direct will not, (i) conflict with or violate the
N-able Charter Documents, (ii) conflict with or violate any Laws applicable to
N-able, or by which any of their respective assets or properties are bound or
affected, or (iii) (A) result in any breach of or constitute a default (or an
event that with notice or lapse of time or both could become a default) under,
(B) impair any of N-able US', N-able Canada's or N-able Direct's rights or
alter the rights or obligations of any third party under, (C) give to others
any rights of termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or (D)
result in the creation of an Encumbrance, other than a Permitted Encumbrance,
on any of the properties or assets of any of N-able US, N-able Canada or
N-able Direct pursuant to, any Contract to which any of N-able US, N-able
Canada and N-able Direct is a party or by which any of N-able US', N-able
Canada's or N-able Direct's properties are bound or affected, except, in the
case of clause (iii), as would not be material. 

(c) Except as set forth in Section 4.3(c) of the N-able Disclosure Schedule,
no consent, approval, order or authorization of, or registration, declaration
or filing with, any Governmental Entity or third party is required by or with
respect to any of N-able US, N-able Canada or N-able Direct in connection with
the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents or the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions, other than any
such consents, approvals, orders, authorizations, registrations, declarations
or filings the absence of which would (i) not prevent or materially delay the
consummation by N-able of the Contemplated Transactions or (ii) result in an
N-able Material Adverse Effect.

4.4 Compliance with Laws. Each of N-able's properties and operations are in
compliance in all material respects with all Laws applicable to any of N-able
US, N-able Canada or N-able Direct except as set forth on Section 4.4 of the
N-able Disclosure Schedule or by which any of their respective properties or
operations are bound or affected (other than Tax Laws, Environmental Laws and
Laws relating to employee benefits or labor matters, which are governed
exclusively by Sections 4.11, 4.12, 4.15 and 4.18, as applicable). None of
N-able US, N-able Canada or N-able Direct has received any notice or other
communication (whether written or, to the knowledge of N-able, oral) from any
Governmental Entity regarding any actual, alleged, possible or potential
violation of, or any failure to comply with, any Law.

4.5 Financial Statements.

(a) In General. Section 4.5(a) of the N-able Disclosure Schedule contains
N-able's audited consolidated balance sheets and statement of operations and
deficits and cash flows as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012
(the "Year End Financial Statements"), and N-able's unaudited consolidated
balance sheets and statements of income and cash flows as of and for the
three-month period ended March 31, 2013 (the "Interim Financial Statements,"
together with the Year End Financial Statements, the "N-able Financial
Statements"). Other than as described in Section 4.5(a) of the N-able
Disclosure Schedule, the N-able Financial Statements (including the notes
thereto) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial condition of
N-able as of the respective dates thereof and the results of operations and
cash flows of N-able for the periods covered thereby, and have been prepared
in accordance with ASPE (except that the unaudited N-able Financial Statements
do not contain all notes required by ASPE and are subject to normal year‑end
audit adjustments the effect of which will not, individually or in the
aggregate, be materially adverse to N-able), applied on a consistent basis
throughout the periods covered thereby (except to the extent disclosed therein
or required by changes in ASPE).

(b) No Undisclosed Liabilities. N-able has no liabilities that would be
required to be accrued on a balance sheet prepared in accordance with ASPE
except for (i) liabilities disclosed in the N-able Financial Statements, (ii)
liabilities incurred by N-able subsequent to the date of the Interim Financial
Statements in the ordinary course of business, (iii) performance obligations
under the executory portion of any Contract by which N-able is bound, (iv)
liabilities under this Agreement and (v) liabilities accrued on the Estimated
Closing Balance Sheet.

(c) Accounts Receivable. Section 4.5(c) of the N-able Disclosure Schedule
provides an accurate and complete breakdown and aging of all Accounts
Receivable as of March 

31, 2013. All Accounts Receivable reflected in the N-able Financial Statements
or recorded on the books of N-able resulted from the ordinary course of
business and have been properly recorded. Subject to the reserves consistent
with prior periods and throughout the periods involved, all billed and, to the
knowledge of N-able, all unbilled receivables are good and collectible in full
without any discount, setoff or valid counterclaim (net of recovery from
vendors or subcontractors), in amounts equal to not less than the amounts
thereof reflected in the N-able Financial Statements.

(d) No Letters of Credit, Bonds or Guarantees. Except as reflected in the
N-able Financial Statements or as set forth in Section 4.5(d) of the N-able
Disclosure Schedule, N-able (i) has no bonds or letters of credit outstanding
as to which N-able has any actual or contingent reimbursement obligations;
(ii) is not a party to or bound, either absolutely or on a contingent basis,
by any agreement of guarantee, indemnification, reimbursement or any similar
commitment, in each case with respect to the liabilities or obligations of any
other Person (whether accrued, absolute, or contingent); or (iii) is not a
party to any swap, hedge, derivative, or similar instrument.

(e) Contingent or Deferred Acquisition Expenses or Payments. Except as
otherwise set forth in Section 4.5(e) of the N-able Disclosure Schedule,
N-able is not obligated or otherwise liable for the payment of any contingent
or deferred acquisition payments relating to the direct or indirect
acquisition of any business, enterprise, or combination.

4.6 Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Since March 31, 2013, N-able has
conducted the Business in the ordinary course of business and there has not
been: (a) any N-able Material Adverse Effect; (b) any transaction, contract or
agreement entered into by N-able, or any relinquishment by N-able of any
contract or other right, in any case materially adversely affecting or that
could reasonably be expected to materially adversely affect N-able or the
Business; (c) any material damage to, destruction or loss of any property of
N-able (whether or not covered by insurance); or (d) any revaluation by N-able
of any of its property for accounting purposes.

4.7 Litigation. Except as set forth on Section 4.7 of the N-able Disclosure
Schedule, there is no private or governmental action, suit, proceeding, claim
or arbitration ("Action") pending before any Governmental Entity or, to the
knowledge of N-able, threatened (including allegations that could form the
basis for future Action), against N-able or, to the knowledge of N-able, any
of its properties, officers, directors or stockholders (in their capacities as
such). There is no judgment, decree or order against N-able that could
reasonably be expected to have an N-able Material Adverse Effect. Except as
set forth on Section 4.7 of the N-able Disclosure Schedule, N-able is not a
party (nor, to the knowledge of N-able, threatened to become a party) to any
Action. N-able has no plans to initiate any Action against any third party.

4.8 Governmental Authorization. Except as set forth on Section 4.8 of the
N-able Disclosure Schedule, the Permits include each federal, provincial,
territorial, county or local governmental consent, license, permit, grant, or
other authorization of a Governmental Entity (a) pursuant to which N-able
currently operates or holds any interest in any of its properties related to
the Business or (b) that is required for the operation of the Business or the
holding of any such interest, and all of such Permits are in full force and
effect, except where the failure to obtain or 

have any such Permits could not reasonably be expected to have an N-able
Material Adverse Effect and, to the actual knowledge of N-able, such Permits
will be available for use by SolarWinds in the Business immediately following
the Closing.

4.9 Title to Property; Assets.

(a) N-able has good and valid title to, or in the case of leased properties or
assets, a valid leasehold interest in, all of its material assets, in each
case free and clear of all Encumbrances, other than Permitted Encumbrances and
those listed on Section 4.9(a) of the N-able Disclosure Schedule. Section
4.9(a) of the N-able Disclosure Schedule lists all tangible property owned or
leased by N-able.

(b) N-able has complied in all material respects with the terms of all leases
to which it is a party, and all such leases are in full force and effect. True
and complete copies of all leases have been made available to SolarWinds.

(c) N-able's assets (other than Intellectual Property assets) include all of
the material assets that are necessary to operate the Business in the same
manner immediately after the Closing as it was operated by N-able on the date
of this Agreement. Its tangible assets are, to the knowledge of N-able, free
from defects (patent and latent), and the assets have been maintained in
accordance with normal industry practice for companies similarly situated to
N-able, are in good operating condition and repair (subject to normal wear and
tear), and are suitable for the purposes for which they are currently being
used by N-able.

(d) To the knowledge of N-able, there are no developments affecting any such
property or assets, pending or threatened, which, individually or in the
aggregate, might reasonably be expected to materially detract from the value
of such property or assets, or materially interfere with the use of any such
property or assets.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 4.9, N-able makes
no representations or warranties in this Section 4.9 regarding any
Intellectual Property assets.

4.10 Intellectual Property Rights.

(a) Section 4.10(a) of the N-able Disclosure Schedule lists or describes (i)
all Registered Intellectual Property Rights owned by, filed in the name of, or
applied for by N-able (the "N-able Registered Intellectual Property Rights");
(ii) all unregistered Trademarks; (iii) all unregistered Copyrights in
computer software and any other material unregistered N-able Intellectual
Property; (iv) Domain Names; and (v) any proceedings or actions before any
court, tribunal (including the PTO, Canadian Intellectual Property Office
("CIPO") or equivalent authority anywhere in the world) related to any of the
N-able Registered Intellectual Property Rights or N-able Intellectual
Property.

(b) Each item of N-able Registered Intellectual Property Rights is valid and
subsisting. All necessary registration, maintenance and renewal fees in
connection with the N-able Registered Intellectual Property Rights have been
paid and all necessary documents and certificates 

in connection with such N-able Registered Intellectual Property Rights have
been filed with the relevant patent, copyright, trademark or other authorities
in the United States, Canada or other foreign jurisdictions, as the case may
be, for the purposes of maintaining such N-able Registered Intellectual
Property Rights. Except as provided in Section 4.10(b) of the N-able
Disclosure Schedule, there are no actions that must be taken by N-able within
one hundred twenty (120) days of the date hereof, including the payment of any
registration, maintenance or renewal fees or the filing of any responses to
actions, documents, applications or certificates for the purposes of
obtaining, maintaining, perfecting, preserving or renewing any N-able
Registered Intellectual Property Right. In each case in which N-able has
acquired any Technology or Intellectual Property Right used in the Business
from any Person, N-able has obtained a valid and enforceable assignment
sufficient to irrevocably transfer all rights in such Technology and any
Intellectual Property Rights (including the right to seek past and future
damages with respect thereto) to N-able. To the maximum extent provided for,
by, and in accordance with, applicable Laws and regulations, N-able has
recorded each assignment related to N-able Registered Intellectual Property
Rights with the relevant Governmental Entity, including the PTO, the U.S.
Copyright Office, CIPO or their respective equivalents in any relevant
jurisdiction, as the case may be. None of the Intellectual Property Rights
used by N-able, other than Intellectual Property Rights licensed from third
parties pursuant to valid license agreements listed in Section 4.10(e) of the
N-able Disclosure Schedule, are registered in the name of any Person other
than N-able.

(c) Each item of N-able Intellectual Property and, to N-able's knowledge, all
Intellectual Property Rights and Technology licensed to N-able (other than
commercially available third party software development tools so long as no
part of such tools is included in the Business' products or services), are
free and clear of any Encumbrances, other than Permitted Encumbrances. N-able
is the exclusive owner of all N-able Intellectual Property.

(d) N-able has no knowledge of any facts or circumstances that (i) N-able
believes may render any N-able Intellectual Property invalid or unenforceable,
including any information or fact that may constitute prior art, (ii) would
render any of the N-able Registered Intellectual Property Rights invalid or
unenforceable, or (iii) would adversely affect any pending application for any
N-able Registered Intellectual Property Right. N-able has not misrepresented,
or failed to disclose, nor does N-able have any knowledge of any
misrepresentation or failure to disclose, any fact or circumstances in any
application for any N-able Registered Intellectual Property Right that would
constitute fraud or a misrepresentation with respect to such application or
that would otherwise affect the validity or enforceability of any Intellectual
Property Right of N-able.

(e) Section 4.10(e) of the N-able Disclosure Schedule lists all licenses,
options or other rights granted by any third party to N-able with respect to
any Technology or Intellectual Property Rights (excluding off-the-shelf, click
wrap or shrink wrap licenses), used in the Business, in each case identifying
the third party and the Intellectual Property Rights. Other than general know-
how and information available in the public domain without charge and without
any restrictions or limitations, the N-able Intellectual Property listed on
Section 4.10(a) of the N-able Disclosure Schedule and the Intellectual
Property Rights licensed to N-able listed on Section 4.10(e) of the N-able
Disclosure Schedule constitute all the Technology and Intellectual Property
Rights used in or necessary to the conduct of the Business, including the
design, development, manufacture, 

use, import and sale of products, technology and performance of services
(including products, technology or services under development at such time).

(f) N-able has taken commercially reasonable steps to protect its rights in
its confidential information in any Technology and in the N-able Intellectual
Property Rights for companies similarly situated to N-able. Except as set
forth in Section 4.10(f) of the N-able Disclosure Schedule, without limiting
the foregoing, N-able requires each employee or independent contractor who is
involved in the development of any N-able Intellectual Property or will have
access to the Trade Secrets of N-able to execute a proprietary information,
confidentiality and inventions assignment agreement (which, for Canadian
employees, also includes a waiver of moral rights), and all such current and
former employees and independent contractors of N-able have executed a valid
and binding agreement in such form that covers the periods of time in which
such individuals were engaged by N-able. N-able has made available to
SolarWinds a true and complete copy of all standard forms of employee
invention assignments and confidentiality agreements that have been used by
N-able.

(g) Except as set forth in Section 4.10(g) of the N-able Disclosure Schedule,
to the extent that any N-able Intellectual Property has been developed or
created by any Person other than N-able or jointly with any Person other than
N-able, N-able has a written agreement with such Person with respect thereto,
and thereby has irrevocably obtained worldwide, perpetual ownership of, and is
the exclusive owner of, all such Technology and associated Intellectual
Property Rights, including the right to seek past and future damages with
respect thereto by operation of law or by valid assignment; and has received
the waiver with respect thereto of all non-assignable rights including but not
limited to all author or moral rights. Each current and former employee or
independent contractor has entered into a valid and binding written agreement
with N-able sufficient to vest title in N-able of all Technology and
Intellectual Property Rights created by such employee or independent
contractor.

(h) All N-able Intellectual Property used in the conduct of the Business has
been developed or created solely by either (i) employees of N-able acting
within the scope of their employment or (ii) third parties, including
independent contractors acting within the scope of their engagement, who have
validly and irrevocably assigned, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
all of their rights, including Intellectual Property Rights therein, to
N-able, and no third party owns or has any rights or claims to any of the
N-able Intellectual Property used in the conduct of the Business, except as
set forth in Section 4.10(g) of the N-able Disclosure Schedule.

(i) No person has licensed any Technology or Intellectual Property Rights to
N-able in connection with the Business (excluding off-the-shelf, click wrap or
shrink wrap licenses). N-able is not in breach of, nor has it failed to
perform under, any of the foregoing contracts, licenses or agreements and, to
N-able's knowledge, no other party to any such contract, license or agreement
is in breach thereof or has failed to perform thereunder.

(j) The operation of the Business, including the design, development, use,
import, branding, advertising, promotion, marketing, manufacture, sale and
licensing of the products, technology or services of N-able did not, does not,
and will not when conducted by SolarWinds in substantially the same manner
following the Closing, infringe or misappropriate any 

Intellectual Property Right of any Person, violate any right of any Person
(including any right to privacy or publicity), or constitute unfair
competition or trade practices under the Laws of any jurisdiction, and N-able
has not received notice from any Person claiming that such operation of the
Business or any act, product, technology or service (including products,
technology or services currently under development) of N-able infringes or
misappropriates any Intellectual Property Right of any Person or constitutes
unfair competition or trade practices under the Laws of any jurisdiction (nor
does N-able have knowledge of any basis therefor).

(k) To N-able's knowledge, there are no material contracts, licenses or
agreements (whether written or oral) between N-able and any other Person with
respect to N-able's Intellectual Property under which there is any dispute
regarding the scope of such agreement, or performance under such agreement
including with respect to any payments to be made or received by N-able
thereunder.

(l) To N-able's knowledge, no Person is infringing or misappropriating, or has
infringed or misappropriated, any N-able Intellectual Property. N-able has not
brought any action, suit or proceeding for infringement of any N-able
Intellectual Property or breach of any license or agreement involving
Intellectual Property Rights against any third party.

(m) No N-able Intellectual Property is subject to any proceeding or
outstanding decree, order, judgment or settlement agreement or stipulation
that restricts in any manner the use, transfer or licensing thereof by N-able
or that may affect the validity, use or enforceability of the foregoing.

(n) All N-able Intellectual Property is fully transferable, alienable or
licensable by N-able without restriction and without payment of any kind to
any third party, other than applicable fees imposed by a Governmental Entity
arising from the recordation of assignments of N-able Registered Intellectual
Property Rights.

(o) N-able has not transferred ownership of, or granted exclusive rights to
use, any Technology or Intellectual Property Right that is or was N-able
Intellectual Property, to any other Person.

(p) The contracts, licenses and agreements listed in Section 4.10(p) of the
N-able Disclosure Schedule include all contracts, licenses and agreements
(whether written or oral) to which N-able is a party with respect to any
N-able Intellectual Property, including, without limitation, any licenses
granted to third parties with respect to any of the N-able Intellectual
Property, except for standard end user license agreements between N-able and
its customers. A true and correct copy of such standard end user license
agreements has been provided to SolarWinds. Any Intellectual Property Rights
used by N-able in the conduct of the Business that are not N-able Intellectual
Property are listed in Section 4.10(e) of the N-able Disclosure Schedule. The
termination or expiration of any inbound licenses of Technology or
Intellectual Property Rights (other than commercially available third party
software development tools so long as no part of such tools is included in
N-able's products or services) will not adversely affect the operation of the
Business. No Person who has licensed Technology or Intellectual Property
Rights to N-able has ownership 

rights or license rights to improvements made by N-able in such Technology or
Intellectual Property Rights which have been licensed to N-able.

(q) Section 4.10(q) of the N-able Disclosure Schedule lists all contracts,
licenses and agreements (whether written or oral) between N-able and any other
Person wherein or whereby, with respect to the Business, N-able has agreed to,
or assumed, any obligation or duty to indemnify, reimburse, hold harmless,
guaranty or otherwise assume or incur any obligation or liability or provide a
right of rescission with respect to the infringement or misappropriation by
N-able or such other person of the Intellectual Property Rights of any Person
other than N-able, except for end user license agreements between N-able and
its customers on the standard forms provided to SolarWinds.

(r) Neither this Agreement, any Transaction Document nor the Contemplated
Transactions, by operation of law or otherwise, or any contracts or agreements
(whether written or oral) to which N-able is a party, will result in (i) any
third party being granted rights or access to, or the placement in or release
from escrow, of any N-able Intellectual Property, (ii) N-able granting to any
third party any right, title or interest to or with respect to any Technology
and Intellectual Property Rights owned by, or licensed to, N-able pursuant to
any agreement to which N-able is a party or by which it is bound, (iii) N-able
being bound by, or subject to, any agreement not to compete or other
restriction on the operation or scope of its business or the Business, (iv)
any restriction on the ability of N-able to share information relating to its
ongoing business or operations, or (v) N-able being obligated to pay any
royalties or other amounts to any third party in excess of those payable by
N-able prior to the Closing Date pursuant to agreements to which N-able is a
party or by which it is bound.

(s) Except as set forth in Section 4.10(s) of the N-able Disclosure Schedule,
N-able does not and has not used any Public Software in connection with the
development of its products or services or incorporated any Public Software
into its products or services. The list in Section 4.10(s) of the N-able
Disclosure Schedule shall contain (i) the name of the Public Software, (ii)
the license name and version pursuant to which N-able has received a license
to use such Public Software, and (iii) a short statement regarding how the
Public Software is being used by N-able. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a)
N-able is in full compliance with all Public Software license agreements to
which it is a party, and (b) N-able's use or incorporation of Public Software
has not and does not (i) grant to any third party any rights in N-able's
products, services or intellectual property, (ii) require the licensing,
disclosure, or distribution of any source code comprising N-able Intellectual
Property, (iii) require N-able to license the use of its products or services
to third parties without charge, or (iv) create restrictions on or immunities
to N-able's enforcement of its Intellectual Property Rights. "Public Software"
means any software that contains, includes, incorporates, or has instantiated
therein, or is derived in any manner (in whole or in part) from, any software
that is distributed pursuant to a license that (1) requires the licensee to
distribute or provide access to the source code of such software or any
portion thereof when the object code is distributed, (2) requires the licensee
to distribute the software or any portion thereof for free or at some reduced
price, or (3) requires that other software or any portion thereof combined
with, linked to, or based upon such software ("Combined Software") be licensed
pursuant to the same license or requires the distribution of all or any
portion of such Combined Software for free or at some reduced price or
otherwise adversely affects N-able's exclusive ownership of such Combined
Software. The term 

"Public Software" includes, without limitation, software licensed or
distributed under any of the following licenses or distribution models, or
licenses or distribution models similar to any of the following: (i) GNU's
General Public License (GPL) or Lesser/Library GPL (LGPL); (ii) the Artistic
License (e.g., PERL); (iii) the Mozilla Public License; (iv) the Netscape
Public License; (iv) the Sun Community Source License (SCSL); (vi) the Sun
Industry Standards License (SISL); (vii) the BSD License; and (viii) the
Apache License.

(t) All data which has been collected, stored, maintained or otherwise used by
N-able and its subsidiaries has been, in all material respects, collected,
stored, maintained, used and disclosed in accordance with PIPEDA and all other
applicable Laws, guidelines, contracts, and industry standards for companies
similarly situated to N-able. Neither N-able nor any of its subsidiaries has
received a notice of non-compliance with applicable data protection Laws,
guidelines or industry standards, except as set forth in Section 4.10(t) of
the N-able Disclosure Schedule. N-able and its subsidiaries have made all
registrations that N-able and its subsidiaries are required by applicable Law
to be made in relation to the processing of data, and are in good standing
with respect to such registrations, with all fees due within one hundred and
twenty (120) calendar days of the date hereof duly paid. N-able and its
subsidiaries' practices are, and have always been, in substantial compliance
with (i) their then-current privacy policy or statement, including the privacy
policy or statement posted on N-able's and its subsidiaries' websites, and
(ii) their customers' privacy policies, when required to do so by contract.
N-able and its subsidiaries have implemented and maintained appropriate and
reasonable measures to protect and maintain the confidential nature of any
personal information. N-able and its subsidiaries have adequate technological
and procedural measures in place in accordance with industry standards for
companies similarly situated to N-able to protect personal information
collected by N-able or a subsidiary of N-able against loss, theft and
unauthorized access or disclosure. N-able and its subsidiaries have the full
power and authority to transfer any and all rights in any individual's
personal information in N-able's and its subsidiaries' possession or control
to SolarWinds. Neither N-able nor any subsidiary of N-able is subject to any
obligation (whether written or oral) that would prevent SolarWinds from using
the personal information in a manner consistent with any Law, guideline,
contract or industry standard regarding the collection, retention, use, or
disclosure of such information.

(u) Each registered Trademark of N-able is used in its jurisdiction of
registration, in association with all wares and services for which it is
registered and in the form appearing in the applicable registration, and has
been used with sufficient continuity in association with those wares and in
such form, and any use by licensee of the Trademark has been controlled and
enforced by N-able, as applicable, so as to avoid any abandonment,
cancellation, expungement or other such challenge against the Trademark
associated with non-continuous use, or otherwise (including the
unenforceability of the Trademark, in each applicable jurisdiction).

(v) N-able and each of its subsidiaries employ commercially reasonable
measures in accordance with industry standards for companies similarly
situated to N-able to ensure that no software contained within N-able's
products or services or otherwise used by N-able contains any material
viruses. For the purposes of this Agreement, "virus" means any computer code
intentionally designed to disrupt, disable, or harm in any manner the
operation of any software or 

hardware or to allow a third party to have access to the user's computer or
network without such user's authority.

(w) N-able owns and has good title to the source code relating to all products
manufactured, sold, licensed, leased, or delivered by N-able and each service
rendered by N-able (collectively, the "Source Code"). The Source Code (i) has
at all times been maintained in confidence, (ii) has been disclosed by N-able
only to employees and consultants who need to have access to such Source Code
and are bound by valid and binding written non-disclosure obligations, (iii)
has not been sold, transferred, or licensed to any customer or third party;
(iv) is not the subject of any escrow or similar agreement or arrangement
(whether written or oral) giving any third party rights in such Source Code
upon the occurrence of certain events except as set forth in Section 4.10(w)
of the N-able Disclosure Schedule; and (v) to the extent such Source Code is
the subject of any escrow or similar agreement or arrangement, no events have
occurred, and no circumstance exists, that would, or would reasonably be
expected to, give rise to the release of such Source Code to such third party.

4.11 Taxes. Except as set forth in Section 4.11 of the N-able Disclosure
Schedule:

(a) N-able, N-able Canada and N-able Direct (each such corporation, for
purposes of Section 4.11, a "Taxpayer," and collectively, the "Taxpayers"),
have timely filed all Tax Returns required to have been filed by them under
applicable Laws, or timely filed extensions related thereto with the
appropriate Governmental Entity, and have paid all Taxes required to be paid
with such Tax Returns required to have been paid by them on or prior to the
Closing Date. The Tax Returns filed with respect to the Taxpayers are true,
correct and complete in all material respects. No Taxpayer will have any
material liability for Taxes for any period ending on or before the Closing
Date, or that portion of any Straddle Period up to and including the Closing
Date, with respect to the operation of the Business, and transactions
occurring, on or before the Closing Date, other than those liabilities for
Taxes reflected as reserves on the N-able Financial Statements.

(b) None of such Tax Returns contains a disclosure statement with respect to
N-able under Section 6662 of the Code (or any predecessor statute) or any
similar provision of state, local or foreign law.

(c) No Taxpayer has received notice that the Internal Revenue Service (the
"IRS"), the Canada Revenue Agency or any other Governmental Entity has
asserted against a Taxpayer any deficiency or claim for Taxes, and no material
issue has been raised by any Governmental Entity in any audit that would
result in a proposed deficiency of any Taxpayer for any pre-Closing taxable
period not so examined, other than any such assessment or issue that has been
fully resolved. No claim has ever been made by a Governmental Entity with
which any Taxpayer does not file Tax Returns that such Taxpayer is or may be
subject to taxation by that Governmental Entity, nor, to the knowledge of
N-able, is there any reasonable factual basis or legal basis for any such
claim. To the knowledge of N-able, none of the Taxpayers has a "permanent
establishment" in any foreign country, as such term is defined in any
applicable Tax treaty or convention between such foreign country and the
Taxpayer's country of residence. 

(d) All Tax deficiencies asserted or assessed against the Taxpayers have been
paid or finally settled with no remaining amounts owed.

(e) There is no pending or, to the knowledge of N-able, threatened action,
audit, proceeding, or investigation with respect to the Taxpayers involving:
(i) the assessment or collection of Taxes, or (ii) a claim for refund made by
a Taxpayer with respect to Taxes previously paid.

(f) All material amounts that are required to be collected or withheld by a
Taxpayer, or with respect to Taxes of a Taxpayer, have been duly collected or
withheld, and all such material amounts that are required to be remitted to
any Governmental Entity have been duly remitted on a timely basis to the
appropriate Governmental Entity.

(g) N-able (i) has not been included in an affiliated group (as defined in
Section 1504 of the Code) and (ii) has no liability for the Taxes of any
Person under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of
state, local, or foreign law), as a transferee or successor, by contract, or
otherwise.

(h) There are no outstanding waivers of any statute of limitations with
respect to the assessment, reassessment or collection of any Tax, the filing
of any Tax Returns or the payment or remittance of any Tax or amount on
account of Tax.

(i) There are no Encumbrances for Taxes (other than Permitted Encumbrances)
due and payable upon the assets of any Taxpayer.

(j) No Taxpayer has participated in, or cooperated with, an international
boycott within the meaning of Section 999 of the Code.

(k) None of the Taxpayers has made nor become obligated to make, nor will any
of the Taxpayers, as a result of any event connected with any transaction
contemplated herein and/or any termination of employment related to such
transaction, make or become obligated to make, any "excess parachute payment,"
as defined in Section 280G of the Code (without regard to subsection (b)(4)
thereof).

(l) There are no outstanding requests for extensions of time within which to
file returns and reports in respect of any Taxes owed by any Taxpayers.

(m) Accruals or reserves for current taxes and deferred tax liabilities as
stated in the Year End Financial Statements, the Interim Financial Statements
and the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet are all in accordance with ASPE
applied in a manner consistent with past practices. With respect to the
Estimated Closing Balance Sheet, such accruals or reserves will be adjusted in
the ordinary course of business in accordance with ASPE in a manner consistent
with that used in prior taxable periods.

(n) There are no amounts outstanding and unpaid for which N-able has
previously claimed a deduction from income under the Income Tax Act or any
other applicable Tax Law and which may be included in N-able's income for any
taxation year ending after the Closing 

Date. There are no circumstances existing which could result in the
application to N-able of Section 17 of the Income Tax Act (deemed interest
income with respect to unpaid amounts owed by non-residents) or Section 79 of
the Income Tax Act (deemed dispositions with respect to the surrender of
property by a debtor) or any equivalent provision under any other applicable
Laws of similar subject matter in any Canadian province. N-able has not
claimed any reserve under any provision of the Income Tax Act or any

negotiations with any Person other than SolarWinds relating to a proposed
Acquisition Transaction, (b) solicit, initiate, encourage or facilitate
making, initiating or submitting any proposal or offer from any Person other
than SolarWinds relating to a proposed Acquisition Transaction, or (c)
participate in any discussions or negotiations or enter into any letter of
intent, agreement or understanding with, or knowingly provide any non-public
information to any Person other than SolarWinds relating to or in connection
with a proposed Acquisition Transaction. If N-able violates or breaches this
Section 6.3 and within six (6) months after the Exclusivity Period, signs a
letter of intent or other agreement for the purchase of a substantial portion
of the assets or business of N-able, and the transaction closes, then N-able
agrees that under these circumstances SolarWinds would be entitled to damages
and that the amount of damages would be difficult and complicated to prove and
N-able agrees to pay SolarWinds an aggregate fee of $6,000,000, which shall
serve as liquidated damages and be the exclusive remedy for breach of this
Section 6.3.

6.4 Employment; Corporation Plans.

(a) SolarWinds may, in its sole discretion, identify N-able employees as
Continuing Employees to receive offers of employment by SolarWinds or its
Affiliates, or continue under such employees' current employment terms with
N-able. Such employment offers to the Continuing Employees shall be effective
as of the Effective Time. Such employment offers or continuation of
employment, as the case may be, to the Continuing Employees shall be on such
terms and conditions as SolarWinds shall determine in its discretion.

(b) Nothing contained in this Article VI shall create any rights in any
Continuing Employee to continued employment for any period after the Closing
Date.

(c) From and after the Closing Date, any Continuing Employee who signs the
necessary paperwork for such employment including the Employee Proprietary
Information 

Agreement (collectively, the "Standard Employee Documents") and chooses to
remain an employee of N-able or become an employee of SolarWinds, as the case
may be, shall be provided with benefits that are substantially similar in the
aggregate to the benefits provided to similarly situated employees of
SolarWinds, and each such Continuing Employee will receive (to the extent he
or she elects to participate and it is permitted by Law) credit for past
service with N-able for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting
(other than with respect to stock options and other equity based awards) under
any Corporation Plan (including any SolarWinds 401(k) plan or for benefit
accrual purposes under any Welfare Plan offered by SolarWinds to such
employee, including (other than for defined benefit pension plans) any
vacation/paid time off policy).

(d) Any compensation amounts related to severance payable under any agreement
between N-able Canada, on the one hand, and the Chief Executive Officer and/or
Chief Financial Officer of N-able Canada, on the other hand, shall be paid by
N-able prior to Closing. Any other amounts payable in connection with the
termination of any employee of N-able who is not a Continuing Employee and
whose employment is terminated after the date hereof shall be paid by
SolarWinds.

(e) N-able will terminate or transfer all N-able employees other than the
Continuing Employees immediately prior to Closing.

(f) Prior to the Closing, N-able shall take all necessary action to terminate
effective immediately prior to the Closing in accordance with applicable Laws
any Corporation Plan that SolarWinds indicates covering any N-able employee.

6.5 Access to Books and Records Following the Closing. Following the Closing,
SolarWinds shall permit the Equity Holder Representatives and their authorized
representatives, during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice, to
have reasonable access to, and examine and make copies of, all books and
records of N-able and/or SolarWinds that relate to transactions or events
occurring prior to the Closing or transactions or events occurring subsequent
to the Closing that are related to or arise out of transactions or events
occurring prior to the Closing; provided, however, (a) that the Equity Holder
Representatives and their representatives shall take such action as is deemed
necessary in the reasonable judgment of SolarWinds and N-able to schedule such
access and visits through a designated officer of N-able and in such a way as
to avoid disrupting the normal business of SolarWinds and/or N-able, (b)
neither SolarWinds nor N-able shall be required to take any action that would
constitute a waiver of the attorney-client or other privilege and (c) neither
SolarWinds nor N-able need supply the Equity Holder Representatives, or their
representatives, with any information which, in the reasonable judgment of
SolarWinds or N-able (as the case may be), is under a contractual or legal
obligation not to supply, including, without limitation, as a result of any
governmental or defense industrial security clearance requirement or program
requirements of any Governmental Entity prohibiting certain persons from
sharing information.

6.6 Certain Tax Matters.

(a) Tax Periods Ending on or Before the Closing Date. SolarWinds shall
prepare, or cause to be prepared, and file, or cause to be filed, on a timely
basis and on a basis reasonably 

consistent with N-able's past practice (unless SolarWinds is advised otherwise
by its independent outside tax consultants that such practice is contrary to
applicable Law), all Tax Returns with respect to N-able for taxable periods
ending on or prior to the Closing Date and required to be filed thereafter
(the "Prior Period Returns"). SolarWinds shall be entitled to be reimbursed
from the Escrow Fund established pursuant to Section 7.4 hereof the reasonable
costs of preparing and filing all such Prior Period Returns. SolarWinds shall
provide a draft copy of such Prior Period Returns to the Equity Holder
Representatives for review at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the due
date thereof. The Equity Holder Representatives shall provide comments to
SolarWinds at least five (5) Business Days prior to the due date of such
returns and SolarWinds shall make all changes reasonably requested by the
Equity Holder Representatives in good faith (unless SolarWinds is advised in
writing by its independent outside tax consultants that such changes (i) are
contrary to applicable Law, or (ii) will, or are likely to, have a material
adverse effect on SolarWinds or any of its Affiliates in any taxable period
ending after the Closing Date). Within five (5) Business Days after the date
on which SolarWinds pays any Taxes of N-able with respect to any Prior Period
Return, the N-able Equity Holders shall, to the extent such Taxes have not
been accrued or otherwise reserved for on the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet
and taken into account as a current liability for purposes of calculating the
Closing Working Capital Amount, pay, or cause to be paid, all Taxes with
respect to N-able shown to be due on such Prior Period Returns. In the event
that the N-able Equity Holders for any reason fail to make the payment
contemplated in the previous sentence, then SolarWinds may bring an
indemnification claim under Article VII.

(b) Tax Periods Beginning Before and Ending After the Closing Date.

(i) SolarWinds shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and file, or cause to
be filed, on a basis reasonably consistent with N-able's past practice, any
Tax Returns of N-able for Tax periods that begin before the Closing Date and
end after the Closing Date (collectively, the "Straddle Periods" and each, a
"Straddle Period"). SolarWinds shall provide a draft copy of such Straddle
Period Returns to the Equity Holder Representatives for review at least ten
(10) Business Days prior to the due date hereof. The Equity Holder
Representatives shall provide comments to SolarWinds at least five (5)
Business Days prior to the due date of such returns and SolarWinds shall make
all changes reasonably requested by the Equity Holder Representatives in good
faith (unless SolarWinds is advised in writing by its independent outside tax
consultant that such changes (i) are contrary to applicable Law, or (ii) will,
or are likely to, have a material adverse effect on SolarWinds or any of its
Affiliates in any taxable period ending after the Closing Date). Within five
(5) Business Days after the date on which SolarWinds pays any Taxes of N-able
with respect to any Straddle Period, the N-able Equity Holders shall, to the
extent such Taxes have not been accrued or otherwise reserved for on the
Estimated Closing Balance Sheet and taken into account as a current liability
for purposes of calculating the Closing Working Capital Amount, pay to
SolarWinds the amount of such Taxes that relates to the portion of such
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date (the "Pre-Closing Tax Period"). In
the event that the N-able Equity Holders for any reason fail to make the
payment contemplated in the previous sentence, then SolarWinds may bring an
indemnification claim under Article VII.

(ii) For purposes of this Agreement: 

(1) In the case of any gross receipts, sales and use, income, or similar Taxes
that are payable with respect to a Straddle Period, the portion of such Taxes
allocable to (A) the Pre-Closing Tax Period and (B) the portion of the
Straddle Period beginning on the day next succeeding the Closing Date (the
"Post-Closing Tax Period") shall be determined on the basis of a deemed
closing at the end of the Closing Date of the books and records of N-able.

(2) In the case of any Taxes (other than gross receipts, sales and use,
income, or similar Taxes) that are payable with respect to a Straddle Period,
the portion of such Taxes allocable to the portion of the Straddle Period
prior to the Closing Date shall be equal to the product of all such Taxes
multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the
Straddle Period from the commencement of the Straddle Period through and
including the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days
in the entire Straddle Period; provided, however, that appropriate adjustments
shall be made to reflect specific events that can be identified and
specifically allocated as occurring on or prior to the Closing Date (in which
case the N-able Equity Holders shall be responsible for any Taxes related
thereto) or occurring after the Closing Date (in which case, SolarWinds shall
be responsible for any Taxes related thereto). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Section 6.6(d) will exclusively govern the allocation of Taxes described
therein.

(iii) SolarWinds shall be responsible for any Taxes with respect to the Post-
Closing Tax Period of the Straddle Periods.

(c) Cooperation on Tax Matters.

(i) SolarWinds and the Equity Holder Representatives shall cooperate fully, as
and to the extent reasonably requested by any Party, in connection with the
filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this Section and any audit, litigation, or
other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the
retention and (upon the other party's request) the provision of records and
information reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation, or other
proceeding (including any determination by SolarWinds of any limitation on the
net operating losses or other tax attributes of N-able under Code Sections
382, 383 or 384) and making their respective employees, outside consultants
and advisors available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. SolarWinds and
the Equity Holder Representatives, on behalf of the Equity Holders, agree (A)
to retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to
N-able relating to any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until
the expiration of the statute of limitations (and, to the extent notified by
SolarWinds or the Equity Holder Representatives, any extensions thereof) of
the respective taxable periods, and to abide by all record retention
agreements entered into with any Governmental Entity, and (B) to give the
other reasonable written notice prior to transferring, destroying or
discarding any such books and records and, if the other so requests,
SolarWinds or the Equity Holder Representatives, as the case may be, shall
allow the other to take possession of such books and records.

(ii) SolarWinds and the Equity Holder Representatives further agree, upon
request, to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or
other document from any Governmental Entity or any other Person as may be
necessary to mitigate, reduce or 

eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including, but not limited to, with
respect to the Contemplated Transactions).

(iii) The Equity Holder Representatives further agree, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by SolarWinds, to provide SolarWinds with all information
that SolarWinds may require to satisfy the requirements of FASB Interpretation
48.

(d) Certain Taxes. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration
and other such Taxes and fees (including any penalties and interest) incurred
in connection with the Contemplated Transactions (including any transfer or
similar tax imposed by any Governmental Entity) shall be shared equally
between SolarWinds on the one hand and the N-able Equity Holders on the other,
and each shall be responsible for one-half of such Taxes. The Party required
by Law to do so will file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation
with respect to all such transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other Taxes and fees, and, if required by applicable Law, the
other Parties will join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other
documentation.

(e) Treatment of Options. As Canadian employers, N-able Canada and N-able
Direct shall, and following the Closing SolarWinds shall cause N-able Canada
and N-able Direct to, and SolarWinds, N-able Canada and N-able Direct shall
cause any person not dealing at arms'-length with such employers to, elect not
to deduct amounts paid to their employee Option Holders for the cancellation
of Options pursuant to Section 3.6(b) in computing such corporation's or non-
arms'-length person's income for Canadian income tax purposes. The holders of
Options are intended to be third party beneficiaries of this Section 6.6(e)
from and after the Closing.

(f) Indemnification and Tax Contests. SolarWinds' and the N-able Equity
Holders' payment and indemnification obligations with respect to the covenants
in this Section 6.6 together with the procedures to be observed in connection
with any Tax contest, shall be governed by Article VII. 

6.7 Spreadsheet. Not less than two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, N-able shall deliver to SolarWinds a spreadsheet (the "Estimated
Spreadsheet") substantially in the form of Section 4.2 of the N-able
Disclosure Schedule, which Estimated Spreadsheet shall, in addition to the
information set forth on Section 4.2 of the N-able Disclosure Schedule,
include, as of the Closing (on a pro forma basis) (i) a list of all N-able
Equity Holders and their respective addresses (to the extent known), (ii) the
number of shares of N-able Capital Stock held by such N-able Equity Holders,
(iii) the portion of the Purchase Price due to each N-able Equity Holder, (iv)
the amount of the Escrow Cash to be deposited with the Escrow Agent on behalf
of each N-able Equity Holder and (v) the Pro Rata Share of each N-able Equity
Holder. At or prior to the Closing, N-able shall revise the Estimated
Spreadsheet to reflect any changes or correct any inaccuracies set forth in
the Estimated Spreadsheet provided pursuant to the first sentence of this
Section 6.7 (such final spreadsheet delivered to SolarWinds pursuant to
Section 3.5(a)(iv), the "Spreadsheet").

6.8 Director and Officer Liability.

(a) SolarWinds agrees that all rights to indemnification for acts or omissions
occurring prior to the Closing existing as of the date of this Agreement under
(i) any N-able Charter Document or (ii) any written agreement pursuant to
which N-able US, N-able Canada and/or N-able Direct is a party providing for
indemnification in favor of the current and former directors and/or officers
of N-able US, N-able Canada and/or N-able Direct shall survive the Closing and
shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms
following the Closing, and SolarWinds shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, fulfill and honor such obligations to the maximum extent
permitted by applicable Law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, this Section 6.8(a) is intended to benefit each Person who was a
director and/or an officer of N-able prior to the Closing, and shall be
binding on all successors of SolarWinds and N-able. SolarWinds hereby
guarantees the payment and performance by the Surviving Corporation of the
indemnification and other obligations pursuant to this Section 6.8(a) and the
N-able Charter Documents. In the event that SolarWinds, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their successors or assigns (a) consolidates with or
merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
Person of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors, assigns
and transferees of SolarWinds or the applicable N-able entity or their
respective successors or assigns, as the case may be, assume the obligations
set forth in this Section 6.8(a).

(b) Prior to the Closing, N-able US shall obtain and fully pay for "tail"
insurance policies with a claims period of at least (6) six years from the
Closing Date from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating
as N-able US' current insurance carrier with respect to the directors' and
officers' liability insurance in an amount and scope at least as favorable as
N-able US' existing policies with respect to matters existing or occurring at
or prior to the Closing Date.

(c) The provisions of this Section 6.8 shall survive the Closing and are
intended to be for the benefit of, and enforceable by, each current director
and officer of N-able and his or her heirs and personal representatives, and
nothing in this Agreement shall affect any indemnification rights that any
such current director or officer and his or her heirs and personal
representatives may 

have under the N-able Charter Documents or any Contract or applicable Law. The
obligations of SolarWinds under this Section 6.8 shall not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any indemnitee to whom this
Section 6.8 applies without the express written consent of such affected
indemnitee (it being expressly agreed that the indemnitees to whom this
Section 6.8 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section 6.8).



6.9 Further Assurances. The Parties shall execute such further documents, and
perform such further acts, as may be necessary to transfer and convey the
Business to SolarWinds, on the terms herein contained, and to otherwise comply
with the terms of this Agreement and consummate the Contemplated Transactions.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Equity Holder
Representatives agree, on behalf of the N-able Equity Holders, to assist
SolarWinds, N-able or its or their designee, in every proper way, to secure
the rights of SolarWinds or N-able in any N-able Intellectual Property Rights,
including the completion and filing of any patent, trademark or copyright
applications with the PTO, CIPO or any foreign agency.



ARTICLE VII 

ESCROW AND INDEMNIFICATION

7.1 Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants. The Indemnifying
Parties' liability for Damages resulting from the breach of any covenant of
N-able, to the extent to be performed pre-Closing under this Agreement, or
breach of any representations or warranties of N-able under this Agreement,
shall survive the Closing and continue until that date that is eighteen (18)
months following the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing:

(a) (i) claims for indemnification based on breaches of representations and
warranties in connection with Section 4.11 (Taxes) shall survive through and
until that date that is sixty (60) days after the last day upon which any
Governmental Entity is entitled to assess or reassess N-able with respect to
any Tax, having regard to any waivers given by N-able in respect of the Tax,
and any entitlement of a Governmental Entity to assess or reassess in the
event of fraud or misrepresentation or attributable to neglect, carelessness
or willful default and (ii) claims for indemnification based on breaches of
representations and warranties in connection with Section 4.12 (Employee
Benefit Plans) shall survive through and until that date that is thirty (30)
days after the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (together,
the "Statute of Limitation Claims"); and

(b) claims for indemnification based on breaches of representations and
warranties in connection with Section 4.1 (N-able Corporate Organization,
Standing and Power), Section 4.2 (Capitalization), Section 4.3 (Authority),
Section 4.9 (Title to Property and Assets), Section 4.21 (Brokers or Finders)
and fraud, willful misrepresentation and willful breach shall survive
indefinitely ("Indefinite Claims").



The Statute of Limitation Claims and Indefinite Claims are collectively the
"Surviving Claims." Unless otherwise specified herein, to the extent that any
covenants in this Agreement describe performance by the Parties hereto from
and after the Closing, such covenants shall survive the Closing until such
covenants are fully performed by the applicable Party or waived by the
beneficiaries thereof.

7.2 Indemnification.

(a) From and after the Closing, and subject to the provisions of Section 7.1
and Section 7.3, the N-able Equity Holders (the "Indemnifying Parties") shall,
severally (in proportion to their respective Pro Rata Shares) and not jointly,
indemnify and hold harmless SolarWinds, the Surviving Corporation and their
Affiliates, and their stockholders, directors, officers, employees and agents
(the "Indemnified Parties") against, and reimburse them for, any actual
liability, damage, loss, obligation, demand, judgment, fine, penalty, cost or
expense (including reasonable out-of-pocket legal fees and expenses, and the
reasonable out-of-pocket costs of investigation incurred in defending against
or settling such liability, damage, loss, cost or expense or claim therefor
and, subject to Section 7.5, any amounts paid in settlement thereof) imposed
on or reasonably incurred by the Indemnified Parties (collectively, the
"Damages") as a result of (i) the breach of any covenant of N-able, to the
extent to be performed pre-Closing under this Agreement, or breach of any
representations or warranties on the part of N-able under this Agreement, (ii)
fraud and willful misrepresentation by N-able, (iii) willful breach by N-able,
(iv) Taxes, as provided in paragraph (b) of this Section 7.2 to the extent
such Taxes have not been deducted in the calculation of the Purchase Price (it
being the intent of the Parties that all of the provisions of this Agreement
shall be interpreted to avoid requiring the N-able Equity Holders to pay twice
for the same Tax or other liability), (v) any claim by any former or other
equity interest owner of N-able for any transaction prior to the Effective
Time involving N-able Capital Stock or other equity interests of N-able, (vi)
any expenses or payments of N-able incurred in connection with the
Contemplated Transactions prior to Closing but not included in the Estimated
Closing Balance Sheet or the Closing Balance Sheet and (vii) any Working
Capital Shortfall Amount as finally determined in accordance with Section 3.2.

(b) The obligations of the N-able Equity Holders under paragraph (a) of this
Section 7.2 shall extend to (A) all Taxes of N-able with respect to taxable
periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date and (B) all Taxes of N-able
with respect to Straddle Periods to the extent that such Taxes are allocable
to the period prior to Closing pursuant to Section 7.7(e), but excluding any
Taxes resulting from any action taken by SolarWinds or its Affiliates outside
the ordinary course of business on the Closing Date or after the Closing with
respect to N-able (the "Pre-Closing Taxes"). Such obligations shall be without
regard to whether there was any breach of any representation or warranty under
Article IV with respect to such Tax or any disclosures that may have been made
with respect to Article IV or otherwise. The indemnification obligations under
this paragraph (b) shall apply even if the additional Tax liability results
from the filing of a Tax Return or amended Tax Return with respect to a pre-
Closing Date transaction or period (or portion of a period) by SolarWinds
provided that the filing of any such amended Tax Return is done in accordance
with the provisions of this Section 7.2(b). SolarWinds shall not cause or
permit N-able to file an amended Tax Return with respect to any taxable period
ending on or prior to the Closing Date or any Straddle Period unless (i) the
Equity Holder Representatives provide their prior written consent to the
filing 

of such amended Tax Return, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned, or delayed, or (ii) SolarWinds obtains a legal opinion from
counsel reasonably acceptable to the Equity Holder Representatives that such
amendment is legally required to be filed by a Governmental Entity pursuant to
the resolution of any Tax audit or administrative or court proceeding relating
to Taxes (provided, further, that such legal opinion may not assume any facts
that are disputed in good faith by the Equity Holder Representatives). In the
event of any conflict between the provisions of this Section 7.2(b) and any
other provision of this Agreement, the provisions of this Section shall
control.

(c) Any payments made to any Party pursuant to this Article VII shall
constitute an adjustment of the Purchase Price for Tax purposes and shall be
treated as such by SolarWinds and the N-able Equity Holders and their
respective Affiliates on their Tax returns unless otherwise required by a
Governmental Entity.

7.3 Limitations on Indemnification Obligations. The rights of an Indemnified
Party to indemnification pursuant to the provisions of Section 7.2 are subject
to the following limitations:

(a) An Indemnified Party shall not be entitled to recover Damages under
Section 7.2 until the cumulative amount of Damages claimed by the Indemnified
Parties exceeds $650,000, in which case, such Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to indemnification for all Damages in excess of (but not including)
such amount. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the limitations contained in this
Section 7.3(a) shall not apply to Excluded Damages, as defined below.

(b) Except for injunctive relief and similar equitable remedies and except for
Damages relating to or arising out of (i) fraud, willful misrepresentation or
willful breach by N-able, (ii) any breach of the Surviving Claims, (iii) any
payment due SolarWinds under Section 3.2(d) or Section 6.6, or (iv) claims set
forth in Section 7.2(a)(iv), (v), or (vi) above (collectively, the "Excluded
Damages"), recourse to the Escrow Fund in accordance with the provisions
hereof shall be the Indemnified Parties' sole and exclusive remedy available
for any Damages under Section 7.2 above, subject to the below provisions of
this Section 7.3; provided, however, that with respect to Excluded Damages,
the Indemnified Parties shall first be required to satisfy such Excluded
Damages from the Escrow Fund and, if the Escrow Fund is insufficient to
satisfy such Excluded Damages or has been released in accordance with Section
7.4, then the Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to seek recourse from
other sources.

(c) The Indemnifying Parties shall not be liable for any Damages to the extent
that such Damages have been reserved for on the Closing Balance Sheet and
taken into account in calculating the Closing Working Capital Amount or have
been otherwise recovered by any Indemnified Party or satisfied by any other
Person including, without limitation, as a result of any Indemnified Party
receiving or being reasonably able to receive compensation for such Damages
pursuant to any policy of insurance maintained by any Indemnified Party.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in no event
shall: (i) any Indemnifying Party's aggregate liability with respect to
Damages, other than Excluded Damages, arising out of or relating to this
Agreement exceed such N-able Equity Holder's Pro Rata Share of the Escrow
Cash; (ii) any Indemnifying Party's liability with respect to Damages in
respect 

of any indemnification claim hereunder exceed (A) the amount of such Damages
indemnified by all Indemnifying Parties in respect of any such indemnification
claim multiplied by (B) such Indemnifying Party's Pro Rata Share; (iii) any
Indemnifying Party's aggregate liability with respect to Damages arising out
of or relating to this Agreement exceed such Indemnifying Party's net proceeds
received in connection with the Merger; or (iv) the Indemnifying Parties'
collective aggregate liability with respect to Damages arising out of or
relating to this Agreement exceed the Purchase Price.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, N-able shall
not have any Liability under any provision of this Agreement for (i) any
Damages consisting of any diminution in value, (ii) any punitive, incidental,
consequential, special or indirect Damages or (iii) any Damages consisting of
multiples of EBITDA, discounted cash flow or other multiples used to determine
the Purchase Price hereunder, except, with respect to clauses (i), (ii) and
(iii), to the extent such Damages are payable to a third party pursuant to a
Third Party Claim; provided, however, that N-able will be liable for any
Damages consisting of lost revenue, profits or earnings, or increased
expenses.



7.4 Escrow.

(a) At the Closing, pursuant to Section 3.5(b), SolarWinds will deposit the
Escrow Cash, without any act of the N-able Equity Holders, with the Escrow
Agent, such deposit to constitute an escrow fund (the "Escrow Fund") to be
governed by the terms set forth herein. The Escrow Cash may be invested as
jointly directed in writing by SolarWinds and the Equity Holder
Representatives from time to time. In the absence of joint written
instructions, the Escrow Cash shall be invested by the Escrow Agent in a U.S.
Bank, National Association, money market deposit account, as more fully
described on Exhibit M hereto. Any interest, earnings and income that accrue
upon the Escrow Cash during the period of time during which the Escrow Cash is
held in the Escrow Fund shall be deemed to be part of the Escrow Fund.

(b) Subject to the following requirements, the Escrow Fund shall remain in
existence through and until that date that is eighteen (18) months following
the Closing Date (the "Escrow Period"). Upon the expiration of the Escrow
Period, and within ten (10) Business Days thereafter, any and all of the
remaining Escrow Cash shall be released from the Escrow Fund to the Paying
Agent for distribution to the N-able Equity Holders after accounting for (i)
all amounts theretofore validly distributed out of the Escrow Fund to the
Indemnified Parties pursuant to this Article VII and (ii) the retention of an
amount of Escrow Cash equal to such portion of the remaining Escrow Fund
which, subject to the objection of the Equity Holder Representatives and the
subsequent arbitration of the matter in a manner consistent with this Article
VII, is necessary to satisfy any unsatisfied claims specified in any Damages
Certificate (as defined in Section 7.5(a) below) delivered to the Equity
Holder Representatives prior to the end of the Escrow Period in accordance
with the terms set forth in this Article VII, which amount shall remain in the
Escrow Fund (and the Escrow Fund shall remain in existence) until such claims
have been resolved in accordance with the terms hereof. Within two (2)
Business Days of the resolution of any such claims (such resolution to be
evidenced by the written agreement of SolarWinds and the Equity Holder
Representatives or 

the written decision of the arbitrators as described below), the Escrow Agent
shall deliver to the Paying Agent for distribution to the N-able Equity
Holders in immediately available funds, the remaining portion of the Escrow
Fund not required to satisfy any remaining claims with such amount to be paid
to the N-able Equity Holders pro rata in accordance with each N-able Equity
Holder's proportionate interest as set forth on the Spreadsheet.

7.5 Notices; Payment of Damages.

(a) In the event that any Indemnified Party has determined that it has
incurred or sustained Damages or that it reasonably anticipates that it will
incur or sustain Damages, the Indemnified Party shall, within ten (10)
Business Days of making any such determination, deliver to the Equity Holder
Representatives a certificate signed by any officer of the Indemnified Party
(a "Damages Certificate") (i) stating that the Indemnified Party has incurred
or sustained Damages or reasonably anticipates that it could incur or sustain
Damages and (ii) specifying in reasonable detail the individual items of
Damages included and the basis for such anticipated liability.

(b) The Equity Holder Representatives shall have thirty (30) calendar days
following their receipt of a Damages Certificate to object to any claim or
claims made in a Damages Certificate. In the event that the Equity Holder
Representatives have not objected within such thirty (30) calendar day period
to a Damages Certificate, then the Escrow Agent shall remit to the Indemnified
Party an amount of Escrow Cash that is equal to the amount set forth in such
Damages Certificate and the Escrow Fund shall be reduced by such amount. In
the event that the Equity Holder Representatives so object within such thirty
(30) calendar day period, such objection must be in the form of a certificate
signed by the Equity Holder Representatives and delivered to the Indemnified
Party (an "Objection Certificate"), which certificate shall set forth the
item(s) of Damages in the Damages Certificate to which the Equity Holder
Representatives are objecting and a reasonable basis for each such objection.

(c) For a period of fifteen (15) calendar days after the delivery of an
Objection Certificate, the Indemnified Party and the Equity Holder
Representatives shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of the
respective Parties with respect to each of such claims as are objected to
therein. If such an agreement is reached as to all or any portion of the
Damages that are subject to the Objection Certificate, then a memorandum
setting forth such agreement shall be prepared and signed by both Parties and,
where an Indemnified Party is entitled to be compensated from the Escrow Fund,
shall be furnished to the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to
rely on any such memorandum. If no such agreement can be reached after good
faith negotiation, either the Equity Holder Representatives or the Indemnified
Party may demand arbitration of the matter unless the amount of the damage or
loss is at issue in pending litigation with a third party, in which event
arbitration shall not be commenced until such amount is ascertained or both
Parties agree to arbitration; and in either such event the matter shall be
settled by arbitration conducted by one arbitrator mutually agreeable to the
Equity Holder Representatives and the Indemnified Parties. In the event that
within forty-five (45) calendar days after submission of any dispute to
arbitrators the Equity Holder Representatives and the Indemnified Parties
cannot mutually agree on one arbitrator, the Equity Holder Representatives and
the Indemnified Parties shall each select one arbitrator, and the two
arbitrators so selected shall select a third arbitrator. The arbitrator(s)
shall set a limited time 

period and establish procedures designed to reduce the cost and time for
discovery while allowing the Parties an opportunity, adequate in the sole
judgment of the arbitrator or a majority of the three arbitrators, as the case
may be, to discover relevant information from the opposing Parties about the
subject matter of the dispute. The arbitrator or a majority of the three
arbitrators, as the case may be, shall rule upon motions to compel or limit
discovery and shall have the authority to impose sanctions, including
reasonable legal fees and costs, to the same extent as a competent court of
law or equity, should the arbitrator or a majority of the three arbitrators,
as the case may be, determine that discovery was sought without substantial
justification or that discovery was refused or objected to without substantial
justification. The decision of the arbitrator or a majority of the three
arbitrators, as the case may be, as to the validity and amount of any claim
objected to in such Objection Certificate shall be binding and conclusive upon
the Parties. Such decision shall be written and shall be supported by written
findings of fact and conclusions which shall set forth the award, judgment,
decree or order awarded by the arbitrator(s).

(d) Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any
court having jurisdiction. Any such arbitration shall be held in Wilmington,
Delaware, under the rules then in effect of the American Arbitration
Association. The payment of all fees and expenses of the Parties to any such
arbitration, as well as the fees of the arbitrator(s) and the administrative
fee of the American Arbitration Association, shall be payable in accordance
with Section 9.10 below.

(e) For federal and state income tax purposes, SolarWinds, the N-able Equity
Holders and the Escrow Agent agree to treat the Escrow Fund in the following
manner: (i) SolarWinds shall be treated as the owner of the Escrow Fund and
thus shall take into account in filing its income tax returns all items of
income, gain, loss and deduction with respect to the Escrow Fund, and (ii) the
Escrow Agent shall report the income on the Escrow Fund on Internal Revenue
Service Form 1099 showing the Escrow Agent as payor and SolarWinds as payee.
SolarWinds shall be entitled to receive from the Escrow Fund, no more often
than quarterly, a tax distribution in an amount equal to 40% of the excess of
(i) the taxable income attributable to the Escrow Fund earned during such
quarter or relevant period, over (ii) the amount of income that would have
been earned during such period if the Escrow Fund generated earnings at the
short-term applicable federal rate released by the Internal Revenue Service
and in effect on the Closing Date, compounded semiannually. This tax
distribution is intended to provide for the payment of income taxes on the
income that is allocable to SolarWinds pursuant to Section 7.5(e) above,
offset by expected imputed interest deductions. Any amount distributed from
the Escrow Fund to the N-able Equity Holders shall be treated as a payment
pursuant to SolarWinds' obligation to the N-able Equity Holders arising from
the N-able Equity Holders' sale of the Business to which the installment sale
provisions of Section 453 of the Code and the unstated interest provisions of
Section 483 or 1274 of the Code apply. Each of SolarWinds and the N-able
Equity Holders shall provide the Escrow Agent with a completed IRS Form W-9
indicating its taxpayer identification number. Neither SolarWinds nor the
N-able Equity Holders shall take any position for federal or state income Tax
purposes that is inconsistent with the provisions of this Section 7.5(e).



7.6 Tax Adjustments. In determining the amount of any Damages under this
Article VII, such Damages shall be increased (or decreased) to take into
account any Tax Cost (or Tax Benefit) incurred or enjoyed by the Indemnified
Party as a result of the matter giving rise to such Damages and the receipt of
an indemnity payment hereunder. For purposes of such adjustments, any Tax Cost
shall include any further cost resulting from such increased payment, and any
Tax Benefit shall result in a decrease to the amount of the Damages at such
time as the Tax Benefit is actually realized by the Indemnified Party;
provided, however, that if any such Tax Benefit is later reduced or eliminated
by any Governmental Entity, the Indemnifying Party shall indemnify the
Indemnified Party for the amount of such Tax Benefit to the extent such Tax
Benefit had reduced any Damages for which the Indemnifying Party was liable.

7.7 Third Party Claims.

(a) In the event an Indemnified Party becomes aware of a third party claim
that the Indemnified Party reasonably believes may result in a demand for
indemnification hereunder (a "Third Party Claim"), the Indemnified Party shall
notify the Equity Holder Representatives of such claim as soon as reasonably
practicable and, in any event, within ten (10) calendar days after the
Indemnified Party has received notice or otherwise learns of the assertion of
such Third Party Claim, and the Equity Holder Representatives shall be
entitled (but not required), at the expense of the N-able Equity Holders, to
participate in, but not to determine or conduct, the defense of such claim;
provided, however, that no delay on the part of the Indemnified Party in
notifying the Equity Holder Representatives shall relieve the Indemnifying
Party from any obligation hereunder unless (and then solely to the extent) the
N-able Equity Holders are thereby prejudiced.

(b) The Equity Holder Representatives will have the right to defend the
Indemnified Party against the Third Party Claim with counsel of its choice
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party so long as (i) the Equity
Holder Representatives notify the Indemnified Party in writing within thirty
(30) Business Days after the Indemnified Party has given notice of the Third
Party Claim that the Indemnifying Parties will indemnify the Indemnified Party
from and against the entirety of any Damages the Indemnified Party may suffer
resulting from, arising out of, relating to, in the nature of, or caused by
the Third Party Claim, (ii) the Equity Holder Representatives provide the
Indemnified Party with evidence reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party
that the Indemnifying Parties will have the financial resources to defend
against the Third Party Claim and fulfill its indemnification obligations
hereunder, (iii) the Third Party Claim involves only monetary damages and does
not seek an injunction or other equitable relief, (iv) settlement of, or an
adverse judgment with respect to, the Third Party Claim is not, in the good
faith judgment of the Indemnified Parties, likely to establish a precedential
custom or practice adverse to the continuing business interests of the
Indemnified Party, and (v) the Equity Holder Representatives conduct the
defense of the Third Party Claim in a commercially reasonable manner. The
Equity Holder Representatives will not consent to the entry of a judgment or
enter into any settlement agreement without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), unless such judgment or settlement includes a full
release of the Indemnified Party in respect of all indemnifiable Damages
resulting therefrom, related thereto or arising therefrom. 

(c) In the event any of the conditions in Section 7.5(b) above is or becomes
unsatisfied, however, (i) the Indemnified Party may defend against, and
consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect
to, the Third Party Claim in any manner it may deem reasonably appropriate
(and the Indemnified Party need not consult with, or obtain any consent from,
the Equity Holder Representatives in connection therewith), (ii) the
Indemnifying Parties will reimburse the Indemnified Party promptly for the
costs of defending against the Third Party Claim (including reasonable legal
fees and expenses) upon the resolution of any such Third Party Claim, and
(iii) the Indemnifying Parties will remain responsible for any Damages the
Indemnified Party may suffer resulting from, arising out of, relating to, in
the nature of, or caused by the Third Party Claim to the fullest extent
provided in this Article VII.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 7.7,
SolarWinds shall have the sole right to control and make all decisions
regarding interests in any Tax audit or administrative or court proceeding
relating to Taxes, including selection of counsel and selection of a forum for
such contest; provided, however, that in the event such audit or proceeding
relates to Taxes for which the N-able Equity Holders are responsible under
Section 7.2, (i) SolarWinds, N-able and the Equity Holder Representatives
shall cooperate in the conduct of any audit or proceeding relating to such
period, (ii) the Equity Holder Representatives shall have the right (but not
the obligation) to participate in such audit or proceeding at the N-able
Equity Holders' expense, (iii) SolarWinds shall not enter into any agreement
with the relevant Governmental Entity pertaining to such Taxes without the
written consent of the Equity Holder Representatives, which consent shall not
unreasonably be withheld, and (iv) SolarWinds may, without the written consent
of the Equity Holder Representatives, enter into such an agreement provided
that SolarWinds shall have agreed in writing to accept responsibility and
liability for the payment of such Taxes and to forego any indemnification
under this Agreement with respect to such Taxes. The Parties will keep each
other reasonably informed as to matters related to any audit or judicial or
administrative proceedings involving Taxes for which indemnification may be
sought hereunder including, without limitation, any settlement negotiations.

(e) Refunds of Tax relating to periods ending prior to the Closing Date (or to
that portion of a Straddle Period that is prior to Closing under the
principles of Section 6.6 shall be the property of the N-able Equity Holders,
but only to the extent that such refunds are not attributable to (i) net
operating loss or other carrybacks from periods ending after the Closing Date
(to the extent that SolarWinds could not waive carryback pursuant to the next
sentence, (ii) refund claims that are initiated by SolarWinds (provided that
SolarWinds gives the Equity Holder Representatives prior notice of such
possible claim and the Equity Holder Representatives decline to pursue such
refund at its own expense) or (iii) refunds reflected in the calculation of
the Purchase Price; provided, however, that SolarWinds shall in no event have
an obligation to file or cause to be filed a claim for refund with respect to
any Taxes relating to any period. SolarWinds shall cause N-able, except to the
extent not permitted by Law, to elect to forego carrybacks of any net
operating losses, tax credits or other tax attributes of a Post-Closing Tax
Period to a Pre-Closing Tax Period. SolarWinds shall pay any refunds that are
the property of the N-able Equity Holders to the Paying Agent for distribution
to the N-able Equity Holders, in immediately available funds and in accordance
with each N-able Equity Holder's Pro Rata Share within five (5) Business Days
of its receiving such refund (or realizing a Tax Benefit attributable thereto)
from the appropriate Governmental Authority. 

(f) The Indemnified Party shall reasonably cooperate with the Indemnifying
Party in any defense, compromise or settlement, subject to this Section 7.7
including, without limitation, by making available all pertinent books,
records and other information and personnel under its control to the
Indemnifying Party.

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 7.7,
SolarWinds shall have the sole right to control and make all decisions
regarding any Third Party Claim involving a material past, current or future
N-able customer or vendor; provided, however, that in the event the N-able
Equity Holders are responsible and have agreed to indemnify SolarWinds for
such Third Party Claim, (i) SolarWinds, N-able, and the N-able Equity Holders
shall cooperate in the defense, compromise or settlement thereof, (ii) the
N-able Equity Holders shall have the right (but not the obligation) to
participate in the defense, compromise or settlement thereof at the N-able
Equity Holders' expense, and (iii) any compromise or settlement by SolarWinds
shall be approved by the Equity Holder Representatives, which approval shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

7.8 Exclusive Remedy. Absent fraud, willful misrepresentation and willful
breach, the indemnification provisions contained in this Article VII are
intended to provide the sole and exclusive remedy following the Closing as to
all Damages any Indemnified Party may incur arising from or relating to this
Agreement, the Merger or the Contemplated Transactions (it being understood
that nothing in this Section 7.8 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall affect
the Parties' rights to specific performance or other equitable remedies with
respect to the covenants in this Agreement to be performed at or after the
Closing).

7.9 Exercise of Remedies by Indemnified Parties Other Than SolarWinds. No
Indemnified Party (other than SolarWinds or any successors thereto or
assignees thereof) shall be permitted to assert any indemnification claim or
exercise any other remedy under this Agreement unless SolarWinds (or any
successors thereto or assignees thereof) shall have consented to the assertion
of such indemnification claim or the exercise of such other remedy.

7.10 Escrow Agent's Duties.

(a) The Escrow Agent shall be obligated only for the performance of such
duties as are specifically set forth in this Agreement and as set forth in any
additional written escrow instructions which the Escrow Agent may receive
after the date of this Agreement which are signed by an officer of SolarWinds
and the Equity Holder Representatives (the "Duties"). Such Duties shall
include the following: (i) safeguarding and treating the Escrow Fund in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and not as the property of
SolarWinds, and holding the Escrow Fund in a separate account, apart from any
other funds or accounts of the Escrow Agent or any other Person and (ii)
holding and disposing of the Escrow Fund only in accordance with the
provisions of this Agreement. The Duties of the Escrow Agent with respect to
the Escrow Fund may be altered, amended, modified or revoked only by a writing
signed by SolarWinds, the Escrow Agent and the Equity Holder Representatives.

(b) The Escrow Agent is hereby expressly authorized to disregard any and all
notices given by any of the Parties hereto or by any other Person inconsistent
with this Agreement, 

excepting only orders or process of courts of law, and is hereby expressly
authorized to comply with and obey orders, judgments or decrees of any court.
In case the Escrow Agent obeys or complies with any such order, judgment or
decree of any court, the Escrow Agent shall not be liable to any of the
Parties hereto or to any other Person by reason of such compliance,
notwithstanding any such order, judgment or decree being subsequently
reversed, modified, annulled, set aside, vacated or found to have been entered
without jurisdiction.

(c) The Escrow Agent shall not be liable in any respect on account of the
identity, authority or rights of the Parties executing or delivering or
purporting to execute or deliver this Agreement or any documents or papers
deposited or called for hereunder.

(d) The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for the expiration of any rights
under any statute of limitations with respect to this Agreement or any
documents deposited with the Escrow Agent.

(e) The Escrow Agent may resign as Escrow Agent at any time with or without
cause by giving at least thirty (30) calendar days' prior written notice to
each of SolarWinds and the Equity Holder Representatives, such resignation to
be effective thirty (30) calendar days following the date such notice is
given. In addition, SolarWinds and the Equity Holder Representatives may
jointly remove the Escrow Agent as escrow agent at any time with or without
cause, by an instrument (which may be executed in counterparts) given to the
Escrow Agent, which instrument shall designate the effective date of such
removal. In the event of any such resignation or removal, a successor escrow
agent which shall be a bank or trust company organized under the laws of the
United States of America or any state thereof having a combined capital and
surplus of not less than $100,000,000, shall be jointly appointed by
SolarWinds and the Equity Holder Representatives in writing. Any such
successor escrow agent shall deliver to SolarWinds and the Equity Holder
Representatives a written instrument accepting such appointment, and thereupon
it shall succeed to all the rights and duties of the Escrow Agent hereunder
and shall be entitled to receive the Escrow Fund. Thereafter, the predecessor
Escrow Agent shall be discharged from any further duties and liabilities under
this Agreement.

(f) In performing any duties hereunder, the Escrow Agent shall not be liable
to any Party for damages, losses, or expenses, except for gross negligence,
bad faith or willful misconduct on the part of the Escrow Agent. The Escrow
Agent shall not incur any such liability for any action taken or omitted in
reliance upon any instrument, including any written statement or affidavit
provided for in this Agreement that the Escrow Agent shall in good faith
believe to be genuine, nor will the Escrow Agent be liable or responsible if
acting in good faith for forgeries, fraud, impersonations, or determining the
scope of any representative authority. In addition, the Escrow Agent may
consult with legal counsel in connection with the Escrow Agent's duties under
this Agreement and shall be fully protected in any act taken, suffered, or
permitted by it in good faith in accordance with the advice of counsel. The
Escrow Agent is not responsible for determining and verifying the authority of
any Person acting or purporting to act on behalf of any Party to this
Agreement.

(g) If any controversy arises between the Parties to this Agreement, or with
any other party, concerning the subject matter of this Agreement, the Escrow
Agent will not be required 

to determine the controversy or to take any action regarding it. The Escrow
Agent shall await the arbitrators' decision as specified in Section 7.5(c) and
act to make or withhold payments out of the Escrow Fund in accordance with
such decision.

(h) In the event of any ambiguity or uncertainty hereunder or in any notice,
instruction or other communication received by the Escrow Agent hereunder, the
Escrow Agent may, in its sole discretion, refrain from taking any action other
than retaining possession of the Escrow Fund, unless the Escrow Agent receives
written instructions, signed by SolarWinds and the Equity Holder
Representatives, that eliminates such ambiguity or uncertainty.

(i) SolarWinds, the Equity Holder Representatives (on behalf of the N-able
Equity Holders and not individually) and their respective successors and
assigns, jointly and severally, shall indemnify and hold the Escrow Agent
harmless against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, and
expenses, including reasonable costs of investigation, counsel fees, and
disbursements that may be imposed on the Escrow Agent or incurred by the
Escrow Agent in connection with the performance of its duties under this
Agreement.

(j) All fees of the Escrow Agent for performance of its duties hereunder shall
be paid one-half (1/2) by SolarWinds and one-half (1/2) by the N-able Equity
Holders in accordance with the standard fee schedule of the Escrow Agent as
set forth on Exhibit N hereto. It is understood that the fees and usual
charges agreed upon for services of the Escrow Agent shall be considered
compensation for ordinary services as contemplated by this Agreement. In the
event that the conditions of this Agreement are not promptly fulfilled, or if
the Escrow Agent renders any service not provided for in this Agreement, or if
the Parties request a substantial modification of its terms, or if a
controversy arises, or if the Escrow Agent is made a party to, or intervenes
in, any litigation pertaining to the Escrow Fund or its subject matter, the
Escrow Agent shall be reasonably compensated for such extraordinary services
and reimbursed for all costs, attorneys' fees, including allocated costs of
in-house counsel, and expenses occasioned by such default, delay, controversy
or litigation.

(k) Any extraordinary fees and expenses, including, without limitation, any
fees or expenses (including the fees or expenses of outside counsel to the
Escrow Agent) incurred by the Escrow Agent in connection with a dispute over
the distribution of Escrow Cash or the validity of a Damages Certificate or
Objection Certificate shall, unless otherwise ordered by the applicable
arbitrator, be paid one-half (1/2) by the N-able Equity Holders and one-half
(1/2) by SolarWinds within ten (10) calendar days of receipt of a written
invoice from the Escrow Agent accompanied by evidence of a written invoice for
such fees and expenses received by the Escrow Agent.

ARTICLE VIII

TERMINATION

8.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Closing:

(a) by mutual written consent of SolarWinds and the Equity Holder
Representatives as duly authorized by the Boards of Directors of SolarWinds
and N-able US; 

(b) by N-able US or SolarWinds, at any time after June 10, 2013 if the Closing
shall have not occurred by such date (the "Termination Date");

(c) by N-able US or SolarWinds, if any court of competent jurisdiction or any
Governmental Entity shall have issued a final order restraining, enjoining or
otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions and
such order is or shall have become final and non-appealable;

(d) by SolarWinds, if there has been a material breach by N-able of any
representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement which (i)
would result in a failure of a condition set forth in Section 3.4(b) or 3.4(c)
and (ii) cannot be cured prior to June 10, 2013;

(e) by N-able, if there has been a material breach by SolarWinds or the Merger
Sub of any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement
which (i) would result in a failure of a condition set forth in Section 3.4(a)
or 3.4(c) and (ii) cannot be cured prior to June 10, 2013; or

(f) by SolarWinds, at any time after May 31, 2013, if the holders of at least
90% of the outstanding Shares have not voted to adopt and approve this
Agreement, the Merger and the Contemplated Transactions and have not
irrevocably waived their rights to be Dissenting Stockholders.

provided, however, that no Party shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement
if the breach by such Party of any provision of this Agreement has been a
material cause of or resulted in the failure of the Contemplated Transactions
to be consummated by such date.

8.2 Procedure for Termination. In the event of termination and abandonment of
the Merger by N-able or SolarWinds pursuant to this Article VIII, written
notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the other Party.

8.3 Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of this Agreement in
accordance with the provisions of this Article VIII, this Agreement shall
forthwith become void and no Party to this Agreement shall have any liability
or further obligation arising under this Agreement to any other Party hereto,
except as provided in Sections 9.14 and 9.15 hereof, which provisions shall
survive such termination; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 8.3
shall prejudice any rights, claims or causes of action that may have accrued
hereunder or with respect hereto prior to the date of such termination arising
from any Party's willful breach of this Agreement.

9.2 Interpretation. When a reference is made in this Agreement to Exhibits,
Schedules or Sections, such reference shall be to an Exhibit, Schedule or
Section to or of this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Any reference to
any Law will be deemed also to refer to such Law as in effect on the date
hereof and all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the
context requires otherwise. The words "include," "includes" and "including"
when used herein shall be deemed in each case to be followed by the words
"without limitation" or "but not limited to" or words of similar import.
Pronouns in the masculine, feminine and neuter genders will be construed to
include any other gender, and words in the singular form will be construed to
include the plural and vice versa, unless the context otherwise requires. The
words "this Agreement," "herein," "hereof," "hereby," "hereunder," and words
of similar import refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular
subdivision unless expressly so limited. In this Agreement, any reference to
any event, change, condition or effect being "material" with respect to any
entity or group of entities taken as a whole means any material event, change,
condition or effect related to the condition (financial or otherwise),
properties, assets (including intangible assets), liabilities, business,
prospects, operations or results of operations of such entity or group of
entities. The phrase "made available" in this Agreement shall mean that the
information referred to has been made available if requested by the Party to
whom such information is to be made available. As used herein, "dollars" or
"$" refer to US Dollars. The table of contents and headings contained in this
Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

9.3 Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement, together
with the other Transaction Documents, (a) constitutes the entire agreement and
understanding of the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
supersedes all prior agreements, understandings and representations, both
written and oral, among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof
and (b) is not intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies
hereunder, except as provided herein and therein and except that (i) the
N-able Equity Holders shall have all rights hereunder with respect to payment
of the Purchase Price and (ii) the directors and officers of N-able shall have
the rights set forth in Section 6.8.

9.4 Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or the
application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the 

application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances will be
interpreted so as reasonably to effect the intent of the Parties hereto. The
Parties further agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this
Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the
extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such void or
unenforceable provision.

9.5 Remedies Cumulative. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all
remedies herein expressly conferred upon a Party will be deemed cumulative
with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by Law or
equity upon such Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy will not
preclude the exercise of any other remedy.

9.6 Governing Law; Jurisdiction. This Agreement and all claims and causes of
action arising hereunder or relating hereto shall be governed by and construed
in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware without regard to
applicable principles of conflicts of law. Each of the Parties hereto
irrevocably consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of any federal or state
court located within the State of Delaware in connection with any matter based
upon or arising out of this Agreement or the matters contemplated herein,
agrees that process may be served upon them in any manner authorized by the
Laws of the State of Delaware for such persons and waives and covenants not to
assert or plead any objection which they might otherwise have to such
jurisdiction and such process.

9.7 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ALL
RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER
BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION,
PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.

9.8 Assignability. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or delegated, in whole or in
part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the Parties without the prior
written consent of the other Parties, and any such assignment without such
prior written consent shall be null and void, except that SolarWinds may
assign this Agreement to any Affiliate of SolarWinds without the prior written
consent of any other Party; provided, however, that SolarWinds shall remain
liable for all of its obligations under this Agreement. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit
of and be enforceable by the Parties and their respective successors and
permitted assigns.

9.9 Rules of Construction. The Parties hereto agree that they have been
represented by counsel during the negotiation, preparation and execution of
this Agreement. If an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation
arises, this Agreement will be construed as if drafted jointly by the Parties
and no presumption or burden of proof will arise favoring or disfavoring any
Party because of the authorship of any provision of this Agreement.

9.10 Fees. Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, in the event of
any suit or other proceeding to construe or enforce any provision of this
Agreement or any other agreement to be entered into pursuant hereto, or
otherwise in connection with this Agreement, the prevailing 

Party's or Parties' reasonable legal, accounting and other fees and costs (in
addition to all other amounts and relief to which such Party or Parties may be
entitled) incurred in such suit or proceeding shall be paid by the non-
prevailing Party or Parties.

9.11 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts,
each of which will be deemed an original but all of which shall be considered
one and the same agreement. The Agreement shall become effective when one or
more counterparts have been signed by each of the Parties and delivered to the
other Parties, it being understood that all Parties need not sign the same
counterpart.

9.12 Telecopy Execution and Delivery. A facsimile, telecopy or other
reproduction of this Agreement may be executed by one or more Parties to this
Agreement, and an executed copy of this Agreement may be delivered by one or
more Parties to this Agreement by facsimile or similar electronic transmission
device pursuant to which the signature of or on behalf of such Party can be
seen, and such execution and delivery shall be considered valid, binding and
effective for all purposes. At the request of any Party to this Agreement, all
Parties to this Agreement agree to execute an original of this Agreement as
well as any facsimile, telecopy or other reproduction of this Agreement.

9.13 Amendments and Waivers. No amendment, modification, waiver, replacement,
termination or cancellation of any provision of this Agreement shall be valid
unless the same shall be in writing and signed by SolarWinds and the Equity
Holder Representatives. No failure on the part of any Party to exercise any
power, right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, and no delay on the
part of any Party in exercising any power, right, privilege or remedy under
this Agreement, will operate as a waiver of such power, right, privilege or
remedy; and no single or partial exercise of any such power, right, privilege
or remedy will preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any other
power, right, privilege or remedy. No Party shall be deemed to have waived any
claim arising from this Agreement, or any power, right, privilege or remedy
under this Agreement, unless the waiver of such claim, power, right, privilege
or remedy is expressly set forth in a written instrument duly executed and
delivered on behalf of such Party; and any such waiver will not be applicable
or have any effect except in the specific instance in which it is given.

9.14 Transaction Expenses. N-able, SolarWinds and the N-able Equity Holders
will bear their own costs and expenses (including legal and accounting fees
and expenses) incurred in connection with this Agreement, the Transaction
Documents and the Contemplated Transactions; provided, however, that the
obligation to pay Taxes shall be allocated pursuant to Section 6.6 and the
obligation to pay expenses in connection with the Escrow Fund shall be
allocated pursuant to Section 7.7.

9.15 Public Announcements. SolarWinds, N-able and each of their Affiliates
will, to the extent reasonably practicable, consult with each other before
issuing, and give each other a reasonable opportunity to review and comment
upon, any press release or other public statements with respect to this
Agreement and the Contemplated Transactions, and shall not issue any such
press release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation,
except as may be required by applicable Law or court process; provided,
however that nothing herein or in any of the other Transaction Documents shall
restrict or limit the right of any non-employee N-able Equity Holder 

and (as applicable) its affiliated investment funds to disclose any
information regarding the Contemplated Transactions (including, without
limitation, the terms of this Agreement) to (a) such N-able Equity Holder's
limited partners and/or (b) any Governmental Entity pursuant to its reporting
obligations from time to time.

9.16 USA Patriot Act Compliance. To help the government fight the funding of
terrorism and money laundering activities, federal law requires all financial
institutions to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each
Person who opens an account. For a non-individual Person such as a business
entity, a charity, a trust or other legal entity the Escrow Agent will ask for
documentation to verify its formation and existence as a legal entity. The
Escrow Agent may also ask to see financial statements, licenses,
identification and authorization documents from individuals claiming authority
to represent the entity or other relevant documentation. The Parties each
agree to provide all such information and documentation as to themselves as
requested by Escrow Agent to ensure compliance with federal law, including
without limitation, the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing
Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001.
