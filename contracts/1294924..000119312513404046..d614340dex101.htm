Section 1.1(c) shall limit ADIs indemnification obligations pursuant to
Section 6.1 or liabilities with respect to a breach of any Ancillary
Agreement:

(i) all obligations and liabilities which arise out of Buyers use of the
Acquired Assets and/or manufacture or sale by Buyer of any Acquired Products
after the Closing;

(ii) all obligations and liabilities under or arising out of the
Designated Contracts to the extent arising out of or relating to the period

(iv) all obligations and liabilities with respect to all actions, suits,
proceedings, disputes, claims or investigations to the extent arising out of
or relating to (x) the Acquired Assets or the Acquired Products and (y)

the Acquired Products after the Closing;

 



3 (v) all obligations and liabilities arising out of or relating to the repair,

respect of, Acquired Products manufactured or sold after the Closing; and

 

(vi) all obligations and liabilities arising out of or relating to any product
liability claim (including any such claim arising out of or relating to
injury to or death of persons), damage to or destruction of property or any
workers compensation claim, in each case to the extent relating to Acquired
Products manufactured or sold after the Closing.

 

(d) _Excluded Liabilities_. It is expressly understood and agreed that,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Buyer shall not
assume or be responsible for paying, performing or discharging any obligations
or liabilities of Sellers that are not Assumed Liabilities (collectively, the
" _Excluded Liabilities_ ").

 

(e) _Buyer s Acquired Assets_. Buyer will determine which Acquired Assets are
to be purchased by each of US Buyer, Foreign Buyer or one or more of their
directly or indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries.

1.2 _Purchase Price and Related Matters_.

 

(a) _Purchase Price_. Regardless of whether the transfer of any Acquired Asset
has been deferred pursuant to the provisions of Section 1.4, in consideration
for the sale and transfer of the Acquired Assets, and subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, Buyer shall (i) at the Closing, assume the
Assumed Liabilities as provided in Section 1.1(c) and pay to Sellers in cash,
by wire transfer of immediately available funds, U.S. $100,000,000.00 (the "
_Closing Purchase Price_ ") and (ii) after the Closing, pay to Sellers the
Earnout Amount, to the extent payable in accordance with Section 1.5. As used
in this Agreement, " _Purchase Price_ " means, as of any time, the Closing
Purchase Price, together with any Earnout Amount that is actually received by
Sellers prior to such time. The Purchase Price shall be allocated among
Sellers as set forth on _Schedule 1.2(a)_.

(b) _Allocation_. Within 90 days after the Closing Date, ADI shall prepare
and deliver to Buyer an allocation schedule (the " _Allocation Schedule_ ")
allocating the Closing Purchase Price and the Assumed Liabilities among the
Acquired Assets transferred by each Seller as of the Closing Date and the
covenants in Sections 9.6 and 9.7 in accordance with the rules under Section
1060 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "). If
Buyer notifies ADI in writing within 30 days after delivery of
such Allocation Schedule that Buyer objects to one or more items reflected in
the Allocation Schedule, ADI and Buyer shall negotiate in good faith to
resolve such dispute regarding the preparation of the Allocation Schedule. If
Buyer and ADI are unable to resolve any such dispute within 30 days following
Buyers delivery of its objection, such dispute shall be resolved by the
Independent Accounting Firm. The fees and expenses of the Independent
Accounting Firm shall be borne equally by 

 



4  Buyer and ADI. The Parties recognize that the Purchase Price and the Assumed
Liabilities do not include Buyers acquisition expenses and that Buyer will
allocate such expenses appropriately. Buyer and Sellers shall file all Tax
Returns (including Internal Revenue Service Form 8594) consistent with the
Allocation Schedule finally resolved pursuant to this Section 1.2(b). Neither
Buyer nor Sellers shall take any Tax position inconsistent with such
Allocation Schedule, except to the extent otherwise required by law. If the
Purchase Price is adjusted pursuant to this Agreement (including by operation
of Section 1.5), the Allocation Schedule shall be adjusted as appropriate and
Buyer and ADI shall cooperate in making any such adjustments.

1.3 _The Closing_.

 

(a) _Time and Location_. The closing of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at the offices of Wilmer
Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP in Boston, Massachusetts, commencing at
10:00 a.m., local time, on the third (3rd) Business Day after the first date
on which the conditions to the obligations of the Parties to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby (excluding the delivery of any documents to
be delivered at the Closing by either of the Parties and other than
satisfaction of those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied or
waived at the Closing, it being understood that the occurrence of the Closing
shall remain subject to the delivery of such documents and the satisfaction or
waiver of such conditions) have been satisfied or waived (the " _Closing
Date_ "). For purposes of this Agreement, a " _Business Day_ " shall be any
day other than (i) a Saturday or Sunday or (ii) a day on which banking
institutions located in Boston, Massachusetts are permitted or required by
law, executive order or governmental decree to remain closed.

(b) _Actions at the Closing_.

 

At the Closing:

defined in the Transition Services Agreement) to be negotiated by the Parties
in good faith prior to the Closing;

 

(vii) Buyer shall pay to Sellers the Closing Purchase Price in cash by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to one or more accounts designated by
ADI; and

(viii) the Parties shall execute and deliver to each other a cross-receipt
evidencing the transactions referred to above.

1.4 _Consents to Assignment_. ADI shall, and shall cause the Sellers to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to deliver to, or obtain from, the applicable
third party, prior to the Closing, all notices, consents, waivers and
approvals identified in _Section 2.3 of the Disclosure Schedule_; _provided_
that no Seller shall be required to make any payments or agree to any
undertaking in connection therewith. Without limiting the foregoing
obligations, this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to assign or
transfer (or an assignment or transfer of) any asset, agreement,
lease, authorization, license or permit, or any claim, right or benefit
arising thereunder or resulting therefrom, if an attempted assignment or
transfer thereof, without the consent of a third party thereto or of the
issuing Governmental Entity, as the case may be, would constitute a breach
thereof or default thereunder, would result in a violation of the rights of
any such third party, would be ineffective, or would in any way adversely
affect the rights of any Seller (or any Affiliate thereof) or Buyer
thereunder and such consent is not obtained at or prior to the Closing (a "
_Deferred Consent_ "). With respect to each Deferred Consent, (a) the asset,
agreement, lease, authorization, license or permit to which such Deferred
Consent relates (a " _Deferred Item_ ") shall not be assigned or transferred
to Buyer at Closing, without any reduction in the Purchase Price, until the
requisite consent is obtained, upon which ADI will, or will cause
the applicable Seller to promptly assign or transfer such Deferred Item to
Buyer, (b) from and after the Closing, Buyer will cooperate, in all reasonable
respects, with the applicable Seller to obtain such Deferred Consent as soon
as practicable after the Closing, _provided_ that no Seller shall be required
to make any payments or agree to any material undertakings in connection
therewith, and (c) until such Deferred Consent is obtained, Sellers and Buyer
shall cooperate, in all reasonable respects, in any lawful and commercially
reasonable arrangement proposed by Buyer under which (i) Buyer would obtain
(without infringing upon the legal rights of any third party) the economic
claims, rights and benefits and (ii) solely if Buyer obtains such economic
claims, rights and benefits described in (i), Buyer would assume any related
economic burden (including Taxes) with respect to the Deferred Item. For
purposes of this Agreement, " _Affiliate_ " shall have the meaning assigned
to it in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

 



6 1.5 _Earnout Matters_.

 

(a) As further consideration for the sale and transfer of the Acquired Assets
pursuant to this Agreement, Buyer shall pay to Sellers an amount (the "
_Earnout Amount_ ") that is equal to fourteen-fifteenths (14/15) of the amount
by which the Earnout Product Revenue for the period from the Closing Date
through the first anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _Earnout Period_ ")
exceeds U.S. $75,000,000.00 ( _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall
the Earnout Amount pursuant to this Section 1.5(a) exceed U.S. $70,000,000.00
(the " _Maximum Earnout Amount_ ")) within twenty (20) Business Days after
the end of the Earnout Period. For purposes of this Agreement, (i) " _Earnout
Product Revenue_ " means the aggregate revenues recognized during the Earnout
Period by all Earnout Product Selling Persons from the sale, transfer,
license or other permitted use for value of the Earnout Products by or on
behalf of the Earnout Product Selling Persons; (ii) " _Earnout Products_ "
means any MEMS Microphone that embodies, contains or is based upon (in whole
or in part) any Transferred Technology, any Transferred Intellectual Property
Rights, any Retained Technology and/or any Retained Intellectual Property
Rights (each as defined in the License Agreement) licensed to Buyer, and
any line extensions, improvements, enhancements, variations or modifications,
whether or not patentable, of any of the foregoing, in each case whether sold
as a standalone product or as a component or element of another product or
bundled with another product; and (iii) " _Earnout Product Selling Persons_ "
means Buyer, its Affiliates and each of their respective successors and
assigns. For purposes of this Section 1.5, (x) revenue shall be deemed
recognized by the applicable Earnout Product Selling Person with respect to
any Earnout Product when such Earnout Product is shipped by such Earnout
Product Selling Person and (y) if any Earnout Product is a component or
element of, or bundled with, another product, the revenue deemed recognized
with respect to the sale, transfer, license or other permitted use for value
of such Earnout Product shall be the greater of (1) Buyers standard list
price of such Earnout Product for standalone sales and (2) the amount
expressly allocated to such Earnout Product by Buyer and the counterparty to
such transaction.

(b) Buyer shall deliver to ADI, within twenty (20) Business Days after the
end of the Earnout Period, a certificate, certified by the Chief Executive
Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of Buyer, setting forth in reasonable
detail the computation of Earnout Product Revenue for the Earnout Period and
the Earnout Amount (a " _Buyer Earnout Certificate_ "), together with
supporting detail therefor, such calculation to be prepared in accordance with
the principles specified in Section 1.5(a).

(c) Buyer and ADI agree that they will cooperate and assist in the calculation
of the Earnout Amount and in the conduct of the review referred to in this
Section 1.5. Without limitation of the foregoing or Section 9.1, Buyer shall
make available books, records, work papers and personnel of the Earnout
Product Selling Persons solely to the extent reasonably necessary to allow
ADI and its accountants and advisors to calculate, and to review and evaluate
Buyers calculation of, the proposed Earnout Amount.

 

(d) Following the Closing and prior to the end of the Earnout Period, in the
event of a Subsequent Sale, the Maximum Earnout Amount (to the extent not
previously paid to

 



7  Sellers) shall be paid in full by Buyer to Sellers in cash within ten (10)
Business Days following such Subsequent Sale. For purposes of this Agreement,
" _Subsequent Sale_ " means the sale, transfer or disposition (including
through the sale or transfer of the equity interests in any entity holding any
of the Acquired Assets) following the Closing Date, in a single transaction or
a series of related transactions, of all or substantially all of the Acquired
Assets, other than in connection with any merger, consolidation, liquidation
or change of control, or sale of substantially all of the assets of Buyer.

 

(e) Following the Closing and prior to the end of the Earnout Period, Buyer
shall (and shall cause each other Earnout Product Selling Person to) use
commercially reasonable efforts to promote, market and sell Earnout Products
during the Earnout Period. Without limiting the foregoing, Buyer shall not
(and Buyer shall cause each other Earnout Product Selling Person not
to) disproportionately discount any Earnout Product that is sold (or
transferred, licensed or otherwise permitted to be used for value) to any
third party in any transaction (or series of related transactions) with any
other product of Buyer or such Earnout Product Selling Person, as compared to
the discount applied to such other product.

(f) Upon the written request of ADI, Buyer shall (and shall cause each other
Earnout Product Selling Person to) permit the Independent Accounting Firm, at
ADIs expense, to have access, upon reasonable prior notice and during normal
business hours to inspect and audit the books and records of each Earnout
Product Selling Person for the purpose of determining the accuracy of the
reports described in Sections 1.5(b). If the Independent Accounting Firm
concludes that Earnout Product Revenue was underreported for the
Earnout Period by more than five percent (5%), Buyer shall promptly reimburse
ADI for the reasonable out-of-pocket costs of the Independent Accounting
Firms inspection and audit. During the period following the Closing and prior
to the final determination of the Earnout Amount (the " _Audit Period_ "),
and thereafter as needed for any audit requested during the Audit Period
pursuant to this Section 1.5(f), Buyer shall (and shall cause each other
Earnout Product Selling Person to) keep such complete and accurate books and
records as may be necessary to calculate the Earnout Product Revenue and
ascertain the efforts of such persons to maximize the Earnout Product Revenue
pursuant to Section 1.5(e). For purposes of this Agreement, " _Independent
Accounting Firm_ " means the Boston, Massachusetts office of
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, or if circumstances create an actual conflict of
interest that would impair such firms ability to impartially determine any
issue presented to it pursuant to this Agreement or such firm is unable or
unwilling to serve as the Independent Accounting Firm, the Boston,
Massachusetts office of a nationally recognized registered public accounting
firm selected in accordance with the rules of procedure of the American
Arbitration Association.

(g) ADI shall be entitled to reimbursement from Buyer of all costs and
expenses incurred by or on behalf of ADI in collecting any Earnout Amount that
is not paid when due pursuant to this Section 1.5.

 

(h) No portion of the Earnout Amount to be paid to ADI under this Section 1.5
shall be subject to any right of set off or any similar right.

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in no event
shall Buyers obligation to pay the Earnout Amount or its liability for
Damages resulting from any breach of any covenant set forth in this Section
1.5 be subject to any of the limitations set forth in Section 6.5.

 



8 1.6 _Further Assurances_. At any time and from time to time after the Closing
Date, as and when requested by either Party hereto and at the requesting
Partys expense, the other Party shall promptly execute and deliver, or cause
to be executed and delivered, all such documents, instruments and certificates
and shall take, or cause to be taken, all such further or other actions as
are necessary to evidence and effectuate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

1.7 _Withholding_. The Parties agree that Buyer is not required to deduct or
withhold Taxes from any consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement
under any current provision of applicable law, including as the result of the
application of Section 1.1(e). If as a result of a change in applicable law
after the date of this Agreement Buyer determines that it is required
to deduct or withhold Taxes from any consideration payable pursuant to this
Agreement, the Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize
such withholding Taxes; without limiting the foregoing, Buyer shall notify ADI
prior to withholding any such Taxes and provide Sellers with a reasonable
opportunity to claim any exemption or reduction in otherwise applicable
withholding Taxes. If any action of Buyer after the date of this Agreement
(including a transfer or assignment of any or all of Buyers rights and
obligations under this Agreement or any action taken in accordance with
Section 1.1(e)) results in the imposition of a withholding Tax on
consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement to any person, the
amounts payable by Buyer under this Agreement to such person shall be
increased so that the person receives an amount equal to what the person would
have received had no such withholding Taxes applied.

entity duly organized, validly existing and, where applicable, in good
standing under the laws of its respective jurisdiction of organization and is

engaged and to own and use the properties now owned and used by it. For
purposes of this Agreement, " _Seller Material Adverse Effect_ " means any
change, effect or circumstance that would or would be reasonably be expected
to (i) have a material adverse effect on the Acquired Assets, taken as a

economic conditions or financial markets in any country or region or globally,
including changes in interest or exchange rates and changes in currency and

worsening of any such acts of war, armed hostilities, sabotage or terrorism,
(VI) any failure of Sellers to meet any projections, guidance, estimates,
forecasts or milestones for or during any period ending on or after the date
hereof with respect to the Acquired Assets or the Acquired Products (it being
agreed that the effects giving rise to any such failure that are not otherwise
excluded by this proviso may be taken into account in determining whether
a Seller Material Adverse Effect has occurred or may occur), (VII)
earthquakes, hurricanes, tsunamis, tornadoes, floods, mudslides, wild fires or
other natural disasters, weather conditions and other force majeure events in
any country or region, or (VIII) changes in law or other legal or regulatory

and thereby have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate
or comparable action on the part of each such Seller. This Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements have been, or will be, duly and validly executed and

applicable Seller in accordance with its terms, except as enforceability may
be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization,
moratorium or other similar laws relating to or affecting the rights of
creditors generally and by equitable principles, including those limiting the
availability of specific performance, injunctive relief and other equitable
remedies and those providing for equitable defenses.

of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the
" _Hart-Scott-Rodino Act_ "), and any applicable foreign antitrust or trade

warranty of ADI contained in Article II of this Agreement or the certificate

21 6.3 _Claims for Indemnification_.

 

(a) _Third-Party Claims_. All claims for indemnification made under this
Agreement resulting from, related to or arising out of a third-party claim
against an Indemnified Party shall be made in accordance with the following
procedures. A person or entity entitled to indemnification under this Article
VI (an " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall give prompt written notification to the
Party from whom indemnification is sought (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") of
the commencement of any action, suit or proceeding relating to a third-party
claim for which indemnification may be sought or, if earlier, upon the
assertion of any such claim by a third party. At any time following the
delivery of such notification, the Indemnifying Party may, upon written notice
thereof to the Indemnified Party, assume control of the defense of such
action, suit, proceeding or claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party does not assume control of such
defense, the Indemnified Party shall control such defense. The Party not
controlling such defense may participate therein at its own expense. The
Party controlling such defense shall keep the other Party advised of the
status of such action, suit, proceeding or claim and the defense thereof and
shall consider recommendations made by the other Party with respect thereto.
The Indemnified Party shall not agree to any settlement of such action, suit,
proceeding or claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying
Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed. The Indemnifying Party shall not agree to any settlement of such
action, suit, proceeding or claim that does not include a complete release of
the Indemnified Party from all liability with respect thereto or that imposes
any liability or obligation on, or admission by, the Indemnified Party
without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 

(b) _Procedure for Other Claims_. An Indemnified Party wishing to assert a
claim for indemnification under this Article VI which is not subject to
Section 6.3(a) shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party a written notice (a "
_Claim Notice_ ") which contains (i) a reasonably detailed description,
including the amount, of any Damages incurred by the Indemnified Party, (ii)
a statement that the Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification under
this Article VI and a reasonably detailed explanation of the basis therefor,
and (iii) a demand for payment in the amount of such Damages. If such dispute
is not resolved within 60 days following the delivery by the Indemnified Party
of the applicable Claim Notice, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified
Party shall each have the right to submit such dispute to a court of
competent jurisdiction in accordance with the provisions of Section 10.14.

6.4 _Survival_.

 

(a) The representations and warranties of ADI and Buyer set forth in this
Agreement and the certificates delivered at Closing pursuant to Sections
5.1(c) and 5.2(c) shall survive the Closing and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and continue until the first anniversary of
the Closing Date, at which time they shall expire. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the representations and warranties of ADI contained in Sections
2.1 and 2.2 and of Buyer contained in Sections 3.1 and 3.2 shall survive the
Closing and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby without
limitation.

 



22 (b) None of the covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement
shall survive the Closing Date other than those which by their terms
contemplate performance after the Closing Date, and each such surviving
covenant and agreement shall survive the Closing in accordance with their
terms.

 

(c) Neither Party shall have any liability or obligation of any nature with
respect to any representation, warranty, agreement or covenant after the
termination or expiration thereof.

(d) Any valid claim that is properly asserted in writing pursuant to Section
6.3, prior to the expiration as provided in Section 6.4(a) of the
representation or warranty that is the basis for such claim, or any claim with
respect to any breach of a covenant as provided in Section 6.4(b), shall
survive until such claim is finally resolved and satisfied solely for
purposes of such claim.

6.5 _Limitations_.

 

(a) From and after the Closing, the rights of the Indemnified Parties under
this Article VI and the remedies expressly provided in Section 1.5, Section
9.3 and Section 10.13 shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of the Parties
and their respective Affiliates with respect to claims resulting from any
breach of warranty or failure to perform any covenant or agreement contained
in this Agreement or otherwise relating to the transactions that are the
subject of this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing
sentence, in no event shall Buyer, its successors or permitted assigns
be entitled to claim or seek rescission of the transactions consummated under
this Agreement.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement each
of the following limitations shall apply:

(i) the aggregate liability of either Indemnifying Party for all Damages
under this Article VI shall not exceed an amount equal to 10% of the Closing
Purchase Price;

(ii) no individual claim for indemnification under this Article VI shall be
valid and assertable unless it is for an amount in excess of $50,000;

(iii) Each of ADI and Buyer shall be liable under this Agreement for only
that portion of the aggregate Damages hereunder that exceeds 1.5% of the
Closing Purchase Price; and

 

 _provided_ , _however_ , that the limitations of Section 6.5(b) shall not
apply to (A) any claim described in Section 6.1(b) or Section 6.2(b), (B) any
breach of a representation or warranty

 



23  contained in Section 2.1 ( _Organization, Qualification and Corporate Power_
) and Section 2.2 ( _Authority_ ), for which ADIs indemnification obligation
for Damages, together with any liability for Damages otherwise pursuant to
Section 6.1(a)(i), in the aggregate shall not exceed the Purchase Price, (C)
any breach of a representation or warranty contained in Section 3.1 (
_Organization_ ) and Section 3.2 ( _Authority_ ), for which Buyers
indemnification obligation for Damages, together with any liability for
Damages otherwise pursuant to Section 6.2(a)(i), in the aggregate shall not
exceed the Purchase Price, and (D) any breach of a covenant that survives the
Closing pursuant to Section 6.4. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this
Agreement shall limit a partys liability for fraud.

 

(c) In no event shall any Indemnifying Party be responsible or liable for any
Damages or other amounts under this Article VI that are (i) consequential, in
the nature of lost profits or diminution in value, special or punitive or
otherwise not actual out-of-pocket Damages or (ii) contingent. The Indemnified
Party shall (and shall cause its Affiliates to) use commercially reasonable
efforts to pursue all legal rights and remedies available in order to minimize
the Damages for which indemnification is provided to the Indemnified Party
under this Agreement.

 

(d) If an Indemnified Party (or an Affiliate) receives any third-party payment
in connection with any claim for Damages for which it has already received an
indemnification payment from the Indemnifying Party, it shall pay to the
Indemnifying Party, within ten (10) Business Days of receiving such third-
party payment, an amount equal to the excess of (i) the amount previously
received by the Indemnified Party under this Agreement with respect to such
claim plus the amount of the third-party payments received, over (ii) the
amount of Damages with respect to such claim which the Indemnified Party has
become entitled to receive under this Agreement.

(e) Each party shall have the right to rely fully upon the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements of the other party contained in this
Agreement or in any instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement. The
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this
Agreement or in any instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall not
be affected by any investigation conducted for or on behalf of Buyer with
respect thereto or any knowledge acquired by Buyer of its officers, directors,
employees or agents as to the accuracy or inaccuracy of any such
representation or warranty.

(f) In no event shall ADI be liable for any Damages arising from or relating
to, directly or indirectly, any act, omission or transaction carried out by
or at the express request of Buyer.

6.6 _Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. All indemnification payments
made under this Agreement shall be treated by the Parties as an adjustment to
the Purchase Price unless otherwise required by applicable law.

shall not release or disclose such Information to any other person, except
its auditors, attorneys, financial advisors, bankers and other consultants and
advisors, unless compelled to disclose such Information by judicial or
administrative process or by other requirements of law or so as not to
violate the rules of any stock exchange; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the
case of disclosure compelled by judicial or administrative process, the
Receiving Party shall (to the extent permitted by applicable law) notify
the Disclosing Party promptly of the request or requirement so that the
Disclosing Party may seek an appropriate protective order or waive compliance
with the provisions of this Section 9.1(e). If, in the absence of a protective
order or the receipt of a waiver hereunder, the Receiving Party is compelled
to disclose any Information by judicial or administration process, such
Receiving Party may so disclose the Information; _provided_ , _however_ , that
at the written request of the Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, at the expense of the Disclosing
Party, an order or other assurance that confidential treatment will be
accorded to such portion of the Information required to be disclosed.

 



28 9.2 _Disclosure Generally_.

 

(a) The inclusion of any information in the Disclosure Schedule (or any update
thereto) shall not be deemed to be an admission or acknowledgment, in and of
itself, that such information is required by the terms hereof to be disclosed,
is material to the Acquired Assets or the Acquired Products, has resulted in
or would result in a Seller Material Adverse Effect, or is outside the
ordinary course of business. For purposes of this Agreement, the terms "
_Sellers  knowledge_", " _known by Sellers_ " or other words of similar
meaning shall mean the actual knowledge on the date hereof of the persons
listed on _Schedule 9.2(a)_ and shall not refer to the knowledge of any other
person or entity.

(b) ADI shall be entitled to submit to Buyer, from time to time between the
date hereof and the Closing Date, written updates to the Disclosure Schedule
disclosing any events or developments that occur between the date of this
Agreement and the Closing Date. ADIs representations and warranties
contained in Article II shall be construed for all purposes of this Agreement
in accordance with the Disclosure Schedule, as so updated _provided_ that
Buyer shall have the right to terminate this Agreement as a result of any
such update to the Disclosure Schedule to the extent provided in Section
7.1(e).

9.3 _Covenants Regarding New Buyer Employees_. It is the intent of the
Parties that all employees named on _Schedule 9.3_ (the " _Designated
Employees_ ") be offered employment by Buyer, as set forth in further detail
below in this Section 9.3. For purposes of this Agreement, " _New Buyer
Employees_ " shall mean those Designated Employees who accept employment with
Buyer in connection with the Closing or whose employment is transferred to
Buyer by operation of applicable law.

 

(a) _Employment Offers to U.S. Employees_. Buyer shall make offers of
employment to the Designated Employees identified on _Schedule 9.3(a)_ (the "
_U.S. Employees_ ") at a time to be mutually agreed between ADI and Buyer. An
offer of employment to a U.S. Employee shall provide terms that are comparable
in the aggregate, including cash and equity compensation, benefits, location,
content, job grade, job shift, and severance, to those provided to such U.S.
Employee by Seller on the date hereof (" _Comparable Terms_ ").

 

(b) _New Buyer Employees_. On the Closing Date, U.S. Employees who accept
employment or engagement with Buyer will be considered to have resigned from
their employment or engagement with the applicable Seller or its Affiliate,
and Buyer shall thereafter, either directly or through one of its Affiliates,
employ or engage all such New Buyer Employees, for at least a period of 12
months following the Closing Date (the " _Retention Period_ "), on Comparable
Terms; _provided_ that Buyer or its Affiliates may, at any time and in its
sole discretion, terminate a New Buyer Employee for Cause. For purposes of
this Agreement, with respect to any New Buyer Employee, " _Cause_ " shall
have the meaning set forth in any written agreement between Buyer and such New
Buyer Employee or, in the absence of any such agreement that defines
"Cause", " _Cause_ " shall mean (i) any willful failure by such New Buyer
Employee, which failure is not cured within 30 days of written notice to such
New Buyer Employee from Buyer, to perform his or her material responsibilities
to Buyer or (ii) any willful misconduct by such New Buyer Employee which
affects the business reputation of Buyer.

 



29 (c) _EU Employees_.

 

(i) Buyer and Sellers acknowledge and agree that the contracts of employment
of the Designated Employees named on _Schedule 9.3(c)(i)_  (the " _EU
Employees_ ") shall not terminate upon Closing. Instead (save in the case of
any EU Employee who validly objects to transferring in accordance with
applicable law), such contracts of employment shall transfer automatically
to Buyer (or its relevant Affiliate), in accordance with applicable law. All
Employment Liabilities to the extent related to the period after the Closing
in respect of EU Employees who so transfer to Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer,
shall from Closing be borne by Buyer or such Affiliate of Buyer. For purposes
of this Agreement, " _Employment Liabilities_ " shall mean any and all claims,
debts, liabilities, commitments and obligations, whether fixed, contingent or
absolute, matured or unmatured, liquidated or unliquidated, accrued or
unaccrued, known or unknown, however arising, including all costs and expenses
relating thereto arising under law, rule, regulation, permit, action or
proceeding before any Governmental Entity, order or consent decree or any
award of any arbitrator with authority to make awards, in each case relating
to any Employee Benefit Plan, employment agreement or otherwise relating to an
employee or former employee, current or former consultant or current or
former director of Sellers or an ERISA Affiliate and his or her employment or
service with Sellers or any ERISA Affiliate. For purposes of this Agreement, "
_ERISA Affiliate_ " shall mean any entity which is a member of (a)
a controlled group of corporations (as defined in Section 414(b) of the
Code), (b) a group of trades or businesses under common control (as defined in
Section 414(c) of the Code), or (c) an affiliated service group (as
defined under Section 414(m) of the Code or the regulations under Section
414(o) of the Code), any of which includes any Seller.

(ii) Where it is not possible or not legally required for Buyer or its
relevant Affiliate to replicate an Employee Benefit Plan (including any
retirement benefit) for an EU Employee whose employment is transferred to
Buyer or its relevant Affiliate by operation of applicable law, Buyer or its
relevant Affiliate shall provide a substantially equivalent benefit.

(iii) If, contrary to the expectations of the parties, the contract of
employment of any EU Employee which the parties expected to transfer
automatically to Buyer or its relevant Affiliate by operation of applicable
law is not so transferred, Buyer or its relevant Affiliate shall make the
relevant Designated Employee an offer of employment on the same basis as that
made to U.S. Employees in accordance with this Section 9.3, such offer to be
made within three (3) Business Days of Buyer becoming aware of such fact.

(iv) Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Sellers and each Affiliate
against any and all claims and demands by any EU Employee, or any
representative of an EU Employee, and against any losses, costs and expenses
incurred investigating or defending such claims, including without limitation
reasonable attorneys fees, arising out of or in connection with:

 

(A) any changes to such EU Employees terms of employment, location, or
engagement, or working conditions, proposed by Buyer or its relevant
Affiliate;

 



30 (B) the identity of Buyer or its relevant Affiliate;

 

(C) any refusal by Buyer or its relevant Affiliate to employ any EU Employee
who would otherwise have transferred to Buyer or its relevant Affiliate by
operation of applicable law, and any requirement of Buyer or its relevant
Affiliate that Sellers or relevant Affiliate terminate the employment of such
EU Employee prior to Closing;

 

(D) acts or omissions of Buyer or its relevant Affiliate arising after
Closing; and

 

(E) any failure by Buyer or its relevant Affiliate prior to Closing to timely
supply Sellers or any Affiliate with information required to be provided by
Buyer or its relevant Affiliate under applicable law, including in particular,
any information required for the purposes of Sellers or any Affiliate
informing or consulting with EU Employees or their representatives, prior to
Closing. 

(d) _Chinese Employees_. Buyer shall issue a written offer of employment to
the employees identified on _Schedule 9.3(d)_ (the " _Chinese Employees_ ")
simultaneously with a written notice of termination to be issued by Sellers to
the Chinese Employees not less than thirty (30) days before the Closing Date
(or such shorter period as may be agreed by any such Chinese Employee or as
may otherwise be consistent with applicable law). Such offers of employment
shall be subject to and in compliance with Buyers standard applicable human
resources policies and procedures and applicable law, and on terms and
conditions (including credit for years of employment with Sellers and any
predecessor entity) at least during the Retention Period comparable in the
aggregate to the terms and conditions on which such Chinese Employees were
employed by Sellers prior to Closing, including, without limitation, with
respect to compensation, social welfare, location and eligibility for
severance. After the date on which such notices are issued, Sellers shall
permit Buyer to review employee files, compensation data, and job information
for such Chinese Employees, subject to applicable law. After such date,
Sellers shall permit Buyer to contact and meet with all such Chinese Employees
at Sellers premises during normal business hours, and Sellers shall
cooperate fully with Buyer in all such respects. Any Chinese Employee who does
not accept an offer of employment from Buyer shall be terminated by Sellers
when allowed under applicable law.

 

(e) _Employee Liability Claims_.

 

(i) Except as provided in this Section 9.3(e)(i), all costs, expenses,
liabilities, and disbursements, if any, incurred in connection with or as a
result of the employment or termination by Sellers or any Affiliate thereof of
any Designated Employee on or prior to Closing (including any Designated
Employee who does not accept an offer of employment with Buyer) shall be borne
by the applicable Seller, except to the extent such costs, expenses,
liabilities or disbursements result from any act or omission of Buyer or any
of its Affiliates or are the responsibility of Buyer by operation of
applicable law. The applicable Seller or Affiliate thereof shall retain
responsibility for and shall pay to departing Designated Employees their
accrued but unpaid salary or wages, vacation or paid time off, pro-rata
bonuses

 



31  for the portion of the bonus period ending with the Closing Date (subject to
any discretionary authority it may retain as to eligibility for or calculation
of such bonuses), and benefits under its Employee Benefit Plans.

(ii) All costs and disbursements incurred in connection with the employment,
engagement or termination by Buyer of any New Buyer Employee on or after the
Closing Date shall be borne solely by Buyer.

(f) _Buyer Employee Plans_.

 

(i) Subject to Section 9.3(c), with respect to New Buyer Employees, (i) Buyer
will allow such New Buyer Employees and their eligible dependents to
participate in the employee benefit plans maintained by Buyer or its
Affiliates on terms comparable in the aggregate to those provided by ADI or
its Affiliates to the Designated Employees, (ii) each such New Buyer Employee
will receive credit for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting
under such plans for years of service with Sellers or any ERISA Affiliate
prior to the Closing Date, and (iii) Buyer will make all commercially
reasonable efforts to cause any and all pre-existing condition limitations,
eligibility waiting periods and evidence of insurability requirements under
any group pension, health, life, accident or disability plans of Buyer in
which such New Buyer Employees and their eligible dependents will participate
to be waived and will provide credit for any co-payments and deductibles prior
to the Closing Date for purposes of satisfying any applicable deductible, out-
of-pocket or similar requirements under any such plans that may apply after
the Closing Date.

(ii) Buyer shall cause a tax qualified defined contribution retirement plan
established or maintained by Buyer (the " _Buyer Plan_ ") to accept eligible
rollover distributions (as defined in Section 402(c)(4) of the Code) from New
Buyer Employees who participated in the Sellers Investment Partnership Plan
(the " _401(k) Plan_ ") with respect to any account balances distributed to
them on or after the Closing Date by the 401(k) Plan, subject to any
restrictions under applicable law. Rollovers of outstanding loans from
Sellers 401(k) Plan to the Buyer Plan shall be permitted.

(g) _Immigration Related Obligations_. Buyer shall assume any of Sellers
immigration related obligations and liabilities relating to Designated
Employees who are foreign nationals of the country in which they are working,
such as (but not limited to), those arising in connection with filings by
Sellers of Labor Condition Applications, nonimmigrant/immigrant visa
petitions, work permit applications or extensions and Applications for Alien
Employment (Labor) Certification.

 

(h) _Limitations_. Nothing contained herein shall (i) be treated as an
amendment of any employee benefit plan or compensatory arrangement, (ii) give
any current or former employee or any other individual associated therewith or
any employee benefit plan or trustee thereof or any other third party any
right to enforce the provisions of this Section 9.3, or (iii) obligate Buyer
or any of its Affiliates to (A) maintain any particular benefit plan or
compensatory arrangement, (B) refrain from amending or terminating any
particular benefit plan or compensatory arrangement, (C) retain the
employment of any particular employee, or (D) refrain from changing the terms
and conditions of employment.

 



32 With respect to all Designated Employees in the U.S. (and their respective
covered dependents) who are "MandA Qualified Beneficiaries" (as defined in
Section 54.4980B-9 QandA-4(a) of the Treasury Regulations), ADI shall provide
any notice required by Section 4980B(f)(6) of the Code and shall make
available to such individuals continuation coverage under a group health plan
maintained by ADI, as provided by Section 54.4980B-9 QandA-7 of the Treasury
Regulations. ADI shall indemnify and hold Buyer harmless for any liability
Buyer incurs at any time under the provisions of Code section 4980B or ERISA
sections 601 through 609 with respect to any individual who was a Designated
Employee prior to the Closing Date, or a dependent or spouse of any such
employee, and who had a "qualifying event" (within the meaning of Code
section 4980B) in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement at any time as a result of a cessation of employment with a Seller.

 

9.4 _Use of Name for Transition Period_.

 

(a) Following the Closing, except as otherwise expressly provided herein,
Buyer shall have no rights to use any trademarks, trade names, logos or any
contraction, abbreviation or simulation of any Seller that are not included in
the Acquired Assets (the " _Retained Marks_ ") and will not hold itself out as
having any affiliations with any Seller.

 

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 9.4(a), for a period of 90 days
after the Closing Date, Buyer may utilize sales promotional aids, literature
and other printed material transferred by Sellers to Buyer on the Closing Date
and containing the Retained Marks subject to the following limitations:

 

(i) No such material may be used by Buyer on or after the Closing Date for any
purpose unless such material clearly and prominently displays the following
statement or a statement of similar import, the form of which shall be
approved by ADI:

"[Buyer product name], formerly a product of Analog Devices"; and

(ii) Promptly following the Closing Date, Buyer will implement a plan to
eliminate the use of all such material as soon as reasonably practicable and
in any event within such 90 day period.

(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 9.4(a), Buyer may continue to
use the Retained Marks for 90 days following the Closing Date on inventories
existing on the Closing Date, provided that the products in such inventories
are not modified or enhanced in any manner.

 



33 (d) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 9.4(a), Buyer may disclose to
its customers and potential customers that it is designing, manufacturing and
selling the Acquired Products as a successor to Sellers from and after the
Closing Date.

 

(e) The licenses to use the Retained Marks set forth in this Section 9.4 shall
not prohibit ADI or any of its subsidiaries from using the Retained Marks (or
any similar name or logo) during the term of the respective license or
thereafter in any manner. Buyer agrees that its use of the Retained Marks
shall be consistent with the past practices of Sellers and their respective
direct and indirect subsidiaries in connection with their business and
operations and, with respect to such use, Buyer shall adhere to substantially
similar quality standards to which Sellers and their direct and indirect
subsidiaries adhered immediately prior to the Closing, provided such quality
standards have been made available to Buyer in writing.

9.5 _Payment or Receipt of Certain Monies_.

(a) In the event that any Seller (or an Affiliate thereof) inadvertently pays
or discharges, after the Closing, any Assumed Liabilities, Buyer shall
reimburse such Seller or Affiliate for the amount so paid or discharged within
30 days of being presented with written evidence of such payment or discharge.
Buyer shall promptly forward to the applicable Seller all monies received by
Buyer or its Affiliates following the Closing with respect to any Excluded
Asset promptly (and in any event within five (5) Business Days) after receipt
thereof.

 

(b) In the event that any Seller (or an Affiliate thereof) inadvertently
receives monies, after the Closing, that constitute any Acquired Asset,
Seller shall reimburse Buyer for the amount so received within 30 days of
receipt thereof.

9.6 _Covenant Not to Compete_. During the period commencing on the Closing
Date and continuing until the third (3rd) anniversary of the Closing Date, no
Noncompetition Party shall manufacture or sell any MEMS Microphones ("
_Competitive Activities_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing
covenants shall not prohibit, or be interpreted as prohibiting, any
Noncompetition Party from:

 

(a) entering into any relationship with a person or entity not owned, managed,
operated or controlled by any Noncompetition Party for purposes primarily
unrelated to the Competitive Activities;

(b) making equity investments in publicly owned companies which conduct
Competitive Activities, provided such investments do not confer control of
any such Competitive Activities upon any Noncompetition Party;

(c) acquiring any person or entity which conducts Competitive Activities if,
in the calendar year prior to such acquisition, the consolidated revenues of
such person or entity from its Competitive Activities do not constitute more
than ten percent (10%) of the total consolidated revenues of such person or
entity; or

(d) designing, manufacturing or selling any of the products, or engaging in
any of the activities, described on _Schedule 9.6(d)_.

 



34 For purposes of the Agreement, (i) " _Noncompetition Party_ " means ADI and
any direct or indirect majority-owned subsidiaries of ADI while (but only
while) ADI controls such entity and (ii) " _MEMS Microphones_ " has the
meaning set forth in the License Agreement.

 

9.7 _Covenant Not to Solicit or Hire_. During the period commencing on the
date hereof and continuing until the third (3rd) anniversary of the Closing
Date, neither Party nor any of its Affiliates (while it remains an Affiliate)
will, directly or indirectly, solicit (except for general solicitations of
employment not specifically directed at employees or former employees
described in this Section 9.7) or hire (as an employee, independent contractor
or otherwise) any employee of the other Party (or former employee who was an
employee of such other Party as of the date six (6) months prior to the date
hereof) without obtaining the prior written consent of such other Party.

"either" and "or" are not exclusive and "include", "includes" and "including"
are not limiting; (ii) "hereof", "hereto", "hereby", "herein" and "hereunder"
and words of similar import when used in this Agreement refer to this
Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this
Agreement; (iii) "date hereof" refers to the date set forth in the initial
caption of this Agreement; (iv) "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" means

allocated, indemnified, reimbursed or calculated pursuant to, or in
accordance with, the terms of this Agreement or any Exhibit or Schedule
(including the Disclosure Schedule) referred to herein (including the
calculation, payment or reimbursement of Damages under Article VI hereof) is
originally stated or expressed in a currency other than United States Dollars,
then, for the purpose of determining the amount to be so paid, transferred,
allocated, indemnified, reimbursed or calculated, such amount shall be
converted into United States Dollars at the exchange rate between those two
currencies most recently quoted in _The Wall Street Journal_ in New York as of
the Business Day immediately prior to (or, if no such quote exists on
such Business Day, on the closest Business Day prior to) the day on which the
party required to make such payment, transfer, indemnification, reimbursement
or calculation first becomes obligated to do so hereunder (or, in the case of
Article VI hereof, would have first become obligated to do so but for the
operation of Section 6.5(b) hereof); _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in
this Section 10.17 shall be deemed to require either Party to make any foreign
currency conversion or other similar calculation that violates or conflicts
with, or otherwise causes a party to violate, applicable law or U.S. GAAP.

10.18  _Waiver of Jury Trial_. To the extent permitted by applicable law,
each Party hereby irrevocably waives all rights to trial by jury in any
action, proceeding or counterclaim (whether based on contract, tort or
otherwise) arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions
