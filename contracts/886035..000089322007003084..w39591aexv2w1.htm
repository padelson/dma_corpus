   ##### 

  

   

sentence of this Section 4.3(a). In the case of Taxes that are payable with
respect to a taxable period that begins before the Closing Date and ends
after the Closing Date, the portion of any such Tax that is allocable to the
portion of the period ending on the Closing Date, shall be deemed equal to
the amount which would be payable if the taxable year ended at the time of
the Closing Date and the Purchaser shall prepare books and working papers
(including a closing of the books) that will demonstrate the income and
activities of the members of the Company Group for the period ending at the
time of the Closing, and such post-closing partial period. In the event that
one party (the " _Tax Indemnitor_ ") is obligated to indemnify the other party
(the " _Tax Indemnitee_ ") for any Tax under this Section 4.3(a), such
indemnity amount shall be reduced by the present value of any future material
Tax benefits reasonably likely to be realized by the Tax Indemnitee resulting
from such Tax (such present value to be determined by mutual agreement of the
Tax Indemnitor and the Tax Indemnitee or, if they are unable to agree, by
the Tax Dispute Accountants pursuant to Section 4.3(h)). 

   

 (b) _Tax Returns_. 

  

 (i) _Sellers  Responsibility_. The Sellers shall cause the members of the Company Group to join, for all taxable periods (or portions thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing Date, in (A) the consolidated federal income Tax Returns of the Sellers and (B) the consolidated, combined or unitary state, local or foreign income tax returns of or including the Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates (other than the members of the Company Group) with respect to which the members of the Company Group (x) has joined in the most recent taxable year or (y) are required by law to join in filing, and shall prepare and file all such Tax Returns. The Sellers shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed all other Tax Returns that are required to be filed by or in respect of the Company Group on or prior to the Closing Date. Any such Tax Returns with respect to which the Sellers are responsible for preparing and filing pursuant to this Section 4.3(b)(i) that include the taxable periods (or portions thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing Date with respect to the members of the Company Group shall, insofar as they relate to the members of the Company Group, be prepared on a basis consistent with the recent tax accounting practices previously utilized in the Tax Returns with respect to the members of the Company Group, except as otherwise required under applicable law. 

  

 (ii) _Purchaser  Responsibility_. The Purchaser shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns required to be filed by or in respect of the Company Group other than those Tax Returns described as the Sellers responsibility in Section 4.3(b)(i) above and shall report on such Tax Returns (including any consolidated federal income Tax Return filed by the Purchaser) any transactions or events by or relating to any of the members of the Company Group after the Closing with respect to the members of the Company Group. Any such Tax Returns with respect to which the Purchaser are responsible for preparing and filing pursuant to this Section 4.3(b)(ii) that include the taxable periods (or portions thereof) ending on or prior to the 

   ##### 

  

   

Closing Date with respect to the members of the Company Group shall, insofar
as they relate to the members of the Company Group, (x) be on a basis
consistent with the recent tax accounting practices previously utilized in
the Tax Returns with respect to the members of the Company Group, except as
otherwise required under applicable law, and (y) be submitted to the Sellers
for their review and approval (which shall be delivered to the Sellers within
a reasonable time prior to the filing date for the Sellers to review and
approve such Tax Returns), such approval not to be unreasonably withheld. 

  

 (iii) _Cooperation_. The Sellers and the Purchaser shall cooperate with each other, and after Closing Date the Purchaser shall cause the members of the Company Group to cooperate with the Sellers, with respect to the preparation and filing of any Tax Return for which the other is responsible pursuant to this Section 4.3(b). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, with respect to all federal consolidated income Tax Returns and state and local consolidated, combined and unitary and foreign Tax Returns of the Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates for all taxable years (or portions thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing Date with respect to the members of the Company Group, the Purchaser shall cause the members of the Company Group to prepare accurately and completely and submit to the Sellers all "tax packages" (including all "foreign reporting packages") and all other information reasonably requested by the Sellers and necessary for the preparation and filing of such Tax Returns by the Sellers no later the date reasonably required for the Sellers to review such documents and to satisfy any applicable Tax Return or other related informational filing requirements in a timely manner. In the event that, after having made inquiry of the Purchaser, the Sellers shall have good reason to believe that such tax packages, foreign reporting packages and other information will not be provided to the Sellers on a timely basis, the Sellers shall promptly notify Purchaser of their intention to, at the Purchasers expense, retain Ernst and Young LLP, or other accounting firm of its choice, to prepare such packages and information and submit the same to the Sellers. In that event, if the Purchaser is then unable to provide Sellers with reasonably adequate assurances that such Tax packages and information will be provided in a timely manner, then Sellers shall have the right to retain any such Tax accounting firm as described in the immediately preceding sentence. In the event the Sellers exercises its rights under the preceding sentence, the Purchaser shall cause the members of the Company Group to fully cooperate with and provide all necessary information and access to Ernst and Young LLP or such other accounting firm as may be necessary to enable it to accurately and completely prepare such packages and information for submission to the Sellers. 

  

 (iv) _Amended Returns_. For all taxable periods (or portions thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing Date with respect to the members of the Company Group, the Purchaser shall not, and shall cause the members of the Company Group not to, file (or consent to file) any amended Tax Returns or a claim for a refund of any Tax, unless the Sellers shall have reviewed and consented in writing to the contents of any such amended Tax Return (or claim for a refund) prior to the filing thereof (which consent shall not be 

   ##### 

  

   

unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed). The Sellers shall not file any
amended returns or claim any Tax refunds on behalf of the Company Group for
any taxable periods (or portions thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing
Date with respect to the members of the Company Group, unless the Purchaser
shall have reviewed and consented in writing to the contents of any such
amended Tax Return (or claim for a refund) prior to the filing thereof (which
consent shall not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed);
provided, however, that the Purchaser shall not be required to consent to the
extent that such amended Tax returns or Tax refund claims would likely have a
materially adverse Tax effect upon the members of the Company Group for any
taxable period of the Company Group ending after the Closing Date. Any
dispute with respect to this Section 4.3(b)(iv) shall be resolved by the Tax
Dispute Accountants pursuant to Section 4.3(h), and any such determination by
the Tax Dispute Accountants shall be final. 

   

 (c) _Refunds_. Subject to Section 4.3(b) above and except as provided below, the Sellers shall be entitled to retain, or promptly receive payment from the members of the Company Group or the Purchaser of, (i) any Tax refund (including refunds arising by reason of amended returns filed after the Closing Date) (except to the extent that the Tax refund is otherwise reflected on the Financial Statements) or (ii) credit of any Taxes (plus any interest thereon received with respect thereto from the applicable taxing authority) relating to the members of the Company Group (except to the extent that the Tax credit is otherwise reflected on the Financial Statements), for which the Sellers are responsible under Section 4.3(a) or has otherwise paid or caused to be paid. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Purchaser shall not, and shall cause the members of the Company Group not to (without the prior written consent of the Sellers not to be unreasonably withheld) carry back to taxable periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date losses or other tax attributes of the Company Group generated in taxable periods ending after the Closing Date. If the use of such losses or tax attributes by carry back is consented to by Sellers, the Purchaser shall be entitled to any Tax refunds generated by the utilization of such losses or tax attributes. For these purposes, Sellers shall be deemed to have consented to any carry back of tax attributes to the extent such carry back is required under applicable Tax law. In addition, any reduction of Taxes (" _Reduced Taxes_ ") due with respect to the assets or business of the members of the Company Group for any period or partial period ending after the Closing Date with respect to the members of the Company Group that is attributable to an adjustment on audit by a taxing authority requiring any member of the Company Group to capitalize expenses or otherwise defer deductions that were currently deducted on a Tax return as originally filed for periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date shall be credited to the Sellers, and the Purchaser shall pay over such Reduced Taxes to the Sellers promptly after the receipt of any refund of Taxes attributable thereto or the payment of any Reduced Tax or the reporting of any Tax Liability in an amount reflecting such Reduced Taxes, less the reasonable expenses incurred by the Purchaser, if any, to amend any Tax Returns in order to pursue such refund. Any dispute with respect to Reduced Taxes shall be resolved by the Tax Dispute Accountants, and any such 

   ##### 

  

   

determination by the Tax Dispute Accountants shall be final. The Purchaser
shall be entitled to the benefit of any other refund or credit of Taxes (plus
any interest thereon received with respect thereto from the applicable taxing
authority) relating to the member of the Company Group. The Purchaser and the
Sellers shall cooperate, and the Purchaser shall cause the members of the
Company Group and their other Affiliates, to cooperate with the Sellers,
with respect to claiming of any refund or credit referred to in this Section
4.3(c), including discussing potentially available refunds or credits and

PDC shall have the right to represent the interests of the members of the Company Group and control the conduct and disposition of any Tax audit or administrative or court proceeding relating to Taxes for any taxable periods (or portions thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing Date, and for which the Sellers may be responsible hereunder; _provided_ that (A) the Purchaser shall have the right to consult with the Sellers during such proceedings at its own expense, and (B) the Sellers shall not accept any proposed adjustment or enter into any settlement or agreement in compromise which would have a materially adverse Tax effect upon the members of the Company Group for any Tax period of the Company Group ending after the Closing Date without the prior written consent of the Purchaser, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

For the avoidance of any doubt, these limitations shall not be applicable with respect to any taxable period of the members of the Company Group beginning after the Closing Date. To the extent that any elections described in this Section 4.3(e) are made with respect to any member of the Company Group, the Purchaser and the Sellers will cooperate fully with each other in making such elections and in completing, executing and assisting with the timely filing of all forms necessary to effectuate such elections, in providing all reasonably necessary information and in taking other actions as reasonably necessary to effectuate and preserve the elections.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if PDC or an Affiliate of PDC has not requested or otherwise consented to the making of a Section 338(g) Election with respect to any member of the Company Group, the Purchaser shall cause such members of the Company Group not to: (i) pay any dividend, or engage in any other transaction that could be characterized as payment of a dividend for United States federal income tax purposes, during the taxable year that includes the Closing (other than any dividend paid with respect to any Minority Interest Company, any dividend paid to minority shareholders of a member of the Company Group to the extent that such dividend is consistent with the historic distribution practices with respect to such entity, or any dividend payment caused to be made by Sellers (including the contemplated distribution by Alambres y Cables Venezolanos C.A. in an amount approximately equal to $13.5 million)), or (ii) outside the ordinary course of business (as reasonably determined by the Purchaser), engage in any transaction that would cause the members of the Company Group to have extraordinary earnings and profits (as determined for United States federal income tax purposes) or give rise to "passive income" within the meaning of section 904(d)(2) of the Code during the taxable year that includes the Closing. For purposes of the preceding sentence, (x) the taxable year of the members of the Company Group shall be a year ending December 31, and (y) the foregoing restrictions on the conduct of business shall not apply: (A) with respect 

   #####

 8.2.5 _Indemnification Procedures_. A party entitled to indemnification hereunder shall herein be referred to as an "Indemnitee." A party obligated to indemnify an Indemnitee hereunder shall herein be referred to as an "Indemnitor." 

  

 (a) If an Indemnitee receives written notice of any claim or the commencement of any action by any third party that such Indemnitee reasonably believes may give rise to a claim for indemnification from an Indemnitor hereunder, and such Indemnitee intends to seek indemnification from such Indemnitor with respect thereto under this Section 8, such Indemnitee shall, provide written notice thereof to such Indemnitor within ten (10) Business Days after receipt by such Indemnitee; provided, however, that the failure to give such notification shall not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except and only to the extent that the Indemnitor shall have been actually prejudiced as a result of such failure. Such notice shall (i) specify in reasonable detail the basis on which indemnification is being asserted, (ii) provide a reasonable estimate of the amount of the Damages that are asserted, if any; (iii) specify the provision or provisions of this Agreement under which such Damages are asserted and (iv) include copies of all notices and documents (including court papers) served on or received by the 

   ##### 

  

   

Indemnitee from such third party. Upon receipt of such notice, the Indemnitor
shall be entitled to participate in such claim or action, to assume the
defense thereof, and to settle or compromise such claim or action; _provided_
that the Indemnitor shall not enter into any settlement that provides for
injunctive or other non-monetary relief affecting the Indemnitee without the
prior written consent of the Indemnitee, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. After notice to the Indemnitee of the
Indemnitors election to assume the defense of such claim or action, the
Indemnitor shall not be liable to the Indemnitee for any legal or other
expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with the
defense thereof; provided that the Indemnitee shall have the right to employ
counsel to participate in such defense, if either (x) such claim or actions
involves remedies other than monetary damages and such remedies in the
Indemnitees reasonable judgment, could have a material adverse effect on such
Indemnitee, (y) the Indemnitee determines in its reasonable judgment that it
has available to it one or more defenses or counterclaims that are
inconsistent with one or more of the defenses or counterclaims alleged by the
Indemnitor and which could be materially adverse to the Indemnitor; or (z)
a conflict of interest makes separate representation by the Indemnitees own
counsel advisable; and provided further, in the case of clause (y) and (z)
above, that the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel as may be
employed by the Indemnitee shall be paid by the Indemnitor. If the Indemnitor
does not elect to assume the defense of such claim or action within twenty
(20) Business Days of the Indemnitees delivery of the notice and other
documents that it is required to deliver to the Indemnitor in respect of such
a claim or action, the Indemnitee shall be entitled to assume the defense
thereof. Unless it has been conclusively determined through a final non-
appealable judicial determination (or settlement tantamount thereto) that the
Indemnitor is not liable to the Indemnitee under this Section 8.2.5, the
Indemnitee shall act reasonably and in accordance with its good faith
business judgment with respect thereto, and shall not settle or compromise any
such claim or action without the consent of the Indemnitor, which consent
shall not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed. The parties shall
render to each other such assistance as may reasonably be requested in order
to ensure the proper and adequate defense of any such claim or action,
including making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any relevant materials or to
testify at any proceedings relating to such claim or action. 

  

 (b) Within twenty (20) Business Days after an Indemnitee sustains any Damages not involving a third party claim or action that such Indemnitee reasonably believes may give rise to a claim for indemnification from an Indemnitor hereunder, and such Indemnitee intends to seek indemnification from such Indemnitor with respect thereto, such Indemnitee shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against an Indemnitor, deliver notice of such claim to the Indemnitor, which notice shall contain the information described in the second sentence of Section 8.2.5(a). Thereafter, the Indemnitor and the Indemnitee shall proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution of such dispute and, if not resolved through negotiations, such dispute shall be resolved by 

   ##### 

  

   

litigation in an appropriate court of competent jurisdiction in accordance
with Sections 10.14, 10.15 and 10.16. 

   

 (c) Without limiting the Sellers rights under other provisions of this Agreement, the Sellers shall have the option to assume exclusive control of the resolution of any matter arising under any Environmental Law for which it has an indemnification obligation; provided that the Purchaser shall be notified of the scope of all work plans, and the commencement of all work to be performed by Sellers will be subject to the prior written consent of the Purchaser, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. 

   

 (d) The Sellers shall have satisfied its indemnification obligations under this Agreement with respect to any matter arising under any Environmental Law if the result meets or exceeds the least stringent standards (including any lesser standards resulting from any site-specific risk assessments and including any deed and land use restrictions and institutional controls), based on the use of the property on the Closing Date and applicable Environmental Laws as in effect on the Closing Date. In the event that there are no applicable standards under the Environmental Laws of the relevant jurisdiction, the standard to be utilized is that required by the Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over the matter. 

  

 8.2.6 _Offset_. The obligations hereunder of the Sellers, on the one hand, and the Purchaser, on the other hand, are independent of the obligations of the other hereunder and shall not be subject to any right of offset, counterclaim or deduction. 

  

 8.2.7 _Exclusive Remedy_. The indemnities provided for in this Agreement shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of (a) the Purchaser after the Closing against the Sellers and their respective Affiliates (i) for any inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of the Sellers contained in Section 2 of this Agreement or (ii) to recover any money damages for any failure or breach of any covenant, obligation, condition or agreement to be performed or fulfilled by the Sellers hereunder or any matters arising under any Environmental Law respecting any member of the Company Group, including but not limited to any environmental conditions on, at, under or emanating from the facilities owned or leased by any member of the Company Group or elsewhere; and (b) the Sellers after the Closing against the Purchaser and their respective Affiliates (i) for any inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of the Purchaser contained in Section 3 of this Agreement or (ii) to recover money damages for any failure or breach of any covenant, obligation, condition or agreement to be performed or fulfilled by the Purchaser hereunder; provided, however, that such limitations shall not limit (i) any remedy that may be available to a party against any other party that has engaged in fraud against such party, or (ii) any equitable remedy that may be available to a party against a party that has failed to perform any of its obligations hereunder, including as contemplated in Section 10.17. 

   ##### 

  

  

 8.2.8 _Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. Any indemnity payment under this Agreement will be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price paid by the Purchaser for the Company Group for Tax purposes, unless a " _Final Determination_ " with respect to the indemnified party or any of its Affiliates causes any such payment not to be treated as an adjustment to such price for Federal Income Tax purposes. For purposes of this agreement " _Final Determination_ " means (i) with respect to federal income Taxes, a "determination" as defined in Section 1313(a) of the Code or execution of an IRS Form 870-AD and, (ii) with respect to Taxes other than federal income Taxes, any final determination of Liability in respect of a Tax that, under applicable law, is not subject to further appeal, review or modification through proceedings or otherwise (including the expiration of a statute of limitations or a period for the filing of claims for refunds, amended returns or appeals from adverse determinations).

 10.1 _Modification; Waiver_. No amendment, modification or discharge of this Agreement, and no waiver hereunder, shall be valid or binding unless set forth in writing and duly executed by the party against whom enforcement of the amendment, modification, discharge or waiver is sought. Any such waiver shall constitute a waiver only with respect to the specific matter described in such writing and shall in no way impair the rights of the party granting such waiver in any other respect or at any other time. The waiver by any of the parties hereto of a breach of or a default under any of the provisions of this Agreement or a failure to or delay in exercising any right or privilege hereunder, shall not be construed as a waiver of any other breach or default of a similar nature, or as a waiver of any of such provisions, rights or privileges hereunder. The rights and remedies herein provided are cumulative and none is exclusive of any other, or of any rights or remedies that any party may otherwise have at law or in equity. Whenever this Agreement requires or permits consent by or on behalf of a party, such consent shall be given in writing in a manner consistent with the requirements for a waiver of compliance as set forth in this Section 10.1. 

  

 10.2 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, including the Schedules and Exhibits hereto (which are hereby incorporated by reference and made a part hereof) and the ancillary agreements referred to herein is the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all other prior discussions, negotiations, agreements and understandings, oral or written, express or implied, between the parties hereto and their respective Affiliates, representatives and agents in respect of the subject matter hereof, except that this Agreement does not supersede the Confidentiality Agreement, the terms and conditions of which the parties hereto expressly reaffirm. 

  

 10.3 _Certain Limitations_. It is the explicit intent and understanding of each of the parties hereto that neither party nor any of its Affiliates, representatives or agents is making any representation or warranty whatsoever, oral or written, express or implied, other than those set forth in Sections 2 and 3 of this Agreement and in the certificates delivered pursuant to Sections 6.3.2 and 6.4.2 and neither party is relying on any statement, representation or warranty, oral or written, express or implied, made by the 

   ##### 

  

   

other party or such other partys Affiliates, representatives or agents
(including, with respect to any estimates, projections, forecasts, budgets or
other forward-looking information delivered or made available to the
Purchaser or their respective representatives), except for
the representations and warranties set forth in such Sections. EXCEPT AS
OTHERWISE SPECIFICALLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT OR IN ANY OTHER AGREEMENT
OR CERTIFICATE DELIVERED BY ANY SELLER IN CONNECTION HEREWITH, THE PARTIES
EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OR REPRESENTATION AS TO CONDITION,
MERCHANTABILITY OR SUITABILITY AS TO ANY OF THE ASSETS OF ANY MEMBER OF THE
COMPANY GROUP TAKEN AS A WHOLE. Except as otherwise specifically set forth in
this Agreement, the Purchaser expressly waives and relinquishes, on behalf of
itself, its successors and any assigns, any and all rights, claims or
remedies it may have against the Sellers under any Environmental Laws, as
presently in force or hereafter enacted, promulgated or amended or at common
law. The parties agree that this is an arms length transaction in which the
parties undertakings and obligations are limited to the performance of their
obligations under this Agreement. The Purchaser acknowledges that it is a
sophisticated investor, and that it has only a contractual relationship with
the Sellers, based solely on the terms of this Agreement and the
Confidentiality Agreement, and that there is no special relationship of trust
or reliance between the Purchaser and the Sellers. The parties have
participated jointly in the negotiating and drafting of this Agreement. In
the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation shall arise,
this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly and no presumption or
burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of
the authorship of any provisions of this Agreement. 

  

 10.4 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated: 

  

 (a) at any time prior to the Closing Date by mutual written consent of the Purchaser and the Sellers; or 

  

 (b) by the Purchaser or the Sellers, if the Closing shall not have taken place on or before December 31, 2007 (as may be extended, the "End Date"); provided, that, if the condition to the obligations of the parties set forth in Section 6.2.1 or 6.2.3, or both, has not been fulfilled and all other conditions to the obligations of the parties are fulfilled (or are immediately capable of being fulfilled at the Closing), then, without action being required of any party, the End Date shall be extended to February 29, 2008; and provided further that if the Purchaser has not received the Company Group Financial Information to the extent related to periods as of and ended on or prior to September 30, 2007 by November 15, 2007, then the End Date shall be extended to February 29, 2008. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.4(b) if such party is in breach of any covenant made herein which it is obligated to fulfill prior to the Closing and the non-occurrence of the Closing is attributable to a breach of such covenant; or 

   ##### 

  

   

 (c) By either PDC, on the one hand, or the Purchaser, on the other hand, by written notice to the other party if: 

  

 (i) the other party has (and the terminating party shall not have) failed to perform and comply, in all material respects, with all agreements, covenants and conditions hereby required to have been performed or complied with by such party prior to the time of such termination, and such failure would result in the inability of any condition set forth in Section 6 to be satisfied and shall not have been cured within thirty (30) days following written notice of such failure; or 

  

 (ii) any event shall occur after the date hereof that shall have made it impossible to satisfy a condition precedent to the terminating partys obligations to perform its obligations hereunder and such party has not waived such condition, unless the occurrence of such event shall be due to the failure of the terminating party to perform or comply with any of the agreements, covenants or conditions hereof to be performed or complied with by such party prior to the Closing; or 

  

 (d) by the Purchaser, if the Purchaser shall not have received on or prior to January 15, 2008 the Company Group Financial Information (other than those as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007) pursuant to Section 4.16. 

  

 (e) In the event of termination by the Sellers or the Purchaser pursuant to this Section 10.4, written notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the other party specifying the subsection of this 10.4 pursuant to which termination is being made and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be terminated without further action by either party. If the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are terminated as provided herein: 

   

 (i) The Purchaser shall return to the Sellers all documents and other materials received from the Sellers, their respective Affiliates (including the Company Group) or their respective agents (including all copies of or materials developed from any such documents or other materials) relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, whether obtained before or after the execution hereof; and 

   

 (ii) All confidential information received by the Purchaser with respect to the Sellers and their respective Affiliates shall be otherwise treated in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement which shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding the termination of this Agreement. 

  

 (f) If this Agreement is terminated as provided in this Section 10.4, this Agreement shall become null and void and of no further force or effect and no party 

   ##### 

  

   

hereto shall have any Liability to the other party hereto or their respective
Affiliates, directors, officers or employees, except for the Confidentiality
Agreement as amended by the last sentence of Section 4.2.3 and this Section
10.4, Section 4.4 (relating to publicity), and Section 10.5 (relating to
certain expenses), Section 10.14 (relating to governing law), Section
10.15 (relating to jurisdiction), and Section 10.16 (relating to waiver of
punitive and other damages and jury trial). Nothing in this Section 10.4
shall be deemed to release either party from any liability for losses or
damages resulting from the willful breach by such party of the terms
and provisions of this Agreement or to impair the right of either party to
compel specific performance by the other party of its obligations under this
Agreement. 

  

 10.5 _Expenses_. Except as expressly provided herein, whether or not the transactions contemplated herein shall be consummated, the Purchaser and the Sellers shall each pay, or cause to be paid, their own expenses, costs and fees incident to the preparation, negotiation and performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, it being understood that any such expenses, costs and fees in respect of accounting, legal, financial advisory, investment bankers, and broker services incurred by any member of the Company Group shall be the liability and obligation of the Sellers. 

  

 10.6 _Further Actions_. Each party shall execute and deliver such certificates, instruments, ancillary agreements and other documents and take such other actions as may reasonably be requested by the other party in order to consummate or implement the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

 10.7 _Post-Closing Access_. In connection with any matter relating to any period prior to, or any period ending on, the Closing, the Purchaser shall, upon the request and at the expense of the Sellers and with reasonable advance notice, permit the Sellers and its representatives access at all reasonable times during normal business hours to the properties, books and records, and personnel of the members of the Company Group and furnish for inspection such information and documents in its possession relating to the Company Group as the Sellers may reasonably request. The Purchaser shall execute (and shall cause the members of the Company Group to execute) such documents as the Sellers may reasonably request to enable the Sellers to file any required reports or Tax Returns relating to any of the members of the Company Group. The Purchaser shall not dispose of such books and records during the six-year period beginning with the Closing Date without the Sellers consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Following the expiration of such six-year period, the Purchaser may dispose of such books and records at any time upon giving sixty (60) days prior written notice to the Sellers, unless the Sellers agrees to take possession of such books and records within sixty (60) days at no expense to the Purchaser.

proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions,

 10.17 _Specific Performance_. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges and agrees that, in the event of any breach of this Agreement, the non-breaching party would be irreparably and immediately harmed and could not be made whole by monetary damages. It is accordingly agreed that the parties hereto (a) shall be entitled, in addition to any other remedy to which they may be entitled at law or in equity, to compel specific performance of this Agreement in accordance with any action instituted in accordance with Section 10.15 and (b) will waive, in any action for specific performance, the defense of the adequacy of a remedy at law. 

  

 10.18 _Inconsistencies with Other Agreements_. In the event of any inconsistency between the provisions in the body of this Agreement and those in the ancillary agreements referred to herein, the provisions in the body of this Agreement will prevail and govern.
