outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company

unanimously (a) approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Offer and the
Merger, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, (b)

WHEREAS, each of the boards of directors of Parent and Merger Sub has
unanimously (a) approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Offer and the
Merger, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, and (b)
determined that this Agreement and such transactions are fair to, and in the

willingness to enter into this Agreement, simultaneously with the execution

1 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this
Agreement, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree
as follows:

 

ARTICLE 1

THE OFFER

Section 1.1. _The Offer_.

 

(a) As promptly as practicable after the date hereof, but in no event later
than the seventh Business Day after the date of the first public announcement
of the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Parent shall cause Merger Sub
to commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder (the "
_Exchange Act_ ")), and Merger Sub shall commence, the Offer. The obligation
of Merger Sub to accept for payment and pay for shares of Company Common Stock
validly tendered (and not withdrawn) pursuant to the Offer shall be
subject only to those conditions set forth in _Annex A_ (any of which may be
waived by Merger Sub in its sole discretion; _provided, however_ , that,
without the prior written consent of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall
not waive the Minimum Tender Condition).

(b) As soon as practicable on the date of commencement of the Offer (within
the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act), Parent and Merger Sub
shall file with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the "
_SEC_ ") with respect to the Offer a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO
(together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the "
_Schedule TO_"), which will comply as to form in all material respects with
the provisions of applicable federal securities Laws and will contain an offer
to purchase relating to the Offer and forms of related letters of transmittal
and summary advertisement and other ancillary Offer documents and instruments
pursuant to which the Offer will be made (which documents, together with any
amendments, supplements or exhibits thereto, are referred to herein
collectively as the " _Offer Documents_ "), which shall be disseminated to the
holders of shares of Company Common Stock as and to the extent required by the
Exchange Act. Subject to the provisions of  _Section 7.3_, the Schedule TO
and the Offer Documents may include (and the Company hereby consents to the
inclusion of) the Recommendation. Merger Sub may, but shall not be required
to, provide guaranteed delivery procedures for the tender of shares of
Company Common Stock in the Offer; _provided, however_ , if Merger Sub
provides guaranteed delivery procedures, for purposes of determining whether
the Tender Condition has been satisfied, Parent and Merger Sub shall
include for purposes of its determination thereof shares of Company Common
Stock tendered in the Offer pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures if and
only if shares of Company Common Stock subject to such guarantees have been
received by, or on behalf of, Merger Sub as of the Expiration Date. The
Company shall promptly furnish to Parent and Merger Sub all information
concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries that is required by applicable
Laws to be included in the Schedule TO or the Offer Documents. Parent, Merger
Sub and the Company shall cooperate in good faith to determine and include the
information regarding the Company that is necessary, reasonably appropriate,
or otherwise reasonably requested by Parent for inclusion in the Schedule TO
and the Offer Documents to satisfy applicable Laws. Each of Parent, Merger Sub
and the Company shall promptly correct any information provided by it or on
its behalf for use in the Schedule TO or the Offer Documents if and to the
extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in any
material respect and to supplement the information contained in the Schedule
TO and the Offer Documents to include any information that shall become
necessary in order to make the statements

 



2  therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, in each case, as and to the extent required by applicable Laws.
Parent and Merger Sub shall take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule TO
and the Offer Documents, as so corrected or supplemented, to be filed with the
SEC and the Offer Documents, as so corrected, to be disseminated to the
holders of Company Common Stock, in each case, as and to the extent required
by applicable Laws. Parent and Merger Sub shall provide the Company and its
counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule TO and
the Offer Documents prior to the filing thereof with the SEC. Parent and
Merger Sub shall provide in writing to the Company and its counsel any and all
comments or other communications, whether written or oral, that Parent, Merger
Sub or their counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to
the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents promptly after such receipt, and
Parent and Merger Sub shall provide the Company and its counsel a reasonable
opportunity to participate in the formulation of any response to any such
comments of the SEC or its staff (including a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on any such response, to which Parent and Merger Sub shall
give due consideration to any comments made by the Company and its counsel)
and to participate in any discussions with the SEC or its staff regarding any
such comments.

(c) Each of Parent and Merger Sub expressly reserves the right to modify the
terms of the Offer, except that neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall, without
the prior written consent of the Company, (i) decrease the Offer Price payable
in the Offer or change the form of consideration payable in the Offer, (ii)
decrease the number of shares of Company Common Stock sought pursuant to the

14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act) following the commencement of the Offer
(the initial expiration date, or such subsequent date to which the expiration
of the Offer is extended pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, the " _Expiration Date_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Merger
Sub shall extend the Expiration Date for any period required by the Exchange
Act, the interpretations and positions of the SEC and its staff with respect
thereto or the rules and regulations of the NASDAQ Stock Market, LLC ("
_Nasdaq_ ") applicable to the Offer or as may be required by any other
Governmental Entity. Unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance
with _Article 9_ (and subject to each partys rights to terminate this
Agreement in accordance with _Article 9_), if, at any scheduled Expiration
Date, all of the conditions to the Offer set forth in _Annex A_ shall not have
been satisfied or earlier waived, Merger Sub shall extend the Offer and the
Expiration Date to a date that is not more than ten Business Days after such
previously scheduled Expiration Date; _provided, however_ , that Merger Sub
shall not be required to extend the Offer and the Expiration Date to a date
later than the Outside Date. Merger Sub shall not terminate or withdraw the
Offer without the prior written consent of the Company, other than in
connection with the termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Article
9_. In the event this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Article 9_ prior
to any scheduled Expiration Date, Merger Sub shall promptly (and in any event
within 48 hours after such termination) irrevocably and unconditionally
terminate the Offer. Merger Sub may not provide a "subsequent offering period"
within the meaning of Rule 14d-11 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 



3 (e) Subject to the terms of the Offer and this Agreement and the satisfaction
or earlier waiver of all the conditions of the Offer set forth in _Annex A_
as of the Expiration Date, Merger Sub shall promptly, on or after the
Expiration Date, accept for payment (such time of acceptance for payment, the
" _Acceptance Time_ ") and promptly (and in any event within two Business
Days (calculated as set forth in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act)) pay
for all shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered and not properly
withdrawn pursuant to the Offer. Parent shall cause Merger Sub to have, on a
timely basis, the funds necessary to purchase all shares of Company Common
Stock that Merger Sub becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer.

 

 __Section 1.2. _Company Actions._

 

(a) The Company will file with the SEC on the date of the commencement of the
Offer a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with respect
to the Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto,
the " _Schedule 14D-9_") containing the Recommendation; _provided, however_
, that the Company Board may effect a Change in Recommendation as and to the
extent permitted by _Section 7.3_. The Company agrees to cooperate with
Parent and Merger Sub in mailing or otherwise disseminating the Schedule
14D-9 with the Offer Documents to the holders of Company Common Stock. Parent
and Merger Sub shall promptly furnish in writing to the Company all
information concerning Parent and Merger Sub required by applicable Laws to
be set forth in the Schedule 14D-9. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall
cooperate in good faith to determine the information regarding the Company
that is necessary or reasonably appropriate to include in the Schedule 14D-9
to satisfy applicable Laws. Without limitation, the Schedule 14D-9 shall
include the notice of availability of appraisal rights that Section 262(d)(2)
of the DGCL requires the Company to deliver to the Companys stockholders in
connection with the Merger. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall
promptly correct any information provided by it or on its behalf for use in
the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that such information shall have
become false or misleading in any material respect and to supplement
the information contained in the Schedule 14D-9 to include any information
that shall become necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, in each
case, as and to the extent required by applicable Laws. The Company shall take
all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9, as so corrected or
supplemented, to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the holders of
Company Common Stock, in each case, as and to the extent required by
applicable Laws. The Company shall provide Parent, Merger Sub and their
counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9
prior to the filing thereof with the SEC, and the Company shall give
reasonable consideration to any comments made by Parent, Merger Sub and their
counsel. The Company shall provide in writing to Parent, Merger Sub and their
counsel any comments or other communications, whether written or oral, the
Company or its counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to
the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after such receipt, and the Company shall provide
Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel a reasonable opportunity to participate
in the formulation of any response to any such comments of the SEC or its
staff (including a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any such
response, to which the Company shall give reasonable consideration to any
comments made by Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel) and to participate in
any discussions with the SEC or its staff regarding any such comments.

(b) In connection with the Offer, the Company shall furnish or cause to be
furnished to Parent promptly (and in any event within three Business Days of
the date of this Agreement) mailing labels containing the names and addresses
of all of the Companys stockholders

 



4  of record, a non-objecting beneficial owners list and security position
listings of Company Common Stock held in stock depositories, each as of a
recent date, and shall furnish Parent with such additional information,
including updated lists of stockholders and beneficial owners, mailing labels,
security position listings and computer files, and such other information and
assistance as Parent or its agents may reasonably request for the purpose of
communicating the Offer to the record holders and beneficial owners of Company
Common Stock. In addition, in connection with the Offer, the Company shall,
and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause third parties to, cooperate
with Parent and Merger Sub to disseminate the Offer Documents to the holders
of Company Common Stock subject to the Company Stock Plans and to permit such
holders of Company Common Stock to tender their Company Common Stock into the
Offer. Subject to the requirements of applicable Laws, and except for such
steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other
documents necessary to consummate the Offer and the Merger, Parent and Merger
Sub and their agents (i) shall hold in confidence the information contained
in any such labels, listings and files and will use such information only in
connection with the Offer and the Merger, and (ii) following the termination
of this Agreement in accordance with  _Article 9_, shall promptly, at the
election of Parent, deliver to the Company or destroy, and will use their
reasonable best efforts to cause their agents to deliver to the Company or
destroy, all copies and any extract or summaries of such information then in
their possession or control and promptly certify to the Company in writing
that all such material has been returned or destroyed.

 

ARTICLE 2

THE MERGER

Section 2.1. _The Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in
this Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall merge with and into
the Company in accordance with the DGCL, whereupon the separate existence of
Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall continue as the surviving
corporation of the Merger (sometimes herein referred to as the " _Surviving
Corporation_ "). The Merger shall be governed by Section 251(h) of the DGCL
and shall be effected as soon as practicable following the consummation of the
Offer without a meeting and without the approval of the Companys
stockholders; _provided, however,_ that if, notwithstanding such express
election to cause the Merger to be governed by Section 251(h) of the DGCL, the
Merger may not be effected pursuant to Section 251(h) of the DGCL for any
reason, then the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be effected pursuant
to a separate provision of the DGCL as promptly as practicable following the
consummation of the Offer in a manner that is not adverse to the
Companys stockholders.

Section 2.2. _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall
take place at the offices of Foley and Lardner LLP, 777 East Wisconsin Avenue,
Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53202, at 10:00 a.m., local time, on the first Business
Day after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Article
8_, other than those conditions that by their nature are intended to be
satisfied at the Closing, or such other location, time and date as Parent and
the Company shall agree in writing consistent with Section 251(h) of the DGCL,
unless this Agreement has theretofore been terminated in accordance with
_Article 9_ (the actual time and date of the Closing is referred to as the "
_Closing Date_ "). The parties intend that the Closing shall be effected, to
the extent practicable, by conference call, the electronic delivery of
documents and the prior physical exchange of certain other documents to be
held in escrow by outside counsel to the recipient party pending authorization
by the delivering party (or its outside counsel) of their release at the
Closing.

 



5 Section 2.3. _Effective Time_. Currently with or as soon as practicable
following the Closing, the Company and Merger Sub shall cause the certificate
of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ "), in such form as is required by
the DGCL, to be executed, acknowledged and filed with the Secretary of State
of the State of Delaware and make all other filings or recordings required by
the DGCL in connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at
such time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware or at such other time as Merger Sub and the
Company shall agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger (the " _Effective
Time_ ").

 

Section 2.4. _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects
specified in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting and
subject to the foregoing, at the Effective Time, all of the property, assets,
rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of Merger Sub and the
Company shall vest in the Company as the Surviving Corporation, and all of
the debts, liabilities and duties of Merger Sub and the Company shall become
the debts, liabilities and duties of the Company as the Surviving Corporation.

 

Section 2.5. _Certificate of Incorporation_. The certificate of incorporation
of the Company shall be amended at the Effective Time so that it reads in its
entirety in a form to be agreed upon by Parent and the Company in their
reasonable discretion and, as so amended, shall be the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, until thereafter amended in
accordance with applicable Laws.

Section 2.6. _By-Laws_. The by-laws of Merger Sub in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall, at the Effective Time, be the by-laws of the
Surviving Corporation, until thereafter amended in accordance with the
provisions thereof, the provisions of the certificate of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation and applicable Laws.

 

Section 2.7. _Officers and Directors_. The officers of the Company immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall, at the Effective Time, be the officers of
the Surviving Corporation, until the earlier of their resignation or removal
or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the
case may be. The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall, at the Effective Time, be the directors of the Surviving
Corporation, until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their
respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be.

 

Section 2.8. _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of
Company Common Stock or any shares of capital stock of Merger Sub:

(a) Each share of Company Common Stock represented by a certificate (each, a
" _Certificate_ ") or book-entry (each, a " _Company Book-Entry Share_ ")
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
shares canceled pursuant to  _Section 2.8(c)_ and Dissenting Shares as
provided in _Section 3.9_, and after giving effect to _Section 2.9(a)_ and
_Section 2.9(b)_) shall be converted into the right to receive cash in the
amount of the Offer Price, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "),
subject to any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Laws.

 

(b) All shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to be outstanding and shall
be automatically canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each
holder of a Certificate or

 



6  Company Book-Entry Shares, that, immediately prior to the Effective Time,
represented any shares of Company Common Stock shall thereafter cease to have
any rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock, except as
otherwise contemplated by this Agreement or applicable Laws.

(c) Any shares of Company Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company or
owned by Parent or any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent
(including Merger Sub) or the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be automatically canceled and shall cease to exist and no consideration
shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

(d) Each share of Merger Sub common stock, par value $0.01 per share,
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable
share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation, which shares at such time shall comprise the only outstanding
shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

Section 2.9. _Company Restricted Stock and Stock Options_.

(a) The Company shall cause all awards of restricted shares of Company Common
Stock heretofore granted under the Company Stock Plans that have not
heretofore vested (" _Company Restricted Common Stock_ ") to, immediately
prior to the Acceptance Time, become fully vested and without further
restrictions with respect to ownership rights thereto, thereby causing all
shares of Company Restricted Common Stock (less shares withheld having a fair
market value equal to the Taxes required to be withheld with respect thereto)
to become shares of Company Common Stock that are converted into the right to
receive, at the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration as provided in
_Section 2.8(a)_.

(b) The Company shall cause all awards of performance-based restricted shares
heretofore granted under the Company Stock Plans that have not heretofore
vested (" _Company Performance Shares_ " and, together with the Company
Restricted Common Stock, " _Company Restricted Shares_ ") to, immediately
prior to the Acceptance Time, become fully vested and without further
restrictions with respect to ownership rights thereto, thereby causing all
Company Performance Shares (less shares withheld having a fair market value
equal to the Taxes required to be withheld with respect thereto) to become
shares of Company Common Stock that are converted into the right to receive,
at the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section
2.8(a)_. For purposes of this _Section 2.9(b)_, the number of shares of
Company Common Stock to be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in respect of the Company Performance Shares shall
be determined as if the performance objectives applicable to the Company
Performance Shares had been achieved at the target performance level.

 

(c) The Company shall cause all outstanding options to acquire shares of
Company Common Stock from the Company heretofore granted under the Company
Stock Plans (" _Company Stock Options_ "), whether or not then exercisable or
vested, to cease to represent, as of the Acceptance Time, a right to acquire
shares of Company Common Stock and to then be converted, in settlement and
cancellation thereof, into the right to receive, at the Acceptance Time, a
lump sum cash payment by the Surviving Corporation of an amount equal to (i)
the excess, if any, of (A) the per share Merger Consideration over (B)
the exercise price per share of the Company Common Stock subject to such
Company Stock Option, multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock for which such Company Stock Option shall not theretofore have
been exercised (the aggregate amount of such cash payable to holders of all
Company Stock Options, the " _Option_

 



7   _Consideration_ ") (it being understood that each unexercised Company Stock
Option as of the Acceptance Time with an exercise price equal to or greater
than the per share Merger Consideration shall be cancelled at the Acceptance
Time without consideration therefor).

(d) The Company Stock Plans shall terminate, and all rights under any
provision of any other plan, program or arrangement providing for the issuance
or grant of any other interest with respect to the capital stock or other
voting securities of the Company, or for the issuance or grant of any
right of any kind, contingent or accrued, to receive benefits measured by the
value of a number of shares of Company Common Stock, shall be canceled
effective as of the Acceptance Time, without any liability on the part of the
Company (except as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement).

(e) At the Acceptance Time, the Surviving Corporation shall pay to each holder
of Company Stock Options the cash payments to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to this _Section 2.9_. No interest shall be paid or accrue on the
cash payments contemplated by this _Section 2.9_. To the extent the Surviving
Corporation or Parent is required or entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
Company Stock Options and/or Company Restricted Shares with respect to the
making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the " _Code_ "), or any provision of any other Tax Law, the amounts so
withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by the Surviving
Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Company Stock
Options and/or Company Restricted Shares in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case
may be.

(f) Immediately following the Acceptance Time, to the extent necessary, Parent
shall deposit or shall cause to be deposited with the Company cash in U.S.
dollars sufficient to pay the Option Consideration and the Companys portion
of any FICA or FUTA tax related thereto and related to the vesting of the
Company Restricted Shares.

 

(g) By approving this Agreement, the Company Board shall be deemed to have
approved and authorized each and every amendment to any of the Company Stock
Plans, the Company Restricted Shares and the Company Stock Options as may be
necessary or appropriate to give effect to the provisions of this _Section
2.9_.

 

Section 2.10. _Certain Adjustments_. If, between the date of this Agreement
and the Acceptance Time and/or the Effective Time, (a) the outstanding shares
of Company Common Stock shall have been increased, decreased, changed into or
exchanged for a different number of shares or different class, in each case,
by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split, split-up,
combination or exchange of shares, (b) a stock dividend or dividend payable in
any other securities of the Company shall be declared with a record date
within such period, or (c) any similar event shall have occurred, then the
Offer Price and Merger Consideration, as applicable, shall be appropriately
adjusted to provide the holders of shares of Company Common Stock and Company
Stock Options the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior
to such event.

 



8 ARTICLE 3

 

PAYMENT OF MERGER CONSIDERATION

 

Section 3.1. _Paying Agent_. Within 20 Business Days following the date on
which Merger Sub commences the Offer, Parent shall designate, and enter into
an agreement with, such bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the
Company to act as paying agent in the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ "), which
agreement shall provide that, before the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit
or cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent in trust for the benefit of the
holders of Company Common Stock cash in an amount sufficient to effect payment
of the Merger Consideration to which holders of Company Common Stock are
entitled pursuant to _Section 2.8(a)_ and this _Article 3_.

Section 3.2. _Payment Procedures_.

 

(a) Promptly, but in no event later than three Business Days after the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of
record of Company Common Stock (other than holders of Company Book-Entry
Shares held through The Depository Trust Company) that, immediately prior to
the Effective Time, represented shares of Company Common Stock that were
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
_Section 2.8(a)_ (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent or, in
the case of Company Book-Entry Shares, upon adherence to the procedures set
forth in the letter of transmittal) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificates or Company Book-Entry Shares in exchange
for the Merger Consideration. Such letter of transmittal shall be in customary
form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify (such
letter to be reasonably acceptable to the Company prior to the Effective
Time). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
no holder of Company Book-Entry Shares shall be required to deliver a
Certificate or, in the case of Company Book-Entry Shares held through The
Depository Trust Company, an executed letter of transmittal to the Paying
Agent to receive the Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to
receive pursuant to _Section 2.8(a)_. In lieu thereof, each holder of record
of one or more Company Book-Entry Shares held through The Depository Trust
Company whose Company Book-Entry Shares were converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration shall automatically upon the Effective Time
be entitled to receive, and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to pay and
deliver as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, in respect of
each such Company Book-Entry Share, a cash amount in immediately available
funds equal to the Merger Consideration, subject to any withholding of Taxes
as required by applicable Laws, and such Company Book-Entry Shares of such
holder shall forthwith be canceled.

(b) Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent or
to such other agent or agents as Parent may appoint, together with such letter
of transmittal, duly executed and completed, and such other documents as the
Paying Agent may reasonably require, or delivery to the Paying Agent of an
"agents message" in respect of Company Book-Entry Shares not held through The
Depository Trust Company (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the
Paying Agent may reasonably request), the holder shall be entitled to receive
the Merger Consideration, subject to any withholding of Taxes as required by
applicable Laws, in exchange for each share of Company Common Stock so
surrendered formerly represented by such holders properly surrendered
Certificates and/or Company Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, and the
Certificate and/or Company Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be
canceled. No interest shall be paid or accrue on the Merger Consideration.

 

(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the applicable surrendered Certificate or
Company Book-Entry Shares not held through The Depository Trust Company are
registered, then it shall be a condition to the payment of such Merger
Consideration that (i) the Certificate or Company Book-Entry Shares so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form
for transfer and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall have (A) paid
any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of such payment in a name
other than that of the registered holder of the Certificate or Company Book-
Entry Shares surrendered or (B) established to the reasonable satisfaction of
Parent that any such Taxes either have been paid or are not payable.

 



9 Section 3.3. _Undistributed Merger Consideration_. Any portion of the funds
made available to the Paying Agent pursuant to _Section 3.1_ that remains
undistributed on the date that is 12 months after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to Parent or its designee, upon demand, and any of the Companys
stockholders who have not theretofore complied with this _Article 3_ shall
thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the Merger Consideration to
which such holders are entitled pursuant to _Section 2.8(a)_ and this
_Article 3_, and subject to _Section 3.4_, Parent shall pay the Merger
Consideration to such holders.

Section 3.4. _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or any of their respective
representatives shall be liable to any Person in respect of any Merger
Consideration duly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed
by the Companys stockholders at such date as is immediately prior to the time
at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of
any Governmental Entity shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Laws,
become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of any claims
or interests of any such stockholders or their successors, assigns or personal
representatives previously entitled thereto.

Section 3.5. _Investment of Merger Consideration_. The Paying Agent shall
invest the funds made available to the Paying Agent pursuant to _Section
3.1_ as directed by Parent on a daily basis; provided that no gain or loss
thereon shall impact the amounts payable to the Companys stockholders
pursuant to  _Section 2.8(a)_ and this _Article 3_. Any interest and other
income resulting from such investments shall be the property of, and shall be
paid to, Parent.

 

Section 3.6. _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, then, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
reasonably required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person
of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct
as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to
such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall deliver in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration with
respect to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby.

Section 3.7. _Withholding Rights_. To the extent that the Paying Agent, the
Surviving Corporation or Parent is required to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
shares of Company Common Stock with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code or any provision of any other Tax Law, the amounts so withheld
and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by the Paying Agent, the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of
Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made by the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may
be.

 



10 Section 3.8. _Stock Transfer Books_. The stock transfer books of the Company
shall be closed immediately upon the Effective Time, and there shall be no
further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock thereafter
on the records of the Company. At or after the Effective Time, the
Certificates or Company Book-Entry Shares presented to the Paying Agent, the
Surviving Corporation or Parent shall, subject to compliance with the
provisions of this _Article 3_ by the holder thereof, represent only the
right to receive the Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of
Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby.

Section 3.9. _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, but only to the extent required by the DGCL, shares of Company
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
and held by a holder who has properly exercised his, her or its
appraisal rights in accordance with the DGCL (collectively, the " _Dissenting
Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the applicable
portion of the Merger Consideration, but instead shall be entitled to payment
of the fair value of such shares in accordance with the DGCL (and, at the
Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and such holder
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the
provisions of the DGCL), unless and until such holder shall have failed to
perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost his, her or its appraisal
rights, if any, under the DGCL. If any holder of Dissenting Shares shall have
failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such appraisal
rights, then such holders shares of Company Common Stock shall thereupon be
treated as if they had been converted into and become exchangeable for the
right to receive, as of the Effective Time, the applicable portion of the
Merger Consideration for each such share of Company Common Stock, in
accordance with  _Section 2.8(a)_, without any interest thereon. Any portion
of the funds made available to the Paying Agent pursuant to _Section 3.1_
that is not distributed to holders of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant
to the other provisions of this _Article 3_ because such holders properly
exercised and perfected their appraisal rights with respect thereto in
accordance with the DGCL may be paid to the holders of such Dissenting Shares
upon written instructions from Parent to the Paying Agent. The Company shall
provide Parent notice of any written demands for appraisal of any shares of
Company Common Stock, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other
instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company related
thereto. Parent shall have the right to participate in and control all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights
under the DGCL. The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of
Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any
such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

 

ARTICLE 4

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

 

Except as set forth in the Company SEC Reports filed with or furnished to the
SEC on or after December 31, 2012 and prior to the date of this Agreement
(excluding any disclosures set forth in any such Company SEC Reports solely
under the heading "Risk Factors" or with regard to the safe harbor for
forward-looking statements) or in the disclosure schedule delivered by
the Company to Parent prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement
(the " _Company Disclosure Schedule_ ") (it being understood and agreed that
disclosure of any item in the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed
disclosure with respect to any section or subsection of this Agreement to
which the

 



11  relevance of such item is reasonably apparent on the face of such
disclosure), the Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as
follows and as set forth on page five of the Company Disclosure Schedule:

Section 4.1. _Organization and Qualification_. Each of the Company and each of
its Subsidiaries is a corporation or other entity duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its
incorporation or organization. Each of the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries has full corporate or other power and authority to own, operate
and lease the properties owned or used by it and to carry on its business as
and where such is being conducted as of the date of this Agreement, except
where the failure to be in good standing, individually or in the aggregate,
would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect and
would not prevent or delay beyond the Outside Date the Companys ability to
consummate the Offer and the Merger. The Company and each of its
Subsidiaries is duly licensed or qualified to do business as a foreign
corporation or other entity, and is in good standing (to the extent such

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB

 

Parent and Merger Sub jointly and severally represent and warrant to the
Company as follows:

 

Section 5.1. _Organization and Qualification_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub
is a corporation or other entity duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing (to the extent such concept is legally recognized) under the Laws of
the jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization. Each of Parent and
Merger Sub has full corporate or other power and authority to own, operate
and lease the properties owned or used by it and to carry on its business as
and where such is being conducted as of the date of this Agreement, except
where the failure to be in good standing, individually or in the aggregate,
would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.
Each of Parent and Merger Sub is duly licensed or qualified to do business as
a foreign corporation, and is in good standing (to the extent such concept is
legally recognized), in each jurisdiction wherein the character of the
properties owned or leased by it, or the nature of its business, makes such
licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so
licensed or qualified or in good standing, individually or in the aggregate,
would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. The
copies of the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of each of Parent and
Merger Sub, including all amendments thereto, made available by Parent to the
Company are correct and complete copies of such instruments as presently in
effect.

Section 5.2. _Authorization_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has full
corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of
this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby

Parent and Merger Sub, and except for the approval of Parent as the sole
stockholder of Merger Sub (which approval Parent shall effect on the date
hereof immediately following execution of this Agreement), no other corporate
proceedings on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or their respective stockholders
are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. No vote of the holders of any of Parents capital stock
is necessary in connection with the consummation of the Offer and/or the
Merger. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Parent and
Merger Sub and constitutes a valid and legally binding obligation of Parent
and Merger Sub enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as such
enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium, fraudulent transfer and similar laws of general applicability
relating to or affecting creditors rights or by general equity principles.

Section 5.3. _No Violation_. 

(a) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub do
not, and the consummation of the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby by Parent and Merger Sub will not, result in any violation
of, or constitute a default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both)
under, or result by its terms in the termination, amendment, cancellation or
acceleration of any obligation, in the loss of a material benefit or in
increased, additional, accelerated or guaranteed rights or entitlements of any
Person under, or create any obligation to make a payment to any other
Person under, or result in the creation of a Lien on any assets of Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to, (i) any provision of the certificate of
incorporation, by-laws or similar organizational document of Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries or 

 



22  (ii) subject to obtaining or making the consents, approvals, Orders,
authorizations, registrations, declarations and filings referred to in
_Section 5.3(b)_, any Contract to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is
a party or any Order or Law applicable to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries,
except, in the case of this _clause (ii)_, as, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect.

(b) No consent, approval, Order or authorization of, or registration,
declaration or filing with, any Governmental Entity or any other Person is
required by or with respect to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in connection
with the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub or
the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby, except for the Necessary Consents.

Section 5.4. _Offer Documents;  Schedule 14D-9_. None of the Offer Documents,
the Schedule TO or any information supplied by Parent or Merger Sub for
inclusion in the Schedule 14D-9 will, at the time that the Offer Documents,
the Schedule TO, the Schedule 14D-9 or any amendments, supplements or exhibits
thereto are filed with the SEC or are first published, sent or given
to stockholders of the Company, as the case may be, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in
the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub make no representation or
warranty with respect to any information supplied by or on behalf of the
Company in writing that is contained in any of the Offer Documents, the
Schedule TO or any amendment, supplement or exhibit thereto. The Offer
Documents and the Schedule TO will, when filed with the SEC or first
published, sent or given to stockholders of the Company, as the case may be,
comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable provisions of
the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.

 

Section 5.5. _Litigation_. As of the date of this Agreement, there is no
claim, action, suit, arbitration, proceeding, investigation or inquiry
pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened against Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries before or by any Governmental Entity or arbitrator that, if
decided adversely to Parent or Merger Sub, would prevent or materially delay
or impede the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 5.6. _Capitalization of Merger Sub_. As of the date of this
Agreement, the authorized capital stock of Merger Sub consists of 200 shares
of common stock, no par value, all of which are validly issued and
outstanding. All of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Merger Sub is,
and at the Effective Time will be, owned by Parent or a direct or indirect
wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent. Merger Sub has not conducted any business
prior to the date of this Agreement and has no, and prior to the Effective
Time will have no, assets, liabilities or obligations of any nature, other
than those incident to its formation and pursuant to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 

Section 5.7. _Available Funds_. Parents and Merger Subs obligations
hereunder are not subject to any conditions regarding Parents, Merger Subs
or any other Persons ability to obtain financing for the transactions
contemplated herein. Parent and/or Merger Sub has available, or will have
available at the time Merger Sub accepts for payment all shares of Company
Common Stock validly tendered into the Offer and not properly withdrawn, and
at the Effective Time, cash in an aggregate amount sufficient to pay the
aggregate Offer Price, the aggregate Merger Consideration and the other
payment obligations of Parent and Merger Sub hereunder, and to enable Parent
and Merger Sub to perform all of their respective obligations hereunder and
effect the Closing on the terms contemplated by this Agreement, and there is
no restriction on the use of such cash for such purpose.

 



23 Section 5.8. _No Brokers or Finders_. With the exception of the engagement
of Moelis and Company by Parent, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has
any liability or obligation to pay any fees or commissions to any financial
advisor, broker or finder with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby.

 

Section 5.9. _Certain Agreements_. Prior to the Company Board approving this
Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby for
purposes of the applicable provisions of DGCL, neither Parent nor Merger Sub,
alone or together with any other Person, was at any time, or became, an
"interested stockholder" (as such term is defined in Section 203 of the DGCL)
thereunder with respect to the Company or has taken any action that would
cause any anti-takeover statute under the DGCL to be applicable to this
Agreement, the Merger, or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has any direct or indirect
beneficial ownership, or sole or shared voting power, with respect to any
shares of Company Common Stock (other than any such shares held by any
employee benefit plan of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any trustee or
other fiduciary in such capacity under any such employee benefit plan).

Section 5.10.  _Financing_. Parent has delivered to the Company a correct and
complete copy of the Debt Commitment Letter, pursuant to which, and in
accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, the
Commitment Parties have committed to lend the amounts set forth therein to
Merger Sub for the purpose of funding the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. As of the date hereof, (a) the Debt Commitment Letter is in full
force and effect and has not been withdrawn or terminated or otherwise
amended, supplemented or modified in any respect, (b) the Debt Commitment
Letter is, in the form so delivered, a legal, valid and binding obligation of
Parent, and to the knowledge of Parent, the Commitment Parties, (iii) there
are no Contracts (except for customary fee letters and engagement letters)
relating to the Debt Financing, and (iv) no event has occurred that, with or
without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or
breach on the part of Parent or Merger Sub under any term, or a failure of
any condition, of the Debt Commitment Letter or otherwise, or, to the
knowledge of Parent, result in any portion of the Debt Financing to be
unavailable.

 

Section 5.11. _Solvency_. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is entering into this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby with the actual intent to
hinder, delay or defraud either present or future creditors. Assuming that the
representations and warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement are
true and correct in all material respects, and after giving effect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, at and immediately after the
Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation (a) will be
solvent (in that both the fair value of its assets will not be less than the
sum of its debts and the present fair saleable value of its assets will not
be less than the amount required to pay its probable liability on its recourse
debts as they mature or become due), (b) will have adequate capital and
liquidity with which to engage in its business, and (c) will not have
incurred and does not plan to incur debts beyond its ability to pay as they

ARTICLE 7

 

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

 

Section 7.1. _Access to Information_. From the date hereof until the Effective
Time, except (a) for information that, if provided, would, based on the
advice of counsel, adversely affect the ability of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to assert attorney-client or attorney work product privilege or a
similar privilege, or (b) as limited by applicable Laws (including Regulatory
Laws), the Company shall cause its officers and the officers of its
Subsidiaries to furnish Parent with such financial and operating data and
other information with respect to the business and properties of the Company
and its Subsidiaries as Parent may reasonably request; _provided, however_ ,
that all requests for such information pursuant to this _Section 7.1_ shall
be made through Mr. Scott S. Cramer, Vice President, General Counsel
and Corporate Secretary of the Company, or such other Person as Mr. Cramer
shall designate in writing to Parent; _provided_ , _further_ , that the
Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such information to
be made available in a manner that would not reasonably be expected to cause
such waiver or violation. Parent shall, and shall cause its authorized
representatives to, use their reasonable best efforts to minimize any
disruption to the businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries that may
result from the requests for data and information pursuant to this _Section
7.1_. Information obtained by Parent or its representatives pursuant to this
_Section 7.1_ shall be subject to the provisions of the confidentiality
agreement, dated March 31, 2015, between the Company and Parent (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "), which shall remain in full force and effect,
and Parent and each such representative shall be deemed to be a party
thereto.

 



27 Section 7.2. _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 

(a) Each of the Company and Parent shall cooperate with and assist the other
party, and shall use its reasonable best efforts, to promptly (i) take, or
cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws to ensure that the
conditions set forth in _Annex A_ and _Article 8_ are satisfied and to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby as soon as practicable,
including preparing and filing as promptly as practicable all documentation to
effect all necessary filings, notices, petitions, statements, registrations,
submissions of information, applications and other documents and (ii) obtain
and maintain all approvals, consents, registrations, permits, authorizations
and other confirmations required to be obtained from any other Person,
including any Governmental Entity, that are necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby in the most expeditious manner practicable but in any event before the
Outside Date (including obtaining the Necessary Consents). None of Parent,
Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates shall take any action,
refrain from taking any action or permit any action to be taken that is
inconsistent with this Agreement or that would reasonably be expected
to impede, delay or prevent the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby.

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each party hereto
shall (i) make or cause to be made an appropriate filing of a Notification and
Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act and appropriate filings under all other
applicable Regulatory Laws with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby as promptly as practicable, but in no event later than ten Business
Days, after the date of this Agreement, and Parent and the Company shall each
bear their own costs and expenses incurred in connection with such filings; 
_provided_ that Parent shall pay any filing fees in connection therewith, and
(ii) use its reasonable best efforts (A) to respond at the earliest
practicable date to any requests for additional information made by the
Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ "), the Federal
Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ") or any other Governmental Entity, (B) to take
all actions necessary to cause the waiting periods under the HSR Act and any
other applicable Regulatory Laws to terminate or expire at the earliest
possible date, (C) to take all actions necessary to obtain any necessary
approval under applicable Regulatory Laws, (D) to resist in good faith, at
each of their respective cost and expense, any assertion that the
transactions contemplated hereby constitute a violation of the Regulatory
Laws, and (E) to eliminate every impediment under any Regulatory Law that may
be asserted by any Governmental Entity so as to enable the Closing to occur
as soon as reasonably possible (and in any event no later than the Outside
Date), all to the end of expediting consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby. Such reasonable best efforts of Parent shall include, to
the extent such actions would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
material adverse effect on the business of Parent and Parents Affiliates
(including, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation) taken as a
whole, the obligation of Parent to agree to hold separate, divest or enter
into a consent agreement or assume any obligation with regard to (1) any of
the businesses, product lines or assets of Parent or Parents Affiliates, (2)
after the Effective Time, any businesses, product lines or assets of the
Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries acquired pursuant to this
Agreement and/or (3) after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation or
any of its Subsidiaries (including entering into customary ancillary
agreements relating to any such divestiture of businesses, product lines or
assets) as may be required by any applicable Governmental Entity (including
the DOJ, the FTC or any court having jurisdiction), in each case, to avoid
the filing of any suit or proceeding by any Governmental Entity seeking to
enjoin the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or to avoid
the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction,
temporary restraining order or other Order in any suit or proceeding that
would otherwise have the effect of restraining, preventing or delaying the

 



28  consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. To the extent such
reasonable best efforts of Parent and/or the Company would require Parent
and/or the Company to hold separate, divest or enter into a consent agreement
or assume any obligation with regard to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or any of their respective businesses, product lines or assets, Parents
and/or the Companys effectuation of such actions shall be contingent upon
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no action taken by Parent pursuant
to this _Section 7.2_ shall entitle Parent to any reduction of the Offer
Price or the Merger Consideration. Except as otherwise expressly contemplated
by this Agreement, each of Parent and the Company shall not, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries not to, take any action or knowingly omit to take any action
within its reasonable control where such action or omission would, or would
reasonably be expected to, result in (I) any of the conditions to the Offer
set forth in _Annex A_ or any of the conditions to the Merger set forth in 
_Article 8_ not being satisfied prior to the Outside Date or (II) a material
delay in the satisfaction of such conditions. Neither Parent nor the Company
will, directly or indirectly, extend any waiting period under the HSR Act or
other Regulatory Laws or enter into any agreement with a Governmental Entity
to delay or not to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
except with the prior written consent of the other, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(c) In connection with this _Section 7.2_, the parties hereto shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable Laws, (i) cooperate in all respects with each
other in connection with any filing, submission, investigation or inquiry,
(ii) promptly inform the other party of any communication received by such
party from, or given by such party to, the DOJ, the FTC or any other
Governmental Entity and of any material communication received or given in
connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case, regarding any
of the transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) have the right to review in
advance, and to the extent practicable each shall consult the other on, any
filing made with, or written materials to be submitted to, the DOJ, the FTC or
any other Governmental Entity or, in connection with any proceeding by a
private party, any other Person, in connection with any of the transactions
contemplated hereby, and (iv) consult with each other in advance of any
meeting, discussion, telephone call or conference with the DOJ, the FTC
or any other Governmental Entity or, in connection with any proceeding by a
private party, with any other Person and, to the extent not expressly
prohibited by the DOJ, the FTC or any other Governmental Entity or Person,
give the other party hereto the opportunity to attend and participate in such
meetings and conferences, in each case, regarding any of the transactions
contemplated hereby. The parties hereto may, as each deems advisable and
necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material provided
to the other under this _Section 7.2_ as "Outside Counsel Only." Such
materials and the information contained therein shall be given only to the
outside legal counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such
outside counsel to directors, officers or employees of the recipient unless
express written permission is obtained in advance from the source of the
materials (the Company or Parent, as the case may be) or its legal
counsel. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 7.2_,
materials provided to the other party hereto or its counsel may be redacted to
remove references concerning the valuation of the Company and its Subsidiaries
or other competitively sensitive information.

Section 7.3. _Acquisition Proposals; Change in Recommendation_.

 

(a) Except as permitted by this _Section 7.3_, following the execution of
this Agreement, (i) the Company shall, and shall cause its directors,
officers, employees, representatives and other agents, including investment
bankers, attorneys, accountants and other advisors (collectively, the "
_Representatives_ "), and its Subsidiaries to, immediately cease any
discussions or

 



29  negotiations with any Person that may be ongoing with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal and (ii) the Company shall not, and the Company shall
cause its Subsidiaries and the Representatives not to, directly or
indirectly, (A) encourage (including by way of furnishing or disclosing
information), solicit or initiate the making of any Acquisition Proposal, (B)
continue or otherwise participate in discussions or negotiations with, or
furnish or disclose any information to, any Person (other than Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries) in connection with any Acquisition Proposal, (C) waive or
provide any consent under any "standstill" or similar restrictions contained
in any confidentiality or other agreements to which the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company is a party that restricts the making of any
Acquisition Proposal ( _provided_ , that (I) Parent acknowledges that (x) the
Company Board has determined to grant waivers of such "standstill"
restrictions for each Person that is an active participant in the Companys
strategic alternatives review process as of the date of this Agreement to
permit such Person to submit an Acquisition Proposal on a confidential basis
to the Company Board and (y) such waivers so granted shall not be deemed to be
the solicitation of an Acquisition Proposal by the Company, the
Representatives or any Subsidiary of the Company, whether prior to, on or
after the date of this Agreement, and (II) the Company Board may waive or
provide a consent under any such "standstill" or similar restriction if the
Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside
legal counsel, that failing to grant such waiver or consent would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders under
applicable Laws, and any waiver or consent so granted shall not be deemed to
be the solicitation of an Acquisition Proposal by the Company, the
Representatives or any Subsidiary of the Company, whether prior to, on or
after the date of this Agreement), or (D) enter into any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle or merger, acquisition or
similar agreement contemplating or otherwise relating to any Acquisition
Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in _Section
7.3(b)_) (each, a " _Company Acquisition Agreement_ ").

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 7.3_, at
any time prior to, but not after, the Acceptance Time, the Company and the
Representatives may participate in discussions or negotiations with, or
furnish or disclose nonpublic information to, any Person in response to an
unsolicited, _bona fide_  written Acquisition Proposal that is submitted to
the Company by such Person after the date of this Agreement and prior to the
Acceptance Time if (i) the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with a nationally recognized financial advisor and the Companys
outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is
reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal that was not solicited by the
Company and did not otherwise result from a breach of this _Section 7.3_,
(ii) prior to participating in discussions or negotiations with, or furnishing
or disclosing any nonpublic information to, such Person, the Company (A)
receives from such Person an executed confidentiality agreement containing
confidentially terms not materially less restrictive upon such Person than the
terms applicable to Parent under the Confidentiality Agreement and (B)
promptly gives Parent written notice of the identity of such Person and
a copy of such Acquisition Proposal (or, where no such copy is available, a
reasonably detailed description of such Acquisition Proposal), and (iii)
promptly after furnishing or disclosing any nonpublic information to such
Person, the Company furnishes or discloses such information to Parent (to the
extent such information has not been previously delivered or made available by
the Company to Parent). The Company shall promptly (and, in any event, within
24 hours after any amendment or modification of, or material development with
respect to, any such Acquisition Proposal, or at the reasonable request of
Parent) notify Parent orally and in writing of the status of any such
Acquisition Proposal, including any material developments, notifications,
amendments or modifications thereto.

 



30 (c) Except as permitted by this _Section 7.3_, neither the Company Board nor
any committee thereof shall (i) withhold, withdraw, modify or qualify, or
propose publicly to withhold, withdraw, modify or qualify, the Recommendation
in any manner adverse to Parent, (ii) fail to include the Recommendation in
the Schedule 14d-9, (iii) if a tender or exchange offer for shares of capital
stock of the Company that constitutes an Acquisition Proposal is commenced,
fail to recommend against acceptance of such tender or exchange offer by the
stockholders of the Company (including by taking no position with respect to
the acceptance of such tender or exchange offer by the stockholders of the
Company) within 10 Business Days after commencement thereof pursuant to Rule
14d-2 under the Exchange Act or (iv) approve, authorize or recommend or
otherwise declare advisable, or propose publicly to approve, authorize or
recommend or otherwise declare advisable, any Acquisition Proposal or Company
Acquisition Agreement (each, a " _Change in Recommendation_ ").
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 7.3_, at any time
prior to, but not after, the Acceptance Time, the Company Board may (A)
subject to _Section 7.3(d)_, make a Change in Recommendation with respect to
an Intervening Event if (I) the Company provides Parent with written notice
indicating that the Company, acting in good faith, believes that an
Intervening Event has occurred and is reasonably likely to lead the Company
Board to make the determination set forth in _clause (II)_ of this _Section
7.3(c)(A)_ and, therefore, plans to conduct a meeting of the Company Board for
the purpose of considering whether to make such determination, which notice
shall be delivered to Parent at least three Business Days prior to the date of
such meeting of the Company Board and shall also include a description of the
Intervening Event, and (II) the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that failing to make a Change in
Recommendation in response to the Intervening Event (after taking into account
any amendments to this Agreement proposed by Parent pursuant to  _Section
7.3(d)_) would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Companys
stockholders under applicable Laws or (B) subject to _Section 7.3(d)_, make a
Change in Recommendation with respect to an Acquisition Proposal if (I) the
Company provides Parent with written notice indicating that the Company,
acting in good faith, believes that the applicable Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal and, therefore, plans to conduct a meeting
of the Company Board for the purpose of considering whether the Acquisition
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, which notice shall be delivered to
Parent at least three Business Days prior to the date of such meeting of the
Company Board and shall also include a copy of such Acquisition Proposal (or,
where no such copy is available, a reasonably detailed description of such
Acquisition Proposal) and the identity of the Person making such Acquisition
Proposal, (II) the Company Board makes the determination that the Acquisition
Proposal (after taking into account any amendments to this Agreement proposed
by Parent pursuant to _Section 7.3(d)_) constitutes a Superior Proposal, and
(III) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel, that failing to approve or recommend a definitive
Company Acquisition Agreement with respect to the Acquisition Proposal would
be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders under
applicable Laws.

(d) During any three Business Day period specified in _clause (A)(I)_ or 
_clause (B)(I)_ of _Section 7.3(c)_, Parent shall be entitled to deliver to
the Company one or more written proposals for amendments to this Agreement
and, if requested by Parent, the Company shall negotiate with Parent in
good faith with respect thereto until the expiration of such three Business
Day period. The Company Board shall not effect a Change in Recommendation
pursuant to _clause (A)_ or _clause (B)_ of _Section 7.3(c)_ unless
the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel, taking into account all amendments to this Agreement
proposed by Parent pursuant to this _Section 7.3(d)_, that the failure of the
Company Board to effect a Change in Recommendation would still be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders under
applicable Laws. Any material change to the facts and circumstances relating
to 

 



31  an Intervening Event, or any material amendment of an Acquisition Proposal,
including any revision to price, shall require the Company to deliver to
Parent a new written notice and again comply with the provisions of _clause
(A)_ or _clause (B)_ , as applicable, of _Section 7.3(c)_ and this _Section
7.3(d)_.

 

(e) Nothing contained in this _Section 7.3_ shall prohibit the Company Board,
directly or indirectly through the Representatives, from taking and
disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a position contemplated by Rule
14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal or from making any disclosure to the Companys stockholders required
by applicable Laws; _provided_ , that any disclosure permitted under this
_Section 7.3(e)_ (subject to the last sentence hereof) shall be deemed a
Change in Recommendation unless it includes either an express rejection of
the Acquisition Proposal or an express reaffirmation of the Recommendation.
For the avoidance of doubt, a "stop, look and listen" or similar communication
of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act, an express
rejection of any Acquisition Proposal or an express reaffirmation of the
Recommendation shall not be deemed to be a Change in Recommendation for
purposes of this Agreement.

 

(f) For purposes of this Agreement:

 

(i) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " shall mean any proposal or offer by any Person
or "group" (as defined in or under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act), other
than Parent or any of its direct or indirect Subsidiaries, (A) to purchase or
otherwise acquire shares of Company Common Stock (or securities exercisable,
convertible, redeemable or exchangeable for Company Common Stock)
representing more than 15% of the combined voting power of Company Common
Stock outstanding after giving effect to the consummation of such purchase or
other acquisition, including pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer by
any Person or "group" (other than Parent or any of its direct or indirect
Subsidiaries) that, if consummated in accordance with its terms, would result
in such Person or "group" beneficially owning more than 15% of the combined
voting power of Company Common Stock outstanding after giving effect to the
consummation of such tender offer or exchange offer, (B) to purchase or
otherwise acquire more than 15% of the consolidated tangible assets of
the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole (measured by the fair
market value thereof, the related revenues applicable to such assets or the
related net income applicable to such assets, in each case, as of the date of
such sale, transfer, acquisition or disposition), or (C) to effect any
merger, consolidation, business combination or other similar transaction
involving the Company pursuant to which any Person or "group," other than
Parent or any of its direct or indirect Subsidiaries and other than the
holders of Company Common Stock (as a group) immediately prior to the
consummation of such transaction, would hold more than 15% of the combined
voting power of the shares of the outstanding Company Common Stock.

(ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean a _bona fide_ , written Acquisition
Proposal that the Company did not solicit following the date of this
Agreement that the Company Board determines in good faith would be reasonably
likely to be consummated and would, if consummated, result in a transaction
more favorable to the Companys stockholders from a financial point of view
than the transactions contemplated hereby, (A) after consultation with a
nationally recognized financial advisor, (B) after taking into account all of
the terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal and any amendments to
this Agreement proposed by Parent pursuant to _Section 7.3(d)_, and (C) if
(and only if) such Acquisition Proposal relates to a sale of tangible assets
in an amount less than 100% of the 

 



32  consolidated tangible assets of the Company, after considering the value of
the Company (as determined by the Company Board in good faith after
consultation with a nationally recognized financial advisor) after giving
effect to such Acquisition Proposal and, if applicable, any proposed or
contemplated future sale or sales of the remaining consolidated assets of the
Company; _provided_ that for purposes of the definition of "Superior
Proposal," the references to "more than 15%" in the definition of Acquisition
Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "more than 50%."

 

(iii) " _Intervening Event_ " shall mean any material fact, event, change,
development, occurrence or set of circumstances that (A) was not known to the
Company Board as of the date of this Agreement and becomes known to the
Company Board prior to the Acceptance Time and (B) does not result from or
arise out of any Acquisition Proposal.

 

Section 7.4. _Indemnification; Exculpation; Insurance_.

 

(a) The parties hereto shall cooperate and use their reasonable best efforts
to respond to and defend against any threatened or actual claim, action,
suit, arbitration, proceeding, investigation or inquiry, whether civil,
criminal or administrative, in which any Person who is now, or who at any time
prior to the date of this Agreement was, or who prior to the Effective Time
becomes, a director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (including in his or her role as a fiduciary of the employee
benefit plans of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) (collectively, the "
_Indemnified Parties_ ") is, or is threatened to be, made a party or a
witness, in whole or in part, as a result of or relating to (i) the fact that
such Indemnified Party is or was a director, officer or employee of the
Company, any of its current or former Subsidiaries or any of their respective
predecessors or (ii) this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby, whether asserted or arising before or after the Effective Time
(collectively, the " _Indemnified Claims_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
each Indemnified Party shall furnish an undertaking to the Company, Parent or
the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, consistent with the form undertaking
that such Indemnified Party would have been required to provide to the
Company pursuant to the Amended and Restated By-Laws of the Company assuming
such Indemnified Persons expenses were advanced pursuant to such By-Laws, to
repay any expenses incurred in connection with such response or defense if it
is ultimately determined that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to
indemnification with respect thereto pursuant to the express provisions of
this _Section 7.4_.

 

(b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, to an extent at least as
favorable as the indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions
contained in the constituent documents of the Company and its Subsidiaries as
of the date of this Agreement, (i) indemnify and hold harmless each
Indemnified Party from and against all losses, claims, damages and
liabilities, joint or several, to which such Indemnified Party may become
subject under any applicable Laws or otherwise and relating to, arising out of
or in connection with any Indemnified Claim and (ii) reimburse each
Indemnified Party for all expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses of
legal counsel) as they are incurred in connection with any Indemnified Claim.
If indemnification or reimbursement is sought under this _Section 7.4_ by an
Indemnified Party, then such Indemnified Party shall notify Parent of the
Indemnified Claim; _provided, however_ , that the failure to notify Parent
shall not relieve Parent from any liability or obligation that it may have
under this _Section 7.4_ or otherwise to such Indemnified Party except to
the extent such failure materially prejudices Parent. Following such
notification, Parent may elect in writing to assume the defense of such
Indemnified Claim (and the costs related thereto), and upon such
election, Parent shall not be liable for any legal costs subsequently
incurred by such Indemnified Party (other than costs of

 



33  investigation or the production of documents or witnesses) unless (A) Parent
has failed to provide legal counsel reasonably satisfactory to such
Indemnified Party in a timely manner or (B) such Indemnified Party shall have
reasonably concluded that (1) the representation of such Indemnified Party by
legal counsel selected by Parent would be inappropriate due to actual or
potential conflicts of interest or (2) there may be legal defenses reasonably
available to such Indemnified Party that are different from or additional to
those available to Parent or any other Indemnified Party represented by such
legal counsel, in which case such Indemnified Party may employ separate legal
counsel to represent or defend him or her in such proceeding. Nothing set
forth in this _Section 7.4(b)_ shall preclude any Indemnified Party from
retaining its own counsel at its own expense. Parent shall not, without
the prior written consent of the applicable Indemnified Party, settle,
compromise or consent to the entry of judgment in any matter in respect of
which indemnification or advancement of expenses could be sought under this
_Section 7.4(b)_ (whether or not any Indemnified Party is an actual or
potential party to such matter), unless such settlement, compromise or
judgment includes a provision unconditionally releasing such Indemnified Party
and all other Indemnified Parties from and holding them harmless against all
liability in respect of claims by any releasing party related to or arising
out of such matters or any transaction or conduct in connection therewith.
Parents obligations under this _Section 7.4(b)_ shall continue in full
force and effect for a period of six years following the Effective Time;
_provided, however_ , that all rights in respect of an Indemnified Claim
asserted or made within such period shall continue until the
final disposition of such Indemnified Claim.

(c) Without limiting the foregoing: (i) during the period commencing at the
Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause the certificate or articles of incorporation and by-laws
(and other similar organizational documents) of the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect to indemnification,
exculpation and the advancement of expenses that are at least as favorable as
the indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses provisions
contained in the certificate or articles of incorporation and by-laws (or
other similar organizational documents) of the Company and its Subsidiaries as
of the date of this Agreement, and during such six-year period, such
provisions shall not be repealed, amended or otherwise modified in
any manner, except as required by applicable Laws; and (ii) all rights to
indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor of the
Indemnified Parties as provided in any indemnification agreements shall be
assumed by the Surviving Corporation in the Merger, without further action, as
of the Effective Time and shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full
force and effect in accordance with their respective terms.

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall, or if the Company is
unable, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time
to, obtain and fully pay the premium for a non-cancellable extension of the
Companys existing directors and officers liability insurance policy for a
claims reporting or discovery period of at least six years after the
Effective Time in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the
Effective Time, including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
covering each person currently covered by the Companys directors and
officers liability insurance policy, and each person who becomes covered by
the Companys directors and officers liability insurance policy prior to the
Effective Time, on the same terms as the Companys existing policy,
_provided_ that the premium for such "tail" policy shall not exceed 300% of
the aggregate annual premiums that the Company is paying with respect to the
Companys directors and officers insurance policy for the current policy
period that includes the date of this Agreement. If the Company and the
Surviving Corporation for any reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance
policy as of the Effective Time, then for six years after the Effective Time,

 



34  Parent shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide,
directors and officers liability insurance coverage in respect of acts or
omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time, including the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, covering each person currently covered by the
Companys directors and officers liability insurance policy, and each person
who becomes covered by the Companys directors and officers liability
insurance policy prior to the Effective Time, on the same terms as the
Companys existing policy or, if such insurance coverage is unavailable,
coverage that is on terms no less favorable to such persons than those of the
Companys existing policy; _provided, however_ , that in satisfying its
obligation under this _Section 7.4(d)_, neither Parent nor the Surviving
Corporation shall be obligated to pay annual premiums in excess of 300% of
the aggregate annual premiums that the Company is paying with respect to the
Companys directors and officers insurance policy for the current policy
period that includes the date of this Agreement, but in such case Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, purchase as much coverage
as possible for such amount.

 

(e) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, Parent shall cause
proper provisions to be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or
the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, expressly assume the
obligations set forth in this _Section 7.4_.

 

(f) The provisions of this _Section 7.4_ are (i) intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or
her heirs and representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution
of, any other rights, including rights to indemnification and advancement of
expenses, that any Indemnified Party may be entitled to or hereafter acquire
under any Law, Contract, provision of the Companys or the Surviving
Corporations certificate of incorporation or by-laws or otherwise.

 

Section 7.5. _Employee Benefits_. For a period of not less than 12 months
following the Acceptance Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to pay each employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries who is in
employment of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the
Acceptance Time an amount at least equal to the annual base salary or
hourly wage rate, as applicable, that was being paid to such individual as of
the day immediately prior to the Acceptance Time. For a period of not less
than 12 months following the Effective Time, Parent shall or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to (a) maintain in effect on behalf of employees of the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries all employment, severance,
termination, consulting, retirement, bonus and other compensation and benefit
plans, programs, arrangements, agreements and policies (other than any
equity-based plans) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as in effect as
of the Acceptance Time (the " _Existing Plans_ ") and (b) provide the
employees of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries the same
opportunity to participate in Parents equity-based plans as are provided to
similarly situated employees of Parent. Parent shall take all actions required
so that employees of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall
receive service credit for their employment with the Company and its
Subsidiaries for all purposes, other than benefit accruals under a defined
benefit pension plan, under any employee benefit plans and arrangements
sponsored by Parent. To the extent that Parent either provides coverage to
the employees of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries other
than under the Existing Plans or modifies any of the Existing Plans, Parent
shall ensure that such plans waive any applicable waiting periods, pre-
existing conditions or actively-at-work requirements and shall give such
employees credit under the new coverages or benefit plans for deductibles, co-
insurance and out-of-pocket payments that have been 

 



35  paid during the year in which such coverage or plan modification occurs.
Nothing in this _Section 7.5_ shall create any third-party beneficiary right
in any Person other than the parties to this Agreement, or create any right
to continued employment.

Section 7.6. _Company Indebtedness_. As of the Acceptance Time, the Company
shall, with Parents cooperation, use reasonable best efforts (which shall not
include the incurrence by the Company of costs) to take all such actions as
are necessary and appropriate to obtain at the Acceptance Time pay-off
letters in a form reasonably satisfactory to Parent evidencing the amount (the
" _Pay-off Amount_ ") necessary to pay-off, at the Acceptance Time, all
existing indebtedness and other obligations (including outstanding letters of
credit) under the Revolving Credit Agreement, dated as of November 6, 2007, by
and between the Company and Associated Bank, N.A., as amended (the "
_Revolving Credit Agreement_ "). At or prior to the Acceptance Time, Parent
shall, or shall cause one of its Subsidiaries to, pay, on behalf of the
Company, the Pay-off Amount to an account or accounts designated by the
administrative agent under the Revolving Credit Agreement.

 

Section 7.7. _Public Announcements_. The initial press release relating to
this Agreement shall be a joint press release issued by the Company and
Parent, and thereafter Parent and the Company shall consult with each other
before issuing, and provide each other the opportunity to review, comment upon
and concur with, any press release or other public statement with respect
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Offer and
the Merger, and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public
statement prior to such consultation, except as either party may determine
(based on the advice of outside legal counsel) is required by applicable
Laws; _provided, however_ , that the restrictions set forth in this _Section
7.7_ shall not apply to any release or announcement made or proposed to be
made (a) following a determination by the Company Board that an Acquisition
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, (b) following a Change in
Recommendation or (c) pursuant to _Section 7.3(d)_.

 

Section 7.8. _Stockholder Litigation_. Subject to any fiduciary duties of the
board of directors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the Company
shall consult with Parent in the Companys defense or settlement of any
stockholder litigation (other than any litigation or settlement where the
interests of the Company or any of its Affiliates are adverse to those of
Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates) against the Company
and/or any of its directors or executive officers relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, _provided_ that the Company shall not
settle, compromise or enter into an agreement regarding any settlement or
compromise of any stockholder litigation relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (other than any settlement solely for monetary
damages paid entirely from proceeds of insurance, except for any applicable
deductible) requiring the payment of any amount, acceptance of any liability,
or admission of any violations of Law by the Company or its Subsidiaries
without the prior written consent of Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

Section 7.9. _Anti-Takeover Laws_. In the event that any state anti-takeover
or other similar Law is or becomes applicable to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company, Parent and Merger
Sub shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to ensure that the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such Law on this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



36 Section 7.10. _Stock Exchange Delisting_. Promptly following the Effective
Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to cause the Company
Common Stock to be delisted from Nasdaq and deregistered under the Exchange
Act.

 

Section 7.11. _Rule 14d-10 Matters_. Prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company
(acting through the Compensation Committee of the Company Board) shall take
all such actions as may be required to cause any agreements, arrangements or
understandings that have been or will be entered into by Parent, the Company
or any of their respective Affiliates with current or future directors,
officers or employees of the Company and its Affiliates pursuant to which
payments are made or to be made or benefits are granted or to be granted
according to such arrangements (including any amendment or modification
thereof) to be approved as an "employment compensation, severance or other
employee benefit arrangement" within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(1) under
the Exchange Act and to satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive safe
harbor set forth in Rule 14d-10(d) under the Exchange Act.

Section 7.12. _Section 16(b) Exemption_. The Company shall take all actions
to cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and any other
dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including derivative
securities) in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
by each individual who is a director or executive officer of the Company to
be exempt under Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act.

Section 7.13. _Merger Sub and Surviving Corporation Compliance_. Parent shall
cause each of Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, to
comply with all of its obligations under this Agreement, and Merger Sub shall
not engage in any activities of any nature except as provided in or
contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 7.14. _Merger Without Meeting of Stockholders_. The parties
shall take all necessary and appropriate action to cause the Merger to be
effected without a meeting of stockholders of the Company in accordance with
Section 251(h) of the DGCL as soon as practicable following the Acceptance
Time. Prior to the initial expiration date for the Offer, Parent shall
transfer or cause to be transferred to Merger Sub all shares of Company Common
Stock owned of record or beneficially by Parent or any of its other
Subsidiaries, and the parties agree to take all action required to cause such
shares to be held of record by Merger Sub prior to the Acceptance Time.

Section 7.15. _Financing Cooperation_.

(a) The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to actively
assist (and to cause the Subsidiaries of the Company to actively assist)
Parent, Merger Sub and the Lenders in completing a syndication with respect to
the Debt Financing, as such assistance may be reasonably requested by Parent
from time to time, including: (i) using commercially reasonable efforts to
ensure that the syndication efforts benefit from the Companys and its
Subsidiaries existing banking relationships; (ii) facilitating direct
contact, following reasonable advance notice and during normal business
hours, between senior management of the Company and the proposed Lenders;
(iii) using commercially reasonable efforts to prepare and provide to the
Lenders all reasonable information with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries, including all financial information, projections and other
forward-looking information (such projections and other forward-looking
information, the " _Projections_ "), as the Commitment Parties may reasonably
request in connection with the Debt Financing and arrangement and syndication
thereof; (iv) assisting, as such assistance may be reasonably requested by
Parent from time to time, with the preparation of one or more confidential 

 



37  information memoranda and other marketing materials to be used in connection
with the syndication associated with the Debt Financing; (v) facilitating the
participation, following reasonable advance notice and during normal business
hours, by the Companys officers in meetings with prospective Lenders; (vi)
furnishing, upon reasonable request and for no fee (other than the
reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses), to the Commitment Parties
electronic versions of the trademarks, service marks and corporate logos of
the Company and its Subsidiaries solely for the purpose of facilitating the
syndication of the Debt Financing (with no right of assignment or
transfer); (vii) delivering to the administrative agent under the Debt
Financing a secretarys certificate of the Company and each Subsidiary of the
Company that becomes a guarantor under the Debt Financing attaching the
organizational documents, resolutions or other action approving the Debt
Financing, and good standing and incumbency certificates with respect to the
Company; and (viii) using commercially reasonable efforts to provide all
documentation and other information with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries that shall have been reasonably requested by such administrative
agent at least seven days prior to the Closing Date that such administrative
agent reasonably determines, based on the advice of legal counsel, is
required by regulatory authorities under applicable "know your customer" and
anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including the requirements of the
USA PATRIOT Act, Title III of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law on October 26,
2001). No breach by the Company of this covenant shall be deemed material for
purposes of this Agreement, nor shall any such breach give rise to any
liability or obligation on the part of the Company or any rights on the part
of Parent or Merger Sub, in each case, unless such breach is a material
breach and is the primary cause of the Debt Financing not being funded under
the Debt Commitment Letter. Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the
Company, its Subsidiaries and the Representatives for any liability, cost or
expense (including all travel and administrative expenses and all reasonable
fees of counsel, accountants and other financial advisors to the Company)
arising out of their compliance with the foregoing covenants. All Lenders and
Commitment Parties shall be deemed to be "Representatives" (as defined in the
Confidentiality Agreement) of Parent, and all information obtained by Parent,
any of its representatives, any Lender or any Commitment Party shall be
subject to the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement. Any failure by any
Lender or Commitment Party to comply with the Confidentiality Agreement, or
any act or omission by any Lender or Commitment Party that, if committed
by Parent, would constitute a breach of the Confidentiality Agreement, shall
be deemed to be a breach of the Confidentiality Agreement by Parent for which
Parent shall be responsible.

 

(b) For purposes of this Agreement:

 

(i) " _Debt Commitment Letter_ " means that certain executed commitment letter
from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC (the "
_Commitment Parties_ ").

(ii) " _Debt Financing_ " means the financing contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter, pursuant to which, and in accordance with the terms and
subject to the conditions thereof, the Lenders have committed to lend the
amounts set forth therein to Parent for the purpose of funding the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(iii) " _Lenders_ " means the Commitment Parties, the group of proposed
lenders to be identified in writing to the Company by the Commitment Parties,
and any lender from time to time party to the credit agreement described in

40 (iii) the Company Board has determined to enter into a definitive
Company Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal, but only
if the Company shall have complied in all material respects with its
obligations under _Section 7.3_ with respect to such Superior Proposal (and

Proposal and make the payment required by _Section 9.3(a)_; or

become null, void and have no further force or effect without liability of any
party or parties hereto, as applicable (or any partner, member, stockholder,
director, officer, employee, affiliate, agent or other representative of such
party or parties), to the other party or parties hereto, as applicable, except
(a) for the terms of the last sentence of _Section 1.2(b)_ and  _Section
7.1_, this _Section 9.2_, _Section 9.3_ and _Article 10_, each of which
shall survive the termination of this Agreement, and (b) subject to _Section

Section 9.3. _Termination Fees_.

 

(a) If:

(i) (A) this Agreement is validly terminated (x) by Parent pursuant to
_Section 9.1(b)(ii)_ or (y) by the Company pursuant to _Section 9.1(b)(ii)_
in a circumstance in

 



41  which Parent would have been permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to _Section 9.1(b)(ii)_, (B) at or prior to the termination of this
Agreement, a third Person shall have delivered to the Company Board a _bona
fide_ Acquisition Proposal (and such Acquisition Proposal shall not have been
withdrawn prior to the termination of this Agreement) (such Acquisition
Proposal, the " _Outstanding Proposal_ "), and (C) within twelve months after
the termination of this Agreement (the " _Tail Period_ "), the Company enters
into a definitive agreement with respect to the Outstanding Proposal and the
Outstanding Proposal is consummated (whether or not such consummation occurs
within the Tail Period) (for the purposes of the definition of "Outstanding
Proposal" only, references in the definition of "Acquisition Proposal" to
"15%" shall be replaced with references to "50%");

(ii) the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section
9.1(c)(iii)_; 

(iii) Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(d)(ii)(A)_
or,

 

(iv) (A) Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(d)(ii)(B)_
and (B) within twelve months after the termination of this Agreement by
Parent pursuant to such _Section 9.1(d)(ii)(B)_, the Company enters into a
definitive Company Acquisition Agreement with the Person in respect of which
the Company committed such willful and material breach of _Section 7.3_ and
the Acquisition Proposal that is the subject of such definitive Company
Acquisition Agreement is consummated,

 

then the Company shall pay to Parent a termination fee equal to 3.5% of the
aggregate Merger Consideration payable to all holders of Company Common
Stock, Company Restricted Shares and Company Stock Options pursuant to
_Section 2.8(a)_ and _Section 2.9_ (the " _Company Termination Fee_ "), by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to one or more accounts
designated in writing by Parent, (I) in the case of _clause (i)_ above, on
the date on which the Company consummates the Outstanding Proposal, (II) in
the case of _clause (ii)_ above, concurrently with such termination, (III)
in the case of termination pursuant to _clause (iii)_ above, within two
Business Days following the date of such termination, and (IV) in the case of
_clause (iv)_ above, on the date on which the Company consummates the
Acquisition Proposal.

(b) In no event shall the Company be required to pay the Company Termination
Fee on more than one occasion whether or not the Company Termination Fee may
be payable at the same time or at different times and/or based upon the
occurrence of different events.

 

(c) In the circumstances in which the Company Termination Fee is paid in
accordance with _Section 9.3(a)_, Parents receipt of the Company
Termination Fee from the Company pursuant to _Section 9.3(a)_ shall (i)
subject to _Section 9.3(d)_, be deemed to be liquidated damages for any and
all losses or damages suffered or incurred by Parent, Merger Sub, any of
their respective Affiliates or any other Person in connection with this
Agreement (and the termination hereof), the transactions contemplated hereby
(and the abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the basis for the
termination giving rise to payment of such Company Termination Fee and (ii)
subject to _Section 9.3(d)_ and _Section 10.11_, be the sole and exclusive
remedy of Parent and Merger Sub against the Company, its Subsidiaries and each
of their respective former, current and future directors, officers,
employees, agents, general and limited partners, managers, members,
stockholders, Affiliates and assignees and each former, current or future
director, officer, employee, agent, 

 



42  stockholder, general or limited partner, manager, member, stockholder,
Affiliate or assignee of any of the foregoing (each, a " _Company Party_ ")
for any loss or damage suffered as a result of the failure of the Merger to
be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder, and no Company
Party shall have any other liability or obligation relating to or arising out
of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided,
however_ , that in no event shall the Companys liability for the Companys
fraud or willful and material breach of this Agreement be so limited.

 

(d) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this _Section
9.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and that, without these agreements, the parties would not enter into this
Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay the amount due
pursuant to _Section 9.3(a)_ and, to obtain such payment, Parent or Merger
Sub commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company for the
amount set forth in _Section 9.3(a)_, then the Company shall pay to Parent
or Merger Sub, as the case may be, (A) Parents or Merger Subs reasonable
costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) in connection with
such suit and (B) interest on the amount payable pursuant to such judgment at
the interest rate per annum described as the prime lending rate in _The Wall
Street Journal_ on the date of payment and compounded quarterly, with such
interest being payable in respect of the period from the date that payment
was originally required to be made pursuant to _Section 9.3(a)_ through
the date of payment.

Section 10.1. _No Other Representations and Warranties_. Parent and Merger Sub
acknowledge that the detailed representations and warranties set forth in
this Agreement have been negotiated at arms length among sophisticated
business entities. Except for the representations and warranties expressly set
forth in _Article 4_, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that none of the
Company, any Subsidiary of the Company or any of their respective Affiliates
or any Person acting on behalf of any of the foregoing makes or has made any
other express or any implied representation or warranty to Parent or
Merger Sub as to the accuracy or completeness of any information regarding
the Company, its Subsidiaries or any other matter. Except for the
representations and warranties expressly set forth in _Article 4_, Parent and
Merger Sub further agree that none of the Company, any Subsidiary of the
Company or any other Person shall have or be subject to any liability to
Parent, Merger Sub or any other Person resulting from the distribution to
Parent and/or Merger Sub, or Parents and/or Merger Subs use, of any such
information, including any information, document or material made available or
provided to Parent or Merger Sub in certain "data rooms," management
presentations or offering or information memoranda, or in any other form, in
expectation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Parent and
Merger Sub acknowledge that the burden to conduct an investigation of the
Company and its Subsidiaries lies solely with Parent and Merger Sub and
that Parent and Merger Sub bear the risk that any information, document or
material made available or provided to them in the course of its investigation
is inaccurate or incomplete, except to the extent otherwise expressly set
forth in  _Article 4_. Without limitation, in connection with Parents
investigation of the Company and its Subsidiaries, Parent has received from or
on behalf of the Company or its Affiliates certain estimates, projections and
other forecasts and plans. Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that there are
uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such estimates, projections and
other forecasts and plans, that Parent and Merger Sub are familiar with such
uncertainties and that Parent and Merger Sub are taking full responsibility
for making their own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates,
projections and other forecasts and plans so furnished to it (including the
reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates,

 



43  projections and forecasts). Unless otherwise expressly set forth in _Article
4_, none of the Company, its Subsidiaries, any Affiliate of the Company or its
Subsidiaries or any Person acting on behalf of the Company, its Subsidiaries
and their respective Affiliates makes any representation or warranty with
respect to such estimates, projections and other forecasts and plans
(including the reasonableness of the assumptions or the accuracy of the
information underlying such estimates, projections and forecasts).

Section 10.2. _Non-Survival of Representations, Warranties and Agreements_.
None of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in
this Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant hereto shall survive the
Effective Time, except that any agreements or covenants that contemplate
performance after the Effective Time shall survive the Effective Time in
accordance with their respective terms.

 

Section 10.3. _Expenses_. Whether or not the Offer is consummated and except
to the extent otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement (including
_Section 7.2_ and _Section 9.3_), each party shall bear its own expenses and
the expenses of its counsel and other agents and representatives in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including in connection
with claims by any Person that it is entitled to brokerage commissions or
finders fees as a result of the action of such Person or any Affiliate of
such Person; _provided_ that Parent shall bear all expenses incurred in

on the part of Parent or the Company to any such extension or waiver shall be
valid only as against such party (and, in the case of an extension or waiver
by Parent, against Merger Sub) and only if set forth in a written instrument
signed on behalf of such party.

 



45 Section 10.7. _Entire Agreement; Parties in Interest_.

 

(a) This Agreement (including the Schedules, Exhibits and Annex attached
hereto) and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute (together with the other
documents and instruments to be executed and delivered pursuant hereto) the
entire agreement, and supersede all prior understandings, agreements or
representations, by or among the parties hereto with respect to the subject
matter hereof. 

(b) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of
each party hereto, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is
intended to or shall confer upon any other person any right, benefit or remedy
of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement, other than (i)

Stock, Company Restricted Shares and Company Stock Options, to pursue
specific performance as set forth in _Section 10.11_ or, if specific
performance is not sought or not granted as a remedy, damages (which damages
may be based on the consideration that would have otherwise been payable to
such holders, lost premium and any decrease in the value of the Company Common
Stock, Company Restricted Shares and Company Stock Options, as applicable).

 

Section 10.8. _Assignment; Binding Effect_. No party hereto may assign,
transfer or encumber this Agreement or any of its rights, interests or
obligations hereunder (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the
prior written approval of the other parties hereto, and any attempted

effect. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
permitted successors and permitted assigns.

 

Section 10.9. _Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
Laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to any choice or conflict
of law provision or rule. Each party hereto stipulates that any dispute or
disagreement between or among any of the parties hereto as to the
interpretation of any provision of, or the exercise of any rights or the
performance of obligations under, this Agreement shall be commenced and
prosecuted in its entirety in, and consents to the exclusive jurisdiction and
proper venue of, the Delaware Chancery Court or, if such court does not have
jurisdiction of the dispute, any federal court located in the State of
Delaware, and each party hereto consents to personal and subject matter
jurisdiction and venue in such courts and waives and relinquishes all right to
attack the suitability or convenience of such venue or forum by reason of
their present or future domiciles, or by any other reason. The parties hereto
acknowledge that all directions issued by the forum court, including all
injunctions and other decrees, will be binding and enforceable in all
jurisdictions and countries. Each party hereby waives its right to a trial by
jury of any claim or cause of action arising out of or relating to Parents
investigation of the Company, this Agreement, the negotiation and execution of
this Agreement or any Contract entered into pursuant hereto (except to the
extent otherwise expressly set forth therein) and the performance by the
parties of its or their terms in any action, proceeding or other litigation of
any type brought by one party against another, regardless of the basis of the
claim or cause of action.

 



46 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, each
of the parties hereto: (i) agrees that it will not bring or support any
Person in any action, suit, proceeding, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or
third-party claim of any kind or description, whether at law or in equity,
whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any of the Lenders in
any way relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including, but not limited to, any dispute arising out of or
relating in any way to the Debt Commitment Letter or the performance thereof
or the financings contemplated thereby, in any forum other than the federal
and New York state courts located in the Borough of Manhattan within the City
of New York; (ii) agrees that, except as specifically set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letter, all claims or causes of action (whether at law, in equity,
in contract, in tort or otherwise) against any of the Lenders in any way
relating to the Debt Commitment Letters or the performance thereof or the
financings contemplated thereby, shall be exclusively governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the internal laws of the State of New York,
without giving effect to principles or rules or conflict of laws to the extent
such principles or rules would require or permit the application of laws of
another jurisdiction; and (iii) hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives
any right such party may have to a trial by jury in respect of any litigation
(whether at law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise)
directly or indirectly arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt
Commitment Letter or the performance thereof or the financings contemplated
thereby. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, except for claims by Parent or the Merger Sub against the Lenders
pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letter and any definitive documents related
thereto, (A) none of the parties hereto nor any of their respective
subsidiaries, Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, partners,
managers, members or stockholders shall have any rights or claims against any
Lender, in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, or in respect of any, or in respect of any
oral representations made or alleged to have been made in connection herewith
or therewith, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to
the Debt Commitment Letter or the performance thereof or the financings
contemplated thereby, whether at law or in equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise and (B) no Lender shall have any liability (whether in contract, in
tort or otherwise) to any party hereto or any of their
respective subsidiaries, Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents,
partners, managers, members or stockholders for any obligations or liabilities
of any party hereto under this Agreement or for any claim based on, in respect
of, or by reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby or in
respect of any oral representations made or alleged to have been made in
connection herewith or therewith, including any dispute arising out of or
relating in any way to the Debt Commitment Letter or the performance thereof
or the financings contemplated thereby, whether at law or in equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise. None of the limitations in this _Section
10.9(b)_ shall be deemed to affect any partys right to seek specific
performance pursuant to and in accordance with _Section 10.11_. The Lenders
are intended third party beneficiaries of this _Section 10.9(b)_.

 

Section 10.10. _Severability_. If any term or provision of this Agreement is
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced by any Law or public policy, then all other terms
and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and
effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the
transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party hereto. Upon such determination that any term or
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties
hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable
manner so that the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated as
originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

 



47 Section 10.11. _Enforcement of Agreement_. The parties hereto agree that money
damages or any other remedy at law would not be a sufficient or adequate
remedy for any actual or threatened breach or violation of, or default under,
this Agreement by any of them and that, notwithstanding any other provision in
this Agreement to the contrary, each aggrieved party shall be entitled, to
the fullest extent permitted by Law, to an injunction restraining such actual
or threatened breach, violation or default and to any other equitable relief,
including specific performance, without bond or other security being
required.

Section 10.12. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed by signatures
exchanged via facsimile or other electronic means and in one or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which
together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

 

Section 10.13. _Headings_. The Article and Section headings contained in this
Agreement are inserted for convenience only and shall not affect in any way
the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

Section 10.14. _Interpretation_. Any reference to any supranational,
national, state, provincial, municipal, local or foreign Law shall be deemed
also to refer to all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the
context otherwise requires. When a reference is made in this Agreement
to Sections, Schedules, Exhibits or Annex, such reference shall be to a
