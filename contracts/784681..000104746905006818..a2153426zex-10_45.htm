knowledge of Rainbow DBS, threatened claim or notice of violation of, any
such statutes, laws rules, regulations, judgments, orders, writs, injunctions
and decrees with respect to the conduct of its business related to, or the
ownership and operation of, the Acquired Assets, except for such instances of
non-compliance or violation, if any, which could not reasonably be expected
to have a material adverse effect on the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Rainbow DBS and its Affiliates have complied with, and Rainbow-1
has been designed and constructed in compliance with, all material Regulatory
Provisions applicable to the Acquired Assets.

  



  

4.1.8 _Agreements, Contracts and Commitments_.  Rainbow DBS has supplied to

party thereto.  Neither Rainbow DBS nor Rainbow DBS Affiliates has received
notice of the pending or threatened cancellation, modification, revocation or
termination of any such agreement, nor does Rainbow DBS have knowledge of any

performed all of its required obligations under the Lockheed Contract and,
between the Execution Date and the Closing, will not (i) terminate the
Lockheed Contract or (ii) amend or modify the Lockheed Contract in a manner
that would have a material adverse effect on the Contract Rights. Rainbow DBS

of Rainbow-1 in accordance with the test plan attached hereto as Appendix C
to ascertain (i) the then-current performance of Rainbow-1 vis-a-vis the
Spacecraft Performance Specifications, and (ii) the Actual CONUS Beam
Operational Capability and the Actual Spot Beam Operational Capability based
on such performance, including without limitation the performance of the
solar arrays, batteries, propulsion system and communications payload of

Lockheed Martin Corporation, shall deliver a report on the test results to
Buyer which report shall state the Actual CONUS Beam Operational Capability
and the Actual Spot Beam Operational Capability based on the results of the
in-orbit tests.

  



  

4.3.10 _Special Provision Relating to Total Loss_.  In the event that a
Total Loss of Rainbow-1 occurs at or before the Closing, Buyer shall have the

If, at Closing, the Parties are not in agreement as to the Actual CONUS Beam
Operational Capability and/or the Actual Spot Beam Operational Capability of
Rainbow-1 and the amount of any reduction in the Consideration pursuant to
this Section 4.3.11, the Parties will proceed to Closing, the undisputed
amount of the Consideration shall be paid to Rainbow DBS, and the dispute
shall be submitted to binding arbitration as described below. Within ten (10)
days after Closing, each Party will select one (1) arbitrator who is
independent ( _i.e._ , does not have an affiliation to either Party) and
experienced in communications satellite manufacturing and operations and the
two (2) arbitrators will be instructed to select a third independent
arbitrator with similar qualifications within ten (10) additional days. The
arbitration will be governed by the rules of the American Arbitration
Association, will be conducted in Chicago, Illinois, and the decision of the
arbitrators as to the Actual CONUS Beam Operational Capability and the Actual
Spot Beam Operational Capability will be final and binding on the Parties.
 The Parties will cooperate with each other in order to commence
the arbitration hearing no later than thirty (30) days after selection of the
three (3) arbitrators. No discovery shall be permitted and the Parties will
instruct the arbitrators to complete the arbitration process and render a
decision within sixty (60) days after commencement of the arbitration.
The arbitrators decision shall be final and shall be binding and enforceable
in a court of competent jurisdiction. In the event that the Arbitrators
decision finds that all or a portion of the disputed amount is owing to
Rainbow DBS from Buyer, then within five (5) days after the release of any
arbitrators decision hereunder, Buyer will pay to Rainbow DBS the amount of
the disputed Consideration, if any, determined in accordance with the
arbitrators decision to be owed to Rainbow DBS.

  



  

4.3.12 _No Solicitation_. Except for the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, from and after the date of the Execution Date, until the date of
receipt of the Regulatory Approvals, Rainbow DBS shall not, nor shall
it authorize any officer, director or employee of, or any investment
banker, attorney, accountant, or other representative retained by, any one of
them to, directly or indirectly, solicit, initiate, participate in, encourage
or entertain (including by way of furnishing information) discussions, offers
or proposals for the

  



  

18   

     
   

  



  

purpose or with the intention of leading to any proposal or offer from any
Person to acquire any portion of the Acquired Assets.

  



  

4.3.13 _Special Provision Relating to Insurance._

  



  

(a) At the request of Buyer, Rainbow DBS, using International Space Brokers
(ISB) or such other broker as may be designated by Buyer from time to time as
its broker, shall obtain quotes for in-orbit insurance for Rainbow-1 covering
the period from and after the Execution Date through and including Closing
(or any portion of such period) on such terms and conditions (including
without limitation the sum insured) as Buyer may from time to time request.
In the event that Buyer, in its sole discretion, elects to accept one of
the quotes obtained by Rainbow DBS, then Buyer shall direct Rainbow DBS in
writing to procure such insurance (the "Insurance Policy") at Buyers
expense. Upon Rainbow DBSs receipt of such written request, Rainbow DBS
shall promptly procure the Insurance Policy and Buyer will pay to Rainbow
DBS, or directly to the underwriters and/or insurers, as applicable under the
Insurance Policy all amounts due under such Insurance Policy.

  



  

(b) Buyer shall be the named insured and loss payee under any insurance
policy placed by Rainbow DBS under this Section 4.3.13. In the event
that, notwithstanding the foregoing, any loss is paid to Rainbow DBS under
the Insurance Policy, then Rainbow DBS agrees to hold such amounts in trust
for Buyer and to pay such amounts to Buyer as soon as reasonably practicable
(and in any event within three (3) business days) after Rainbow DBS receives
the corresponding payment from the insurers.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Rainbow DBS shall reasonably cooperate with Buyer in recovering all amounts
due from the insurers under the Insurance Policy, in which case Buyer shall
be entitled to direct and control any litigation and settlement negotiations
arising in connection therewith and Buyer shall (whether incurred by Buyer or
Rainbow DBS) pay all costs of litigation and administrative costs and
expenses, including attorneys fees, incurred in connection with the
prosecution of any such litigation. Buyer shall comply with all material
terms and conditions in the Insurance Policy necessary for the payment of
claims, including any terms and conditions relating to salvage.

  



  

(c) In lieu of requesting that Rainbow DBS procure insurance under Section
4.3.13(a) and (b), above, Buyer, at its option, may procure insurance
directly for Rainbow-1. Regardless of whether Buyer or Rainbow DBS
is attempting to procure insurance regarding risks relating to the in
orbit operation of Rainbow-1, Rainbow DBS shall, at its own cost and expense,
timely provide all reasonable assistance requested by Buyer in connection
with the procurement of insurance for Rainbow-1, provide such information
regarding Rainbow-1 as is reasonably requested by Buyers or Rainbow DBSs
brokers and underwriters, and perform technical presentations to brokers and
underwriters. In addition, Rainbow DBS shall provide such information
regarding Rainbow-1 as is reasonably requested by the insurer(s) and will
cooperate in any insurance reviews.

or action against such Indemnified Party in respect of which indemnity may be
sought hereunder, notify the indemnifying party (the "Indemnitor") in writing
of the claim or action; _provided_  that the failure to notify the Indemnitor
shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to an Indemnified
Party on account of the indemnity agreements contained in Section 6.3 or
Section 6.4 above except to the extent that the Indemnitor was actually
substantially prejudiced by such failure, and in no event shall such failure
relieve the Indemnitor from any other liability that it may have to such
Indemnified Party.

  



  

6.5.2 _Assumption of Defense._ If any such claim or action shall be brought
against an Indemnified Party, and it shall have notified the Indemnitor
thereof, the Indemnitor shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the
extent that it wishes, assume the defense thereof.

  



  

6.5.3 _Cooperation._ If the Indemnitor elects to assume the defense of any
such claim or action, it shall within thirty (30) calendar days (or sooner,
if the nature of the claim or action so requires) notify the Indemnified
Party of its intent to do so, and the Indemnified Party shall, at the
Indemnitors request and expense, give the Indemnitor all
reasonable cooperation and assistance in the defense against, such claim or
action, which cooperation and assistance shall include, among other things,
the retention and (upon the Indemnitors request) the provision to the
Indemnitor of any books, records, documents and other information in its
control as reasonably necessary or appropriate for such defense, and making
employees available on a mutually convenient basis as reasonably necessary or
appropriate for such defense. Except as expressly set forth to the
contrary below, after timely notice from the Indemnitor to the Indemnified
Party of its election to assume the defense of any such claim or action and
the undertaking of such defense with counsel reasonably acceptable to the
Indemnified Party, the Indemnitor shall not be liable to the Indemnified
Party under this Section 6.5 for any legal or other expenses subsequently
incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof.

  



  

6.5.4 _Defense by Indemnified Party._ If the Indemnitor elects not to defend
any such claim or action, fails to timely notify the Indemnified Party of its
election as herein provided or contests its obligation to indemnify under
this Agreement (or if counsel to the Indemnified Party advises such party
that there may be a potential conflict of interest between the Indemnitor and
the Indemnified Party), the Indemnified Party may defend, at the expense of
the Indemnitor, such claim or action as the Indemnified Party considers
appropriate.

  



  

6.5.5 _Admission. _The Indemnified Party shall not make any admission as to
liability or agree to any settlement of, or otherwise compromise, any claim
or action without the prior written consent of the Indemnitor (such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). Any Indemnitor
against whom indemnity may be sought under this Section 6.5

  



  

22   

     
   

  



  

shall not be liable to indemnify an Indemnified Party if such Indemnified
Party makes an admission as to liability, settles or otherwise compromises
such claim or action without the consent of the Indemnitor (such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). The Indemnitor shall
not settle or otherwise compromise any such claim or action over the
objection of the Indemnified Party; _provided,_ _however,_ that consent to
settlement or compromise shall not be unreasonably withheld by the
Indemnified Party.

  



  

6.5.6 _Participation. _With respect to any claim or action as to which the
Indemnitor has timely assumed the defense thereof, the Indemnified Party
shall continue to be entitled to participate in the defense thereof, with
counsel of its own choice, but the Indemnitor shall not be obligated
hereunder to reimburse the Indemnified Party for the costs thereof unless:
(i) the Indemnitor agrees to pay such costs; (ii) the Indemnitor fails to
promptly assume and continue the defense of such claim or action with counsel
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party; (iii) counsel to
such Indemnified Party advises that a potential conflict of interest between
such Indemnified Party and Indemnitor may exist in respect of such claim; or
(iv) the Indemnitor contests its obligation to indemnify under this
Agreement.

  



  

 ** _7._** **_ASSIGNMENT AND SUCCESSORS_**

  



  

7.1 _Assignment_.  Neither Party may assign its rights and interests under
this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other Party;
provided, however, that EchoStar may assign its rights, but not its
obligations, under this Agreement, in its sole discretion for any reason or
no reason, to one of its Affiliates. As used in this Section 7.1, "assign"
shall mean to grant, sell, assign, encumber or otherwise convey directly or
indirectly, in whole or in part.

  



  

7.2 _Successors_.  Subject to the provisions concerning assignments above,
this Agreement shall be binding on and shall inure to the benefit of any
successors and permitted assigns of the Parties. Any purported assignment by
either Party not in compliance with the provisions of this Agreement shall be
null and void and of no force and effect.

  



  

 ** _8._** **_CONFIDENTIALITY_**

  



  

8.1 _Non-Disclosure_.  Buyer and Rainbow DBS will hold in confidence the
material terms and conditions of this Agreement; provided that disclosure, on
a confidential basis, by either Party is permitted: (a) to its principals,
auditors, attorneys, investors, lenders, insurance agents, and proposed and
actual successors in interest and (b) to comply with law and enforce its
rights and perform its obligations under this Agreement.

  



  

8.2 _Proprietary Information_. To the extent that either Party discloses
to the other Party any other information which it considers proprietary,
said Party shall identify such information as proprietary when disclosing it
to the other Party by marking it clearly and conspicuously as
proprietary information. Any proprietary disclosure to either Party, if made
orally, will be identified at the time of disclosure as proprietary
information, if the disclosing

  



  

23   

     
   

  



  

Party wishes to keep such information proprietary under this Agreement. Any
such information disclosed under this Agreement will be used by the
recipient thereof only in its performance under this Agreement. Neither Party
will be liable for the inadvertent or accidental disclosure of such
information marked as proprietary, if such disclosure occurs despite the
exercising of the same degree of care as the receiving Party normally takes
to preserve and safeguard its own proprietary information (but not less than
reasonable care) or if such information (i) is or becomes lawfully available
to the public from a source other than the receiving Party; (ii) is released
in writing by the disclosing Party without restrictions; (iii) is lawfully
obtained by the receiving Party from a third party or parties without
obligation of confidentiality; (iv) is lawfully known by the receiving Party
prior to such disclosure; or (v) is at any time lawfully developed by the
receiving Party completely independently of any such disclosure or
disclosures from the disclosing Party. In addition, neither Party will be
liable for the disclosure of any proprietary information which it receives
under this Agreement pursuant to judicial action or decree, or pursuant to
any requirement of any government or any agency or department thereof, having
jurisdiction over such Party, provided, that in the reasonable opinion of
counsel for such Party such disclosure is required, and provided further that
such Party to the extent reasonably practical shall have given the other
Party notice prior to such disclosure.

  



  

 ** _9._** **_MISCELLANEOUS_**

  



  

9.1 _Applicable Law, Attorney Fees, Entire Agreement and Effectiveness_. This
Agreement shall be interpreted according to the laws of the State of New
York, U.S.A. and, where applicable, subject to compliance with the laws,
rules and regulations of the United States, including, without limitation,
those of the FCC and those governing communications, exports and re-exports,
without regard to any conflict of law provisions. Each Party consents to the
jurisdiction of courts located in New York. In any action or arbitration
brought with respect to this Agreement by one Party hereto against the other
Party hereto, in addition to any other money damages awarded, the prevailing
Party shall be entitled to recover from the other Party its reasonable costs,
including reasonable attorneys fees, in successfully bringing or defending
against such action or arbitration. This Agreement, including the Appendices
and any non-disclosure agreements between the Parties, constitutes the entire
agreement between the Parties and supersedes any and all prior or
contemporaneous statements, understandings, writings, commitments,
or representations concerning its subject matter. This Agreement may not
be amended or modified in any way, and none of its provisions may be
waived, except by a prior writing signed by an authorized officer of each
Party. This Agreement shall not be binding or effective on any Party until
fully executed by both Parties hereto.

  



  

9.2 _U.S. Export Control Laws_. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the
Acquired Assets, technical information, and/or accompanying
technology provided under this Agreement are subject to export controls under
the laws and regulations of the United States. Each Party shall comply with
such laws and regulations and agrees not to export, re-export, or otherwise
transfer such services or items to foreign persons (including foreign
national employees) without first obtaining all required United States
authorizations or licenses.

  



  

24   

     
   

  



  

9.3 _Severability_.  Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed
so as to require the commission of any act contrary to law.  If any
provision of this Agreement shall be held invalid or unenforceable, the
provisions of this Agreement so affected shall be curtailed and limited only
to the extent necessary to permit compliance with the minimum legal
requirements and the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall not in any
way be affected or impaired.

  



  

9.4 _No Third Party Beneficiary_. Except as expressly set forth herein, the
provisions of this Agreement are for the benefit only of Rainbow DBS and
Buyer and no third party may seek to enforce or benefit from these
provisions.

  



  

9.5 _Non-Waiver of Breach_. Either Party may specifically waive any breach
of this Agreement by the other Party; provided, that no such waiver shall be
binding or effective unless in writing and signed by an authorized officer of
the Party to be bound and no such waiver shall constitute a continuing waiver
of similar or other breaches.  A waiving Party may at any time, upon notice
given in writing to the breaching Party, direct future compliance with the
waived term or terms of this Agreement, in which event the breaching Party
shall comply as directed from such time forward.

  



  

9.6 _Notices_.  Except as otherwise expressly set forth to the contrary
herein, any notice or other communications required or permitted to be given
hereunder shall be in English, in writing and shall be delivered personally
or sent by facsimile transmission, or by first class certified mail, postage
prepaid, or by overnight courier service, charges prepaid, to the Party to be
notified, addressed to such Party at the address set forth below, or sent by
facsimile to the fax number set forth below, or such other address or fax
number as such Party may have substituted by written notice to the other
Party. The sending of such notice with confirmation of receipt thereof (in
the case of facsimile transmission) or receipt of such notice (in the case of
personal delivery or delivery by mail or by overnight courier service) shall
constitute the giving thereof:

9.7 _Headings_.  The descriptive headings of the sections and subsections of
this Agreement are inserted for convenience only and do not constitute a part
of this Agreement.

  



  

9.8 _Documen_ _ts_. Subject to applicable legal compliance, each Party agrees
to provide information and to execute, and, if necessary, to file with the
appropriate Governmental Entities and international organizations, such
documents as the other Party shall reasonably request in order to carry out
the purposes of this Agreement.

  



  

9.9 _Reconstit_ _ution_. In the event the Regulatory Approvals necessary to
consummate this transaction are denied or conditioned (except for any
condition that would make the matter Unconditional hereunder) by any
Governmental Entity, the Parties will use their respective best efforts for a
period of six (6) months thereafter to reconstitute this Agreement in a
manner that would permit each Party to realize the material benefits of this
Agreement in a manner that either does not require Regulatory Approval or can
reasonably be expected to achieve such Unconditional approval, and if such
material benefits can be realized, the Parties will proceed to implement this
Agreement as reconstituted; _provided, however,_ that no Party shall be
obligated to enter into any such reconstituted Agreement that would require
it to make material expenditures or dispose of material assets in excess of
the amount of expenditures or assets contemplated by this Agreement unless
compensated for such arrangement.

  



  

9.10 _Counterpart_ _s and Facsimile Signatures_.  This Agreement may be
executed by facsimile signatures and in several counterparts, each of which
shall be deemed an original, and all such counterparts together shall
constitute but one and the same instrument.

  



  

9.11 _Specific Per_ _formance_.  Nothing herein shall be deemed to preclude
either Party from seeking injunctive relief, if necessary, in order to
prevent the other from breaching its

  



  

26   

     
   

  



  

material obligations under this Agreement or to compel the other to perform
its material obligations under this Agreement in the event of a failure to
comply with this Agreement.  Both Parties acknowledge that the Acquired
Assets are unique and not readily available on the open market and that, if
the Acquired Assets are not available to Buyer because the terms of this
Agreement are not fulfilled through no fault of Buyer and for reasons
attributable to a breach of this Agreement by Rainbow DBS, then Buyers
remedies at law would not be adequate.

  



  

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, each of the Parties has duly executed and delivered this
Agreement as of the Execution Date.
