after receipt by Buyer of the Protest Notice submit the remaining Disputed Items for resolution to the Neutral Accountant, which shall be instructed by Buyer and Seller to determine and report to Buyer and Seller upon the resolution of such
remaining Disputed Items within 30 days after such submission (and for the avoidance of doubt, the Neutral Accountant shall consider only those items and amounts which are remaining Disputed Items). Each of Buyer and Seller will be afforded the
opportunity to present to the Neutral Accountant any material such Party deems relevant to the Neutral Accountant&#146;s determination. Buyer and Seller shall each furnish to the Neutral Accountant such work papers, financial information, books,
records, schedules, memoranda, and other documents and information relating to the remaining Disputed Items as the Neutral Accountant may request; <U>provided</U> that such access shall not include any access to documents to the extent prepared
primarily in anticipation of, or for the purposes of evaluating, any potential dispute, litigation, or arbitration relating to the Preliminary Adjustment Statement or the Protest Notice. The Neutral Accountant&#146;s determination shall be based
solely on the supporting material provided by Buyer and Seller which are in accordance with the terms and procedures set forth in this Agreement and not on the basis of an independent investigation or review. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, with respect to its determination of each Disputed Item, the Neutral Accountant: (i)&nbsp;may not assign a value to any Disputed Item greater than the greatest value for such Disputed Item claimed by Buyer and Seller, or less than the
lowest value for such Disputed Item claimed by Buyer and Seller and (ii)&nbsp;must make its determinations in accordance with the standards and definitions in this Agreement. The costs, fees and disbursements of the Neutral Accountant shall be
allocated between Buyer and Seller, in the same proportion that the aggregate amount of such remaining Disputed Items so submitted to the Neutral Accountant that is unsuccessfully disputed by each such Party (as finally determined by the Neutral
Accountant) bears to the total amount of such remaining Disputed Items so submitted. For example, if it is Buyer&#146;s position that the adjustment owed is $300, it is Seller&#146;s position that the adjustment owed is $100 and the Neutral
Accountant&#146;s finding is that the adjustment owed is $250, then Buyer shall pay 25% ((300-250) / (300-100)) of the Neutral Accountant&#146;s fees and expenses and Seller shall pay 75% ((250-100) / (300-100)) of the Neutral Accountant&#146;s fees
and expenses. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this <U>Section&nbsp;2.6</U>, the Neutral Accountant will act as an expert and not as an arbitrator and will address only those elements of the Closing Statement that are in dispute and
submitted to the Neutral Accountant for resolution. The scope of the disputes to be resolved by the Neutral Accountant shall be limited to whether the relevant calculations were performed in accordance with the terms hereof, whether the accounting
methods, standards, policies, practices, classifications, estimation methodologies, assumptions and procedures used to prepare the Closing Statement were consistent with the terms of this Agreement, and whether there were mathematical errors in the
calculation of the Closing Statements, and the Neutral Accountant shall not make any other determination. The Neutral Accountant is not authorized or permitted to make any determination as to the interpretation of any provision of this Agreement
