                                (ii) Upon receipt of the Closing Balance Sheet
and the Buyer's computation of Cash Consideration, Seller, at Seller's expense,

Seller shall notify Buyer in writing that either (A) it concurs with the
calculation of the Cash Consideration or (B) it disagrees with such calculation,
specifying in reasonable detail the items as to which disagreement exists (the

Consideration as of the Closing Date. If a notice of disagreement is delivered
by Seller, Buyer and Seller shall negotiate in good faith to resolve in writing
any Closing Disputed Matters. If Buyer and Seller are unable to reach an
agreement with respect to the Closing Disputed Matters within a period of thirty

Closing Disputed Matters as to which written agreement has not been reached
shall be submitted to and reviewed by KPMG Peat Marwick LLP, or if such firm is
unable or unwilling to serve in such capacity, by another accounting firm
acceptable to both Buyer and Seller. Such accounting firm shall consider only

all Closing Disputed Matters and its decision with respect thereto shall be
final and binding upon the parties. The fees and expenses of such accounting
firm in connection with its review and determination of any Closing Disputed
Matters shall be borne in equal shares by Buyer and Seller. The Cash
Consideration as agreed upon by Buyer and Seller or, as applicable, resulting
from the resolution of any Closing Disputed Matters, shall thereafter for all
purposes under this Agreement be the "Final Cash Consideration".

                  of the payment of such amount to Buyer; or

                                    (2) if the Final Cash Consideration is less
                  than the Estimated Cash Consideration (taking into
                  consideration any payments made to date pursuant to the last
                  sentence of Section 2.2(d)), Buyer shall promptly pay to

Seller).

                           (j) Except as disclosed in Schedule 3.19(j) hereto,

such Information Systems license and lease agreement; and

                                (vii) the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby will not result in a loss or impairment of any Acquired

Assets

                           (a) Attached hereto as Schedule 3.25(a) is a list of
each material Contract related to the Other Purchased Assets (collectively, the
"Other Purchased Asset Contracts"). Seller has made available to a Buyer a
correct and complete copy of each Other Purchased Asset Contract listed on
Schedule 3.25(a) hereto. Each Other Purchased Asset Contract is a legal, valid
and binding agreement, enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject, as to
the enforcement of remedies, to applicable bankruptcy, reorganization,
insolvency, moratorium (whether general or specific), fraudulent conveyance and
similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditor's rights generally, and
general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforcement is sought
in a proceeding in equity or at law) and is in full force and effect and is not
subject to any right of set-off. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.25(a) hereto,
(i) each Acquired Person party to an Other Purchased Asset Contract has
performed the obligations required to be performed by it to date under such
Other Purchased Asset Contract, and (ii) to Seller's Knowledge, there is no
default by any other party to any Other Purchased Asset Contract.

                           (b) Attached hereto as Schedule 3.25(b) is a list of
each material Contract related to the Purchased Investment Assets (collectively,
the "Purchased Investment Asset Contracts"). Seller has made available to Buyer
a correct and complete copy of each material Contract relating to Purchased
Investment Asset Contract listed on Schedule 3.24(b) hereto. Each Purchased
Investment Asset Contract is a legal, valid and binding agreement, enforceable
in accordance with the terms, subject, as to the enforcement of remedies, to
applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium (whether general
or specific), fraudulent conveyance and similar laws affecting the enforcement
of creditor's rights generally, and general principles of equity (regardless of
whether such enforcement is sought in a proceeding in equity or at law) and is
in full force and effect and is not subject to any right of set-off. Except as
set forth on Schedule 3.25(b) hereto, (i) each Acquired Person party to a
Purchased Investment Asset Contract has performed the obligations required to be
performed by it to date under such Purchased Investment Asset Contract, and (ii)
to Seller's Knowledge, there is no default by any other party to any Purchased
Investment Asset Contract.

                  Section 3.26. REMIC or Other Residual Interests. Except as set
forth on Schedule 3.26 hereto, none of the Acquired Persons is the owner of, and
there is not included in the Purchased Investment Assets, any Receivable for any
purpose, including for Tax purposes. Also set forth in Schedule 3.26 hereto is
the estimate of the future cash flows and weighted average life for the period
June 1, 2001 through the scheduled maturity of the modeled Securitization
Receivables owned by the Acquired Persons or included in the Purchased
Investment Assets as of June 1, 2001, which was prepared by Seller on June 8,
2001 utilizing the information available to Seller on May 28, 2001 and based on
certain hypothetical assumptions (the "Assumptions") as to the performance of
the Securitization Receivables and of the loans underlying such Securitization
Receivables, future interest rates and other factors which affect the cash flow
associated with the Securitization Receivables and consistent with Seller's
regular methodology; provided, however, that no representation is made regarding
the reliability or accuracy of the data provided by third parties or that
Assumptions will coincide with actual market conditions or events and the
parties acknowledge that the actual performance of the Securitization
Receivables and the loans underlying the Securitization Receivables may not be






                                       36
<PAGE>   43

consistent with the estimates shown on Schedule 3.26 hereto. Further, any
Securitization Receivables shown as owned by the Acquired Persons or included in
the Purchased Investment Assets on Schedule 3.26 hereto are and will be treated
as owned for Tax purposes and the IRS has not challenged the Tax
characterization of any Securitization Receivables.

                  Section 3.27. Sufficiency of Purchased Assets. Except as set
forth on Schedule 3.27 hereto, the Purchased Assets include all assets,
property, rights and systems of Seller and the Retained Subsidiaries used in the
conduct of the business of the Acquired Persons.

amount of cash and cash equivalents of not less than $2,500,000 and (ii) AIFI
has an amount of cash and cash equivalents of not less than $5,500,000.

                  Section 3.29. No Other Representations or Warranties. Except
for the representations and warranties contained in this Article III, neither
Seller nor any other Person makes any other express or implied representation or
warranty on behalf of Seller.

                  Section 4.3. Brokers and Finders. No broker, finder,

applicable state securities law, and that the ACFI Shares, AIFI Shares and

to prohibit Buyer from consummating the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the Related Documents to which it is a party or performing its
obligations hereunder and thereunder.

                  Section 4.6. Litigation. No Actions or Proceeding are pending

for the representations and warranties contained in this Article IV, neither
Buyer nor any other Person makes any other express or implied representation or

                                    ARTICLE V

                                   TAX MATTERS

                  Section 5.1. Tax Sharing and Indemnification. (a) (i) Seller
shall indemnify and hold harmless Buyer, each Acquired Person, each Subsidiary
of any Acquired Person and their respective directors, officers, employees,
agents and Affiliates (each, a "Tax Indemnitee")




                                       38
<PAGE>   45

with respect to any and all Taxes that may be imposed on Buyer, any Tax
Indemnitee, or in respect of the business or assets of any Tax Indemnitee (A)
with respect to any Taxable period of any Acquired Person, any Subsidiary of any
Acquired Person or any Affiliated Group ending on or prior to the Closing Date
or allocated to Seller pursuant to subparagraph (ii) of this Section 5.1(a), (B)
to the extent such Taxes arise as a result of a breach or inaccuracy of any
representation contained in Section 3.16 or 3.26, (C) under Treasury Regulation
Section 1.1502-6 or any comparable state, local or foreign Tax provision, and
(D) as a result of making any Section 338 Election.

                                (ii) If, for any federal, state, local or
foreign Tax purposes, the Taxable period of any Acquired Person or any
Subsidiary of any Acquired Person does not terminate on the Closing Date (any
such period, a "Straddle Period"), Taxes, if any, attributable to such Straddle
Period shall be allocated to (A) Seller for the portion of such Straddle Period
up to and including the Closing Date, and (B) Buyer for the portion of such
Straddle Period subsequent to the Closing Date. For purposes of the preceding
sentence, Taxes for the portion of each Straddle Period up to and including the
Closing Date and for the portion of such Straddle Period subsequent to the
Closing Date shall be determined on the basis of an interim closing of the books
as of the close of business on the Closing Date as if such Straddle Period
consisted of one Taxable period ending on the Closing Date followed by a Taxable
period beginning on the day following the Closing Date or under such other
reasonable method as the parties may agree. For purposes of this subparagraph
(ii), exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual
basis, such as the deduction for depreciation, shall be apportioned on a daily
basis. For purposes of this Article V and the representation contained in
Section 3.16, any Tax that is based in whole or in part on income earned during
a particular Taxable period shall be deemed to be a Tax attributable to and
imposed in respect of such Taxable period; provided, that for purposes of this
sentence, the term "Taxable period" shall include any portion of a Taxable
period that ends on and includes the Closing Date.

                           (b) (i) Seller shall prepare or cause to be prepared,
and file or cause to be filed, all Tax Returns of each Acquired Person and each
Subsidiary of any Acquired Person, including consolidated, combined or unitary
Tax Returns which include any Acquired Person or any such Subsidiary, for all
Taxable periods of each Acquired Person and each such Subsidiary that end on or
prior to the Closing Date. All such returns shall be prepared on a basis that is
consistent with the manner in which Seller prepared or filed such Tax Returns
for prior periods. Buyer shall be responsible for filing all Tax Returns
required to be filed by or on behalf of each Acquired Person and each Subsidiary
of each Acquired Person for Taxable periods ending after the Closing Date.



                                (ii) With respect to any Tax Return required to
be filed by Buyer pursuant to subparagraph (i) above for a Straddle Period of
any Acquired Person or any Subsidiary of any Acquired Person, Buyer shall
provide Seller with copies of such completed Tax Return and a statement setting
forth the amount of Tax shown on such Tax Return that is allocable to Seller
pursuant to subparagraph (ii) of paragraph (a) above (the "Statement") at least
30 days prior to the due date for the filing of such Tax Return. If Seller
notifies Buyer in writing within ten days after receiving the Statement that
Seller questions the information contained therein, then PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLP (or such other "Big Five" accounting firm as selected by Buyer in its
discretion) shall be instructed to review the Statement and determine its
accuracy




                                       39
<PAGE>   46

and reasonableness within 15 days. If PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (or such other
"Big Five" accounting firm as selected by Buyer in its discretion) determines
that the Statement is reasonable, or if Seller does not provide any such
notification, then not later than five days before the due date for payment of
Taxes with respect to such Tax Return, Seller shall pay to Buyer an amount equal
to the Taxes shown on the Statement as being allocable to Seller pursuant to
subparagraph (ii) of paragraph (a) above.

                                (iii) After the Closing Date, Buyer and Seller
shall provide each other with reasonable cooperation in connection with the
preparation of Tax Returns of the Acquired Persons and their Subsidiaries and
shall make available to the other and to any Taxing authority, as reasonably
requested, all information, records or documents relating to Tax liabilities or
potential Tax liabilities of the Acquired Persons and their Subsidiaries for all
periods prior to or including the Closing Date and shall preserve all such
information, records and documents until the expiration of any statute of
limitations or extensions thereof.

                                (iv) Buyer shall promptly notify Seller in
writing upon receipt by Buyer, any Acquired Person or any Subsidiary thereof of
written notice of any assessments of any Acquired Person or any such Subsidiary
which may affect the liability of an Acquired Person or any such Subsidiary for
Taxes for which it is indemnified under this Section 5.1. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the failure of Buyer to give notice under the preceding sentence
shall not relieve Seller of any obligations hereunder unless such failure shall
preclude the defense of such claim. If Seller so requests within 30 days after
receipt of such notice, Buyer shall contest, and shall not settle without the
prior consent of Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, any
claim arising as a result of any such audit; provided, however, that (A) Buyer
may, at its sole discretion, either pay the Tax claimed and sue for a refund or
contest the claim in any permissible forum, (B) Seller shall have agreed to pay
Buyer all costs and expenses incurred in connection with contesting such claim,
and (C) if any contest of any such claim shall require the payment of the
disputed Tax, Seller shall advance to Buyer the amount of such Tax on an
interest-free basis and at no after-Tax cost to Buyer. Any refund received by
Buyer or any affiliate thereof of Taxes with respect to which Seller has made
payment pursuant to its obligation under Section 5.1(a) shall be for the account
of Seller.

                           (c) Adjustment to Purchase Price. Any payment by
Seller under this Article V will be an adjustment to the Purchase Price unless a
final determination (which shall include the execution of a Form 870-AD or
successor form) causes any such payment not to be treated as an adjustment to
the Purchase Price for United States federal income Tax purposes. All payments
made under this Section 5.1 shall include an amount sufficient to hold the
recipient harmless on an after-Tax basis from all Taxes imposed with respect to
the receipt or account of the payment.

                           (d) Refunds from Carrybacks. If Seller becomes
entitled to the amount or economic benefit of any refund, credit or offset of
Taxes for any period for which they are liable under Section 5.1(a) to indemnify
Buyer and such refund, credit or offset of Taxes are attributable to the
carryback of losses, credits or similar items attributable to the Acquired
Persons or any Subsidiary of the Acquired Persons for a taxable year or period
that begins after the Closing Date, Seller shall promptly pay to Buyer the
amount or economic benefit of any such refund, credit or offset.




                                       40
<PAGE>   47

                  Section 5.2. Transfer Taxes. All sales, use, transfer, real
estate transfer stamp, documentary and other similar Taxes which may be imposed
or assessed as a result of Buyer's acquisition of the ACFI Shares or AIFI
Shares, the Other Purchased Assets or the Purchased Investment Assets shall be
borne by Seller.

                  Section 5.3. Tax Sharing Agreements. Any and all Tax sharing,
Tax indemnity or Tax allocation agreements between Seller, the Acquired Persons
and/or any Affiliate thereof that were in effect at any time prior to the
Closing shall terminate upon the Closing. No further amounts shall be payable by
Seller, Acquired Persons or any Affiliate thereof under such agreements
following the Closing and Seller, the Acquired Persons or any Affiliate thereof
shall have no further obligations thereunder following the Closing.

                  Section 5.4. Claims Adjusted for Tax Benefits. The amount of
any indemnity payment owed by Seller to Buyer under this Article V or Article IX
shall be adjusted if such indemnity payment is made in connection with (i) the
purchase of Purchased Investment Assets or Other Purchased Assets or (ii) the
purchase of any Acquired Person or any Subsidiary of any Acquired Person if a
Section 338 Election is made with respect to such purchase. The amount of any
such indemnity payment shall be reduced to take account of any net Tax benefit
realized by Buyer arising from the item resulting in such indemnity payment, and
increased by any net Tax cost realized by Buyer as a result of the receipt of
such indemnity payment being treated as income or as a reduction in purchase
price. For purposes of this Section 5.4, (i) any net Tax benefit shall be
calculated by discounting (based on semi-annual compounding) the Tax benefit
from the date it is expected to be realized to the date the indemnity payment is
made using a discount rate equal to the overpayment rate contained in Section
6621(a)(1) of the Code and (ii) any net Tax cost shall be calculated by
increasing the indemnity payment by an interest factor (based on semi-annual
compounding) equal to the overpayment rate contained in Section 6621(a)(1) of
the Code from the Closing Date to the date the indemnity payment is made.

                  Section 5.5. Section 338(h)(10) Election. If Buyer so requests
by written notice delivered not later than 90 days after the Closing Date,
Seller and each appropriate Affiliate of Seller shall join with Buyer in making
an election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code and any analogous provision of
state or local law (each such election, a "Section 338 Election") with respect
to the purchase of the stock of each Acquired Person and any deemed purchase of
any Subsidiary of any Acquired Person (it being understood that Buyer may make
such requests separately with respect to Section 338 Elections under the Code
and under state and local law and with respect to any Acquired Person and any
Subsidiary of any Acquired Person). If Buyer requests that one or more Section
338 Elections be made with respect to any Acquired Person or any Subsidiary of
any Acquired Person, then Section 5.9 shall apply to determine the allocation of
the Purchase Price and other relevant items among the assets of the Acquired
Person and, if applicable, one or more of its Subsidiaries.

                  Section 5.6. Pre-Closing Tax Information. Seller shall deliver
to Buyer as promptly as practicable, and in any event within 10 days after the
date of this Agreement, any and all information in connection with determining
whether to make any Section 338 Election (such information to include, without
limitation, the adjusted tax basis of each asset owned by any Acquired Person
and Seller's (and any Affiliate of Seller's) tax basis in the stock of each
Acquired Person). Seller shall also deliver to Buyer as promptly as practicable,
and in any event




                                       41
<PAGE>   48

within 20 days of receipt of Buyer's request therefor, any and all information
reasonably requested by Buyer in connection with determining the expected Tax
consequences of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (such
information to include, without limitation, information regarding the tax
attributes of Seller and members of its affiliated group and information
regarding the Tax consequences of such transactions under the Treasury
Regulations promulgated under Section 1502 of the Code. Any and all information
provided pursuant to this Section 5.6 shall be provided at Seller's expense and
shall be the most current information reasonably available; provided, however,
that (a) all such information provided pursuant to the first sentence of this
Section 5.6 shall be current as of no earlier than March 31, 2001, (b) Seller
shall deliver to Buyer as promptly as practicable, and in any event within 20
days of receipt of Buyer's request therefor, updates of the information provided
pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 5.6 that is current as of no
earlier than June 30, 2001 and (c) all such information provided pursuant to the
second sentence of this Section 5.6 shall be current as of no earlier than June
30, 2001.

                  Section 5.7. Closing Year Tax Return. Upon completion of the
federal income tax return for the affiliated group of which Seller is the common
parent for the taxable year of such group that includes the Closing Date (the
"Closing Year Tax Return"), Seller shall deliver a true copy of such Closing
Year Tax Return to Buyer together with such work papers and other documents as
may be reasonably necessary to determine the accuracy and completeness of such
Closing Year Tax Return; provided, however, that Seller shall also deliver to
Buyer no later than March 15, 2002 projections in reasonable detail for the
amounts that will appear on the Closing Year Tax Return. Seller shall, upon
Buyer's request, make reasonably available to Buyer at a mutually convenient
time and location any personnel involved in the preparation of the Closing Year
Tax Return for the purpose of answering any questions Buyer may have regarding
such Closing Year Tax Return or the manner in which such Closing Year Tax Return
was prepared.

                  Section 5.8. Survival of Obligations. The obligations of the
parties set forth in this Article V and the representations and warranties set
forth in Section 3.16 hereof shall be unconditional and absolute and shall
remain in effect until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations
(including extensions).

                  Section 5.9. Allocation of Purchase Price. In accordance with
the terms of this Section 5.9, Buyer shall deliver to Seller a proposed
allocation of the Purchase Price and other relevant items (the "Proposed
Allocation") among the assets acquired or deemed to be acquired with respect to
(i) the purchase of Purchased Investment Assets and Other Purchased Assets and
(ii) the purchase of any Acquired Person or any Subsidiary of any Acquired
Person if a Section 338 Election is made with respect to such purchase. Such
Proposed Allocation shall be delivered as soon as practicable after the Closing
Date. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (or such other "Big Five" accounting firm as
selected by Buyer in its discretion) shall be instructed to review the Proposed
Allocation and determine its accuracy and reasonableness within 20 days after
receiving the Proposed Allocation from Buyer. If PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (or
such other "Big Five" accounting firm as selected by Buyer in its discretion)
determines that the Proposed Allocation is reasonable, then the Proposed
Allocation shall be the final allocation of the Purchase Price and other
relevant items among the assets described in this Section 5.9 (the "Final
Allocation"). Any allocation that becomes the Final Allocation pursuant to the
proceeding provisions of this Section 5.9 shall be final and binding as between
Seller, Buyer and their





                                       42
<PAGE>   49

respective Affiliates and neither Seller, Buyer nor any Affiliate of either
thereof shall take any position on any Tax Return, including, without
limitation, Internal Revenue Service Form 8023, that is inconsistent with the
Final Allocation. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer's
allocation of the adjusted grossed-up basis (within the meaning of Treasury
Regulation Section 1.338-5) and Seller's allocation of the aggregate deemed
sales price (within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.338-4) shall be
consistent with the Final Allocation.

                  Section 5.10. REMIC Disclosures. Seller shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain and disclose to Buyer as promptly as
practicable the estimate prepared by the appropriate trustee or other third
party of the future taxable income for the period January 1, 2001 through the
scheduled maturity of the modeled Securitization Receivables owned by the
Acquired Persons or included in the Purchased Investment Assets as of January 1,
2001. Buyer may exclude any asset described in Section 3.26 from the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement based on the information provided
pursuant to this Section 5.10; provided, however, that any such exclusion shall
not result in an adjustment to the Purchase Price.

                  Section 5.11. Trust Account. At Closing, Seller shall deposit
into an interest bearing trust account approved by the Bankruptcy Court, in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer, an amount sufficient, in the
reasonable good faith judgment of Buyer, to pay any and all liabilities for
Taxes which the Acquired Companies or any Subsidiaries of the Acquired Companies
may be liable with Seller or any of the Retained Subsidiaries on a joint and
several basis. The amounts held in the Trust Account shall be applied solely to
satisfy such liabilities, and thereafter any remaining amount shall be applied
in such manner as the Bankruptcy Court shall determine.

                                   ARTICLE VI

                        CERTAIN COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS
                               OF SELLER AND BUYER

                  Section 6.1. Access and Information. (a) Seller shall permit,
and shall cause the Retained Subsidiaries and the Acquired Persons to permit,
Buyer and its representatives after the date of execution of this Agreement to
have full access, during regular business hours and upon reasonable advance
notice, to the properties, officers and employees of the Acquired Persons (and
Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause Seller's outside
independent accountants be available to Buyer on the same basis), and shall
furnish, or cause to be furnished, to Buyer any financial and operating data,
tax information, books and records, contracts and documents and other
information that is available with respect to the Seller, Acquired Persons, the
Other Purchased Assets and the Purchased Investment Assets as Buyer shall from
time to time reasonably request (including any work papers of Seller's
accountants); provided, that the foregoing shall not require Seller to permit
any inspection, or to disclose any information, that in its reasonable judgment
would result in the disclosure of any trade secrets of third parties or violate
Seller's or the Acquired Persons' obligations with respect to confidentiality.

                           (b) All information provided or obtained pursuant to
clause (a) above shall be held by Buyer in accordance with and subject to the
terms of (i) the Confidentiality





                                       43

use its reasonable best efforts to obtain Bankruptcy Court approval of the

be held by the Bankruptcy Court in escrow until the earlier of the Closing Date
or the termination of this Agreement, at which time the Initial Deposit shall,

                           (c) As promptly as practicable, but in no event later
than four Business Days, after the filing of the Petition with the Bankruptcy
Court, Seller shall file with the Bankruptcy Court a motion, notices and a
proposed Sale Order, each in a form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
Buyer, seeking approval under Section 105, 363, 364 and 365 of the Bankruptcy
Code of this Agreement, Seller's and its Subsidiaries' performance hereunder,
the sale of the Purchased Assets free and clear of all Liens, claims (as defined
in Section 101(5) of the Bankruptcy Code) and interests, and the assumption and
assignment of the Contracts as provided in this Agreement. Buyer shall cooperate
with Seller in obtaining such Bankruptcy Court approval and Seller shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain such Bankruptcy Court approval.

                  Section 6.5. Bidding Procedures. Seller acknowledges that this
Agreement is the culmination of an extensive process undertaken by Seller to
identify and negotiate a transaction with a bidder who was prepared to pay the
highest and best purchase price for the Purchased Assets while assuming or
otherwise satisfying certain liabilities in order to maximize the value of those
assets. Set forth below are the bidding procedures (the "Bidding Procedures") to
be employed with respect to this Agreement concerning the sale of the Purchased
Assets of Seller and its Subsidiaries to Buyer (the "Sale"); provided, that
Buyer reserves the right to further






                                       46
<PAGE>   53

comment on the form of the Bidding Procedures Order. The Sale is subject to
competitive bidding only as set forth herein and approval by the Bankruptcy
Court at a hearing under Sections 105, 363, 364 and 365 of the Bankruptcy Code
(the "Sale Hearing"). The following overbid provisions and related bid
protections are designed to reimburse Buyer for its efforts and agreements to
date and to facilitate a full and fair process designed to maximize the value of
the Purchased Assets for the benefit of Seller's creditors and stakeholders.

                           (a) Bid Deadline. All Bids must be submitted to
Seller c/o Robin Phelan and Mark Mullen, Haynes and Boone, LLP, with a copy to
Seller, to the attention of its General Counsel, so as to be received not later
than 11:00 a.m., eastern time on the date which is three Business Days prior to
the date scheduled by the Bankruptcy Court for the Sale Hearing (the "Bid
Deadline"). Seller will immediately distribute by facsimile transmission,
personal delivery or reliable overnight courier service in accordance with
Section 10.12 a copy of each Bid upon receipt to (i) counsel to any creditors'
committee appointed in the Bankruptcy Case and (ii) counsel to Buyer. For
purposes of this Agreement, "Bid" shall mean a letter from a Person who the
Board of Directors of Seller has determined in the exercise of its fiduciary
duty is financially able to consummate the purchase of the Purchased Assets (a
"Qualified Bidder") stating that (A) such Qualified Bidder offers to purchase
the Purchased Assets upon the terms and conditions set forth in a copy of this
Agreement, together with all Exhibits and Schedules hereto (the "Definitive Sale
Documentation"), marked to show those amendments and modifications to the
Definitive Sale Documentation, including, but not limited to, price and the time
of closing, that such Qualified Bidder proposes, (B) such Qualified Bidder is
prepared to enter into and consummate the transaction within not more than
eleven (11) days after approval by the Bankruptcy Court of the Sale Order,
subject to receipt of any governmental or regulatory approvals (which must be
obtained within sixty (60) days of the approval by the Bankruptcy Court of the
Sale Order), and (C) such Qualified Bidder's offer is irrevocable until the
closing of a purchase of the Purchased Assets.

                           (b) Qualified Bid. Only Qualified Bids will qualify
for consideration at the Auction (as defined below). For purposes of this
Agreement, a "Qualified Bid" is a Bid that:

                                (i) complies in all respects with Section
6.5(a);

                                (ii) has a cash component of at least an amount
sufficient to satisfy the Expense Reimbursement and the Break-Up Fee (each as
defined in Section 6.5(d));

                                (iii) is a proposal that Seller determines, in
the good faith opinion of the Board of Directors of Seller after consultation
with the independent financial advisor of Seller, is not materially more
burdensome or conditional than the terms of this Agreement and has a value
greater than or equal to the sum of (x) the value, as reasonably determined by
the independent financial advisor of Seller, of Buyer's offer plus (y) the
amount of the Expense Reimbursement and the Break-Up Fee plus (z) in the case of
the initial Qualified Bid, $1,000,000, and in the case of any subsequent
Qualified Bids, $1,500,000 over the preceding Qualified Bid;





                                       47
<PAGE>   54

                                (iv) is substantially on the same or better
terms and conditions as those set forth in a copy of the Definitive Sale
Documentation;

                                (v) is accompanied by satisfactory evidence of
committed financing or other ability to perform;

                                (vi) is accompanied by a deposit (by means of a
certified bank check from a U.S. bank or by wire transfer) equal to or greater
than the Initial Deposit plus the Break-Up Fee plus the Expense Reimbursement;

                                (vii) is accompanied by satisfactory evidence of
committed financing sufficient to repay all amounts outstanding under the
Replacement Warehouse Facilities immediately upon acceptance of the Bid with
financing in an amount at least equal to the Replacement Warehouse Facilities
plus all accrued interests and fees due thereunder and a commitment to repay
such amounts upon acceptance of such bid.

If Seller does not receive any Qualified Bids, Seller will report the same to
the Bankruptcy Court and will proceed with a sale and assignment of the
Purchased Assets to Buyer pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. This
Agreement executed by Buyer shall constitute a Qualified Bid for all purposes.

                           (c) Auction, Bidding Increments, and Bids Remaining
Open.

                                (i) If Seller receives a Qualified Bid, Seller
will conduct an auction (the "Auction") at the offices of Haynes and Boone, LLP,
901 Main Street, Suite 3100, Dallas, Texas 75202, on the date that is one
Business Day prior to the date scheduled by the Bankruptcy Court for the Sale
Hearing, beginning at 11:00 a.m. (EST) or such later time or other place as
Seller shall notify all Qualified Bidders who have submitted Qualified Bids.
Only Buyer, Seller, any representative of any creditors' committee appointed in
the Bankruptcy Case and any Qualified Bidders who have timely submitted
Qualified Bids shall be entitled to attend the Auction, and only Buyer and
Qualified Bidders will be entitled to make any subsequent Qualified Bids at the
Auction. Bidding at the Auction will continue until such time as the highest and
best Qualified Bid is determined. Seller may announce at the Auction additional
procedural rules that are reasonable under the circumstances (e.g., the amount
of time allotted to make subsequent overbids) for conducting the Auction so long
as such rules are not inconsistent with these Bidding Procedures.

                                (ii) At least one Business Day prior to the
Auction, Seller will give Buyer and all other Qualified Bidders a copy of the
highest and best Qualified Bid received and copies of all other Qualified Bids.
In addition, Seller will inform Buyer and each Qualified Bidder who has
expressed its intent to participate in the Auction the identity of all Qualified
Bidders that may participate in the Auction.

                           (d) Break-Up Fee and Expense Reimbursement. In the
event that Seller (i) accepts a Bid, other than that of Buyer, as the highest or
best offer (an "Auction Transaction"), (ii) sells, transfers, leases or
otherwise disposes directly or indirectly, including through an asset sale,
stock sale, merger, reorganization or other similar transaction (by the Acquired
Companies or otherwise), all or substantially all or a material portion of the
Purchased





                                       48
<PAGE>   55

Assets (or agrees to do any of the foregoing) in a transaction or series of
transactions to a party or parties other than Buyer within two years from the
date hereof, or (iii) chooses not to sell, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose
of, directly or indirectly, including through an asset sale, stock sale, merger,
reorganization or other similar transaction (by the Acquired Companies or
otherwise), all or substantially all or a material portion of the Purchased
Assets (or agrees to do any of the foregoing) to Buyer whether as a result of
the proposal of a stand-alone plan of reorganization or otherwise (either of
clause (i), (ii) or (iii) being, an "Alternative Transaction"), Seller shall pay
to Buyer (x) an amount equal to its reasonable, actual out-of-pocket costs and
expenses (including, without limitation, expenses of counsel, expenses of
financial advisor and expenses of other consultants and the HSR Act filing fee)
incurred by Buyer in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, not to exceed $2,000,000, less any amount of expense
deposits previously paid (the "Expense Reimbursement"), (y) provided that
amounts have been funded under the Replacement Warehouse Facilities, a break-up
fee in the amount of $8,000,000 which reimburses Buyer for the time and expense
dedicated to this transaction and the value added by the Buyer in (A)
establishing a bid standard or minimum for other bidders, (B) placing Seller's
estate property in a sales configuration mode attracting other bidders to the
Auction and (C) for serving, by its name and its expressed interest, as a
catalyst for other potential or actual bidders (the "Break-Up Fee"); and (z) all
amounts payable under the Replacement Warehouse Facilities upon a termination
thereof; provided, however, that in no event shall the Expense Reimbursement or
the Break-Up Fee be payable to Buyer (1) if Buyer terminates this Agreement
(other than in the event of an Alternative Transaction) for any reason other
than any material breach of this Agreement by Seller, including, without
limitation, any material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement set forth in this Agreement, or (2) if this Agreement is terminated by
Seller pursuant to Section 8.1(ii) and no Alternative Transaction occurs or
Section 8.1(iii) and no Alternative Transaction occurs. The Break-Up Fee and the
Expense Reimbursement shall be paid as an administrative priority of Seller
under Section 503(b)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code upon the earlier to occur of the
closing of the Alternative Transaction and the consummation of a plan of
reorganization.

                  Section 6.6. Retention of Books and Records. Buyer shall cause
the Acquired Persons to retain, until the applicable tax statute of limitations
(including periods of waiver) has expired, all books, records and other
documents pertaining to the Acquired Persons in existence on the Closing Date
that are required to be retained under current retention policies and to make
the same available after the Closing Date for inspection and copying by Seller
or their agents at Seller's expense, during regular business hours and upon
reasonable request and upon reasonable advance notice. Seller shall hold all
such information in strict confidence. After the expiration of such period, no
such books and records shall be destroyed by Buyer without first advising Seller
in writing detailing the contents thereof and giving Seller at least 120 days to
obtain possession thereof.

                  Section 6.7. Affiliate Accounts and Transactions. At the
Closing, Seller shall contribute to the capital of the Acquired Companies all
indebtedness then owed by the Acquired Companies to Seller or its Retained
Subsidiaries and Seller cancel or otherwise settle, at no expense to Buyer or
the Acquired Persons, all agreements, arrangements and understandings between
the Acquired Persons and Seller, any of the Retained Subsidiaries or any of
their respective employees, officers or directors (other than under Contracts
and other arrangements relating to Transferred Employees disclosed to Buyer
prior to the date hereof), and at the Closing







                                       49
<PAGE>   56

Seller shall deliver a release to the Acquired Persons acknowledging that no
Acquired Person has any outstanding obligation to Seller, any of its Affiliates
or any of their respective employees, officers or directors other than under
such disclosed Contracts and arrangements relating to Transferred Employees.

                  Section 6.8. Delivery of Corporate Minutes and Bank Signature
Cards. At the Closing, Seller shall deliver to Buyer the minutes and stock books
of the Acquired Persons, and promptly following the Closing shall deliver
signature cards from all banks or financial institutions with which the Acquired

                  Section 6.9. Further Assurances. At any time after the Closing
Date, Seller shall, and Buyer shall cause the Acquired Persons to, promptly

requested by Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, and necessary for Buyer or
Seller, as the case may be, to satisfy its obligations hereunder or obtain the
benefits contemplated hereby and Seller shall cooperate with Buyer in connection
with the disposition of certain Purchased Investment Assets and Other Purchased
Assets prior to Closing.

                  Section 6.10. Non-Solicitation of Employees. (a) Seller agrees
that, for a period of two years from the Closing Date, Seller shall not,
directly or indirectly: (i) solicit or recruit any Transferred Employees and
(ii) and disclose or furnish to anyone any confidential information relating to
the Acquired Persons (other than as required under applicable Law) or otherwise
use such confidential information for their own benefit or the benefit of any
other Person.

                           (a) The parties recognize that the performance of the
obligations under this Section 6.10 by Seller are special, unique and
extraordinary in character, and that in the event of the breach by Seller of the
terms and conditions of this Section 6.10 to be performed by Seller, each of
Buyer and the Acquired Persons shall be entitled, if it so elects, to institute
and prosecute proceedings in any court of competent jurisdiction, either in law
or in equity, to obtain damages for any breach of this Section 6.10, to enforce
the specific performance thereof by Seller and its Affiliates and/or to enjoin
Seller and its Affiliates from actions in violation of this Section 6.10.

                  Section 6.11. Closing. The parties agree to use all
commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions set forth in Article VII so as to enable the parties to effect the
Closing on or prior to September 30, 2001.

                  Section 6.12. Taxes. Without the prior written consent of
Buyer, neither Seller nor any Affiliate of Seller shall, to the extent it may
adversely affect or relate to any Acquired Person, any Subsidiary of an Acquired
Person or any other of the Purchased Assets, make or change any Tax election,
change any annual Tax accounting period, adopt or change any method of Tax
accounting, file any amended Tax Return, enter into any closing agreement,
settle any Tax claim or assessment, surrender any right to claim a Tax refund,
consent to any extension or waiver of the limitation period applicable to any
Tax claim or assessment or take or omit to take any other action, if any such
action or omission would have the effect of increasing the Tax






                                       50
<PAGE>   57

liability or reducing any Tax Asset of any Acquired Person, any Subsidiary of
any Acquired Person, Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer. For purposes of this
Agreement, "Tax Asset" shall mean any net operating loss, net capital loss, Tax
credit or any other Tax attribute which could reduce Taxes (including, without
limitation, deductions and credits related to alternative minimum Taxes).

                  Section 6.13. Employment. On the Closing Date, Buyer will
offer regular full-time or part-time employment, as applicable, to such
employees of Seller (including those designated as "commercial finance"
employees) as Buyer shall hereafter designate to Seller. Employees who accept
offers of employment made by Buyer pursuant to this Section 6.13 shall be
referred to herein as the "Transferred Employees." Nothing in Section 6.13 shall
be deemed to require, however, that the employment of any Transferred Employee
be continued for any specific period of time after the Closing Date. Seller
shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Buyer and its Affiliates from any
claims, liabilities or expenses arising in connection with the severance of any
employee of Seller who is not a Transferred Employee.

                  Section 6.14. Benefit Plans. Subject to Section 6.13, Buyer
shall, or shall cause the Acquired Companies to, establish and maintain for at
least one year following the Closing Date employee benefit plans, compensation
and payroll arrangements, and other arrangements providing benefits which are
substantially the same, in the aggregate, as the benefits provided to the
Transferred Employees immediately prior to the Closing. To the extent that any
employee benefit plan or arrangement is made available by Buyer or the Acquired
Companies to any Transferred Employees following the Closing Date, (i) Buyer
shall, or shall cause the Acquired Companies to, grant all such Transferred
Employees after the Closing Date credit for all service with the Seller and any
predecessors prior to the Closing Date for all purposes for which such service
was recognized by Seller; and (ii) with respect to any "Employee Benefit Welfare
Plan" (as that term is defined in Section 3(l) of ERISA), to the extent
permitted under any applicable insurance policy, Buyer shall, or shall cause the
Acquired Companies to, waive any waiting periods, pre-existing condition
exclusions and actively-at-work requirements and provide that any expenses
incurred on or before the Closing Date by a Transferred Employee or a
Transferred Employee's covered dependent shall be taken into account for
purposes of satisfying applicable deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of
pocket provisions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall retain liability
under any Employee Benefit Welfare Plan for claims incurred prior to the Closing
Date, including, but not limited to, (i) disability claims which commence prior
to the Closing Date and extend beyond the Closing Date and (ii) claims of
employees not actively at work with Buyer or the Acquired Companies as of the
Closing Date regarding ongoing medical conditions first arising before Closing
for which treatment will continue after Closing, provided that Buyer shall
assume liability for claims incurred after the employee is actively at work with
Buyer or the Acquired Companies. Seller shall be responsible for maintaining
continuation health coverage under Section 4980B of the Code and Part 6 of Title
I of ERISA for employees who are not Transferred Employees and employees whose
employment terminated prior to the Closing Date, including, but not limited to,
employees on a disability leave as of the Closing Date.

                  Section 6.15. Buyer Savings Plan. Notwithstanding any
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, effective immediately after the
Closing, Buyer shall maintain a profit sharing plan ("Buyer Savings Plan") for
the benefit of the Transferred Employees pursuant to








                                       51
<PAGE>   58

which Buyer shall take the necessary actions to obtain a determination letter
from the Internal Revenue Service that such plan is qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code. Buyer Savings Plan shall provide the Transferred Employees
with the opportunity to defer compensation pursuant to Section 401(k) of the
Code and with employer contributions in the amounts set forth and on the terms
and conditions set forth in such plan. As soon as practicable after the Closing,
Seller shall cause the AMRESCO, INC. Retirement Savings and Profit Sharing Plan
(the "AMRESCO Plan") to transfer the accounts of the Transferred Employees, and
all promissory notes evidencing then outstanding participant loans under the
AMRESCO Plan with respect to Transferred Employees, to Buyer Savings Plan and
Buyer shall cause Buyer Savings Plan to accept and assume from the AMRESCO Plan
all of the AMRESCO Plan's liabilities and obligations with respect to the
Transferred Employees; provided, however, that such transfer shall be contingent

notice to Seller not less than five Business Days prior to the date of the
scheduled Closing. Upon such designation, Seller shall deliver to Buyer as
promptly as practicable such supplemental disclosure schedules to this agreement
to disclose such information as would have been required to be disclosed by
Seller pursuant to Article III had such Designated Subsidiary been an Acquired
Person on the date hereof.

                  Section 6.17. Transitional Services Agreement. Buyer and
Seller shall, as promptly as practicable, negotiate in good faith an agreement
to be entered into at the Closing for the provision, on an arm's length basis,
of transitional services to each other in order to facilitate an orderly

Assets, and for the administration of the Seller's remaining assets and estate

prior to the Closing Date shall have been duly performed in all material

be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Acquired Persons considered

approvals shall have been obtained from and made with all required Governmental
Entities, except for such consents, waivers, approvals or authorizations that
the failure to obtain, or such filings or notices that the failure to make,

Purchased Assets considered as a whole or on the validity or enforceability of
any Loans, or (ii) prohibit Buyer from consummating the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or performing its obligations hereunder.

                           (f) Third Party Consents. All third party consents,

prior to the Closing Date shall have been duly performed in all material
respects; and Seller shall have received at the Closing certificates to the
foregoing effect, dated as of the Closing Date and executed on behalf of Buyer.

terminated by the FTC or the Antitrust Division, and other regulatory approvals
shall have been obtained from and made with all required Governmental Entities,
except for such consents, waivers, approvals or authorizations that the failure

                                   TERMINATION

                  Section 8.1. Termination. Anything contained herein to the
contrary notwithstanding, this Agreement may be terminated and the transactions
contemplated hereby abandoned at any time prior to the Closing Date:

                                (i) by mutual written consent of Seller and
Buyer;

                                (ii) by Seller, on the one hand, or Buyer, on
the other hand, if the Closing does not occur on or prior to October 31, 2001;
provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 8.1(ii) shall not be available to Seller, on the one hand, or Buyer, on
the other hand, as the case may be, if such party or parties have failed to
perform any of their material respective obligations under this Agreement;

                                (iii) by either Seller, on the one hand, or
Buyer on the other hand, if consummation of the transactions contemplated by
Article II would violate any non-appealable final Judgment of any court or
Governmental Entity having competent jurisdiction;

                                (iv) by Buyer, if the Bankruptcy Court has not
entered the Bidding Procedures Order by July 13, 2001; provided, however, that
if the Bankruptcy Court has not entered the Bidding Procedures Order by July 13,
2001 and Buyer does not exercise its right to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to this Section 8.1(iv) by July 20, 2001, then Buyer shall be deemed to have
irrevocably waived its right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 8.1(iv);

                                (v) by Buyer, if the Bankruptcy Court has not
entered the Sale Order by September 7, 2001; provided, however, that if the
Bankruptcy Court has not entered the Sale Order by September 7, 2001 and Buyer
does not exercise its right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
8.1(v) within 60 days after the Bankruptcy Court enters the Bidding Procedures
Order, then Buyer shall be deemed to have irrevocably waived its right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(v);

                                (vi) by Seller, if Seller accepts or is about to

refinances in full the Replacement Warehouse Facilities and Break-Up Fee and
Expenses, provided that such termination shall be of no effect if Seller does
not accept such Qualified Bid immediately after termination hereunder;

                                (vii) by Buyer, if the Sale Order has not become
final and no appeal of the Sale Order shall have been filed within the time
frame specified in the second sentence of Section 7.1(h); provided, however,
that if the such condition is not met and Buyer does not exercise its right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(vii) within 20 days after

<PAGE>   62

                                (viii) by Buyer, if Seller gives written notice
to Buyer that it is unable to obtain the consents required by Section 7.1(f);
provided, however, that if Seller so notifies Buyer and Buyer does not exercise
its right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(viii) within
five Business Days of receiving such notice from Seller, then, with respect to
Seller's obligation to obtain such consent, Buyer shall be deemed to have
irrevocably waived (x) its right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 8.1 (viii), and (y) the condition set forth in Section 7.1(f); and

                                (ix) by Buyer, in the event of an Auction
Transaction.

                  Section 8.2. Notice of Termination. In the event of any
termination pursuant to this Article VIII, written notice thereof setting forth
the reasons therefor shall promptly be given to the other parties and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be terminated, without further

                  Section 8.3. Abandonment. If this Agreement is terminated and
the transactions contemplated hereby are abandoned as described in Section 8.1,
this Agreement shall become void and of no further force or effect, except for
the provisions of (i) Section 6.1 relating to the obligations of Seller, on the
one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, to keep confidential certain information
and data obtained by them, (ii) Section 6.5(d), relating to certain payments to
be made to Buyer in connection with an Alternative Transaction, (iii) Section
10.3 relating to publicity, and (iv) Section 10.2 relating to certain expenses.
Nothing in this Section 8.3 shall be deemed to release any party from any
liability for any breach by such party of the terms and provisions of this
Agreement or to impair the right of any party to compel specific performance by
any other party of its obligations under this Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE IX

                                 INDEMNIFICATION

                  Section 9.1. Survival of Representations. Except as otherwise
provided in this Agreement, the representations and warranties contained in
Articles III and IV of this Agreement or in any other instrument delivered in
connection herewith shall survive for six months following the Closing Date,
after which such representations or warranties shall terminate and not have any
force or effect and shall not constitute the basis for any further claim in
contract, tort or otherwise by Buyer against any Seller or by Seller against
Buyer, absent fraud. Following the Closing Date, the remedies provided in this
Article IX shall be the sole recourse of each of the parties hereto for all
claims, liabilities, losses, damages, costs and expenses arising out of this
Agreement, other than those arising from breaches of the covenants and
agreements set forth in Article V and Section 6.10, for which the sole recourse
shall be as provided in Article V and Section 6.10. Each of the covenants of the
parties hereto shall terminate as of the Closing other than those which by their
terms contemplate performance after the Closing Date.

                  Section 9.2. Agreement to Indemnify. (a) Upon the terms and
subject to the conditions of this Article IX, Seller shall indemnify, defend and
hold harmless Buyer and its directors, officers, employees, agents and
Affiliates from any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses (including
reasonable legal fees and expenses) (collectively, "Claims") which result





                                       56
<PAGE>   63

from any breach of (i) the representations made by Seller in Article III of this
Agreement or (ii) the covenants made by Seller in Articles V and VI of this
Agreement, in each case to the extent, and only for the amount by which any such
Claim results in losses in excess of an identified (whether by specific item or
by category) reserve established for such matters and reflected in the Closing
Balance Sheet.

                           (b) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Article IX, Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller and its
directors, officers, employees agents and Affiliates from any Claims which
result from any breach of (i) the representations made by Buyer in Article IV of
this Agreement or (ii) the covenants made by Buyer in Articles V and VI of this
Agreement.

                  Section 9.3. Conditions of Indemnification for Third-Party
Claims. Subject to the provisions of Section 9.4, the obligations and
liabilities of Seller, in the case of Section 9.2(a), and Buyer in the case of
Section 9.2(b), with respect to Claims made by or against third parties ("Third
Party Claims") shall be subject to the following terms and conditions:

                           (a) The person to whom such Third Party Claim relates
(the "Indemnified Party") will give the party from which indemnity is sought
hereunder (the "Indemnifying Party") prompt notice of such Third Party Claim,
and the Indemnifying Party will (except as otherwise contemplated by the proviso
to Section 9.3(b) hereof) assume the defense thereof by counsel selected by it
(such counsel to be reasonably satisfactory to Buyer); provided, that the
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in such action and to employ
counsel at its own expense to assist in the handling of such Third Party Claim.

                           (b) If the Indemnifying Party, within a reasonable
time after notice of any such Third Party Claim, fails to assume the defense
thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, the
Indemnified party shall have the right to undertake the defense or, with the
consent of the Indemnifying Party (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld), to undertake a compromise or settlement of such Third Party Claim on
behalf of and for the account and risk of the Indemnifying Party. The
Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any compromise or settlement of a
Third Party Claim effected without its written consent (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld). During any period when the Indemnifying Party is
contesting any such Third Party Claim in good faith, the Indemnified Party shall
not pay, compromise or settle such Third Party Claim without the Indemnifying
Party's consent; provided, that the Indemnified Party may nonetheless pay,
compromise or settle such Third Party Claim without such consent during such
period, in which event it shall, automatically and without any further action on
its part, waive any right (whether or not pursuant to this Agreement) to
indemnity in respect of all losses, liabilities, damages or expenses relating to
such Third Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party shall defend any such Third
Party Claim until such Third Party Claim shall be adjudicated by order, decree,
ruling or other action, then the Indemnified Party shall have the right, in the
exercise of its exclusive discretion, to determine whether or not to appeal such
adjudication.

                           (c) Anything in this Section 9.3 to the contrary
notwithstanding, the Indemnifying Party shall not, without the written consent
of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be withheld unreasonably or
delayed), settle or compromise any Third Party







                                       57
<PAGE>   64

Claim or consent to the entry of any Judgment which does not include as an
unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant and/or plaintiff to the
Indemnified Party of a release from all liabilities in respect of such Third
Party Claim.

                           (d) The Indemnified Party shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, provide the Indemnifying Party with such assistance (without
charge) as may reasonably be requested by the Indemnifying Party in connection
with any indemnification or defense provided for herein, including, without
limitation, providing the Indemnifying Party with such information, documents
and records as shall be reasonably available and reasonable access to the
services of and consultations with such personnel of the Indemnified Party or
its Affiliates as the Indemnifying Party shall reasonably deem necessary
(provided that such access shall not unreasonably interfere with the performance
of the duties performed by or responsibilities of such personnel).

                  Section 9.4. Limitation of Indemnification. Any Claim brought
under Section 9.2(a) is subject in each case to the following limitations and
restrictions:

                           (a) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement,
claims may not be asserted at any time after the close of business on the first
Business Day that is six months after the Closing Date.

                           (b) Claims made pursuant to Section 9.2(a) will be
paid only to the extent that the aggregate amount of all such Claims exceeds
$1,000,000 (the "Basket") at which point Seller shall be liable for the full
amount of such Claims back to the first dollar thereof; provided, however, that
the aggregate amount recoverable pursuant to Section 9.2(a) shall in no event
exceed $25,000,000.

                           (c) Each Claim shall be reduced by the amount of any
insurance proceeds (net of expenses of collection) actually received in
connection with such Claim; Buyer covenants to exercise its reasonable best
efforts to collect insurance proceeds under applicable insurance policies that
are then in force if and to the extent that such Claim relates to an event
covered by such insurance policies and if Buyer shall receive any insurance
proceeds after payment of any Claim by Seller, Buyer shall pay to Seller the
lesser of the amount of insurance proceeds (net of expenses of collection) and
the amount actually paid by Seller to Buyer in respect of such Claim.

                           (d) Except as provided in Article V, Claims made
shall be made solely by set-off against the Holdback Note.

                           (e) In determining whether Buyer is entitled to
recover for any Claim under Section 9.2(a), the representations and warranties
of Seller shall not be deemed qualified by any references to materiality
contained therein and any breaches thereof shall be determined without regard to
whether such breach constitutes a Material Adverse Effect; provided, however,
that in no event will Buyer be entitled (i) to recover for any Claim relating to
or arising out of a breach of any representation or warranty herein of Seller
pursuant to which the aggregate loss, expense, liability or damage does not
exceed $10,000; (ii) to aggregate any such items for the







                                       58
<PAGE>   65

purpose of exceeding the limitation set forth in clause (i) of this Section
9.4(e) or the Basket; or (iii) to otherwise submit such items as Claims
reimbursable pursuant to this Article IX.

                  Section 9.5. Offset Right. Any other provision herein
notwithstanding, Buyer's obligations hereunder and under the Holdback Note are
subject to, and Buyer shall have the benefit of, all defenses, counterclaims,
rights of offset or recoupment or other claims and rights, including the right
to deduct payments due to Seller under the Holdback Note (collectively,
"Offsets") which Buyer may have at any time against Seller, its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates (or any of their respective successors and assigns) or any transferee
or assignee of any of Seller's rights as against Buyer or any part thereof or
interest therein, whether the claim or right of Buyer relied upon for such
purpose is matured or unmatured, contingent or otherwise, and no transfer or
assignment of this Agreement or any other obligation of Seller, or of any rights
in respect thereof, pursuant to any plan of reorganization or liquidation or
otherwise shall affect or impair the availability to Buyer of the Offsets.

                                   ARTICLE X

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

                  Section 10.1. Amendment and Waiver. Any provision of this
Agreement may be amended or waived if, and only if, such amendment or waiver is
in writing and signed, in the case of an amendment, by Seller and Buyer, or in
the case of a waiver, by the party against whom the waiver is to be effective.
No failure or delay by any party or parties in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege.

                  Section 10.2. Expenses. Except as otherwise expressly provided
in this Agreement, including Section 6.5(d) and this Section 10.2, whether or
not the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated, the parties
shall bear their own respective expenses (including, but not limited to, all
compensation and expenses of counsel, financial advisors, consultants, actuaries
and independent accountants) incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby.

                  Section 10.3. Public Disclosure. Each of the parties to this
Agreement agrees with the other parties hereto that, except as may be required
to comply with the requirements of applicable Law or the rules and regulations
of each stock exchange upon which the securities of one of the parties or its
Affiliates is listed, no press release or similar public announcement or
communication will be made or caused to be made concerning the execution or
performance of this Agreement unless specifically approved in advance by all
parties hereto; provided, however, that to the extent that either party to this
Agreement is required by applicable Law or the rules and regulations of any
stock exchange upon which the securities of one of the parties or its Affiliates
is listed to make such a public disclosure, such public disclosure shall only be
made after prior consultation with the other party to this Agreement.

                  Section 10.4. Specific Performance. The parties recognize that
if any party breaches this Agreement or refuses to perform under the provisions
of this Agreement, monetary









                                       59
<PAGE>   66

damages alone would not be adequate to compensate the non-breaching party or
parties for their injuries. The non-breaching party or parties shall therefore
be entitled, in addition to any other remedies that may be available, to obtain
specific performance of the terms of this Agreement. If any action is brought by
the non-breaching party or parties to enforce this Agreement, the party in
breach shall waive the defense that there is an adequate remedy at law.

                  Section 10.5. Assignment. This Agreement and the rights and
obligations of the parties hereunder shall not be assigned, delegated or
otherwise transferred, by Buyer or by Seller; provided, however, that Buyer may
assign its right to purchase the Purchased Assets to one or more of its
Affiliates, but in no event will such assignment relieve Buyer of its
obligations hereunder.

                  Section 10.6. Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including all
Schedules hereto) contains the entire agreement between the parties hereto with
respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements and
understandings, oral or written, with respect to such matters including the
financing proposal letter from RP to Seller, dated May 10, 2001 (which
incorporates by reference the proposal letter dated May 8, 2001 from RP to
Seller), the financing proposal letter from RP to Seller dated May 22, 2001 and
the transaction proposal letter from Fortress Investment Group LLC, RP and GSMC
to Seller dated June 19, 2001, except for the Confidentiality Agreements, each
of which will remain in full force and effect for the term provided for therein.

                  Section 10.7. Fulfillment of Obligations. Any obligation of
any party to any other party under this Agreement, which obligation is
performed, satisfied or fulfilled by an Affiliate of such party, shall be deemed
to have been performed, satisfied or fulfilled by such party.

                  Section 10.8. Parties in Interest; No Third Party
Beneficiaries. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon
the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.
Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any
Person other than Buyer and Seller, or their successors or permitted assigns,
any rights or remedies under or by reason of this Agreement.

                  Section 10.9. Schedules. The inclusion of any matter in any
Schedule to this Agreement shall be deemed to be an inclusion for all purposes
of this Agreement, to the extent that such disclosure is sufficient to identify
the section to which such disclosure is responsive, but inclusion therein not be
deemed to constitute an admission, or otherwise imply, that any such matter is
material or creates a measure for materiality for the purposes of this
Agreement. If, subsequent to the date of this Agreement and prior to the Closing
Date, an event occurs that renders untrue any representation or warranty of the
Seller (a "Subsequent Event"), the Seller shall promptly deliver to Buyer an
amended or supplemental Schedule (a "Subsequent Disclosure Schedule") which will
contain a description of the Subsequent Event. The existence of a Subsequent
Event which is disclosed on a Subsequent Disclosure Schedule shall not
constitute a breach by the Seller of any representations or warranties hereunder
or be taken into account in determining whether any condition precedents have
been satisfied or form a basis for any indemnification or other claim by the
Buyer hereunder, provided, however, that this Section 10.9 is not intended to
permit the Seller to alter or amend the representations and warranties as






                                       60

made herein as of the date of this Agreement and shall not cure the inaccuracy
thereof as of the date of this Agreement for any purpose under this Agreement.
The disclosure of any particular fact or item in any Schedule or Subsequent
Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed any admission as to whether the fact or
item is "material" or would constitute a "Material Adverse Effect."

                  Section 10.10. Counterparts. This Agreement and any amendments
hereto may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be
deemed to be an original by the parties executing such counterpart, but all of
which shall be considered one and the same instrument.

                                    EXHIBIT A

                              FORM OF HOLDBACK NOTE

                                                        Dated: [_____, __, 2001]

                  This promissory note (this "Note") is a duly authorized,
non-negotiable promissory note of NCS I LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company (the "Maker"), issued pursuant to, and subject to the provisions of, an
Asset Purchase Agreement, dated as of June 29, 2001 (the "Asset Purchase
Agreement"), between AMRESCO, INC., a Delaware corporation ("AMRESCO"), and the
Maker. Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined shall have the
meanings assigned to such terms in the Asset Purchase Agreement.

                  Subject to the provisions hereof and as set forth in the Asset
Purchase Agreement, the Maker, for value received, hereby promises to pay to the
order of AMRESCO, at such account as it shall designate in writing, the
Principal Amount (as defined below) on the Payment Date or Resolution Payment
Date (each as defined below), as applicable, or, if such date is not a Business
Day, on the next succeeding Business Day, and to pay simple interest on the
Payment Date at a rate per annum equal to the Prime Rate on the Principal
Amount. Simple interest at the Prime Rate shall accrue on the Principal Amount
outstanding from time to time, with all then accrued but unpaid interest being
payable on the Payment Date.

                  The principal amount of this Note shall initially be
Twenty-Five Million Dollars ($25,000,000) (the "Initial Principal Amount"). The
Initial Principal Amount shall be subject to decrease in accordance with the
terms of this Note, the Asset Purchase Agreement and the Related Documents. The
Initial Principal Amount as so decreased from time to time, is referred to
herein as the "Principal Amount". Subject to the last sentence of the next
paragraph, if at any time the Principal Amount shall be reduced to zero, this
Note shall immediately be deemed void, canceled, paid in full and satisfied as
of such date, and the Maker shall not be required for any reason to make any
further payments thereon.

                  The Maker shall have the right, but not the obligation, at its
sole election (which election shall be evidenced in writing and delivered to
AMRESCO in accordance with Section 10.12 of the Asset Purchase Agreement) to
satisfy any obligations of AMRESCO or any of its Subsidiaries due to the Maker
or any of its subsidiaries or Affiliates under or arising out of the Asset
Purchase Agreement or any other Related Document (collectively, the
"Obligations") by offsetting the amount due the Maker or any of its subsidiaries
or Affiliates in respect of any Obligation (any such amount, an "Election
Amount") against the obligations of the Maker under this Note. Upon the delivery
of notice of such written election to AMRESCO, the obligations of the Maker
under this Note and the Initial Principal Amount (for the first Offset, and
thereafter, the Principal Amount) shall be reduced by the amount of such
Election Amount. Any election by the Maker not to so offset any Obligation under
this Note shall not in any manner affect, limit or impair the right of the Maker
to demand payment or performance of such Obligation from AMRESCO or any of its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates. If it shall be finally determined in any Final
Determination (defined below) that the Maker's reduction of the Principal Amount
by any Election Amount (or any portion thereof) was wrongful, then the amount so
determined to have been wrongfully deducted from the Principal Amount shall be
restored to the Principal Amount



<PAGE>   71

as of the date of the wrongful reduction, and interest at the Prime Rate shall
be deemed to have accrued on such restored amount as if such wrongful reduction
had never occurred.

                  On the date that is the six-month anniversary of this Note
(the "Payment Date"), the Maker shall pay AMRESCO the (a) Principal Amount then
outstanding as of the Payment Date, less (b) the asserted or claimed value of
all outstanding Claims made by the Maker or its subsidiaries or Affiliates under
or in connection with the Asset Purchase Agreement or any other Related Document
(each such Claim, an "Outstanding Claim", and the amount so asserted or claimed
in respect thereof, a "Reserve Amount"), the resolution of which shall not have
been finally determined (such final determination, a "Final Determination") as
of the Payment Date and the amount of which shall not have been indefeasibly
offset by the Maker against and deducted by the Maker from the Principal Amount
or amounts owing by the Maker to AMRESCO under any of the Related Documents, in
either case prior to the Payment Date (with the amount representing the sum of
clauses (a) and (b) being referred to hereafter as the "First Payment Amount").
Upon payment of the First Payment Amount, the Principal Amount shall be reduced
by the First Payment Amount.

                  If at any time and from time to time after the Payment Date
any Outstanding Claim shall be resolved in a Final Determination and the amount
of such Outstanding Claim determined pursuant to the Final Determination shall
be less than the Reserve Amount with respect thereto, the Maker shall pay to
AMRESCO the Difference Amount (as defined below) on the tenth Business Day after
the date the Maker first receives written notice of such Final Determination
(each such tenth Business Day, a "Resolution Payment Date"), and the Principal
Amount shall be reduced by such Difference Amount. The term "Difference Amount"
shall mean, with respect to each Outstanding Claim the resolution of which is
resolved in a Final Determination after the Payment Date, the lesser of (a) the
excess, if any, of (i) the Reserve Amount for such Claim over (ii) the amount of
such Outstanding Claim determined pursuant to the Final Determination, and (b)
the outstanding Principal Amount as of the relevant Resolution Payment Date.

                  To the extent that the Maker determines in its reasonable good
judgment that the amount held in the Trust Account established pursuant to
Section 6.17 of the Asset Purchase Agreement is insufficient to pay in full all
Group Tax Liabilities, then the Maker may, at its option, pay any amounts due
hereunder into such Trust Account.

                  Payments under this Note to the various entities constituting
AMRESCO shall be allocated among such entities in the same proportions as the
Purchase Price is allocated among such entities pursuant to the Asset Purchase
Agreement. Any such entity shall be permitted to assign its interest in this
Note to any other such entity or to any Retained Subsidiary, provided that the
assignor and any assignee shall remain subject to the terms of this Note and the
Maker's defenses and rights (including, without limitation, offset rights)
hereunder.

                  The undersigned may prepay all or any portion of the Principal
Amount of this Note at any time and from time to time without premium or
penalty.

                  This Note shall terminate, and be deemed canceled and
satisfied and be of no further force or effect, immediately if at any time the
Principal Amount shall be reduced to zero



                                      -2-

and in addition immediately upon the last to occur of the following (A) the
first date on which all Outstanding Claims shall have been resolved pursuant to
a Final Determination, or (B) the date the Maker shall have satisfied in full
its obligation to pay in full any First Payment Amount and Difference Amounts,
together with any accrued interest thereon.

                  Any other provision contained herein or in the Asset Purchase
Agreement or any other Related Document notwithstanding, the obligations
hereunder and under the Asset Purchase Agreement or any other Related Document
of the Maker and/or any of its subsidiaries and Affiliates are subject to, and
the Maker and such subsidiaries and Affiliates shall have the benefit of, all
defenses, counterclaims, rights of offset or recoupment or other claims and
rights (collectively, "Offsets") which the maker and/or such subsidiaries and
Affiliates may have at any time against AMRESCO or any transferee or assignee of
AMRESCO's rights as against the maker or its subsidiaries or Affiliates or any
part thereof or interest therein, whether the claim or right of the Maker or
such subsidiary or Affiliate relied upon for such purpose is matured or
unmatured, contingent or otherwise, and no transfer or assignment of this Note
or other obligation of the Maker or such subsidiary or Affiliate, or of any
rights in respect thereof, shall affect or impair the availability to the Maker
or any such subsidiary or Affiliate of the Offsets.

                  THIS NOTE SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE
WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF TEXAS.

                  IN WITNESS WHEREOF, NCS I LLC has caused this Note to be duly
executed as of the date set forth below.
