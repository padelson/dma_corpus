2.2.11. Each of the Seller, Company and its Subsidiaries, the Purchaser and

Company or any of its subsidiaries is obligated pursuant to the Credit
Agreements or any Person to whom Transaction Expenses are paid, such amounts
as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under any provision of applicable Legal Requirements. If the Seller,
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the Purchaser or the Escrow Agent, as

Agent, as the case may be, made such deduction and withholding, and such

delivered to the Purchaser a certificate signed by an executive officer of the
Company attaching: (a) a statement setting forth the Company's good faith
estimate of the Closing Working Capital (including each component item thereof
as set forth on the Form Working Capital Statement) (the "Estimated Closing
Working Capital"), together with such schedules and data with respect to the
determination of the Estimated Closing Working Capital as may be appropriate
to support such calculation of Estimated Closing Working Capital; (b) a
statement setting forth the Company's good faith estimate of Closing Cash
("Estimated Closing Cash"); (c) the Company's good faith estimate of the
Closing Indebtedness (the "Estimated Closing Indebtedness"), including the
Persons to whom such Closing Indebtedness is owed and a designation of whether
such Closing Indebtedness is to be repaid at the Closing, together with a
customary pay-off letter for any such Closing Indebtedness which is to be
repaid at the Closing (which includes wire instructions from each such Person
to whom a repayment of such Closing Indebtedness is to be made); (d) in the
case of the Indebtedness under the Credit Agreements, customary releases of
Liens and other obligations thereunder; and (e) the Company's good faith
estimate of the Transaction Expenses (the "Estimated Transaction Expenses"),
and the Persons to whom such Transaction Expenses are owed, together with wire
instructions in the case of payments to be made at the Closing by wire

Section 2.4. Post-Closing Purchase Price Deliveries and Adjustments.

2.4.1. As soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date, but in no
event later than ninety (90) calendar days thereafter, the Purchaser shall
cause to be prepared and delivered to the Seller a certificate signed by the
Chief Executive Officer or the Chief Financial Officer of the Purchaser
setting forth its good faith calculation (the "Initial Calculation") of (a)
the Closing Working Capital (including each component item thereof as set
forth on the Form Working Capital Statement), (b) the Closing Cash, (c) the
Closing Indebtedness and (d) the Transaction Expenses, together with the
Purchaser's good faith calculation of the Adjustment Amount, including
customary supporting documentation. The Purchaser agrees that, following the
Closing through the date that the Adjustment Amount becomes final and binding
on the parties hereto in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, it will
not take any actions with respect to any accounting books, Records, policies
or procedures on which the Adjustment Amount is to be based or derived that
would impede, delay or change the determination of Adjustment Amount in the
manner and utilizing the methods required by this Agreement.

2.4.2. If the Seller disagrees in whole or in part with the Initial
Calculation, then within forty-five (45) calendar days after its receipt of
the Initial Calculation, the Seller shall notify the Purchaser of such
disagreement in writing (the "Notice of Disagreement"). Any such Notice of
Disagreement shall include a copy of



-17-

#25932618 v26

* * *





the Initial Calculation, marked to indicate those specific line items that are
in dispute (the "Disputed Line Items"), and shall be accompanied by the
Seller's calculation of each of the Disputed Line Items and the Seller's
revised calculation of the Closing Working Capital, the Closing Cash, the
Closing Indebtedness and the Transaction Expenses, as applicable, as well as
the Adjustment Amount, including customary supporting documentation, it being
understood that all items that are not Disputed Line Items shall be final,
binding and conclusive for all purposes hereunder. In the event that the
Seller does not provide a Notice of Disagreement within such forty-five (45)
calendar day period, the Seller shall be deemed to have accepted in full the
Initial Calculation as prepared by the Purchaser, which shall be final,
binding and conclusive for all purposes hereunder. To the extent the Seller
provides a Notice of Disagreement within forty-five (45) calendar days after
its receipt of the Initial Calculation, all Disputed Line Items shall be
resolved as provided below. The Purchaser and the Seller shall use all
commercially reasonable efforts for a period of twenty (20) calendar days
following the delivery of the Notice of Disagreement (or such longer period as
they may mutually agree in writing) to resolve any Disputed Line Items. If, at
the end of such twenty (20) day period, the Purchaser and the Seller are
unable to resolve such Disputed Line Items, then the New York City, NY office
of Deloitte LLP or, failing Deloitte LLP's willingness to so serve, such other
independent certified public accounting firm of recognized international
standing as may be mutually selected by the Purchaser and the Seller (the
"Arbitrator"), shall resolve any remaining Disputed Line Items in the manner
provided below. The Purchaser and the Seller will enter into reasonable and
customary arrangements for the services to be rendered by the Arbitrator under
this Section 2.4.2. The Arbitrator shall determine as promptly as practicable,
whether the Initial Calculation was determined in accordance with the
standards set forth in Section 2.4 and whether and to what extent (if any) the
Closing Working Capital, the Closing Cash, the Closing Indebtedness or the
Transaction Expenses, as applicable, as well as the Adjustment Amount, in each
case, as set forth in the Initial Calculation, requires adjustment, limiting
its review, however, only to the Disputed Line Items so submitted. The
Purchaser and the Seller shall instruct the Arbitrator not to assign a value
to any Disputed Line Item greater than the greatest value for such item
assigned to it by the Purchaser, on the one hand, or the Seller, on the other
hand, or less than the smallest value for such item assigned to it by the
Purchaser, on the one hand, or the Seller, on the other hand. The Purchaser
and the Seller shall each furnish to the Arbitrator such work papers and other
documents and information relating to the calculation of the Closing Working
Capital, the Closing Cash, the Closing Indebtedness, the Transaction Expenses
and the Adjustment Amount, and shall provide interviews and answer questions,
as such Arbitrator may reasonably request. The determination of the Arbitrator
shall be final, conclusive and binding on the parties. The date on which all
of the Closing Working Capital, the Closing Cash, the Closing Indebtedness,
the Transaction Expenses and the Adjustment Amount are finally determined in
accordance with this Section 2.4.2 is hereinafter referred as to the
"Determination Date." The fees and expenses of the Arbitrator shall be paid by
the Purchaser and the Seller in proportion to the dollar value of the Disputed
Line Items determined in favor of the other party. Each party shall be
responsible for its own costs and expenses incurred in connection with this
Section 2.4.



-18-

2.4.3. If the Adjustment Amount as finally determined is positive, then within
three (3) Business Days following the Determination Date, (a) the Purchaser
and the Seller shall provide a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent
to deliver the full Adjustment Escrow Amount to an account designated in
writing by the Seller, and (b) the Purchaser shall deliver by wire transfer of
immediately available U.S. Dollars to an account designated in writing by the
Seller an amount equal to the Adjustment Amount. If the Adjustment Amount as
finally determined is a negative number, then within three (3) Business Days
following the Determination Date, the Purchaser and the Seller shall provide a
joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent to (x) deliver an amount equal
to the Adjustment Amount from the Adjustment Escrow Amount to an account
designated in writing by the Purchaser, and (y) deliver the amount, if any,
equal to the positive difference between the Adjustment Escrow Amount and the
absolute value of the Adjustment Amount to an account designated in writing by
the Seller. If the Adjustment Escrow Amount is insufficient to pay the
Purchaser the full amount owing to it, the Purchaser and the Seller shall
promptly provide a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent to deliver to
the Purchaser from the Indemnity Escrow Account an amount equal to the
Adjustment Amount minus the Adjustment Escrow Amount.

2.4.4. The amount of any Adjustment Amount paid pursuant to Section 2.4.3
shall be deemed an adjustment to the Closing Payment.

are based on Company's Knowledge, matters, if any, of which the Seller first
acquires such knowledge after the date hereof. In the event that the changes
to the Company Disclosure Schedules resulting from such supplements and
amendments give rise to a Company Material Adverse Effect or the failure of

may either (i) terminate this Agreement without liability to any party hereto
as set forth in the next succeeding sentence, or (ii) not so terminate this

the Seller or the failure of the conditions set forth in Sections 9.2.2(a)(ii)
or 9.3.1(a) (which would otherwise exist absent such supplements and

sought by the Purchaser under Article XI, to the extent the breach or failure

their reasonable best efforts to cause the conditions to Closing set forth in
Article IX to be satisfied as soon as reasonably practicable after the date

filed by such other parties as described in clauses (i) and (ii) above. The

to be taken, all actions necessary to cause the expiration or termination of
the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act and to obtain all other

connection with all Proceedings related to the foregoing in this Section 7.7.3

Representatives during normal business hours, such Records as is reasonably
requested by the Seller, including for the preparation and filing of any Tax
Returns, reports or forms or the defense of any Tax or other Claim or

-50-

#25932618 v26

* * *





Company; and provided, further, however, that the Seller shall pay the
reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company to provide such access
and cooperation.

Section 8.2. Further Assurances After Closing. If, at any time after the
Closing, any party reasonably determines that further action is necessary to
effectuate the transactions contemplated hereby in accordance with the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, the other parties shall take or cause to be

file, or cause to be executed, delivered and filed, all such documentation as

related to this Agreement, the Transaction Documents or the transactions

Section 8.3. Employee Matters.

8.3.1. For a period of twelve (12) months after the Closing Date, with respect
to employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries who are employed by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries on the Closing Date (the "Continuing
Employees"), the Company shall and shall cause the applicable employer (the
"Continuing Employer") to, and the Purchaser shall cause each Continuing
Employer to, take all action necessary to provide that each Continuing
Employee's compensation and benefits shall be on terms and conditions
substantially comparable in the aggregate to the compensation and benefits
(exclusive of any equity-based compensation) applicable to such Continuing
Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date; provided, however, that
nothing herein is intended to limit the right of the Company or Continuing
Employer to terminate the employment of any Continuing Employee.

8.3.2. The Company shall and shall cause each other Continuing Employer to,
and the Purchaser shall cause each Continuing Employer to, recognize all
accrued but unused vacation and sick pay of the Continuing Employees as of the
Closing Date. For purposes of eligibility and vesting under the employee
benefit plans of the Purchaser or Continuing Employer and their respective
Affiliates providing benefits to any Continuing Employees after the Closing
Date (the "New Plans"), and for purposes of accrual of vacation and other paid
time off and severance benefits under applicable New Plans, each Continuing
Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with the Seller as
reflected on the information set forth on Section 5.15 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, the Company and any of its Subsidiaries (and any
additional service with any predecessor employer) before the Closing Date, to
the same extent as such Continuing Employee was entitled, before the Closing
Date, to credit for such service under any similar Benefit Plan to the fullest
extent permitted by Legal Requirements. In addition, and without limiting the
generality of the foregoing: (i) each Continuing Employee shall be immediately
eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to
the extent coverage under such New Plan replaces coverage under a comparable
Benefit Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated immediately



-51-

#25932618 v26

* * *





before the replacement; and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing
medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Continuing
Employee, the Company shall and shall cause each other Continuing Employer to,
and the Purchaser shall cause each Continuing Employees to, waive all pre-
existing condition exclusions of such New Plan for such Continuing Employee
and his or her covered dependents, and the Company shall and shall cause each
other Continuing Employer to, and the Purchaser shall cause each Continuing
Employer to, cause any eligible expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee
and his or her covered dependents under a Benefit Plan during the portion of
the plan year of the New Plan ending on the date such Continuing Employee's
participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account
under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and
maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Continuing Employee and
his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts
had been incurred under and in accordance with such New Plan.

8.3.3. Immediately following the Closing, the Seller shall the transfer of the
Continuing Employees' health-care and dependent-care spending accounts
balances (determined as of the Closing Date) under the Seller's flexible
spending account plan to Purchaser's or Continuing Employer's flexible
spending account plan. On and after the date of such transfer, Purchaser's or
Continuing Employer's flexible spending account plan shall be responsible for
reimbursement of eligible health-care and dependent-care expenses incurred
during the 2014 calendar year by Continuing Employees and their respective
eligible spouses and dependents (to the extent such expenses have not
previously been reimbursed under the Seller's flexible spending account plan).
If the sum of the claims reimbursed to or claimed for reimbursement by a
Continuing Employee in respect of the 2014 calendar year exceeds the amount of
the Seller's flexible spending account plan balance for such Continuing
Employee as of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall transfer to the Sellers on
the Closing Date an amount equal to such excess. Purchaser or Continuing
Employer, as applicable, shall honor and administer each Continuing Employee's
payroll deduction elections existing in connection with the Seller's flexible
spending account plan, as in effect as of the Closing Date. On or prior to the
Closing Date, the Seller will provide Purchaser with true and accurate copies
of payroll deferral elections, claims histories and such other Records as may
be reasonably necessary for Purchaser or Continuing Employer, as applicable,
to administer the Continuing Employees' claims with respect to the remainder
of calendar year 2014.

8.3.4. The Purchaser shall provide, or cause to be provided, to any current or
former employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries (and such individual's
"qualified beneficiaries" within the meaning of Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title
I of ERISA and Section 4980B of the Code ("COBRA")) whose "qualifying event"
(within the meaning of COBRA) occurs after the Closing Date with COBRA
continuation coverage.

8.3.5. The Seller shall take all reasonable actions to permit each Continuing
Employee to effect a "direct rollover" (within the meaning of Section
401(a)(31) of the Code) of his or her account balances (including any notes
associated with plan loans) under any Benefit Plan that is a defined
contribution plan intended to qualify under



-52-

#25932618 v26

* * *





Section 401(a) of the Code, including a qualified cash or deferred arrangement
under Section 401(k) of the Code (the "Seller 401(k) Plan"), in accordance
with applicable Legal Requirements, to a defined contribution plan that
includes a qualified cash or deferred arrangement within the meaning of
Section 401(k) of the Code maintained by the Purchaser (the "Buyer 401(k)
Plan"), including the establishment of a Buyer 401(k) Plan to receive any
direct rollovers. The Purchaser shall cause the Buyer 401(k) Plan to accept a
direct rollover of a Continuing Employee's account balance (including any
notes associated with plan loans) from the Seller 401(k) Plan if such rollover
is elected in accordance with applicable Legal Requirements by such Continuing
Employee.

8.3.6. Nothing contained herein, express or implied: (i) shall be construed to
establish, amend, or modify any benefit plan, program, agreement or
arrangement, (ii) shall alter or limit the ability of the Company and its
Subsidiaries to amend, modify or terminate any particular benefit plan,
program, agreement or arrangement that they maintain or contribute to, or
(iii) is intended to confer upon any individual (including employees,
retirees, or dependents or beneficiaries of employees or retirees) any right
as a third party beneficiary of this Agreement.

Section 8.4. Confidentiality.

8.4.1. For a period of six (6) years following the Closing Date, each of the
Purchaser, the Seller, the Company and its Subsidiaries will, and will cause
their Affiliates to, treat and hold as confidential the purchase price for the
Shares herein and all of the Confidential Information of the other party, and
refrain from using or disclosing any of the Confidential Information, except
(i) to consummate the transaction, (ii) to satisfy any obligations pursuant to
this Agreement or any other Transaction Document, (iii) with respect to
investigating, defending or prosecuting Claims (whether pursuant to a
Proceeding or otherwise) brought in connection with this Agreement, the
transactions contemplated hereby, the Assets or the Business pursuant to
Article XI or otherwise, (iv) to any employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, in the course of performing his or her normal duties as an
employee, or (v) for any disclosure to any lender of the Seller or any of its
Affiliates; provided, however, each of the Equity Sponsors may disclose such
information under customary confidentiality obligations to its investors and
co-investors, to its Representatives and to comply with Legal Requirements and
the requirements of self-regulatory agencies applicable to the operation of
their respective businesses. In the event that a party is requested or
required (by oral question or request for information or documents in any
legal proceeding, interrogatory, subpoena, civil investigative demand or
similar process) to disclose any such Confidential Information, to the extent
permitted to do so by Legal Requirement, such party will notify the other
party promptly of the request or requirement so that the other party may seek
an appropriate protective order or waive compliance with the provisions of
this Section 8.4.1 and at the request of the other party, will cooperate with
respect to the other party's attempts, if any, to limit the scope of
disclosure or to obtain other assurance that confidential treatment will be
accorded to such portion of the Confidential Information required to be
disclosed as the other party designates; provided, further, that the
requesting party shall pay all of the non-requesting party's out-of-pocket
costs incurred in connection



-53-

#25932618 v26

* * *





with such cooperation. If, in the absence of a protective order or the receipt
of a waiver hereunder, a party is, on the advice of counsel, compelled to
disclose any Confidential Information, that party may disclose the requested
information.

8.4.2. The parties acknowledge that their obligations under this Section 8.4
are of a special, unique and extraordinary character, that they are reasonably
related to the legitimate business interests of the parties, and that a
failure to perform any such obligation or a violation of such obligations
under this Section 8.4 would cause irreparable harm to the other party, the
amount of which may not be readily ascertainable and for which adequate
compensation could not be fashioned. Accordingly, each party agrees that the
other party will have the right, without the need to prove irreparable injury
or to post bond, to seek an injunction against any breach or threatened breach
of this Section 8.4 by either party, as well as the right to pursue any and
all other rights and remedies available at law or in equity.

Section 8.5. Indemnification; Insurance.

8.5.1. For a period of six (6) years following the Closing, the Company and
the Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Company's Subsidiaries to, indemnify,
defend and hold harmless, and also advance expenses as incurred, in each case,
to the fullest extent permitted under Legal Requirements, to each Person who
is now or has been prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the
Closing an officer, director or manager (or their non-U.S. equivalent) of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the "Indemnified Persons") from and
against all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses (including counsel fees
and expenses), settlement payments or liabilities arising out of or in
connection with any claim, Proceeding or investigation based in whole or in
part on or arising in whole or in part out of the fact that such Person is or
was an officer, director or manager of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
whether or not such claim, Proceeding or investigation, as applicable, is
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Closing; provided, however, the
Person to whom such expenses are advanced provides a customary unsecured
undertaking to the Company to repay such advances if it is ultimately
determined that such Person is not entitled to indemnification. The parties
hereto intend, to the extent not prohibited by Legal Requirement, that the
indemnification provided for in this Section 8.5 shall apply without
limitation to acts or omissions, other than illegal acts or acts of fraud, or
alleged acts or omissions, other than illegal acts or acts of fraud, by the
Indemnified Persons in their capacities as officers, directors or managers, as
the case may be.

8.5.2. For a period of six (6) years following the Closing, the Purchaser
shall not, and shall not permit the Company or its Subsidiaries to amend,
repeal or otherwise modify any provision in any of their respective
Organizational Documents, in each case relating to the exculpation or
indemnification of any managers, officers and/or directors (unless required by
applicable Legal Requirement), where such amendment results in coverage less
favorable to the coverage offered to the managers, directors and officers on
the date of this Agreement, it being the intent of the parties that the
managers,



-54-

#25932618 v26

* * *





officers and directors of the Company and its Subsidiaries shall continue to
be entitled to such exculpation and indemnification to the fullest extent of
Legal Requirements.

8.5.3. The Purchaser and the Company hereby acknowledge that the Indemnified
Persons may have certain rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses
and/or insurance provided by the Equity Sponsors (the "Sponsor Indemnitors").
The Purchaser and the Company each hereby agrees, on behalf of itself and, in
the case of the Company, its Subsidiaries, (i) that it is an indemnitor of
first resort (i.e., its obligations to each of the Indemnified Persons are
primary and any obligation of the Sponsor Indemnitors to advance expenses or
to provide indemnification for the same expenses or liabilities incurred by or
on behalf of any of the Indemnified Persons are secondary), (ii) that it shall
be required to advance the full amount of expenses incurred by or on behalf of
each of the Indemnified Persons and shall be liable for the full amount of all
Losses to the extent legally permitted and as required by the terms of this
Agreement (or, to the extent applicable, its Organizational Documents),
without regard to any rights such Indemnified Persons may have against the
Sponsor Indemnitors, and (iii) that it irrevocably waives, relinquishes and
releases the Sponsor Indemnitors from any and all claims for contribution,
subrogation or any other recovery of any kind in respect thereof. The
Purchaser and the Company each further agrees that no advancement or payment
by the Sponsor Indemnitors on behalf of an Indemnified Person with respect to
any claim for which an Indemnified Person has sought indemnification from the
Purchaser, the Company or any of the Company's Subsidiaries shall affect the
foregoing. and the Sponsor Indemnitors shall have a right of contribution
and/or be subrogated to the extent of such advancement or payment to all of
the rights of recovery of an Indemnified Person against the Purchaser, the
Company or any of the Company's Subsidiaries. The Purchaser, the Company and
each of the Indemnified Persons agrees that the Sponsor Indemnitors are
express third party beneficiaries of the terms of this Section 8.5.3.

8.5.4. The Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Company to, cooperate, and
cause each of their respective Affiliates to cooperate, in the defense of any
claim that is subject to limitation of liability, advancement of expenses
and/or indemnification as contemplated by this Section 8.5 or the
Organizational Documents and shall provide access to properties and
individuals as reasonably requested and furnish or cause to be furnished
Records, information and testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery
proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals, as may be reasonably requested in
connection therewith.

8.5.5. The Purchaser shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to provide
or maintain in effect for a period of six (6) years from and after the Closing
Date, through the purchase of "run-off" coverage or otherwise, liability
insurance covering those individuals who are covered by the liability
insurance policy or policies provided for managers, directors and officers of
the Company and the Company's Subsidiaries as of the date hereof (the
"Existing Policies") on terms comparable and no less favorable in the
aggregate in all respects to the Existing Policies, and such coverage shall
contain minimum aggregate limits of liability at least equal to that of the
Existing Policies and deductibles no greater than those of the Existing
Policies;



-55-

#25932618 v26

* * *





provided, however, that if such "run-off" or other coverage is not available
at a cost not greater than three hundred percent (300%) of the annual premiums
paid as of the date hereof under the Existing Policies (the "Insurance Cap"),
then the Company and its Subsidiaries shall be required to obtain as much
coverage as is possible under substantially similar policies for such annual
premiums as do not exceed the Insurance Cap.

8.5.6. In the event that the Purchaser, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or any of their respective successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger,
or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
Person, then, and in each case, proper provision shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of the Purchaser or the Company, as the case may be,
honor the indemnification and other obligations set forth in this Section 8.5.

8.5.7. The provisions of this Section 8.5 are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person, his, her or its
respective heirs and his or her respective Representatives and are in addition
to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or
contribution that any such Person may have by Legal Requirement, Contract or
otherwise. The obligations of the Purchaser and the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries under this Section 8.5 shall not be terminated or modified in
such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Person to whom this
Section 8.5 applies without the consent of each affected Indemnified Person
(it being expressly agreed that such Persons to whom this Section 8.5 applies
shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section 8.5).

8.5.8. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or
shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors' and officers'
insurance claims or rights under any policy or Contract that is or has been in
existence with respect to the Company or any of the Company's Subsidiaries or
any of their respective directors or officers, it being understood and agreed
that the indemnification provided for in this Section 8.5 is not prior to or
in substitution for any such claims under such policies or Contracts.

Section 8.6. Seller Bonuses. The Purchaser acknowledges that at or after the
Closing certain of the Continuing Employees may become eligible to receive a
cash bonus from the Seller (each, a "Seller Bonus" and collectively, the
"Seller Bonuses"), and that it will cooperate with the Seller in order to pay
such Seller Bonuses. In connection with the foregoing, if the Seller notifies
the Purchaser that it is required to pay a Seller Bonus to any Continuing
Employee, then the Company shall accept, and the Purchaser shall cause the
Company to accept, from the Seller a transfer of funds in such amount as the
Seller shall so determine to enable the Company to pay the full amount of any
such Seller Bonuses, plus the employer portion of any withholding Taxes
related to such Seller Bonuses. Within five (5) Business Days of its receipt
of such notice, the Company shall provide the Seller with wire payment
instructions to deposit the necessary funds. Promptly upon the Company's
receipt of such funds, but in no event later than the first regularly
scheduled payroll cycle after the date of receipt, the Company shall cause to
be paid, and



-56-

#25932618 v26

* * *





the Purchaser shall cause the Company to cause to be paid, to each recipient
of a Seller Bonus, as designated by the Seller, the amount of such recipient's
Seller Bonus; provided, that, all payments to such recipients pursuant to this
Section 8.6 shall be net of all applicable withholding Taxes in accordance
with Section 2.2.3, and the Company shall deliver to the applicable Tax
Authorities, the appropriate amount of Taxes so withheld, including the
employer portion of any payroll, social security, unemployment or similar
Taxes, as and when required by applicable Legal Requirement. The Seller
acknowledges that the Company shall act only as the paying agent of the Seller
with respect to the payment of any Seller Bonus pursuant to this Section 8.6
and not in its own capacity, and as such is not assuming any obligations or
liabilities associated with the Seller Bonuses, including without limitation
the employer portion of any payroll, social security, unemployment or similar
Taxes imposed on such bonuses, except as expressly provided in this Section
8.6.

Section 8.7. Amendments to the RandW Insurance Policy. Promptly after it is
received by Purchaser, Purchaser shall deliver a copy of the RandW Insurance
Policy to Seller. From and after the issuance of the RandW Insurance Policy, the
Purchaser shall not (and shall cause its Affiliates to not) amend, modify,
terminate or waive any waiver of subrogation set forth in the RandW Insurance
Policy without the prior written consent of the Seller.

ARTICLE X 

TAX RELATED MATTERS

Section 10.1. Preparation of Tax Returns and Payment of Taxes.

10.1.9. The Seller shall prepare (or cause to be prepared), at Seller's cost
and expense, all Tax Returns of the Company and the Subsidiaries for all
periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date. Such Tax Returns shall be
prepared in a manner consistent with past practices of the Company and its
Subsidiaries. The Seller shall provide the Purchaser with a copy of any such
Tax Return at least twenty (20) Business Days prior to the date such Tax
Return is due for the Purchaser's review. The Seller shall make revisions to
any such Tax Return as reasonably requested by the Purchaser. In the event
there is a disagreement as to whether revisions requested by the Purchaser
should be included in any such Tax Return, the disagreement shall be submitted
to the Arbitrator for resolution (the expenses of which shall be shared in a
manner similarly to that set forth in Section 2.4.2). Seller shall submit such
Tax Returns as finally prepared (including the resolution of the Arbitrator,
if applicable) to the Company and its Subsidiaries for filing and the Company
and the Subsidiaries shall file such Tax Returns as so prepared.

10.1.10. The Purchaser shall prepare (or cause to be prepared), at its cost
and expense, all Tax Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries for all
Straddle Periods. Such Straddle Period Tax Returns shall be prepared in a
manner consistent with past practices of the Company and its Subsidiaries. The
Purchaser shall provide the Seller with a copy of any Straddle Period Tax
Return at least twenty (20) Business Days prior to the date such Tax Return is
due for the Seller's review. The Purchaser shall make revisions to any such
Tax Return as reasonably requested by the Seller. In the event there is a
disagreement as to whether revisions requested by the Seller should be
included in any such Tax Return, the disagreement shall be submitted to the
Arbitrator for resolution (the expenses of which shall be shared in a manner
similarly to that set forth in Section 2.4.2). The Company and the
Subsidiaries shall file all Straddle Period Tax Returns as finally prepared
(including the resolution of the Arbitrator, if applicable).

Section 10.2. Amended Tax Returns/Refunds.

10.2.6. The Purchaser shall not, nor shall it permit or cause any of its
Affiliates, the Company or its Subsidiaries to, amend, file, refile, revoke or
otherwise



-61-

#25932618 v26

* * *





modify any Tax Return or Tax election of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries with respect to Tax periods that begin on or prior to the Closing
Date without prior written consent of the Seller, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

10.2.7. Subject to the last sentence of this Section 10.2.2, any refunds, net
of Taxes to the Company and its Subsidiaries on such refunds, and any interest
thereon, of Taxes received by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or
benefit of crediting an overpayment of Taxes and any interest thereon) that
relate to a period (or a portion of a period) that begins on or prior to the
Closing (excluding any refund or credit attributable to any loss in a Tax year
(or portion of a Straddle Period) beginning after the Closing Date applied
(e.g., as a carryback) to income in a Tax year (or portion of a Straddle
Period) ending on or before the Closing Date) shall be owned by and delivered
to the Seller within 30 days of receipt of such refund (or benefit of such
crediting), unless the refund or benefit was accrued as a current asset in
calculating the Adjustment Amount. Any loss, credit or other item that may be
carried back from a taxable year to prior taxable years shall be so carried
prior to being carried forward and no party shall permit or cause any ability
to carry back to be waived. The Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall, upon
the written request of Seller, file or cause to be filed any Tax Return or
other filing necessary to obtain any such refund (and Seller shall pay all
costs and expenses associated therewith). Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, in the event that a Tax refund is subsequently
determined by any Governmental Entity to be less than the amount paid by
Purchaser to the Seller, Seller shall promptly return any such disallowed
amounts (plus any interest in respect to such disallowed Tax refunds owed by a
Governmental Entity) to Purchaser.

10.2.8. Until such time as the DCL Elections are accepted by the Internal
Revenue Service and all funds in the Amended Tax Return Escrow Account are
released, the Company shall file its U.S. federal income tax returns in a
manner which is consistent with it having made the DCL Elections.

Section 10.3. Cooperation. The Purchaser and the Seller shall, and shall each
cause their respective Affiliates to, provide the other with such cooperation
and information, as and to the extent reasonably requested, in connection with
the filing of any Tax Return, determining liability for Taxes, or in
conducting any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes.
Such cooperation and information shall include providing copies of all
relevant portions of relevant Tax Returns and related documents, and making
its employees available, to the extent reasonably requested.

Section 10.4. Transfer Taxes. The Purchaser shall be responsible for all
transfer, sales, use, real property transfer, recording, documentary, stamp,
registration, stock transfer and other similar Taxes and fees imposed in
respect of the purchase and sale of the Shares (collectively, "Transfer
Taxes"), and the Purchaser, with the cooperation of Seller, shall file all Tax
Returns and other documentation related thereto.

Section 10.5. Straddle Periods. For purposes of this Agreement, in the case of
any period that includes but does not end on the Closing Date (a "Straddle
Period"), the amount of any Taxes of the Company or its Subsidiaries not based
upon or measured



-62-

#25932618 v26

* * *





by income or gain, proceeds, receipts, activities, expenses (e.g., payroll
Taxes) or transactions for the Pre-Closing Tax Period will be deemed to be the
amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of days in the taxable period ending on the
Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in such
Straddle Period. The amount of any other Taxes for a Straddle Period that
relate to the Pre-Closing Tax Period will be determined based on an interim
closing of the books as of the close of business on the Closing Date (and for
such purposes, the taxable period of any partnership or pass-through entity in
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries holds a beneficial interest shall
be deemed to terminate at such time), provided, however, that any item
determined on an annual or periodic basis (such as deductions for depreciation
or real estate Taxes) shall be apportioned on a daily basis. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, all Taxes attributable to income includable under Code Section
951 with respect to the operations and activities of the Company's foreign
Subsidiaries for the Pre-Closing Tax Period included in the last Straddle
Period beginning prior to the Closing Date shall be included in the portion of
the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date, even if such income is
includable after the Closing Date. Notwithstanding anything else in this
Section 10, the Purchaser and the Seller agree that payments made with respect
to Closing Indebtedness, Transaction Expenses and Transaction Bonuses, to the
extent such payments give rise to Tax deductions, Tax losses and Tax credits
or otherwise may offset taxable income or Tax under applicable law, shall, to
the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, be considered to arise in the
taxable period (or portion thereof) ending on the Closing Date and the
provisions of this Agreement shall be interpreted and applied in a manner
consistent therewith. For the avoidance of doubt, any Tax refund with respect
to a taxable period beginning after the Closing Date, or the portion of the
Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Date, shall be for the benefit of
the Buyer, even if attributable to a loss or other tax attribute arising in a
Pre-Closing Tax Period, or the portion of a Straddle Period ending on the
Closing Date.

Section 10.6. Closing Date Items/No 338 Election. None of the Purchaser, the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall cause or permit to be made any
extraordinary transaction or event after the Closing on the Closing Date that
is not contemplated by this Agreement that would result in any increased Tax
liability for which Seller would be required to provide indemnification
pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise pay. None of the Purchaser, the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall cause or permit to be filed any
election under Section 338 of the Code in connection with the purchase and
sale of the Shares pursuant to this Agreement. None of the Purchaser, the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall cause or permit to be filed any
election to change the Tax status of any of the Company or its Subsidiaries
with respect to any taxable period or portion thereof ending on or before the
Closing Date.

Section 10.7. Characterization of Indemnity Payments. All payments made
pursuant to indemnifications obligations under Article XI shall be deemed, for
Tax purposes, to be an adjustment to the Purchase Price, to the extent
permitted by Legal Requirement.

Section 10.8. Tax-Sharing Agreements. All agreements the principal purpose of
which is Tax sharing or Tax allocation of the Company and its Subsidiaries
shall be terminated as of the Closing Date and, after the Closing Date, the
Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be bound thereby or have any liability
thereunder.

and all U.S. federal income Taxes assessed by the Internal Revenue Service and
finally determined to be due and payable which result from the Company not

ended December 31, 2010, December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2012 (the "DCL
Years") the DCL Elections (the "DCL Taxes"). Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary, the Indemnity Escrow Fund shall not be available to indemnify the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties for any Losses involving Indemnified Taxes which
constitute DCL Taxes or for any breach of a representation or warranty
relating to DCL Taxes, the DCL Elections or the DCL Returns.

11.1.12. From and after the Closing Date, subject to the terms, conditions and
limitations set forth in this Agreement, the Seller hereby agrees to indemnify

Purchaser, in the case of indemnification sought by any Seller Indemnified
Party, or give to Seller, in the case of indemnification sought by any
Purchaser Indemnified Party, including with respect to a Third Party Claim, a
written notice describing in reasonable detail the facts giving rise to any

Party Claim as provided in Section 11.4.1. The Indemnifying Party
Representative at its sole expense may assume the defense thereof by notifying
the Indemnified Party in writing within thirty (30) days of it being notified
by the Indemnified Party of the existence of the Third Party Claim. Upon the
giving of such notice, the Indemnifying Party Representative will undertake,
conduct and control, through counsel of its own choosing and at its own
expense, the settlement or defense thereof and in which event the Indemnified

of counsel for such Indemnified Party, there is a reasonable likelihood of a
conflict of interest between the Indemnifying Party Representative and the
Indemnified Party, the reasonable fees and expenses of one counsel and one
local counsel, if applicable, to such Indemnified Party in connection with
such defense shall be subject to recovery pursuant to the indemnification
provided in this Article XI.

(b) The Indemnifying Party Representative shall have full right to enter into
any compromise or settlement that is dispositive of the matter involved;
provided, however, that except for the settlement of a Third Party Claim that
involves (i) no obligation of any Indemnified Party other than the payment of
money and, solely in the case of indemnification of the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties, is fully covered by the monies then remaining in the Indemnity Escrow
Account, and (ii) a release from all liability in favor of the Indemnified
Party, the Indemnifying Party Representative shall not settle or compromise
any Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified
Party. No Indemnifying Party Representative may consent to entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement in respect of a Third Party Claim that
does not include a release of the Indemnified Party from all liability in
respect of such Third Party Claim.

(c) If the Indemnifying Party Representative does not so assume control of
such defense, the Indemnified Party shall conduct and control such defense and
the Indemnified Party shall have full right to enter into any compromise or
settlement on its behalf that is dispositive of the matter involved; provided
that the Indemnifying Party Representative shall be entitled to a right to
participate in any such Claim or Proceeding at its own cost and expense and
approve any proposed settlements.

inaccuracy or misrepresentation of any representation or warranty referenced
in Section 11.1.1(a) or (ii) the amount of any Loss in connection with any
breach, inaccuracy or misrepresentation pursuant to this Article XI.

11.5.1. Insurance proceeds received and Tax benefits realized with respect to
a Loss shall not reduce the amount of any such Loss that is indemnifiable
pursuant to this Article XI.

Section 11.6. Mitigation. Except as otherwise provided herein, upon any
Indemnified Party becoming aware of any Claim as to which indemnification may
be sought by such Indemnified Party pursuant to this Article XI, an
Indemnified Party shall utilize all commercially reasonable efforts to
mitigate any Losses which may be subject to such Claim for indemnification.

Section 11.7. Exclusive Remedy. The remedies in this Article XI shall be the
exclusive remedies of the parties with respect to any and all matters covered
by this Agreement that arise after the Closing, except (i) for the remedies of
specific performance and injunctive or other equitable relief to the extent
expressly permitted elsewhere in this Agreement, and (ii) for the payment of
the Adjustment Amount, if any, which shall be governed solely by Section 2.4
above. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 11.7, no party
hereto shall be deemed to have waived any rights, claims, causes of action or
remedies against a party if and to the extent fraud is proven on the part of
such party.

expiration of the three (3) Business Day period described above in this
Section. The Company shall not amend, file, refile, revoke, modify or
supplement any DCL Return as originally filed without the prior written
consent of Seller. The Company shall promptly apprise Seller and Purchaser of
all communications from the Internal Revenue Service, including notification
of receipt of the DCL Returns or DCL Elections. Should the Internal Revenue
Service contact or notify the Company with respect to any matter involving the
DCL Returns or the DCL Elections, or otherwise seek to engage in any
discussion or negotiation involving the DCL Returns or the DCL Elections,
including notifying the Company of any request for additional information with
respect thereto, then the Company shall so notify Seller and Purchaser within
two (2) Business Days follow its receipt of such contact or notice, and the
Company shall not take any action, including providing any additional
information, or otherwise engage in any such discussion or negotiation,
without the consent of Seller, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed, and the participation of Seller and its Representatives.

authorization. In connection with the foregoing, Seller will undertake,
conduct and control, through counsel and advisors of its own choosing and at
its own expense, the settlement or defense thereof and, in which event, to the
extent reasonably requested by Seller, the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall
cooperate with Seller in connection therewith; provided, that the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties may participate in such settlement or defense through
counsel and other advisors chosen by Purchaser and paid by Purchaser.



11.8.3 Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if requested by
Seller, the Company shall file powers of attorney, in such form as prescribed
by the Internal Revenue Service, naming one or more of Seller, Pepper Hamilton
LLP and Grant Thornton LLP as the Company's attorney-in-fact to handle all
matters with respect to the DCL Returns and DCL Elections, including (A)
responding to requests for information or (B) any claims or Proceedings that
are or may be brought by the Internal Revenue Service. As and when requested
by Seller, the Company shall promptly file additional powers of attorney with
the Internal Revenue Service naming such other Persons as its attorney-in-fact
with respect to the DCL Returns and DCL Elections. The Company shall not
revoke any powers of attorney previously filed with the Internal Revenue
Service, file any other powers of attorney with the Internal Revenue Service
or extend the statute of limitations, in each case with respect to the DCL
Returns and DCL Elections, without the prior written consent of Seller.



11.8.4 Seller shall have full right to enter into any compromise or settlement
that is dispositive of any claim or Proceeding brought by the Internal Revenue
Service with respect to the DCL Returns and the DCL Elections; provided,
however, that any such settlement that involves obligations on the part of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries other than the payment of money that is
fully covered by the monies in the Amended Tax Return Escrow Account, shall
require the prior written consent of Purchaser. Neither the Company nor any
Purchaser Indemnified Party may consent to entry of any judgment or enter into
any settlement in respect of a claim or Proceeding involving the DCL Returns
or the DCL Elections without the prior written consent of Seller.



11.8.5 The provisions of this Section 11.8 supersede in their entirety the
provisions of Section 11.4 of this Agreement with respect to the process of
indemnification of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties under Section 11.1.3 of
this Agreement.



Section 11.9. Disbursements From Amended Tax Return Escrow Amount. The
following provisions apply to disbursements from the Amended Tax Return Escrow
Amount:

11.9.1. On the date that is 121 days after the receipt by the Company of
notice from the Internal Revenue Service that the DCL Returns and the DCL
Elections relating to the DCL Years have been assigned for review, Purchaser
and Seller shall cause to be delivered to the Escrow Agent a duly executed
joint written direction, in the form attached to the Escrow Agreement,
authorizing the release to Seller of the



-69-

#25932618 v26

* * *





full amount of the Amended Tax Return Escrow Amount (the "Seller DCL
Direction"); provided, however, if the Internal Revenue Service requests an
extension of time to review such DCL Returns and such DCL Elections, then
Purchaser and Seller shall cause to be delivered to the Escrow Agent a duly
executed Seller DCL Direction on the date which is one (1) Business Day
following the date to which such review period is extended (provided if any
additional requests for extension have been made, the Seller DCL Direction
shall be delivered on the date which is one (1) Business Day following the
expiration of the latest extension); provided, further, notwithstanding the
foregoing, in any event, Purchaser and Seller shall cause to be delivered to
the Escrow Agent a duly executed Seller DCL Direction on the date which is one
(1) Business Day following the date that the Internal Revenue Service provides
written notice that the Company has reasonable cause to amend all of the DCL
Returns.

11.9.2. If the Internal Revenue Service provides written notice to the Company
that it does not have reasonable cause to file the DCL Elections and DCL
Returns for the DCL Years and, as a result thereof, additional Taxes are due
from the Company arising from the Company's failure to file a DCL Election at
the time it filed a particular DCL Return (the "IRS Tax Assessment") and, at
the time the Company receives the IRS Tax Assessment, there are funds in the
Amended Tax Return Escrow Account, then the amounts in the Amended Tax Return
Escrow Account shall be held by the Escrow Agent until there is a final
resolution of the IRS Tax Assessment in accordance with the provisions of
Section 11.8 above. Within two (2) Business Days following such final
resolution of the IRS Tax Assessment, Purchaser and Seller shall provide a
joint written direction to the Escrow Agent, in the form attached to the
Escrow Agreement, to deliver, by wire transfer of immediately available U.S.
Dollars, to the Seller or the Internal Revenue Service, the amounts to be
released in accordance with such resolution.



Section 11.10. Disbursements from the Indemnity Escrow Account. If any
Purchaser Indemnified Party is entitled to recover any amounts from the
Indemnity Escrow Account pursuant to this Agreement, then the Purchaser and
the Seller shall promptly provide a joint written instruction to the Escrow
Agent to deliver such amounts to the Purchaser (or any Person designated by
the Purchaser). If, at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date that is
eighteen (18) months after the Closing Date (the "Escrow Termination Date"),
there are any amounts remaining in the Indemnity Escrow Account, then the
Seller shall be entitled to receive such funds, and the Purchaser and the
Seller shall, within two (2) Business Days of such time, provide a joint
written instruction to the Escrow Agent to deliver such funds by wire transfer
of immediately available U.S. Dollars to an account designated by the Seller;
provided, however, that if prior to the Escrow Termination Date, the Seller
has received one or more notices which set forth Claims for indemnification
under Article XI for Losses (each, a "Claim Notice") that are unresolved on
the Escrow Termination Date, then an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the
amount of the aggregate Losses claimed in, and reasonably expected to be
incurred in connection with, each such unresolved Claim, or (ii) the amount
remaining in the Indemnity Escrow Account, shall continue to be held by the
Escrow Agent in the Indemnity Escrow Account to pay such claims and any other
amounts associated therewith that are payable pursuant



-70-

#25932618 v26

* * *





to Section 11.1.1Article XI; and provided further, from time to time promptly
after final resolution of each such Claim for indemnification, the Seller and
the Purchaser will authorize the Escrow Agent to disburse all amounts
remaining in the Indemnity Escrow Account to the Seller in the same manner as
described above, subject to the condition that if at such time there remains
unresolved any Claim for Losses described in any Claim Notice, an amount equal
to the lesser of (i) the amount of the aggregate Losses claimed in, and
reasonably expected to be incurred in connection with, each such Claim Notice
or (ii) the amount remaining in the Escrow Account, shall be maintained in the
Indemnity Escrow Account. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Notice of
Disagreement has been delivered pursuant to Section 2.4.2, and the matters set
forth therein remain unresolved as of the Escrow Termination Date, an amount
equal to the disputed amount shall continue to be held by the Escrow Agent in
the Indemnity Escrow Account to satisfy any Adjustment Amount (in excess of
the Adjustment Escrow Amount) pursuant to Section 2.4.3 until resolution of
such dispute pursuant to Section 2.4.2, upon which the Purchaser and the
Seller shall provide a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent to
deliver, by wire transfer of immediately available U.S. Dollars to the Seller,
the amounts to be released in accordance with such resolution.

Section 11.11. Disbursements from Section 11.1.4 Escrow Account. If any
Purchaser Indemnified Party is entitled to recover any amounts from the
Section 11.14 Escrow Account pursuant to this Agreement, then the Purchaser
and the Seller shall promptly provide a joint written instruction to the
Escrow Agent to deliver such amounts to the Purchaser (or any Person
designated by the Purchaser). If, at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the
date that is one (1) year after the Closing Date, there are any amounts
remaining in the Section 11.1.4 Escrow Account, then the Seller shall be
entitled to receive such funds, and the Purchaser and the Seller shall, within
two (2) Business Days of such time, provide a joint written instruction to the
Escrow Agent to deliver such funds by wire transfer of immediately available
U.S. Dollars to an account designated by the Seller; provided, however, that
if prior to such date, the Seller has received one or more Claim Notices
relating to the Section 11.1.4 Matters that are then unresolved, then an
amount equal to the lesser of (i) the amount of the aggregate Losses claimed
in, and reasonably expected to be incurred in connection with, each such
unresolved Claim, or (ii) the amount remaining in the Section 11.1.4 Escrow
Account, shall continue to be held by the Escrow Agent to pay such claims and
any other amounts associated therewith that are payable pursuant to Article
XI11.1.4; and provided further, from time to time promptly after final
resolution of each such Claim for indemnification, the Seller and the
Purchaser will authorize the Escrow Agent to disburse all amounts remaining in
the Section 11.1.4 Escrow Account to the Seller in the same manner as
described above, subject to the condition that if at such time there remains
unresolved any Claim for Losses described in any Claim Notice, an amount equal
to the lesser of (i) the amount of the aggregate Losses claimed in, and
reasonably expected to be incurred in connection with, each such Claim Notice
or (ii) the amount remaining in the Escrow Account, shall be maintained in the
Section 11.14 Escrow Account. Notwithstanding the foregoing, should there be a
settlement of the Section 11.1.4 Matters in accordance with Section 11.1.4 of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule, then the Purchaser and the Seller shall,
within two (2) Business Days of the date of such settlement, provide a joint
written instruction to the Escrow Agent to deliver such funds



-71-

#25932618 v26

* * *





by wire transfer of immediately available U.S. Dollars to such accounts of
such Persons as is appropriate to effect such settlement in accordance with
its terms, it being understood that amounts not paid to third parties pursuant
to such settlement shall be paid to the Seller.



ARTICLE XII 

TERMINATION, EXPIRATION

Section 12.1. Termination. This Agreement may be terminated prior to the
Closing as follows:

12.1.1. by mutual written consent of the Purchaser and the Seller authorized
by their respective boards of directors (or similar governing body) prior to
the Closing;

12.1.2. by the Purchaser to the extent it has a right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.5, and

12.1.3. by the Purchaser, on the one hand, or by the Seller, on the other
hand, if (i) any Governmental Entity shall have issued a final Governmental
Order restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting this Agreement and such
Governmental Order is or shall have become nonappealable, or (ii) the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement have not been consummated by 5:00
P.M., New York City time, on August 29, 2014 ("Outside Date"); provided,
however, that if as of the Outside Date the Closing shall not have occurred
solely by reason of the waiting periods applicable to the transactions
contemplated this Agreement under the HSR Act (or any similar foreign
competition Legal Requirements) having not yet expired, or been waived or
terminated by the applicable Governmental Entity, or the parties have not
received a Governmental Approval required by any foreign Legal Requirement,
then each of the Company and the Seller shall have the right to extend the
Outside Date for up to ninety (90) days in the aggregate for the sole and
exclusive purpose of permitting the satisfaction of such conditions, it being
understood and agreed that any other conditions which have been satisfied as
of the Outside Date, including the conditions set forth in Section 9.2.2 shall
be deemed to continue to be so satisfied through the Closing Date and any
certificates required to be delivered at the Closing, to the extent they were
to refer to the Closing Date shall, in lieu thereof, refer to the Outside
Date; provided, further, that neither the Purchaser nor the Seller may
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this clause (ii) if (x) such party's
failure (or any of its Affiliates shall have failed) to fulfill any of its
obligations under this Agreement shall have been the reason that the
transactions have not been consummated on or before the Outside Date, (y) the
other party has initiated Proceedings to specifically enforce this Agreement
while such Proceedings are still pending, or (z) on the Outside Date, the
other party has the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
12.1.4, or Section 12.1.5, as applicable.

12.1.4. by the Seller, if: (i) there shall have occurred a breach of any of
the Purchaser's representations or warranties contained in this Agreement and



-72-

#25932618 v26

* * *





where such breach would give rise to the failure of the Closing Conditions set
forth on Section 9.3.1 except that if such breach is capable of being remedied
by the Purchaser, it shall have continued unremedied until 5:00 p.m. New York
City time on the earlier of the Outside Date or the date which is thirty (30)
days after the Purchaser has received written notice from the Seller of the
occurrence of such breach; or (ii) the Purchaser shall have breached any of
such party's covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement to be
complied with or performed by it at or prior to the Closing where such breach
would give rise to the failure of the Closing Conditions set forth on Section
9.3.1 except that if such breach is capable of being remedied by the
Purchaser, it shall have continued unremedied until 5:00 p.m. New York City
time on the earlier of the Outside Date or the date which is thirty (30) days
after the Purchaser have received written notice from the Seller of the
occurrence at such breach; or

12.1.5. by the Purchaser, if: (i) there shall have occurred a breach of any of
the Seller's or the Company's representations or warranties contained in this
Agreement and where such breach would give rise to the failure of the Closing
Conditions set forth on Section 9.2.1, except that if such breach is capable
of being remedied by the Seller, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, it
shall have continued unremedied until 5:00 p.m. New York City time on the
earlier of the Outside Date or the date which is thirty (30) days after the
Seller and/or the Company has received written notice from the Purchaser of
the occurrence of such breach or (ii) the Seller or the Company shall have
breached any of such party's covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement to be complied with or performed by it at or prior to the Closing
where such breach would give rise to the failure of the Closing Conditions set
forth on Section 9.2.1 except that if such breach is capable of being remedied
by the Seller, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, it shall have continued
unremedied until 5:00 p.m. New York City time on the earlier of the Outside
Date or the date which is thirty (30) days after the Seller and/or the Company
have received written notice from the Purchaser of the occurrence at such
breach.

Section 12.2. Effect of Termination or Expiration of the Agreement. If this
Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section 12.1, this Agreement shall
become void and of no further force and effect, and none of the parties hereto
shall have any further rights against or obligations to any of the other
parties; provided, however, that if the Purchaser terminates this Agreement
pursuant to Section 12.1.5 or if the Seller terminates this Agreement pursuant
to Section 12.1.4, then the terminating party shall have the right to pursue
its remedies set forth in Article XI and this Article XII with respect to the
breach or breaches giving rise to such termination; and provided further,
however, that the provisions of Section 8.4 and this Section 12.2, Section
12.3, Article I and Article XIII shall survive any termination.

Section 12.3. Expenses. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each
party will bear its own expenses and costs incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, whether or not such
transactions will be consummated.

assigned (including by operation of law) by any party without the prior
written consent of the other parties; provided, however, the Purchaser may
assign its right to indemnification contained under Article XI of this
Agreement as collateral security for any financing that it is obtaining in
order to pay the Purchase Price so long as no such assignment expands or
otherwise adversely affects the rights or limitations applicable to the Seller
under Article XI; and provided, further, that the Seller may assign this
Agreement in connection with a change of control transaction involving the
Seller or its material Subsidiaries.

any time by the party hereto entitled to the benefit thereof by a written

Agreement shall not affect in any manner the right of such party to take such
action at any time in the future.

brought in an inconvenient forum, and (c) any defense that it may now or
hereafter have based on lack of personal jurisdiction in such forum. Each
party further agrees that service of process may be effected by mailing a copy

-75-

#25932618 v26

* * *





BY JURY IN ANY PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

Section 13.5. Personal Liability. None of the Seller, its direct or indirect
stockholders, members or other holders of Capital Stock of the Seller or any
of the Seller's or their respective officers, directors or Representatives
(collectively, the "Covered Persons") shall have any liability of any kind to
the Purchaser or any other Purchaser Indemnified Party, subject only to the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties' ability to bring indemnification claims
pursuant to Article XI, and this Agreement (including the provisions of
Article XI) shall not create, or be deemed to create or permit, any personal
liability or obligation on the part of such Covered Persons.

Section 13.6. No Third-Party Beneficiaries. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, except as set forth in Section 8.5, no provision of
this Agreement is intended to benefit any Person other than the signatories
hereto, nor shall any such provision be enforceable by any other Person.

Section 13.7. Severability. Any provision of this Agreement which is invalid
or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall be ineffective to the extent of
such invalidity or unenforceability without invalidating or rendering
unenforceable the remaining provisions hereof, and any such invalidity or
unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render
unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.

Section 13.8. Schedules and Exhibits. The parties hereto agree that the
Schedules and Exhibits attached hereto form an integral part of this
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement or in any Schedule attached hereto, information disclosed on one
Schedule shall be considered to be disclosure both with respect to the section
of this Agreement to which such information is directly responsive and to all
other sections of the Agreement to which it is reasonably apparent from the
face of such disclosure that such information is responsive. Certain
information disclosed on the Schedules is included solely for informational
purposes and may not be required to be disclosed pursuant to this Agreement.
The disclosure of any information in Schedules shall not be deemed to
constitute (a) an admission against interest, (b) an acknowledgment that such
information is required to be disclosed in connection with the representations
and warranties made by the Seller or the Company in this Agreement or that it
is material, nor (c) the establishment of a standard of materiality.

Section 13.9. Section Headings. All Section headings herein have been inserted
for convenience of reference only and shall in no way modify or restrict any
of the terms or provisions hereof.

Section 13.10. Contents of Agreement. This Agreement (including any Exhibits
and Schedules hereto), together with the Confidentiality Agreement, the
Guarantee and the Transaction Documents, collectively set forth the entire
understanding and agreement of the parties hereto with respect to the
transactions provided for herein



-76-

#25932618 v26

* * *





and therein, and shall not be amended or terminated except by a written
instrument duly executed by the parties hereto.

Section 13.11. Counterparts; Delivery. This Agreement may be executed in two
or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of
such counterparts, when taken together, shall constitute but one and the same
instrument. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page by
facsimile or other electronic transmission shall be as effective as delivery
of a manually executed counterpart.

Section 13.12. Mutual Drafting. The parties hereto have participated jointly
in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement; accordingly, in the event
an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement
shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties hereto, and no
presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party
hereto by virtue of the authorship of any provisions of this Agreement.

Section 13.13. Specific Performance. The parties hereby acknowledge and agree
that the failure of any party to perform its agreements and covenants
hereunder, including its failure to take all actions as are necessary on its
part to consummate the Closing in accordance with the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, will cause irreparable injury to the other parties, for which
damages, even if available, will not be an adequate remedy. Accordingly, each
party hereby consents to the issuance of injunctive relief by any court of
competent jurisdiction pursuant to Section 13.4.1 or to compel performance of
such party's obligations, and to the granting by any court of the remedy of
specific performance of its obligations hereunder or a temporary or
preliminary injunction, in each case, without any requirement that a bond be
posted.

Section 13.14. Publicity. No public release or announcement concerning the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be issued by a party without the prior
consent of the other party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld),
except such release or announcement as may be required by any Legal
Requirement or Governmental Order in which case the party required to make the
release or announcement shall, except where prohibited by applicable Legal
Requirement or Governmental Order, allow the other party reasonable time to
comment on such release or announcement in advance of such issuance and will
make such changes to such release or announcement as the commenting party
shall reasonably request. Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as required by
Legal Requirement or Governmental Order, in no event shall any release or
announcement disclose the Purchase Price or any component thereof or any
information which would enable Persons not associated with the transaction to
calculate the Purchase Price or any component thereof.

Section 13.15. No Conflict; Attorney-Client Privilege.

13.15.1. Each of the parties, on behalf of itself and their respective
Subsidiaries and Affiliates, (a) hereby confirms that no engagement that
Pepper Hamilton LLP has undertaken on behalf of the Seller, the Company, or
any of their



-77-

#25932618 v26

* * *





respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates will be asserted, following the Closing,
by any of the Purchaser, the Seller, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or Affiliates, either as a conflict of interest with respect to,
or as a basis to preclude, challenge or otherwise disqualify Pepper Hamilton
LLP from, any current or future representation of the Seller, the Company, or
any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, in any matter involving
this Agreement or any Transaction Document, or the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby, including any representations in negotiations,
transactions, counseling or litigation adverse to the Purchaser, the Seller,
the Company, or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, (b) hereby
waives any conflict of interest that exists on or prior to the Closing, or
that might be asserted to exist after the Closing, and any other basis that
might be asserted to preclude, challenge or otherwise disqualify Pepper
Hamilton LLP in any representation of the Seller, the Company, or any of their
respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, with respect to any such matter, and
(c) intends for the foregoing conflicts waiver to be effective and fully
enforceable and to be relied upon by Pepper Hamilton LLP.

13.15.2. Each of the Purchaser and the Company, on behalf of itself and its
Subsidiaries and Affiliates, agrees that, as to all communications among
Pepper Hamilton LLP and the Seller and its Subsidiaries (including the Company
and its Subsidiaries), that relate in any way to the negotiations with the
Purchaser in connection with this Agreement, the attorney-client privilege and
the expectation of client confidence belongs to the Seller and its direct and
indirect equity holders, and will not pass to or be claimed by the Purchaser,
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates or the insurance carrier
providing the RandW Insurance Policy. In the event that a dispute arises after
the Closing between the Purchaser, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on
the one hand, and a third party, on the other hand, the Purchaser, the Company
and its Subsidiaries shall notify the Seller if such third party seeks
disclosure of confidential communications by Pepper Hamilton LLP that fall
within the privilege that the Seller and its direct or indirect equity holders
have retained as described in this Section 13.15.2, the Seller or its
designee, on behalf of the holders of any such attorney-client privilege, in
its sole discretion, will direct the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
whether to assert the attorney-client privilege on its behalf, or whether to
waive such privilege, and if so directed to assert such privilege, the Company
and its Subsidiaries shall take such actions as reasonably requested by the
Person so directing.
