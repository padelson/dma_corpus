NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises set forth above, which are
incorporated in this Agreement as if fully set forth below, and the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this
Agreement, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the Parties hereto agree
as follows:

  



  

Article I 
  _THE SHARE EXCHANGE_

  



  

1.1  _Purchase and Sale of Shares_. At the Closing and subject to and upon
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Sellers shall sell, transfer,
convey, assign and deliver to the Purchaser, and the Purchaser shall purchase,
acquire and accept from the Sellers, all of the issued and outstanding shares
(being 20,000,000 shares of US$ 0.00000005 par value each) and other
equity interests in or of the Company (collectively, the " _Purchased Shares_
"), free and clear of all Liens (other than potential restrictions on resale
under applicable securities Laws).

  



  

1.2  _Consideration_. At the Closing and subject to and upon the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, in full payment for the Purchased Shares, the
Purchaser shall issue and deliver to the Sellers an aggregate of Twenty
Million (20,000,000) Purchaser Ordinary Shares (the " _Exchange Shares_ "),
less the Escrow Shares. Each Seller shall receive its pro rata share of the
Exchange Shares based on the percentage of Purchased Shares owned by such
Seller as compared to the total number of Purchased Shares owned by all
Sellers (such Seller's " _Pro Rata Share_ ").

  



  

1.3  _Escrow_. At or prior to the Closing, the Purchaser, the DT
Representative, the Seller Representative and the Escrow Agent shall enter
into an Escrow Agreement, effective as of the Closing, substantially in the
form attached as _Exhibit A_ hereto (the " _Escrow Agreement_ "), pursuant to
which the Purchaser shall cause to be delivered to the Escrow Agent from the
Exchange Shares otherwise deliverable at Closing Eight Million (8,000,000)
Purchaser Ordinary Shares (including any equity securities paid as dividends
or distributions with respect to such shares or into which such shares are
exchanged or converted, the " _Escrow Shares_ "), with the Escrow Shares,
along with any earnings thereon (excluding Accrued Dividends), to be held by
the Escrow Agent in a segregated escrow account (" _Escrow Account_ ") in
accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement. The portion of the Exchange Shares that shall be withheld at the
Closing for deposit in the Escrow Account shall be allocated among the Sellers
pro rata based on each Seller's Pro Rata Share. Each Seller shall have the
right to vote its portion of such Escrow Shares (based on its Pro Rata Share,
subject to adjustment for any Escrow Shares that are forfeited or earned in a
manner other than pro rata among all Sellers based on their Pro Rata Share)
during the time held in the Escrow Account as Escrow Shares. The Parties agree
that while any Escrow Shares are held in the Escrow Account, any dividends or
distributions made or otherwise payable on or in respect of such
Escrow Shares shall not be paid to the Escrow Account and shall instead be
held by Purchaser as Accrued Dividends in accordance with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement.

  



  

1.4  _Company Shareholder Consent_. Each Seller, as a shareholder of the
Company, hereby approves, authorizes and consents to the Company's execution
and delivery of this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents to which it is or
is required to be a party or otherwise bound, the performance by the Company
of its obligations hereunder and thereunder and the consummation by
the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. Each Seller
acknowledges and agrees that the consents set forth herein are intended and
shall constitute such consent of the Sellers as may be required (and shall, if
applicable, operate as a written shareholder resolution of the Company)
pursuant to the Company Charter, any other agreement in respect of the Company
to which any Seller is a party and all applicable Laws.

Article II 
  _EARN-OUT_

  



  

2.1  _Earn-Out_. The Escrow Property shall be held in the Escrow Account and,
subject to _Article VIII_ and this _Article II_ , will only be released to
the Sellers (along with the Accrued Dividends) in the event that the
Purchaser, the Company and their respective Subsidiaries meet certain minimum
performance requirements in accordance with this _Article II_. Subject to
_Article VIII_ and this _Article II_ , in the event that (i) the Adjusted Net
Income for the calendar year ended December 31, 2016 exceeds the 2016 Earn-
Out Target, (ii) the Adjusted Net Income for the calendar year ended December
31, 2017 exceeds the 2017 Earn-Out Target or (iii) the Adjusted Net Income
for the calendar year ended December 31, 2018 exceeds the 2018 Earn-
Out Target, the Sellers shall collectively be entitled to receive (each, an "
_Earn-Out Payment_ ") from the Escrow Account, in each case, one-third
(1/3rd) of the Escrow Shares, and from the Purchaser the Accrued Dividends on
such one-third (1/3rd) portion of the Escrow Shares, subject to maximum Earn-
Out Payments in the aggregate for all three calendar years 2016, 2017 and
2018 together (each such calendar year, an " _Earn-Out Year_ ", and such
three-year calendar period, the " _Earn-Out Period_ ") equal to the Escrow
Property plus the Accrued Dividends. In the event that the above Adjusted Net
Income targets are not met for any Earn-Out Year, the Sellers shall not
be entitled to receive any Earn-Out Payment for such Earn-Out Year and shall
forfeit any right to such Escrow Property and Accrued Dividends with respect
to such Earn-Out Year; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event that at the
end of the Earn-Out Period the average Adjusted Net Income per Earn-Out Year
for all three Earn-Out Years exceeds the Alternative Earn-Out Target (each of
the 2016 Earn-Out Target, the 2017 Earn-Out Target, the 2018 Earn-Out Target
and the Alternative Earn-Out Target, an " _Earn-Out Target_ "), the Sellers
shall collectively be entitled to receive all of the Escrow Property and
Accrued Dividends that they previously did not receive (such payment the "
_Alternative Earn-Out Payment_ ", with such Alternative Earn-Out Payment
considered an additional Earn-Out Payment). For the avoidance of doubt,
failure to qualify for an Earn-Out Payment in any Earn-Out Year during the
Earn-Out Period shall not prevent the Sellers from being able to
collectively receive an Earn-Out Payment in a subsequent Earn-Out Year during
the Earn-Out Period. If for any Earn-Out Year there is a final determination
in accordance with _Section 2.2_ that the Sellers are entitled to receive an
Earn-Out Payment for such Earn-Out Year or the Alternative Earn-Out Payment,
then within five (5) Business Days after such final determination, the
Purchaser, the DT Representative and the Seller Representative will provide
joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to release to the Sellers
Escrow Property from the Escrow Account (and Purchaser shall pay the Accrued
Dividends) in an aggregate amount (of Escrow Property and Accrued Dividends)
equal to (i) such Earn-Out Payment less (ii) the aggregate amount of any
indemnification claims by any Indemnified Parties under _Article VIII_ that
(A) are pending, (B) have been finally determined as due and owing but are
unpaid from the Escrow Account in accordance with _Article VIII_ or (C) have
been paid from the Escrow Account in accordance with _Article VIII_ but have
not previously been used to reduce the amount of any prior Earn-Out Payment,
with each Seller receiving its Pro Rata Share of such net Earn-Out Payment.
At the end of the Earn-Out Period, if there is any Escrow Property and/or
Accrued Dividends which the Sellers are not entitled to receive in accordance
with this _Article II_ , such Escrow Property and/or Accrued Dividends will
be forfeited by the Sellers and distributed to Purchaser from the Escrow
Account in the case of Escrow Property, or retained by the Purchaser, in the
case of Accrued Dividends, and within five (5) Business Days after a final
determination in accordance with _Section 2.2_ that at the end of the Earn-Out
Period there is such Escrow Property to which the Sellers are not entitled to
receive, the Purchaser, the DT Representative and the Seller Representative
will provide joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to release such
Escrow Property to the Purchaser. The Purchaser will cancel any Escrow Shares
distributed to the Purchaser from the Escrow Account promptly after its
receipt thereof and cancel any Accrued Dividends payable in respect of such
Escrow Shares. Each Seller acknowledges that such Seller's right to receive
the Escrow Shares, other Escrow Property and Accrued Dividends is contingent
based on the performance of the Purchaser, the Company and their
respective Subsidiaries for periods including those after the Closing as set
forth in this _Article II_ , and that if the requirements for the payment of
the Earn-Out Payments as set forth in this _Article II_ are not met in
accordance with the terms hereof, the Escrow Shares, the other Escrow
Property and the Accrued Dividends will not be paid or delivered to the
Sellers, and the Sellers shall have no right to receive such Escrow Shares,
other Escrow Property or Accrued Dividends.

2.2  _Determination of Earn-Out Payment_. As soon as practicable (but in any
event within twenty (20) days) after the completion of the audited
consolidated financial statements for the Purchaser and its Subsidiaries for
each Earn-Out Year, the Purchaser's Chief Financial Officer (the " _CFO_ ")
will prepare and deliver to the DT Representative and Seller Representative a
written statement (each, an " _Earn-Out Statement_ ") that sets forth the
CFO's determination in accordance with the terms of this _Article II_ of the
Adjusted Net Income for such Earn-Out Year based on such audited financial
statements, _Annex II_ and the Exchange Rate Acknowledgement, and whether the
Sellers are entitled to receive an Earn-Out Payment for such Earn-Out Year
(including giving effect to _Section 2.5_ ), and, for the last Earn-Out Year
in the Earn-Out Period, whether the Sellers are entitled to receive the
Alternative Earn-Out Payment (including giving effect to _Section 2.5_ ).
Each of the DT Representative and the Seller Representative will have thirty
(30) days after its receipt of an Earn-Out Statement to review it. To the
extent reasonably required to complete their respective reviews of such Earn-
Out Statement, the Purchaser and its Subsidiaries will provide each of the DT
Representative and the Seller Representative and their respective
Representatives with reasonable access to the books and records of the
Purchaser and its Subsidiaries, their respective finance personnel and any
other information that the DT Representative or the Seller Representative
reasonably requests relating to the determination of the Adjusted Net Income
or the Earn-Out Payment for such Earn-Out Year or the Alternative Earn-Out
Payment. Either the DT Representative or the Seller Representative may
deliver written notice to the CFO (by providing notice to the Purchaser to the
attention of the CFO) and the other Party on or prior to the thirtieth (30th)
day after receipt of an Earn-Out Statement specifying in reasonable detail
any items that they wish to dispute and the basis therefor. If the Seller
Representative or the DT Representative fails to deliver such written notice
in such thirty (30) day period, then such Party will have waived its right
(and, with respect to the Seller Representative, the right of the Sellers,
and, with respect to the DT Representative, the right of the Purchaser or its
Subsidiaries) to contest such Earn-Out Statement and the calculations set
forth therein of the Adjusted Net Income for such Earn-Out Year. If either
the DT Representative or the Seller Representative provides the CFO and the
other Party with written notice of any objections to the Earn-Out Statement
in such thirty (30) day period, then the Seller Representative and the DT
Representative will, for a period of twenty (20) days following the date of
delivery of such notice, attempt to resolve their differences and any written
resolution by them as to any disputed amount will be final and binding for all
purposes under this Agreement. If at the conclusion of such twenty (20) day
period the Seller Representative and the DT Representative have not reached an
agreement on any objections with respect to the Earn-Out Statement, then upon
request of either Party the Parties will resolve the dispute in accordance
with the Dispute Resolution Procedure (as set forth in _Section 2.3_ ). The
Purchaser hereby agrees during the Earn-Out Period to use its commercially
reasonable efforts to maintain a financial reporting system that enables the
parties to calculate the Adjusted Net Income and Earn-Out Payments for
purposes of this _Article II_.

2.3  _Dispute Resolution Procedure_. Matters disputed pursuant to _Section
2.2_ may be referred by either the DT Representative or the Seller
Representative to the Independent Expert for determination in accordance with
this _Section 2.3_. Each of the Seller Representative and the DT
Representative agrees to execute, if requested by the Independent Expert, a
reasonable engagement letter with respect to the determination to be made by
the Independent Expert. All fees and expenses of the Independent Expert will
be borne by the Purchaser. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, all
other costs and expenses incurred by the Seller Representative in connection
with resolving any dispute hereunder before the Independent Expert will be
borne by the Sellers, and all other costs and expenses incurred by the DT
Representative in connection with resolving any dispute hereunder before
the Independent Expert will be borne by the Purchaser. The Independent Expert
will determine only those issues still in dispute as of the Dispute
Resolution Notice Date and the Independent Expert's determination will be
based solely upon and consistent with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement. The determination by the Independent Expert will be based solely on
presentations with respect to such disputed items by the DT Representative
and the Seller Representative to the Independent Expert and not on the
Independent Expert's independent review; provided, that such presentations
will be deemed to include any work papers, records, accounts or similar
materials delivered to the Independent Expert by the DT Representative or the
Seller Representative in connection with such presentations and any materials
delivered to the Independent Expert in response to requests by the
Independent Expert. Each of the Seller Representative and the DT
Representative will use their reasonable efforts to make their
respective presentations as promptly as practicable following submission to
the Independent Expert of the disputed items, and each such Party will be
entitled, as part of its presentation, to respond to the presentation of the
other Party and any questions and requests of the Independent Expert. In
deciding any matter, the Independent Expert will be bound by the provisions of
this Agreement, including this Dispute Resolution Procedure. It is the intent
of the parties hereto that the Dispute Resolution Procedure and the
activities of the Independent Expert in connection herewith are not (and
should not be considered to be or treated as) an arbitration proceeding or
similar arbitral process and that no formal arbitration rules should be
followed (including rules with respect to procedures and discovery). The
Seller Representative and the DT Representative will request that the
Independent Expert's determination be made within forty-five (45) days after
its engagement, or as soon thereafter as possible, will be set forth in a
written statement delivered to the DT Representative and the Seller
Representative and will be final, conclusive, non-appealable and binding
for all purposes hereunder (other than for fraud or manifest error).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Independent Expert shall not make any
determinations with respect to the matters described in _Sections 2.4_ or
_2.5_ , and any determination made by the Independent Expert of the
applicable Earn-Out Payment for an applicable Earn-Out Year shall be subject
to further adjustment pursuant to such Sections.

  



  

2.4  _Future Operations_. Following the Closing (including during the Earn-
Out Period), the Purchaser and its Affiliates, including the Target
Companies, will be entitled to operate their respective businesses based upon
the business requirements of the Purchaser and its Affiliates. Each of the
Purchaser and its Affiliates, including the Target Companies will be
permitted, following the Closing (including during the Earn-Out Period), to
make changes at its sole discretion to its operations, organization,
personnel, accounting practices and other aspects of its business, including
actions that may have an impact on the achievement of the Earn-Out Payments,
and the Sellers will have no right to claim the loss of all or any portion of
an Earn-Out Payment or other damages as a result of such decisions.

  



  

2.5  _No Earn-Out During Breach of Non-Competition Agreement_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, it is
the intent of the parties that the Earn-Out Payments will be made to the
Sellers only if the Sellers are in compliance with their obligations under
the Non-Competition Agreement. Accordingly, without limiting any other
remedies available to the Purchaser under this Agreement or the Ancillary
Documents or under applicable Law, should any Seller at any time following the
Closing breach its obligations under the Non-Competition Agreement, then (a)
while such Seller's breach is continuing and remains uncured the Purchaser's
obligation to make any Earn-Out Payment to such Seller shall be suspended, and
(b) such Seller shall forfeit any right to (i) any Earn-Out Payment due to
such Seller for any Earn-Out Year in which such breach occurs and continues
and remains uncured for at least ten (10) days and, (ii) if such breach is
continuing and remains uncured for a period of at least ten (10) days of any
subsequent Earn-Out Year, any Earn-Out Payment for such subsequent Earn-Out
Year, if any. For the avoidance of doubt, if such breach occurs after the
completion of any Earn-Out Year, but prior to the payment of the Earn-Out
Payment for such Earn-Out Year, then such Seller shall forfeit any right to
the Earn-Out Payment for such Earn-Out Year. Additionally, if the
Alternative Earn-Out Payment would otherwise be payable to such Seller, then
for each Earn-Out Year that the Earn-Out Payment is forfeited pursuant to the
prior sentence, the amount of the Alternative Earn-Out Payment shall be
reduced by one-third (1/3rd) of the total Alternative Earn-Out Payment
otherwise payable to such Seller. In each case where a Seller forfeits its
rights to an Earn-Out Payment hereunder, the Purchaser shall instead receive
such Earn-Out Payments from the Escrow Account.

distribution of such Exchange Shares; (c) has been advised and understands
that the Exchange Shares (i) are being issued in reliance upon one or more
exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and any
applicable state securities Laws, (ii) have not been and shall not be

business or financial experience, or by reason of the business or financial
experience of such Seller's "purchaser representatives" (as that term is
defined in Rule 501(h) under the Securities Act), each Seller is capable of
evaluating the risks and merits of an investment in the Purchaser and
of protecting its interests in connection with this investment. Each Seller
has carefully read and understands all materials provided by or on behalf of
the Purchaser or its Representatives to such Seller or such Seller's
Representatives pertaining to an investment in the Purchaser and has
consulted, as such Seller has deemed advisable, with its own attorneys,
accountants or investment advisors with respect to the investment
contemplated hereby and its suitability for such Seller. Each Seller
acknowledges that the Exchange Shares are subject to dilution for events not
under the control of such Seller. Each Seller has completed its
independent inquiry and has relied fully upon the advice of its own legal
counsel, accountant, financial and other Representatives in determining the
legal, tax, financial and other consequences of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby and the suitability of this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby for such Seller and its particular
circumstances, and, except as set forth herein, has not relied upon any
representations or advice by the Purchaser or its Representatives. Each Seller
acknowledges and agrees that, except as set forth in Article IV (including
the related portions of the Purchaser Disclosure Schedules and
any Supplemental Disclosure Schedules provided by the Purchaser), no
representations or warranties have been made by the Purchaser or any of its
Representatives, and that such Seller has not been guaranteed or represented
to by any Person, (i) any specific amount or the event of the distribution of
any cash, property or other interest in the Purchaser or (ii) the
profitability or value of the Exchange Shares in any manner whatsoever. Each
Seller: (A) has been represented by independent counsel (or has had the
opportunity to consult with independent counsel and has declined to do so);
(B) has had the full right and opportunity to consult with such Seller's
attorneys and other advisors and has availed itself of this right and
opportunity; (C) has carefully read and fully understands this Agreement in
its entirety and has had it fully explained to it or him by such counsel; (D)
is fully aware of the contents hereof and the meaning, intent and legal
effect thereof; and (E) is competent to execute this Agreement and has

investment banker or incurred any liability for any brokerage fees,
commissions, finders' fees or similar fees in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

6.9  _Independent Investigation_. Without limiting _Section 8.4(c)_ hereof,
each Seller has conducted its own independent investigation, review and
analysis of the business, results of operations, prospects, condition
(financial or otherwise) or assets of the Purchaser, and acknowledges that it
has been provided adequate access to the personnel, properties, assets,
premises, books and records, and other documents and data of the Purchaser
for such purpose. Each Seller acknowledges and agrees that: (a) in making its
decision to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, it has relied solely upon its own investigation and the
express representations and warranties of the Purchaser set forth in _Article
IV_ (including the related portions of the Purchaser Disclosure Schedules and
any Supplemental Disclosure Schedules provided by the Purchaser); and (b)
neither the Purchaser nor any of its Representatives have made any
representation or warranty as to the Purchaser or this Agreement, except as
expressly set forth in _Article IV_ (including the related portions of the
Purchaser Disclosure Schedules and Supplemental Disclosure Schedules provided
by the Purchaser).

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of _Section 7.9(a)_ , to the extent
required under any Laws that are designed to prohibit, restrict or regulate
actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade
(" _Antitrust Laws_ "), each Party hereto agrees to make any required filing
or application under Antitrust Laws, as applicable, at such Party's sole cost
and expense, with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly

any objections are asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement under any applicable Law or if any suit is instituted (or
threatened to be instituted) by any applicable Governmental Authority or
any private party challenging any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as violative of any applicable Law or which would otherwise
prevent, materially impede or materially delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, the Parties shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to resolve any such objections or suits so as to permit
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including in
order to resolve such objections or suits which, in any case if not resolved,
could reasonably be expected to prevent, materially impede or materially
delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. In the event
any Action is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by a Governmental
Authority or private party challenging the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, or any Ancillary Document, the Parties shall, and shall cause their
respective Representatives to, cooperate in all respects with each other and
use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to contest and resist
any such Action and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any Order,
whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that
prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

  



  

(d) Prior to the Closing, each Party shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain any Consents of Governmental Authorities or other third
Persons as may be necessary for the consummation by such Party or its
Affiliates of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or required as
a result of the execution or performance of, or consummation of the
transactions contemplated by, this Agreement by such Party or its Affiliates,
and the other Parties shall provide reasonable cooperation in connection
with such efforts.

  



  

(e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no Party shall be
required to agree to any term, condition or modification with respect to
obtaining any Consents in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement that would result in, or would be reasonably likely to result
in: (i) a Material Adverse Effect to such Party or its Affiliates, or (ii)
such Party having to cease, sell or otherwise dispose of any material assets
or businesses (including the requirement that any such assets or business be

7.11  _The Proxy Statement; Extension_.

  



  

(a) As promptly as practicable after the date hereof, the Purchaser shall
prepare and file with the SEC a proxy statement (as amended or supplemented
from time to time, the " _Proxy Statement_ ") calling a special meeting of the
Purchaser's shareholders (the " _Shareholder Meeting_ ") seeking the approval
of the Purchaser's shareholders for the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and offering to redeem from its public shareholders their Purchaser
Ordinary Shares in conjunction with a shareholder vote on the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Redemption_ "), all in accordance with
and as required by the Purchaser's Organizational Documents, the IPO
Prospectus, applicable Law and any applicable rules and regulations of the
SEC and Nasdaq. In the Proxy Statement, the Purchaser shall seek (i) adoption
and approval of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby or
referred to herein (including, if required, the issuance of the PIPE Shares)
by the holders of Purchaser Ordinary Shares in accordance with the Purchaser's
Organizational Documents, the BVI Act, and the rules and regulations of the
SEC and Nasdaq, (ii) if required to be approved by the Purchaser's
shareholders, adoption and approval of an Amended and Restated Memorandum and
Articles of Association of the Purchaser in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to the Purchaser and the Company (the " _Amended Charter_ ") (which
Amended Charter, if appropriate as determined by the Purchaser, will be
adopted by the Purchaser in two separate amendments, one prior to the
consummation of the PIPE Investment in order to further detail the rights of
the PIPE Shares and the other to become effective at the time of the Closing
and upon registration by the BVI Registry to, among other things, change the
name of the Purchaser effective as of the Closing to "China Direct Lending
Corporation"), (iii) to appoint, and designate the classes of, the members of
the board of directors of the Purchaser, and appoint the members of any
committees thereof, in each case in accordance with  _Section 7.16_ hereof,
and (iv) to obtain any and all other approvals necessary or advisable to
effect the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and the Ancillary Documents. In connection with the Proxy Statement, the
Purchaser will also file with the SEC financial and other information about
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with applicable
proxy solicitation rules set forth in the Purchaser's Organizational
Documents, the BVI Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC and Nasdaq
(such Proxy Statement and the documents included or referred to therein
pursuant to which the Redemption will be made, together with any supplements,
amendments and/or exhibits thereto, the " _Proxy Documents_ ").

  



  

(b) If the Purchaser reasonably believes that the Closing will most likely
not occur prior to the eighteen (18) month anniversary of the IPO (the "
_Purchaser Wind-Up Date_ "), but that the Parties are reasonably capable of
causing the Closing to occur after the Purchaser Wind-Up Date, but prior to
the six (6) month anniversary of the date of this Agreement, and so long as
none of the Sellers or the Company are in material breach of this Agreement
(which breach has not been cured), the Purchaser shall prepare with the
assistance of the Company and the Sellers and file with the SEC under the
Exchange Act, and with all other applicable regulatory bodies, materials in
the form of a proxy statement to be used for the purpose of soliciting
proxies from the holders of Purchaser Ordinary Shares to approve, at a
special meeting of the holders of Purchaser Ordinary Shares (the " _Extension
Special Meeting_ "), an amendment to the Purchaser Charter to extend the
deadline for the Purchaser to consummate its initial business combination
(and, if applicable, each amendment set forth therein) (the " _Extension_
"), and providing such holders with a Redemption Offer in connection
therewith (the " _Extension Proxy Statement_ ", and together with the
documents included or referred to therein pursuant to which the Extension will
be made, together with any supplements, amendments and/or exhibits thereto,
the " _Extension Documents_ ").

(c) Except with respect to the information provided by or on behalf of the
Target Companies or the Sellers for inclusion in the Proxy Statement and
other Proxy Documents or the Extension Documents, the Purchaser shall ensure
that, when filed, the Proxy Statement and other Proxy Documents and, if
applicable, the Extension Documents will comply in all material respects with
the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder. The Purchaser shall cause the Proxy Documents and, if
applicable, the Extension Documents to be disseminated as promptly as
practicable to the Purchaser's equity holders as and to the extent such
dissemination is required by U.S. federal securities laws and the rules and
regulations of the SEC and Nasdaq promulgated thereunder or otherwise (the "
_Federal Securities Laws_ "). The Company and the Sellers shall
promptly provide to the Purchaser such information concerning the Sellers,
the Target Companies and their respective businesses, operations, condition
(financial or otherwise), assets, Liabilities, properties, officers, directors
and employees as is either required by Federal Securities Laws or reasonably
requested by the Purchaser for inclusion in the Proxy Documents or the
Extension Documents. Subject to compliance by the Company and the Sellers
with the immediately preceding sentence with respect to the information
provided or to be provided by or on behalf of them for inclusion in the Proxy
Documents or the Extension Documents, the Purchaser shall cause the Proxy
Documents and, if applicable, the Extension Documents to comply in all
material respects with the Federal Securities Laws. The Purchaser shall
provide copies of the proposed forms of the Proxy Documents and, if
applicable, the Extension Documents (including, in each case, any amendments
or supplements thereto) to Company such that the Company and its
Representatives are afforded a reasonable amount of time prior to the
dissemination or filing thereof to review such material and comment
thereon prior to such dissemination or filing, and the Purchaser shall
reasonably consider in good faith any comments of such Persons. The Purchaser
and the Company and their respective Representatives shall respond promptly to
any comments of the SEC or its staff with respect to the Proxy Documents and,
if applicable, the Extension Documents and promptly correct any information
provided by it for use in the Proxy Documents or, if applicable, Extension
Documents if and to the extent that such information shall have become false
or misleading in any material respect or as otherwise required by the Federal
Securities Laws. The Purchaser shall amend or supplement the Proxy Documents
and, if applicable, the Extension Documents and cause the Proxy Documents and,
if applicable, the Extension Documents, in each case as so amended or
supplemented, to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to the
holders of Purchaser Ordinary Shares, in each case as and to the extent
required by the Federal Securities Laws and subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and the Purchaser Organizational Documents. The
Purchaser shall provide the Company and its Representatives with copies of
any written comments, and shall inform them of any material oral comments,
that the Purchaser or any of its Representatives receive from the SEC or its
staff with respect to the Proxy Documents or, if applicable, the Extension
Documents promptly after the receipt of such comments and shall give the
Company a reasonable opportunity under the circumstances to review and
comment on any proposed written or material oral responses to such comments.
The Purchaser shall use its reasonable commercial efforts to cause the Proxy
Statement and, if applicable, the Extension Documents to "clear" comments from
the SEC and its staff and to permit the Company and its Representatives to
participate with the Purchaser or its Representatives in any discussions or
meetings with the SEC and its staff. The Company and the Sellers shall, and
shall cause each of the Target Companies to, make their respective directors,
officers and employees, upon reasonable advance notice, available to the
Purchaser and its Representatives in connection with the drafting of the
public filings with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Proxy Documents and, if applicable, the Extension
Documents, and responding in a timely manner to comments from the SEC.
The Purchaser shall call (i) the Shareholder Meeting as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the Proxy Statement has "cleared" comments from
the SEC, and (ii), if applicable, the Extension Special Meeting as promptly as
reasonable practicable after the Extension Proxy Statement has "cleared"
comments from the SEC.

(d) If at any time prior to the Closing, any information relating to the
Purchaser, on the one hand, or the Company, its Subsidiaries or the Sellers,
on the other hand, or any of their respective Affiliates, businesses,
operations, condition (financial or otherwise), assets, Liabilities,
properties, officers, directors or employees, should be discovered by the
Purchaser, on the one hand, or the Target Companies or the Sellers, on the
other hand, that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the
Proxy Documents or, if applicable, the Extension Documents, so that such
documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the Party which
discovers such information shall promptly notify each other Parties and an
appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be
promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by law,
disseminated to the Purchaser's shareholders.

  



  

7.12  _Public Announcements_.

  



  

(a) The Parties agree that no public release, filing or announcement
concerning this Agreement or the Ancillary Documents or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be issued by any Party or
any of their Affiliates without the prior written consent of the Purchaser,
the Company and the DT Representative and the Seller Representative (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except
as such release or announcement may be required by applicable Law or the rules
or regulations of any securities exchange, in which case the applicable Party
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to allow the other
Parties reasonable time to comment on, and arrange for any required filing

(a) The Company (prior to the Closing) and the Sellers hereby agree that they
shall, and shall cause their respective Representatives to: (i) treat and

transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Ancillary Documents,
performing their obligations hereunder or thereunder, enforcing their rights
hereunder or thereunder, or in furtherance of their authorized duties on
behalf of the Purchaser or its Subsidiaries), nor directly or indirectly

Purchaser waives compliance with this _Section 7.13(a)_ , furnish only that

Purchaser or any Target Company without first advising the DT Representative
in writing and giving the DT Representative a reasonable opportunity to
obtain possession thereof.

  



  

7.16  _Post-Closing Board of Directors and Executive Officers_.

  



  

(a) The Parties shall take all necessary action, including causing the
directors of the Purchaser to resign, so that effective as of the Closing,
the Purchaser's board of directors (the " _Post-Closing_ _Purchaser Board_
") will consist of five (5) individuals. Immediately after the Closing, the
Parties shall take all necessary action to designate and appoint to the Post-
Closing Purchaser Board (i) the two (2) persons that are designated by the
Purchaser prior to the Closing (the " _DT Directors_ "), both of whom shall
qualify as independent directors under Nasdaq rules, and (ii) the three (3)
persons that are designated by the Company prior to the Closing (the " _Seller
Directors_ "), at least one (1) of whom shall be required to qualify as an
independent director under Nasdaq rules. Pursuant to the Amended Charter as
in effect as of the Closing, the Post-Closing Purchaser Board will be a
classified board with three classes of directors, with (I) one class of
directors, the Class I Directors, initially serving a one (1) year term, such
term effective from the Closing (but any subsequent Class I Directors serving
a three (3) year term), (II) a second class of directors, the Class II
Directors, initially serving a two (2) year term, such term effective from
the Closing (but any subsequent Class II Directors serving a three (3) year
term), and (III) a third class of directors, the Class III Directors, serving
a three (3) year term, such term effective from the Closing. The DT Directors
shall be Class III Directors. In accordance with the Amended Charter as in
effect at the Closing, no director on the Post-Closing Purchaser Board may be
removed without cause. Subject to resignations provided by the
Company's directors, the board of directors of the Company immediately after
the Closing shall be the same as the board of directors of the Company
immediately prior to the Closing. Each Seller hereby agrees to vote all equity
securities of the Company and, after the Closing, the Purchaser consistent
with the terms hereof.

  



  

(b) The Parties shall take all action necessary, including causing the
executive officers of the Purchaser to resign, so that the individuals
serving as executive officers of the Purchaser immediately after the Closing
will be the same individuals (in the same offices) as those of the Company
immediately prior to the Closing.

7.17  _Disclosure Schedules_.

  



  

(a) During the Interim Period, each of the Company, the Sellers and the
Purchaser shall have the right, by providing one or more written supplemental
disclosure schedules (" _Supplemental Disclosure Schedules_ ") to the others,
to update its disclosure schedules to disclose updates: (a) to reflect
changes in the ordinary course of business first existing or occurring after
the date of this Agreement, which if existing or occurring on or prior to the
date of this Agreement, would have been required to be set forth on such
schedules, and (b) which updates do not result from any breach of a covenant
made by such disclosing Party or its Affiliates in this Agreement. Other than
any updates permitted by the prior sentence, no Supplemental Disclosure
Schedule shall affect any of the conditions to the Parties' respective
obligations under the Agreement (including for purposes of determining
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Article IX_ ), or any
indemnification rights under _Article VIII_ or any other remedy available to
the Parties arising from a representation or warranty that was or would be
inaccurate, or a warranty that would be breached, without qualification by
the update.

  



  

(b) For the purposes of the Company Disclosure Schedules and the Purchaser
Disclosure Schedules, any information, item or other disclosure set forth in
any part of such disclosure schedules (or, to the extent applicable, any
Supplemental Disclosure Schedule) shall be deemed to have been set forth in
all other applicable parts of such disclosure schedules (or, to the extent
applicable, Supplemental Disclosure Schedules) to the extent that the
applicability of such disclosure to such other parts is reasonably apparent on
the face of such disclosure. Inclusion of information in any disclosure
schedule or Supplemental Disclosure Schedule shall not be construed as an
admission by such party that such information is material to the business,
properties, financial condition or results of operations of, as applicable,
the Company, the Sellers or the Purchaser or their respective Affiliates.
Matters reflected in any disclosure schedule or Supplemental Disclosure
Schedule is not necessarily limited to matters required by this Agreement to
be reflected therein and the inclusion of such matters shall not be deemed an
admission that such matters were required to be reflected in such disclosure
schedule or Supplemental Disclosure Schedule. Such additional matters are set
forth for informational purposes only and do not necessarily include other
matters of a similar nature.

  



  

7.18  _Use of Trust Account Proceeds After the Closing_. The Parties agree
that after the Closing, the funds in the Trust Account and any proceeds
received by the Purchaser from the PIPE Investment, after taking into account
payments for the Redemption, shall first be used (i) to pay the Purchaser's
accrued Expenses for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii)
to pay the deferred Expenses (including cash amounts payable to EBC and any
legal fees) of the IPO. Such Expenses, as well as any Expenses that are
required to be paid by delivery of the Purchaser's securities, will be paid at
the Closing. Any remaining cash will be used for general corporate purposes.

  



  

7.19  _Purchaser Dividend Policy; Company Pre-Closing Dividend_.

  



  

(a) The Parties hereby agree from and after the Closing to encourage the
Purchaser's board of directors to adopt a stated dividend policy for the
Purchaser consistent with Annex III hereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Parties acknowledge that the Purchaser's board of directors is solely
responsible for declaring and paying dividends, and nothing herein shall
require a director of Purchaser to breach its fiduciary duties to the
Purchaser and Purchaser's shareholders.

  



  

(b) The Parties hereby agree that prior to the Closing, the Company may make
a special cash dividend in an aggregate amount equal to fifty percent (50%)
of the Company's consolidated net income (if any) for its fiscal year ending
December 31, 2015 as set forth in its audited consolidated financial
statements for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2015.

7.20  _Purchaser Policies_. During the Interim Period, the Purchaser will
consult with the Company, and the Purchaser and the Company will adopt,
effective as of the Closing, corporate and operational policies for the
Purchaser, the Company and their respective Subsidiaries, including the
Target Companies, appropriate for a company publicly traded in the United
States with active business and operations in the industries and regions in
which the Target Companies operate and contemplate operating as of the
Closing. Such policies will include a conflicts of interest policy
establishing, among other matters, proper procedures and limitations for
related party loans involving the Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries,
including the Target Companies (the " _Conflicts of Interest Policy_ ").

  



  

7.21  _SOX 404(b) Compliance_. From and after the Closing, the Sellers agree
to, and cause the Seller Directors to, engage the Purchaser's audit firm to
complete an attestation pursuant to Section 404(b) of SOX and Item 308(b) of
Regulation S-K of the Purchaser's internal control over financial reporting
effective no later than December 31, 2017, or such earlier date as is
required by SEC rules or other applicable Law, with such audit firm's
attestation report to be included in the Purchaser's applicable annual
report.

  



  

7.22  _Purchaser Fiscal Period_. Effective as of the Closing, the Purchaser
will change its fiscal period to a December 31 year end.

  



  

Article VIII 
  _SURVIVAL AND INDEMNIFICATION_

  



  

8.1  _Survival_.

  



  

(a) All representations and warranties of the Company and the Sellers
contained in this Agreement (including all schedules and exhibits hereto and
all certificates, documents, instruments and undertakings furnished pursuant
to this Agreement) shall survive the Closing through and until eighteen (18)
months after the Closing Date; provided, however, that (a) the representations
and warranties contained in _Sections 5.14_ (Taxes and Returns), _5.19_
(Benefit Plans), _5.20_ (Environmental Matters), _5.30 _ (Information
Supplied) and _6.10_ (Information Supplied) shall survive until sixty (60)
days after the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations, and (b)
the representations and warranties contained in Sections _5.1_ (Due
Organization and Good Standing), _5.2_ (Authorization; Binding Agreement),
_5.3_ (Capitalization), _5.4_ (Subsidiaries), _5.28 _ (Finders and Investment

the Sellers shall survive indefinitely. If written notice of a claim for
breach of any representation or warranty has been given before the
applicable date when such representation or warranty no longer survives in
accordance with this _Section 8.1(a)_ , then the relevant representations and
warranties shall survive as to such claim, until the claim has been finally
resolved. All covenants, obligations and agreements of the Company and the
Sellers contained in this Agreement (including all schedules and exhibits
hereto and all certificates, documents, instruments and undertakings
furnished pursuant to this Agreement), including any indemnification
obligations, shall survive the Closing and continue until fully performed in
accordance with their terms. For the avoidance of doubt, a claim for
indemnification under any subsection of _Section 8.2_ other than clauses (a)
or (b) thereof may be made at any time.

  



  

(b) The representations and warranties of the Purchaser contained in this
Agreement or in any certificate or instrument delivered pursuant to this
Agreement shall not survive the Closing, and from and after the Closing, the
Purchaser and its Representatives shall not have any further obligations, nor
shall any claim be asserted or action be brought against the Purchaser or its
Representatives with respect thereto. The covenants and agreements made by
the Purchaser in this Agreement or in any certificate or instrument delivered
pursuant to this Agreement, including any rights arising out of any breach of
such covenants or agreements, shall not survive the Closing, except for those
covenants and agreements contained herein and therein that by their terms
apply or are to be performed in whole or in part after the Closing (which
such covenants shall survive the Closing and continue until fully
performed in accordance with their terms).

  



  

   

 | 47| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

8.2  _Indemnification by the Sellers_. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this _Article VIII_ , from and after the Closing, the Sellers and their
respective successors and assigns (each, with respect to any claim made under
this _Section 8.2_ , an " _Indemnifying Party_ ") will jointly and severally
indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Purchaser and its Affiliates and
their respective officers, directors, managers, employees, successors and
permitted assigns (each, with respect to any claim made under this _Section
8.2_ , an " _Indemnified Party_ ") from and against any and all losses,
Actions, Orders, Liabilities, damages (including consequential damages),
diminution in value, Taxes, interest, penalties, Liens, amounts paid in
settlement, costs and expenses (including reasonable expenses of investigation
and court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses), (any of the
foregoing, a " _Loss_ ") paid, suffered or incurred by, or imposed upon, any
Indemnified Party to the extent arising in whole or in part out of or
resulting directly or indirectly from (whether or not involving a Third Party
Claim): (a) the breach of any representation or warranty made by the Company
or any Seller set forth in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered by
the Company, any Seller or the Seller Representative pursuant to this
Agreement; (b) the breach of any covenant or agreement on the part of any
Seller, the Company or, after the Closing, the Purchaser, set forth in this
Agreement or in any certificate delivered by the Company, any Seller, the
Seller Representative or the Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement; or (c) any
Action by Person(s) who were holders of equity securities of a Target
Company, including options, warrants, convertible debt or other convertible
securities or other rights to acquire equity securities of a Target Company,
prior to the Closing arising out of the sale, purchase, termination,
cancellation, expiration, redemption or conversion of any such securities.

  



  

8.3  _Payment from Escrow Account_. Except for Fraud Claims, (i) any
indemnification claims against an Indemnifying Party under this _Article
VIII_ shall be exclusively brought against and paid solely from the Escrow
Account and the Accrued Dividends, and (ii) the aggregate indemnification
claims shall not exceed the Escrow Shares and other Escrow Property in the
Escrow Account plus any Accrued Dividends, subject to _Section 8.4(a)_. Any
indemnification claims shall first be paid with Accrued Dividends, then with
any cash or cash equivalents that are held in the Escrow Account, then with
the Escrow Shares and then with any remaining property in the Escrow Account.
With respect to any indemnification payment that includes Escrow Shares, the
value of each Escrow Share for purposes of determining the indemnification
payment shall be the Purchaser Share Price on the date that the
indemnification claim is finally determined in accordance with this Article
VIII. For successful indemnification claims by an Indemnified Party, within
five (5) Business Days after the indemnification claim is finally determined
in accordance with this _Article VIII_ , the Escrow Agent shall disburse a
number of Escrow Shares and other Escrow Property equal to the amount of such
indemnification claim (as determined in accordance with this _Article VIII_ )
from the Escrow Account to the Purchaser (and the DT Representative and the
Seller Representative will provide or cause to be provided to the Escrow Agent
any written instructions or other information or documents required by the
Escrow Agent to do so). The Purchaser will cancel any Escrow Shares
distributed to the Purchaser from the Escrow Account promptly after its
receipt thereof and cancel any Accrued Dividend payable in respect of such
Escrow Shares. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, any Earn-Out Payments paid pursuant to _Article II_  shall be
reduced by the amount of any indemnification claims by any Indemnified Parties
under this _Article VIII_ that (i) are pending, (ii) have been finally
determined as due and owing but are unpaid from the Escrow Account in
accordance with this  _Article VIII_ or (iii) have been paid from the Escrow
Account in accordance with this _Article VIII_ but have not previously been
used to reduce the amount of any prior Earn-Out Payment. Upon the final
determination of any such pending indemnification claim, if the final amount
determined to be payable to the Indemnified Parties is less than the amount
reserved for such claim, then to the extent that such pending claim reduced
and would otherwise continue to reduce the amount of any prior Earn-Out
Payment (after first giving effect for other reductions to the amount of such
prior Earn-Out Payment pursuant to the preceding sentence, including other
pending indemnification claims, taking into account the following events
occurring after the time that the Earn-out Payment was initially reduced: (x)
any adjustments to the claimed amount for any other indemnification claims
existing at such time; and (y) the amount of any new pending or finally
determined indemnification claims made since such time), such amount
of Escrow Property will be promptly thereafter disbursed by the Escrow Agent
from the Escrow Account to the Sellers (and Purchaser shall pay the Accrued
Dividends).

  



  

   

 | 48| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

8.4  _Limitations and General Indemnification Provisions_.

  



  

(a) Except for Fraud Claims, the maximum aggregate amount of indemnification
payments to which the Indemnifying Parties will be obligated to pay in the
aggregate under _Section 8.2_ shall not exceed an amount equal to the Escrow
Property in the Escrow Account plus any Accrued Dividends. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in the event that any Escrow Property and/or Accrued Dividends
are disbursed to any Seller, if there is an indemnification claim against an
Indemnifying Party that is finally determined to be due and owing to an
Indemnified Party in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, to the
extent that there is insufficient Escrow Property in the Escrow Account to
pay for such indemnification claim, the Sellers shall personally be jointly
and severally liable to applicable Indemnified Parties for such excess
indemnification obligations, with each Seller personally liable for up to
a maximum amount (except with respect to Fraud Claims) equal to the fair
market value of the Escrow Property and Accrued Dividends disbursed to such
Seller on the date of disbursement from the Escrow Account (with each Escrow
Share valued at the Purchaser Share Price).

  



  

(b) Solely for purposes of determining the amount of Losses under this
_Article VIII_ (and, for the avoidance of doubt, not for purposes of
determining whether there has been a breach giving rise to the indemnification
claim), all of the representations, warranties and covenants set forth in
this Agreement (including the disclosure schedules hereto) or any Ancillary
Document that are qualified by materiality, Material Adverse Effect or words
of similar import or effect will be deemed to have been made without any such
qualification.

  



  

(c) No investigation or knowledge by an Indemnified Party or the DT
Representative or their respective Representatives of a breach of a
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of an Indemnifying Party shall
affect the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the
Indemnifying Party or the recourse available to the Indemnified Parties under
any provision of this Agreement, including this _Article VIII_ , with respect
thereto.

  



  

(d) The amount of any Losses suffered or incurred by any Indemnified Party
shall be reduced by the amount of any insurance proceeds paid to the
Indemnified Party or any Affiliate thereof as a reimbursement with respect to
such Losses (and no right of subrogation shall accrue to any insurer
hereunder, except to the extent that such waiver of subrogation would
prejudice any applicable insurance coverage), net of the costs of collection
and the increases in insurance premiums resulting from such Loss or insurance
payment.

  



  

8.5  _Indemnification Procedures_.

  



  

(a) The DT Representative shall have the sole right to act on behalf of the
Indemnified Parties with respect to any indemnification claims made pursuant
to this _Article VIII_ , including bringing and settling any claims hereunder
and receiving any notices on behalf of the Indemnified Parties. The Seller
Representative shall have the sole right to act on behalf of the
Indemnifying Parties with respect to any indemnification claims made pursuant
to this _Article VIII_ , including defending and settling any claims
hereunder and receiving any notices on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties.

  



  

   

 | 49| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) In order to make a claim for indemnification hereunder, the DT
Representative on behalf of an Indemnified Party must provide written notice
(a " _Claim Notice_ ") of such claim to the Seller Representative on behalf of
the Indemnifying Parties and to the Escrow Agent, which Claim Notice shall
include (i) a reasonable description of the facts and circumstances which
relate to the subject matter of such indemnification claim to the extent then
known and (ii) the amount of Losses suffered by the Indemnified Party in
connection with the claim to the extent known or reasonably estimable
(provided, that the DT Representative may thereafter in good faith adjust the
amount of Losses with respect to the claim by providing a revised Claim Notice
to the Seller Representative and the Escrow Agent); _provided_ , that the
copy of any Claim Notice provided to the Escrow Agent shall be redacted for
any confidential or proprietary information of the Indemnifying Party or the
Indemnified Party described in clause (i).

  



  

(c) In the case of any claim for indemnification under this _Article VIII_
arising from a claim of a third party (including any Governmental Authority)
(a " _Third Party Claim_ "), the DT Representative must give a Claim Notice
with respect to such Third Party Claim to the Seller Representative promptly
(but in no event later than thirty (30) days) after the Indemnified Party's
receipt of notice of such Third Party Claim; _provided_ , that the failure to
give such notice will not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
indemnification obligations except to the extent that the defense of such
Third Party Claim is materially and irrevocably prejudiced by the failure to
give such notice. The Seller Representative will have the right to defend and
to direct the defense against any such Third Party Claim, at its expense and
with counsel selected by the Seller Representative, unless (i) the Seller
Representative fails to acknowledge fully to the DT Representative the
obligations of the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party within twenty
(20) days after receiving notice of such Third Party Claim or contests, in
whole or in part, its indemnification obligations therefor or (ii) at any time
while such Third Party Claim is pending, (A) there is a conflict of interest
between the Seller Representative on behalf of the Indemnifying Party and the
DT Representative on behalf of the Indemnified Party in the conduct of such
defense, (B) the applicable third party alleges a Fraud Claim, (C) such claim
is criminal in nature, could reasonably be expected to lead to criminal
proceedings, or seeks an injunction or other equitable relief against the
Indemnified Party or (D) the amount of the Third Party Claim exceeds or is
reasonably expected to exceed the amount of the Escrow Property plus Accrued
Dividends. If the Seller Representative on behalf of the Indemnifying Party
elects, and is entitled, to compromise or defend such Third Party Claim, it
will within twenty (20) days (or sooner, if the nature of the Third Party
Claim so requires) notify the DT Representative of its intent to do so, and
the DT Representative and the Indemnified Party will, at the request and
expense of the Seller Representative, cooperate in the defense of such Third
Party Claim. If the Seller Representative on behalf of the Indemnifying Party
elects not to, or at any time is not entitled under this _Section 8.5_ to,
compromise or defend such Third Party Claim, fails to notify the DT
Representative of its election as herein provided or refuses to acknowledge
or contests its obligation to indemnify under this Agreement, the DT
Representative on behalf of the Indemnified Party may pay, compromise or
defend such Third Party Claim. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, the Indemnifying Party will have no indemnification
obligations with respect to any such Third Party Claim which is settled
by the Indemnified Party or the DT Representative without the prior written
consent of the Seller Representative on behalf of the Indemnifying Party
(which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned);
_provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified
Party will not be required to refrain from paying any Third Party Claim
which has matured by a final, non-appealable Order, nor will it be required
to refrain from paying any Third Party Claim where the delay in paying such
claim would result in the foreclosure of a Lien upon any of the property or
assets then held by the Indemnified Party or where any delay in payment would
cause the Indemnified Party material economic loss. The Seller
Representative's right on behalf of the Indemnifying Party to direct the
defense will include the right to compromise or enter into an
agreement settling any Third Party Claim; _provided_ , that no such
compromise or settlement will obligate the Indemnified Party to agree to any
settlement that that requires the taking or restriction of any action
(including the payment of money and competition restrictions) by the
Indemnified Party other than the execution of a release for such Third Party
Claim and/or agreeing to be subject to customary confidentiality obligations
in connection therewith, except with the prior written consent of the DT
Representative on behalf of the Indemnified Party (such consent to be
withheld, conditioned or delayed only for a good faith reason).
Notwithstanding the Seller Representative's right on behalf of the
Indemnifying Party to compromise or settle in accordance with the
immediately preceding sentence, the Seller Representative on behalf of the
Indemnifying Party may not settle or compromise any Third Party Claim over
the objection of the DT Representative on behalf of the Indemnified Party;
provided, however, that consent by the DT Representative on behalf of the
Indemnified Party to settlement or compromise will not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned. The DT Representative on behalf of the
Indemnified Party will have the right to participate in the defense of any
Third Party Claim with counsel selected by it subject to the Seller
Representative's right on behalf of the Indemnifying Party to direct the
defense.

  



  

   

 | 50| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d) With respect to any direct indemnification claim that is not a Third
Party Claim, the Seller Representative on behalf of the Indemnifying Party
will have a period of thirty (30) days after receipt of the Claim Notice to
respond thereto. If the Seller Representative on behalf of the Indemnifying
Party does not respond within such thirty (30) days, the Seller Representative
on behalf of the Indemnifying Party will be deemed to have accepted
responsibility for the Losses set forth in such Claim Notice subject to
the limitations on indemnification set forth in this _Article VIII_ and will
have no further right to contest the validity of such Claim Notice. If the
Seller Representative on behalf of the Indemnifying Party responds within such
thirty (30) days after the receipt of the Claim Notice and rejects such claim
in whole or in part, the DT Representative on behalf of the Indemnified Party
will be free to pursue such remedies as may be available under this Agreement
(subject to _Section 12.4_ ), any Ancillary Documents or applicable Law.

  



  

8.6  _Exclusive Remedy_. From and after the Closing, except with respect to
Fraud Claims related to the negotiation or execution of this Agreement or
claims seeking injunctions or specific strict performance (including pursuant
to _Section 12.7_ ), indemnification pursuant to this _Article VIII_ shall be
the sole and exclusive remedy for the Parties with respect to matters arising
under this Agreement of any kind or nature, including for any
misrepresentation or breach of any warranty, covenant, or other
provision contained in this Agreement or in any certificate or instrument
delivered pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise relating to the subject
matter of this Agreement, including the negotiation and discussion thereof.

 | 57| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

10.4  _Termination Fee_. Notwithstanding _Section 10.3_ above, in the event
that there is a termination of this Agreement by the Purchaser pursuant to

and agree that, with respect to any termination of this Agreement in
circumstances where the Termination Fee is payable, the payment of the

entitled to assert against the Company or its Affiliates or any of their
respective assets, or against any of their respective directors, officers,
employees or shareholders with respect to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby and shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy
available to the Purchaser, _provided_ , that the foregoing shall not limit

specific performance or other injunctive relief in lieu of terminating this
Agreement.

  



  

Article XI 
  _WAIVERS AND RELEASES_

  



  

11.1  _Waiver of Claims Against Trust_. The Company and each Seller hereby
acknowledges that it has read the IPO Prospectus and understands that the
Purchaser has established the Trust Account containing the proceeds of the IPO
and certain additional proceeds (including interest accrued from time to time
thereon) initially in an amount of $69,972,642.60 for the benefit of the
Purchaser's public shareholders (including overallotment shares acquired by
the underwriters of the IPO) (the " _Public Shareholders_ ") and that, except
as otherwise described in the IPO Prospectus, the Purchaser may disburse
monies from the Trust Account only: (a) to the Public Shareholders in the
event they elect to redeem their Purchaser Ordinary Shares in connection with
the consummation of its initial business combination (as such term is used in
the IPO Prospectus) (" _Business Combination_ "), (b) to the Public
Shareholders if the Purchaser fails to consummate a Business Combination
within eighteen (18) months after the closing of the IPO, (c) to pay any
taxes and for working capital purposes from the interest accrued in the Trust
Account and (d) to the Purchaser after or concurrently with the consummation
of its Business Combination. For and in consideration of the
Purchaser entering into this Agreement and for other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby
acknowledged, the Company and each Seller hereby agrees on behalf of itself
and its Affiliates that none of them does now or shall at any time hereafter
have any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies in
the Trust Account, or make any claim against the Trust Account (including any
distributions therefrom), regardless of whether such claim arises as a result
of, in connection with or relating in any way to, any proposed or actual
business relationship between the Purchaser (or its Affiliates) and any of
them, this Agreement or any other matter, and regardless of whether such claim
arises based on contract, tort, equity or any other theory of legal liability
(any and all such claims are collectively referred to hereafter as the "
_Released Claims_ "). The Company and each Seller on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates hereby irrevocably waives any Released Claims it may have against
the Trust Account (including any distributions therefrom) now or in the future
as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, Contracts or agreements
with Purchaser or its Affiliates and will not seek recourse against the
Trust Account (including any distributions therefrom) for any reason
whatsoever (including for an alleged breach of this Agreement). The Company
and each Seller agrees and acknowledges that such irrevocable waiver is
material to this Agreement and specifically relied upon by the Purchaser and
its Affiliates to induce them to enter in this Agreement, and the Company and
each Seller further intends and understands such waiver to be valid, binding
and enforceable under applicable Law. To the extent that the Company, any
Seller or any of their respective Affiliates commences any action or
proceeding based upon, in connection with, relating to or arising out of any
matter relating to the Purchaser or its Affiliates, which proceeding seeks, in
whole or in part, monetary relief against the Purchaser or its Affiliates,
the Company and each Seller hereby acknowledges and agrees that its sole
remedy shall be against funds held outside of the Trust Account and that such
claim shall not permit any of them or their Affiliates (or any other Person
claiming on their behalf) to have any claim against the Trust Account
(including any distributions therefrom) or any amounts contained therein. In
the event that the Company, any Seller or any of their respective Affiliates
commences any action or proceeding based upon, in connection with, relating
to or arising out of any matter relating to the Purchaser or its Affiliates
which proceeding seeks, in whole or in part, relief against the Trust Account
(including any distributions therefrom) or the Public Shareholders, whether
in the form of money damages or injunctive relief, the Purchaser and its
Affiliates shall be entitled to recover from the commencing Person and its
Affiliates the associated legal fees and costs in connection with any such
action, in the event the Purchaser or its Affiliate prevails in such action or
proceeding.

fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, each Seller, on behalf of itself
and its Affiliates and any China Lending Shareholder that owns any share or
other equity interest in or of such Seller (the " _Releasing Persons_ "),
hereby releases and discharges the Target Companies from and against any and
all Actions, obligations, agreements, debts and Liabilities whatsoever,
whether known or unknown, both at law and in equity, which such Releasing
Person now has, has ever had or may hereafter have against the Target
Companies arising on or prior to the Closing Date or on account of or arising
out of any matter occurring on or prior to the Closing Date, including any
rights to indemnification or reimbursement from a Target Company, whether
pursuant to its Organizational Documents, Contract or otherwise, and whether
or not relating to claims pending on, or asserted after, the Closing Date.
From and after the Closing, each Releasing Person hereby irrevocably
covenants to refrain from, directly or indirectly, asserting any Action, or
commencing or causing to be commenced, any Action of any kind against the
Target Companies or their respective Affiliates, based upon any matter
purported to be released hereby. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, the releases and restrictions set forth herein shall not apply to
any claims a Releasing Person may have against any party pursuant to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement or any Ancillary Document or any of the
other matters set forth on _Schedule 11.2_.

12.2  _Binding Effect; Assignment_. This Agreement and all of the provisions
hereof shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties hereto
and their respective successors and permitted assigns. This Agreement shall
not be assigned by operation of Law or otherwise without the prior written
consent of the Purchaser, the Company, the DT Representative and the Seller
Representative, and any assignment without such consent shall be null and
void; _provided_ that no such assignment shall relieve the assigning Party of
its obligations hereunder.

  



  

12.3  _Third Parties_. Nothing contained in this Agreement or in any
instrument or document executed by any party in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby shall create any rights in, or be deemed to
have been executed for the benefit of, any Person that is not a Party hereto
or thereto or a successor or permitted assign of such a Party.

  



  

12.4  _Arbitration_. Any and all disputes, controversies and claims (other
than disputes subject to the Dispute Resolution Procedure under _Section 2.2_
or applications for a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction,
permanent injunction or other equitable relief or application for enforcement
of a resolution under this _Section 12.4_ ) arising out of, related to, or in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (a "
_Dispute_ ") shall be governed by this _Section 12.4_. A party must, in the
first instance, provide written notice of any Disputes to the other
parties subject to such Dispute, which notice must provide a reasonably
detailed description of the matters subject to the Dispute. The parties
involved in such Dispute shall seek to resolve the Dispute on an amicable
basis within ten (10) Business Days of the notice of such Dispute being
received by such other parties subject to such Dispute; the " _Resolution
Period_ ");  _provided_ , that if any Dispute would reasonably be expected to
have become moot or otherwise irrelevant if not decided within sixty (60)
days after the occurrence of such Dispute, then there shall be no Resolution
Period with respect to such Dispute. Any Dispute that is not resolved during
the Resolution Period may immediately be referred to and finally resolved by
arbitration pursuant to the then-existing Expedited Procedures of the
Commercial Arbitration Rules (the " _AAA Procedures_ ") of the American
Arbitration Association (the " _AAA_ "). Any party involved in such Dispute
may submit the Dispute to the AAA to commence the proceedings after the
Resolution Period. To the extent that the AAA Procedures and this
Agreement are in conflict, the terms of this Agreement shall control. The
arbitration shall be conducted by one arbitrator nominated by the AAA
promptly (but in any event within five (5) Business Days) after the submission
of the Dispute to the AAA and reasonably acceptable to each party subject to
the Dispute, which arbitrator shall be a commercial lawyer with substantial
experience arbitrating disputes under acquisition agreements. The arbitrator
shall accept his or her appointment and begin the arbitration process
promptly (but in any event within five (5) Business Days) after his or her
nomination and acceptance by the parties subject to the Dispute. The
proceedings shall be streamlined and efficient. The arbitrator shall decide
the Dispute in accordance with the substantive law of the state of New York.
Time is of the essence. Each party shall submit a proposal for resolution of
the Dispute to the arbitrator within twenty (20) days after confirmation of
the appointment of the arbitrator. The arbitrator shall have the power to
order any party to do, or to refrain from doing, anything consistent with this
Agreement, the Ancillary Documents and applicable Law, including to perform
its contractual obligation(s); provided, that the arbitrator shall be limited
to ordering pursuant to the foregoing power (and, for the avoidance of doubt,
shall order) the relevant party (or parties, as applicable) to comply
with only one or the other of the proposals. The arbitrator's award shall be
in writing and shall include a reasonable explanation of the arbitrator's
reason(s) for selecting one or the other proposal. The seat of arbitration
shall be in New York County, State of New York. The language of the
arbitration shall be English.

12.5  _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_. This Agreement shall be governed by,
construed and enforced in accordance with the Laws of the State of New York
without regard to the conflict of laws principles thereof. Subject to _Section

heard and determined exclusively in any state or federal court located in New
York, New York (or in any court in which appeal from such courts may be
taken) (the " _Specified Courts_ "). Subject to _Section 12.4_ , each Party
hereto hereby (a) submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of any Specified Court
for the purpose of any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement
brought by any Party hereto and (b) irrevocably waives, and agrees not to
assert by way of motion, defense or otherwise, in any such Action, any claim
that it is not subject personally to the jurisdiction of the above-named
courts, that its property is exempt or immune from attachment or execution,
that the Action is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of the
Action is improper, or that this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby may not be enforced in or by any Specified Court. Each
Party agrees that a final judgment in any Action shall be conclusive and may
be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other
manner provided by Law. Each Party irrevocably consents to the service of the
summons and complaint and any other process in any other action or proceeding
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, on behalf of
itself, or its property, by personal delivery of copies of such process to
such Party at the applicable address set forth in _Section 12.1_. Nothing in
this _Section 12.5_ shall affect the right of any Party to serve legal
process in any other manner permitted by Law.

  



  

12.6  _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY WAIVES TO THE
FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL
BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY ACTION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF,
UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY. EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OTHER

12.7  _Specific Performance_. Each Party acknowledges that the rights of each
Party to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby are unique,
recognizes and affirms that in the event of a breach of this Agreement by any
Party, money damages may be inadequate and the non-breaching Parties may have
not adequate remedy at law, and agree that irreparable damage would occur in
the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed by
an applicable Party in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. Accordingly, each Party shall be entitled to seek an injunction or
restraining order to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to seek to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, without the requirement
to post any bond or other security or to prove that money damages would be
inadequate, this being in addition to any other right or remedy to which such
Party may be entitled under this Agreement, at law or in equity.

12.8  _Severability_. In case any provision in this Agreement shall be held
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in a jurisdiction, such provision shall be
modified or deleted, as to the jurisdiction involved, only to the extent
necessary to render the same valid, legal and enforceable, and the validity,
legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof shall not in
any way be affected or impaired thereby nor shall the validity, legality or
enforceability of such provision be affected thereby in any other
jurisdiction. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties will substitute
for any invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision a suitable and equitable
provision that carries out, so far as may be valid, legal and enforceable,
the intent and purpose of such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision.

Affiliated Party hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracy in the representations and
warranties by such other non-Affiliated Party contained herein or in any

writing signed by the Party or Parties to be bound thereby. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, no failure or delay by a Party in exercising any right
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial
exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any other right
hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any waiver of any provision of this
Agreement after the Closing shall also require the prior written consent of
the DT Representative.

ANNEX II

  

 _Adjusted Net Income_

  



  

The net income of the Purchaser and the Company and their respective
Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, shall be adjusted as follows to
determine the Adjusted Net Income used in connection with the determination of
the Earn-Out Payments hereunder:

  



   1.| Adjusted  Net Income will be calculated in RMB, and compared to the
Earn-Out Targets expressed  in RMB as set forth in the Exchange Rate
Acknowledgement. The foreign exchange rate between  the U.S. dollar and RMB
(or the currency of any other applicable jurisdiction where the  Purchaser,
the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries conduct business at any 
time during the Earn-Out Period) will be fixed at the exchange rate as of the
close of  business on June 30, 2015 using the USD/CNY midpoint rate as posted
on the http://www.oanda.com  website, as agreed by the Purchaser and the
Company in the Exchange Rate Acknowledgement  with respect to the currencies
set forth therein. 
---|--- 
   | 
  2.| If  during the Earn-Out Period, the Purchaser, the Company or any of
their respective Subsidiaries  acquire another business (excluding the
Company and its Subsidiaries as contemplated  by this Agreement), then the
Adjusted Net Income shall be computed without taking into  consideration (i)
the financial results of such acquired business or (ii) any impact  such
acquired business would have on the financial results of the Purchaser, the
Company  or their respective Subsidiaries. 
   | 
  3.| To  exclude the following: 
  



   | a.| Any  extraordinary gains or losses (such as from the sale of real
property, investments, securities  or fixed assets) or any other
extraordinary income or expenses; and 
---|---|--- 
  



   | b.| Any  net income from revenue that is non-recurring and earned
outside of the ordinary course  of business. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | c.| Any  Expenses, including brokers', finders', advisors',
consultants'  and professional fees related to the Business Combination,
incurred by the Purchaser  or the Target Companies prior to or at the
Closing. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

Any accounting term that is used herein but not defined in the Agreement
shall have the meaning normally ascribed to such term under GAAP.

  



    



 



     



  

ANNEX III

  

 _Purchaser Dividend Policy_

  



  

The Parties intend that the Purchaser will use its reasonable efforts to
declare and pay dividends on the Purchaser Ordinary Shares after the Closing
as follows:

  



   | ●| an  amount equal to fifteen percent (15%) of the Company's
consolidated net income  (if any) for its fiscal year ending December 31,
2015 as set forth in its audited consolidated  financial statements for the
fiscal year ending December 31, 2015, which Purchaser Ordinary  Share
dividend will be declared and paid within forty-five (45) days after the
Closing. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | ●| within  forty-five (45) days after the filing of Purchaser's Form
10-Q or 10-K (or substantially  equivalent form), as applicable, for the
first full or partial fiscal quarter period  of Purchaser ending after the
Closing, Purchaser will declare and pay a dividend on Purchaser  Ordinary
Shares in an aggregate amount equal to twenty-five percent (25%) of (i) the 
Purchaser's and the Company's aggregate consolidated net income for the
period  beginning January 1, 2016 through the end of such fiscal quarter
(without double-counting  any periods during which the Purchaser and the
Company are consolidated), less (ii) the  amount of dividends paid, payable
or otherwise accrued as preferred dividends with respect  to the PIPE Shares
for such period. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | ●| for  each fiscal quarter of the Purchaser thereafter, an amount
equal to twenty-five percent  (25%) of (i) the Purchaser's consolidated net
income for such fiscal quarter, less  (ii) the amount of dividends paid,
payable or otherwise accrued as preferred dividends  with respect to the PIPE
Shares for such period, which Purchaser Ordinary Share dividend  will be
declared and paid within forty-five (45) days after the filing of the
Purchaser's  Form 10-Q or 10-K (or substantially equivalent form) for such
fiscal quarter. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

Such dividends will be payable by the Purchaser, at the option of each
shareholder, either in cash or Purchaser Ordinary Shares.

  



  

For purposes of this _Annex III_ , "net income" will exclude any Expenses
incurred by the Purchaser that are paid by delivery of capital shares of the
Purchaser.

  



  

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties acknowledge that the Purchaser's
board of directors is solely responsible for declaring and paying dividends,
and nothing herein shall require a director of the Purchaser to breach its
fiduciary duties to the Purchaser and Purchaser's shareholders.

---|---|--- 

 



    



  

ANNEX IV

  

 _Earn-Out Targets_

  



  

The Parties agree that the amount of each Earn-Out Target will be determined
in accordance with the table below (as such amounts may alternatively be
expressed in RMB pursuant to the Exchange Rate Acknowledgement):

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Earn-Out Targets above shall be modified
as follows based on the actual Closing Date in 2016:

  



   | 1.| The  2016 Earn-Out Target shall be reduced by an amount equal to
fifty percent (50%) of (i)  the 2016 Earn-Out Target as listed above,
multiplied by (ii) a fraction, where the numerator  is the number of days in
the 2016 calendar year prior to the Closing Date and the denominator  is 366. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 2.| The  Alternative Earn-Out Target shall be reduced by an amount
equal to one-third (1/3rd)  of the 2016 Earn-Out Target reduction calculated
pursuant to item 1 above. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

Solely for purposes of an example of the foregoing formula, if the Closing
Date is February 15, 2016, and the amount of the Net Closing Proceeds is
$58,000,000:

  



   | ●| The  2016 Earn-Out Target will be $27,217,213 (calculated as
$29,000,000 - 50% x ($29,000,000  x 45/366), which is also equal to
$29,000,000 - $1,782,787); and 
---|---|--- 
  



   | ●| The  Alternative Earn-Out Target will be $32,905,738 (calculated
as $33,500,000 - (1/3  x $1,782,787)) 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   



 



    



  

During the period in which the upper limit for the annual rate of private
borrowing and lending allowed by policy in Xinjiang, China (the " _Upper Rate
Limit_ ") is four (4) times the PBOC base interest rate (" _PBOC Base Rate_
"), the Earn-Out Targets above shall be further modified based on changes to
the PBOC Base Rate from the June 30, 2015 PBOC Base Rate of 4.85% (" _June
30, 2015 PBOC Base Rate_ ") as follows:

  



   | 1.| Each  of the Earn-Out Targets as listed above shall be multiplied
by a fraction equal to (i)  the weighted-average PBOC Base Rate (based on the
number of days) for the applicable  calendar year, divided by (ii) the June
30, 2015 PBOC Base Rate. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 2.| The  Alternative Earn-Out Target as listed above shall be
multiplied by a fraction equal to  (i) the weighted-average PBOC Base Rate
(based on the number of days) for the period  from January 1, 2016 through
December 31, 2018, divided by (ii) the June 30, 2015 PBOC  Base Rate. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

Provided, however, that if the Laws of the applicable Governmental
Authorities in Xinjiang, China are amended so that the Upper Rate Limit is no
longer four (4) times the PBOC Base Rate (the effective date of such
amendment, the " _Base Rate Lock Date_ "), then for purpose of the foregoing
formula, the PBOC Base Rate on and after the Base Rate Lock Date shall be
deemed to equal the PBOC Base Rate in effect at the open of business on the
Base Rate Lock Date.

  



  

Solely for purposes of an example of the foregoing formula, if the Closing
Date is February 15, 2016, the amount of the Net Closing Proceeds is
$58,000,000 and PBOC Base Rate as of January 1, 2016 is 4.35% and is reduced
to 4.10% on February 15, 2016 and remains at that rate for the Earn-Out
Period (and the Upper Rate Limit remains at four (4) times the PBOC Base
Rate):

  



   | ●| The  2016 Earn-Out Target will be $23,180,859 (calculated as
[$29,000,000 - 50% x ($29,000,000  x 45/366)] x [(4.35%/4.85%) x (45/366) +
(4.10%/4.85%) x (321/366)], which is also equal  to [($29,000,000 -
