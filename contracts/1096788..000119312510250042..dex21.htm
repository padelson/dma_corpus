2.4.1 As consideration for the transfer of the Assets, Buyer shall (a) pay the
Seller One Hundred Sixty-Five Million and No/100ths Dollars ($165,000,000.00)
(the "Base Purchase Price"), _plus_ the Estimated Working Capital Adjustment

the "Purchase Price"), (b) assume the obligation to pay or perform the

2.5 _Purchase Price Adjustments_.

2.5.1 At least fifteen (15) days prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall
deliver to Buyer a good faith estimate of what the Divisions Net Working
Capital will be as of the Adjustment Time on the Closing Date (the "Sellers
Estimated Working Capital"), together with supporting documentation for such
estimate and any additional information relating thereto reasonably requested
by Buyer. The Sellers Estimated Working Capital shall be prepared in good
faith in a manner consistent with the calculation of the Average Working
Capital and shall be certified by an authorized officer of Seller. Buyer and
its accountants and advisors shall be given full access to all of Sellers
books and records with respect to the Division and the Business for purposes
of evaluating the accuracy and completeness of the Sellers Estimated Working
Capital. If Buyer believes, in good faith, that the

 



12  Sellers Estimated Working Capital is in error, Buyer may challenge the
amount of the Sellers Estimated Working Capital within ten (10) days
following its receipt of the Sellers Estimated Working Capital by delivering
a written notice of disagreement to Seller, which notice shall include an
itemization of Buyers objections and an explanation of such objections. If
Buyer does not timely deliver a notice of disagreement to Seller, the amount
of the Purchase Price to be paid at the Closing shall be based on the Sellers
Estimated Working Capital as delivered to Buyer. If Buyer timely delivers a
written notice of disagreement to Seller, Buyer and Seller shall use their
good faith efforts to resolve any disputes with respect to the Sellers
Estimated Working Capital prior to the Closing Date, and the amount of Closing
Consideration to be paid at the Closing shall be based on the Estimated
Working Capital (as defined below) as mutually agreed to in writing by Buyer
and Seller. If Buyer timely delivers a notice of disagreement to Seller but
Buyer and Seller are unable to resolve their dispute regarding the
Sellers Estimated Working Capital within four (4) days of the delivery by
Buyer to Seller of such notice of disagreement, then the Purchase Price to be
paid at the Closing shall be based on the Sellers Estimated Working
Capital. "Estimated Working Capital" means the estimate of what Net Working
Capital will be at the Adjustment Time on the Closing Date as determined by
the Parties pursuant to this _Section 2.5.1_.

 

2.5.2 "Average Working Capital" means ($499,195.00) in Net Working Capital
calculated in the manner and methodology agreed to by Buyer and Seller as set
forth on _Schedule 2.5.2_. "Target Working Capital Range" means a range
between and including (i) an amount equal to the Average Working Capital less
$300,000.00 (the "Working Capital Floor") and (ii) an amount equal to the
Average Working Capital plus $300,000.00 (the "Working Capital Ceiling"). The
"Estimated Working Capital Adjustment" shall be a dollar amount calculated as
follows:

 

(i) If Estimated Working Capital is within the Target Working Capital Range,
then the Estimated Working Capital Adjustment shall be zero; or

(ii) If Estimated Working Capital is less than the Working Capital Floor, then
the Estimated Working Capital Adjustment shall be equal to (A) the amount of
Estimated Working Capital calculated in accordance with _Section 2.4_(a)
minus (B) the Working Capital Floor; or

 

(iii) If Estimated Working Capital is greater than the Working Capital
Ceiling, then the Estimated Working Capital Adjustment shall be equal to (A)
the amount of Estimated Working Capital calculated in accordance with _Section
2.4(a)_ minus the Working Capital Ceiling.

2.5.3 Within sixty (60) days following the Closing Date, Seller shall prepare
and deliver to Buyer Sellers calculation of the actual Net Working Capital
calculated in the manner and methodology agreed to by Buyer and Seller as set
forth on _Schedule 2.5.2_ as of the Adjustment Time on the Closing Date (the
"Closing Working Capital") and a certificate, based on such statement, of
Sellers calculation of the Closing Working Capital Adjustment (such
statement of Net Working Capital and certificate, collectively, are referred
to herein as, the "Closing Statement"). The Closing Statement shall be
prepared consistently with the Average Working Capital and shall be certified
by an authorized officer of Seller. The preparation of the Closing Statement
shall be for the sole purpose of determining the Closing Working Capital
Adjustment. Buyer shall have twenty (20) business days following its receipt
of the Closing Statement (the "Review Period") to review the same. During the
Review Period, Buyer and its accountants and advisors shall be given full
access to all of Sellers books and records with respect to the Division and
the Business for purposes of evaluating the accuracy and completeness of the
Sellers calculation of Closing Working Capital. On or before the expiration
of the Review Period, Buyer shall deliver to Seller a written statement
accepting or objecting to the Closing Statement. If Buyer objects to the
Closing Statement, such statement shall include an itemization of Buyers
objections and an explanation of the objections. If Buyer does not deliver
such statement to Seller within the Review Period, Buyer shall be deemed to
have accepted the Closing Statement.

2.5.4 The "Closing Working Capital Adjustment" shall be a dollar amount
calculated as follows:



     | (i) |

If Closing Working Capital is within the Target Working Capital Range, then
the Closing Working Capital Adjustment shall be zero, and any previously-made
Estimated Working Capital Adjustment shall be reversed and, if applicable,
refunded to the appropriate party 

---|---|--- 
 



13  (which amount will be paid directly by the parties without any deductions
from the Escrow Fund); or 

---|--- 
 



     | (ii) | If Closing Working Capital and Estimated Working Capital
are both less than the Working Capital Floor, then the Closing Working Capital
Adjustment shall be equal to (A) Closing Working Capital _minus_ (B)
Estimated Working Capital; or 
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | If Closing Working Capital is less than the Working
Capital Floor and Estimated Working Capital is within the Target Working
Capital Range, then the Closing Working Capital Adjustment shall be equal to
(A) Closing Working Capital _minus_ (B) the Working Capital Floor; or 
---|---|--- 



     | (iv) | If Closing Working Capital is less than the Working Capital
Floor and Estimated Working Capital is greater than the Working Capital
Ceiling, then the Closing Working Capital Adjustment shall be equal to (A)
Closing Working Capital _minus_ (B) the Working Capital Floor minus (C) the
Estimated Working Capital Adjustment; or 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (v) | If Closing Working Capital is greater than the Working
Capital Ceiling and Estimated Working Capital is less than the Working Capital
Floor, then the Closing Working Capital Adjustment shall be equal to (A)
Closing Working Capital _minus_ (B) the Working Capital Ceiling minus (C) the
Estimated Working Capital Adjustment; or 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (vi) | If Closing Working Capital is greater than the Working
Capital Ceiling and Estimated Working Capital is within the Target Working
Capital Range, then the Closing Working Capital Adjustment shall be equal to
(A) Closing Working Capital _minus_ (B) the Working Capital Ceiling; or 
---|---|--- 



     | (vii) | If Closing Working Capital and Estimated Working Capital
are both greater than the Working Capital Ceiling, then the Closing Working
Capital Adjustment shall be equal to (A) Closing Working Capital _minus_ (B)
the Working Capital Ceiling minus (C) the Estimated Working Capital
Adjustment. 
---|---|--- 

2.5.5 The Closing Working Capital Adjustment set forth on the Closing
Statement, as accepted or deemed accepted under _Section 2.5.3_ or, if
applicable, as determined in accordance with  _Section 2.5.6_ below, shall
constitute the "Final Closing Adjustment" for purposes of determining any
adjustment to the Purchase Price and shall be binding and conclusive on the
Parties and not subject to appeal. 

2.5.6 If Buyer objects to the Closing Statement within the Review Period,
Buyer and Seller shall promptly and in good faith attempt to resolve such
objections. Any such objections that cannot be resolved between Buyer and
Seller within thirty (30) days following Sellers receipt of Buyers statement
of objections shall be resolved in accordance with this _Section 2.5.6_. Any
such unresolved objections shall be submitted to Ernst and Youngs Kansas City,
Missouri offices (the "Accounting Referee") for review and resolution, with
instructions to complete the same as promptly as practicable, but in any
event within thirty (30) days of its engagement, and to make any calculations
in accordance with the methodology specified above. Such Accounting Referee
shall deliver a statement setting forth its own calculation of the Closing
Working Capital Adjustment within thirty (30) days of the submission of the
matter to such firm, which calculation, absent manifest error, shall be
binding and conclusive on the Parties and not subject to appeal. The
Accounting Referee will be directed to give to each of the Parties and their
respective accountants and advisors access to all of the Accounting Referees
work papers for purposes of determining whether there is a manifest error.
The determination of the Accounting Referee shall be accompanied by a
certificate of the Accounting Referee that its determination was prepared in
accordance with the methodology specified above with respect to such dispute.
The fees and expenses (including any related indemnity obligation to the
Accounting Referee) shall be borne one-half by Buyer and one-half by Seller.

 

2.5.7 If the Final Closing Adjustment is a negative amount, Seller shall pay
to Buyer an amount in cash equal to the Final Closing Adjustment. If the
Final Closing Adjustment is a positive amount, then

 



14  Buyer shall pay to Seller an amount in cash equal to the Final Closing
Adjustment. Any payment made under this _Section 2.5.7_ shall be made within
fifteen (15) days of the final determination of the Final Closing Adjustment.

2.6 _Allocation of Purchase Price_. Buyer and Seller agree, with respect to
the Assets and Assumed Liabilities to be acquired, sold and transferred
hereunder, to allocate the Purchase Price, Assumed Liabilities and other
relevant items (including, for example, adjustments to the Purchase Price) to
individual assets (including to Seller Restrictive Covenant, as hereinafter
defined) or classes of assets for all purposes and matters regarding Taxes and
Tax Returns in the manner and using the methodology (i.e., using Sellers tax
basis as a starting point) as described in the example of an allocation set
forth in _Schedule 2.6_, which allocation will be agreed upon in good faith
in writing by the parties within sixty (60) days after Closing (the "Agreed-
Upon Allocation"). Buyer and Seller (and their Affiliates) agree to use the
Agreed-Upon Allocation in preparing and filing all required forms under
Section 1060 of the Code and all other Tax Returns, and neither Buyer nor
Seller (nor their Affiliates) will take any position before any Governmental
Authority on any Tax Return or in any judicial proceeding concerning Taxes and
Tax Returns that is in any way inconsistent with such Agreed-Upon Allocation
unless otherwise required by Law. Each of Buyer and Seller (and their
Affiliates) shall notify the other within fifteen (15) business days if it
receives written notice that any Governmental Authority proposes any
allocation that is different from the Agreed-Upon Allocation. 

2.7 _Excluded Liabilities_. Specifically, and without in any way limiting the
generality of  _Section 2.3_, other than the Assumed Liabilities, Buyer does
not, and in no event shall Buyer be deemed to, assume, agree to pay, or agree
to or be required to discharge or perform, and Seller shall continue to be
responsible for, any and all responsibilities, obligations and liabilities of
Seller or any Affiliate of Seller, whether or not arising out of or relating
to the System, the Business or the Division, of whatever kind or nature,
whether presently in existence or arising hereafter, known or unknown,
contingent or otherwise (the "Excluded Liabilities"). For the avoidance of
doubt, the fact that any of the Excluded Liabilities are set forth or
described on any Schedule to this Agreement does not change their status as
Excluded Liabilities.

Seller hereby represents and warrants to Buyer as follows:

3.1 _Organization; Authority_. Seller is a corporation duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Kansas, and has

been provided true and correct copies of the Organizational Documents of
Seller, as in effect on the date hereof. Seller has no direct or indirect
subsidiaries other than WorldNet, L.L.C. (in which Seller owns a majority of

Seller. The execution and delivery by Seller of the other Transaction
Documents to which it is a party, the performance by Seller of its obligations
thereunder and the consummation by Seller of the transactions contemplated
thereby will be duly authorized by all necessary corporate and shareholder
action of Seller prior to the Closing. This Agreement has been, and each other
Transaction Document to be executed by Seller at or prior to the Closing will

other Transaction Document to be executed by Seller will constitute, a valid

violate or result in a breach of any provision of the Organizational Documents
of Seller; (c) do not violate, conflict with, or result in a breach of any

Seller is in full compliance with all of the terms and requirements of each
such Licenses and Franchises in all material respects, and no event has
occurred, and to Sellers Knowledge no condition or circumstance exists, that

comply with any term or requirement of any such License or Franchises, or (ii)
result directly or indirectly in the revocation, withdrawal, suspension,
cancellation, termination or modification of any such License and Franchise.

respect to telephone and cable, and state telecommunications relay service and
911 charges have been paid in full when due or an estimate of such liability
has been accrued by Seller and is reflected on _Schedule 2.5.2_. All fees
payable with respect to any conduit agreement, any agreement regarding man
holes or hand holes or any agreement regarding static lines have been
correctly calculated and paid in full. All amounts payable under all
agreements regarding pole attachments have been calculated correctly and paid
in full. Seller has not been notified in writing by any Governmental
Authority or other Person regarding any material adjustment to the amount of
franchise or other fees to be paid by Seller to such Governmental Authority or
third party.

 

3.4.3 Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Buyer
acknowledges and agrees that no representations or warranties are being given
by Seller with respect to the Communications Act, the Copyright Act or FCC
matters in this _Section 3.4_.

 



16 3.5 _Title, Condition and Sufficiency of Assets_. Upon Closing, Buyer will
acquire from the Seller good and valid title to, or a valid and enforceable
leasehold interest in, or other valid rights to use, the Assets, free and
clear of all Liens, other than Permitted Encumbrances. All items of Tangible
Personal Property that individually have a fair market value of $50,000 or
more or, for items that individually have a fair market value of less than
$50,000, that have a fair market value of $100,000 in the aggregate, and that
are currently being used in the operation of the System are in adequate
operating condition for their respective present uses and operation, ordinary
wear and tear excepted. Except with respect to any services provided by the
Seller pursuant to the TSA and except with respect to the assets listed on
_Schedule 3.5_ , the Assets are all the assets necessary to permit Buyer to

with respect to any Seller Consent for the Assumed Contracts, the Seller may
grant, and Buyer hereby agrees to accept, accommodations and concessions to
obtain any such Seller Consent that are customary and commercially reasonable.
Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to promptly assist Seller
and shall take such prompt and affirmative actions as may reasonably be
necessary in obtaining such Seller Consents, and, except as set forth in the
proviso in the immediately preceding sentence with respect to the Assumed
Contracts, in no event shall Buyer be required, as a condition of obtaining
any such Seller Consent to expend any monies on, before or after the Closing,
or to offer or grant any accommodations, concessions, changes or conditions
materially adverse to the Business or Buyer (including any
amendment, modification, supplement or change to any Franchise or Assumed
Contract to which any such Seller Consent related), and in no event shall
Seller agree to (a) the payment of any amount by Buyer after Closing or, (b)
except as set forth in the proviso in the immediately preceding sentence with
respect to the Assumed Contracts, any accommodation, concession, charge or
condition to any Assumed Contract or Franchise to which such Seller Consent
relates attributable to the period after Closing in connection with obtaining

and employee benefits; provided, however, that Buyer shall offer Patrick Knorr

right of the Buyer to terminate, reassign, promote or demote any of the Hired
Employees after the Closing or to change adversely or favorably the title,
powers, duties, responsibilities, functions, locations, compensation, benefits
or terms or conditions of employment of such employees. Seller shall

Closing and/or the termination of such Designated Employees employment with
Seller (including any retention bonus or any severance payments due under any
policy of or agreement with the Seller, if any). Seller shall not (a) without
the prior written consent of Buyer, change the compensation of any Designated
Employees from the execution of this Agreement prior to Closing or (b) change

of business consistent with past practices and except for entering into or
amending any retention bonus, severance policy or agreement with Seller (if
any) and any retirement plan, SERP, Bonus Plans or deferred compensation plan
with Seller or an Affiliate of Seller, which retention bonus, severance
policies and agreements (if any), SERP, Bonus Plans or deferred compensation
plan, if any, are Excluded Liabilities.

 

5.6.3 Seller shall be responsible for maintenance and distribution of benefits
accrued under any Employee Plan prior to and as of Closing pursuant to, and

such accrued benefits under any Employee Plan.

5.6.4 All claims and obligations under, pursuant to or in connection with any
welfare, medical, insurance, disability or other employee benefit plans of
Seller or arising under any Legal Requirement affecting Division Employees
incurred on or before the Closing, or resulting or arising from events
or occurrences occurring or commencing on or prior to the Closing, shall
remain the responsibility of Seller, whether or not such employees become
Hired Employees. Buyer shall have and assume no obligation or liability under
or in connection with any such plan except that Buyer shall assume the
obligations for uninsured accrued vacation of Division Employees who become
Hired Employees to the extent included in the Assumed Liabilities or the
calculation of Net Working Capital.

 

5.6.5 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 5.6_, Buyer
shall (i) permit the Hired Employees and the Hired Employees spouses and
dependents to participate in Buyers employee benefit plans (other than any
defined benefit plans) to the same extent as Buyers similarly situated
employees and their dependents; (ii) to the extent permitted under Buyers
employee benefit plans, waive any waiting periods with respect to any of
Buyers medical, dental or vision insurance employee benefit plans; (iii) not
subject any Hired Employee to any limitations on benefits for pre-existing
conditions under its employee benefit plans, including any group health and
disability plans, in each case, to the extent permitted under Buyers employee
benefit plans and 

 



30  applicable Legal Requirements; and (iv) permit Hired Employees to
participate in Buyers 401(k) plan based on normal quarterly enrollment dates.

 

5.6.6 Effective as of the Closing, Buyer shall assume responsibilities and
obligations for continuation coverage under COBRA (the "COBRA Obligations")
and any state continuation coverage requirements with respect to the Hired

5.7 _HSR Act Filing_. As soon as practicable after the execution of this
Agreement, but in any event no later than fifteen (15) business days after
such execution (subject to extension for a period of up to an additional
fifteen (15) business days, if reasonably necessary for a Party to complete
its notification and report if not filed by the expiration of such fifteen
(15) business day period), the Parties will each complete and file, or cause
to be completed and filed, any notification and report required to be filed
under the HSR Act. The Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to any inquiries received from
the Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") and the Antitrust Division of the
Department of Justice (the "Antitrust Division") for additional information
or documentation and use commercially reasonable efforts to respond as
promptly as reasonably practicable to all inquiries and requests received from
any other Governmental Authority in connection with antitrust matters. The
Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to overcome any objections
which may be raised by the FTC, the Antitrust Division or any other
Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over antitrust matters; provided
that Buyers or Sellers obligations under this _Section 5.6_ shall not
include (a) agreeing to hold separate or to divest any of its or its
Affiliates businesses, product lines or assets or agreeing to any
material restriction as to the operation of the Business post-Closing or (b)
defending any judicial administrative action brought by a Governmental
Authority under any antitrust Legal Requirements. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, (i) Buyer shall not be required, as a condition
to obtaining any such approval, to divest or hold separate or otherwise take
or commit to take any action or enter into any agreement that limits its
freedom of action with respect to all or any portion of Buyers or any of its
Affiliates existing assets, businesses or lines of business, and Seller shall
not make any such divestiture or take any such action or make any such
commitment with respect to the Business or the Assets in connection with
obtaining any such approval without Buyers prior written consent; and (ii)
neither Buyer, its Affiliates nor Seller shall be required to terminate
existing contractual rights or obligations, relationships, joint ventures or
strategic alliances (the items set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) above being

respect thereto on the terms and conditions contained in the Commitment
Letters, (iii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions applicable to Buyer in
such definitive agreements that are within its control and (iv) consummate
the Financing no later than the Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer
shall not be prohibited from obtaining and consummating financing on terms
other than those contemplated by the Commitment Letters, provided that
Buyers efforts to obtain such alternate financing terms are not reasonably
expected to materially delay or prevent the Financing and consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

5.9 _Title Commitments and Surveys_. Buyer may order at its own expense (i)
commitments for owners or lenders or leasehold title insurance policies
(the "Title Commitments") on any parcel of Real Property owned or leased by
the Seller and used in connection with the Business that is being sold or
leased to Buyer pursuant to this Agreement upon Closing, and (ii) an ALTA
survey (the "Surveys") on any parcel of Owned Real Property for which a title
insurance policy is to be obtained certified to Buyer and the title company.
Seller shall cooperate, at Buyers sole cost and expense, in all commercially
reasonable respects with Buyer in obtaining the Title Commitments and Surveys.

32 5.14 _Certain Confidential Contracts_.

5.14.1 The Parties acknowledge that, under confidentiality provisions
contained within certain contracts used in the Business that Seller proposes
to designate as Assumed Contracts (the "Confidential Contracts"), Seller is
prohibited from disclosing the existence or the terms and conditions of the
Confidential Contracts without obtaining prior consent from the other parties
thereto.

5.14.2 Seller agrees to use commercially reasonably efforts to obtain the
necessary consents in order to disclose to Buyer the existence and terms and
conditions of the Confidential Contracts within thirty (30) days after the
date of this Agreement (the "Consent Period"). On or before the expiration of
the Consent Period, Seller shall deliver to Buyer in writing a list of all
Confidential Contracts the existence of which Seller has not previously
disclosed to Buyer and for which Seller has obtained any consent necessary to
do so, together with copies of all Confidential Contracts copies of which
Seller has not previously disclosed to Buyer and for which Seller has obtained
any consent necessary to do so. If Seller is unable to obtain any consent
necessary to disclose the existence or a copy of any of the Confidential
Contracts by the end of the Consent Period, then prior to the expiration of
the Consent Period, Seller shall notify Buyer that there remain Confidential
Contracts the existence or terms and conditions of which Seller is prohibited
from disclosing to Buyer.

5.14.3 During the Consent Period Seller may deliver to Buyer revised copies
of the Schedules to this Agreement. At Closing for purposes of Sellers
representations and warranties and covenants in this Agreement, all references
to the Schedules shall mean the version of the Schedules attached to this
Agreement on the date of this Agreement as supplemented or revised by such
revised Schedules delivered during the Consent Period, as the case may be.

5.14.4 Buyer shall have a period of fifteen (15) days after the expiration of

_Section 5.14.3_ and provide Seller with written notice of its election to
either (a) accept the information disclosed by Seller without objection, or
(b) object to the information or revised Schedule disclosed by Seller and
terminate this Agreement on the basis of such objection. If Buyer fails to
provide Seller with written notice of an election to terminate within such
fifteen (15) day period, Buyer shall be deemed to have accepted without
objection any revised Schedules delivered by Seller and the information
disclosed by Seller concerning the Confidential Contracts, in which case all
of the disclosed Confidential Contracts shall become Assumed Contracts and
Seller shall have no further obligation to transfer any still undisclosed
Confidential Contracts, or the terms thereof, to Buyer, in which case Seller
shall retain such undisclosed Confidential Contracts and may terminate the
same in its discretion.

5.14.5 Not less than ten (10) business days prior to Closing, Seller shall
deliver to Buyer a list of all of the Material Contracts that were entered
into by Seller between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date

five (5) days after receipt of the list of Material Contracts provided for in
the preceding sentence in which to review such list and provide Seller with
written notice of its election to either (a) accept the revised _Schedule 3.7_

5.15 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Until the Closing, each Party shall
promptly notify the other Party in writing if it becomes aware of any fact,
change, condition, circumstance, or occurrence or nonoccurrence of any event
that causes any representation or warranty of such Party to be inaccurate such

cable television franchise, Buyer has not been successful in obtaining its
own CLEC license or a judgment has been entered enjoining or disapproving the
transfer of such cable television franchise to Buyer, such cable television
franchise shall be excluded from the Assets conveyed at Closing. Closing
shall occur with respect to all other Assets, and Buyer shall pay the full
Purchase Price in accordance with this Agreement. In such case, at Closing,

 



33  Seller and Buyer shall execute and deliver a Management Agreement in the
form attached hereto as _Exhibit 5.16_ (Buyer and Seller agree to negotiate

franchise and the area served by such cable television franchise and the
operation thereof and shall receive all revenues resulting from such area as

television franchise until the earliest of (i) revocation of such cable
television franchise in an action from which no further appeal may be taken,
as a result of the transactions described in this _Section 5.16_; (ii) the
entry by a court of an order terminating such cable television franchise;
(iii) 180 days after the Closing Date; and (iv) the date on which the
applicable Franchising Authority consents to the transfer of such cable
television franchise to Buyer (the "Management Period"). Upon the termination
of the Management Period, the Management Agreement shall terminate without any
liability hereunder for the exclusion of any such cable television franchise
from the Assets conveyed at Closing, and, upon receipt of all
necessary approvals, Seller shall assign and transfer to Buyer the cable
television franchise by instruments in form and substance identical to those
by which Assets shall have been transferred and assigned to Buyer at Closing.

Agreement. Subject to the Escrow Agreement, the Escrow shall be held for a
period of twelve months after the Closing Date, which period is subject to
increase as provided for in the Escrow Agreement (the "Holdback Period").

to their prior condition and the Systems normal and usual operation and the
Normal Business Level is resumed or until the Buyer otherwise elects to
proceed to Closing pursuant to _Section 5.23.2(i)_; provided, that in no
event may the Closing be delayed pursuant to this _Section 5.23.2(ii) _beyond
the End Date; and provided, further, that as of the Closing, Seller shall
remit to Buyer the amounts contemplated by _Section 5.23.2(i)_ with respect

with respect to any representation or warranty or covenant of Seller made
pursuant to this Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents to which
Seller is a party; provided however that Seller may, but shall not have the
obligation, to repair or restore any Assets damaged or destroyed in connection
with a loss of the type described in _Section 6.1.11_ or _6.2.6_.

6.2.1_ or _Section 6.2.2_ if such breach or failure to perform had occurred
at the time scheduled for Closing, and (ii) if such breach relates to a
representation or warranty of the Buyer, such breach has not been
substantially cured by thirty (30) days following Buyers receipt of written
notice thereof (such 30-day period, "Buyers Cure Period") or waived by
Seller;

8.1.4 by Buyer or Seller, (i) if any Governmental Authority of competent
jurisdiction shall have issued an injunction or taken any other action (which
injunction or other action the parties hereto shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts (which shall not include any divestiture, commencement of
litigation or other extraordinary act) to lift) that temporarily or
permanently restrains, enjoins or otherwise prohibits the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and such injunction or other
action shall have become final and non-appealable; or (ii) if the Closing
shall not have occurred on or before December 15, 2010 or such other date, if
any, as Buyer and Seller may agree in writing (the "End Date"); provided,
however, that the right to terminate the Agreement under this  _Section
8.1.4_ shall not be available to any Party whose failure to comply with any
provision of this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure
of the Closing to occur on or before the End Date;

 

8.1.5 by Buyer, pursuant to _Section 5.23_; or

 



39 8.1.6 by Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, if the closing conditions
described in _Section 6.1.11_ or _Section 6.2.6_, respectively, have not
been satisfied or such non-satisfaction has not been waived by both Parties
prior the End Date. 

8.2 _Rights Upon Termination_. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to  _Section 8.1_, this Agreement shall forthwith become
null and void and have no effect, without any liability on the part of Buyer
or Seller or their respective directors, officers, employees, partners,
managers, members or stockholders, and all rights and obligations of any
Party hereto shall cease, except for the agreements contained in this _Section
8.2_

 

8.3 _Survival after Termination_. Section _ 8.2_ and _Article 10_ survive
termination of the Agreement. 

9. _SURVIVAL OF COVENANTS, AGREEMENTS, REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES; INDEMNIFICATION_. 

 

9.1 _Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants_.

 

9.1.1 All covenants or agreements in this Agreement and the Transaction
Documents which by their terms are to be performed, if at all, after the
Closing Date shall survive the Closing. Except as otherwise provided in this
_Article 9_ , each of the representations and warranties contained in _Article
3_ and _Article 4_ and all covenants and agreements in this Agreement and
the Transaction Documents which are to be performed at or prior to Closing
including without limitation those in _Article 5_ , will terminate, without
further action, on the date that is the twelve (12) month anniversary of the
Closing Date (the "Anniversary Date"); provided, however, that the
representations and warranties set forth in _Sections 3.1_, _3.2_ , _3.3_ ,
_3.8_ , _3.13_ , _3.19_ , _4.1_ , _4.2, 4.6 _ and the first sentence only of
_Section 3.5_ shall survive and continue until expiration of the statutes of
limitations applicable with respect to matters arising under such sections.

 

9.1.2 The indemnification contained in this _Article 9_ will survive the
Closing and shall remain in effect:

 

(i) to the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations with respect to
any indemnifiable claim related to (A) the breach of any covenants or
agreements in this Agreement and the Transaction Documents which by their
terms are to be performed, if at all, after the Closing Date or (B) the breach
of any representation or warranty that pursuant to  _Section 9.1.1_ survives
until the expiration of its applicable statute of limitations,

(ii) indefinitely with respect to any indemnifiable claim arising under
_Section 9.2.1(iii)_ or _Section 9.2.2(iii)_; or

(iii) until the Anniversary Date for any indemnifiable claims that are not
specified in _Section 9.1.2(i)_ or _Section 9.1.2(ii)_.

 

Unless a claim for indemnification with respect to any alleged breach of any
such covenant, agreement, representation or warranty is asserted by
notice given as herein provided that identifies a particular breach and the
underlying facts relating thereto, which notice is given within the applicable
period of survival for such covenant, agreement, representation or warranty,
such claim may not be pursued and is irrevocably waived after such time.
Without limiting the generality or effect of the foregoing sentence, no claim
for indemnification with respect to any such covenant, agreement,
representation or warranty will be deemed to have been properly made except
(i) to the extent it is based upon a Third Party Claim or (ii) to the extent
based on Indemnifiable Losses incurred by an Indemnitee for which
indemnification is provided under _Sections 9.2.1_ or _9.2.2_ , and such
indemnification claim is made or brought prior to the expiration of the
survival period for such covenant, agreement, representation or warranty. For
purposes of clarity, claims asserted in a written notice thereof (which
reasonably describes such claim and provides reasonable evidence thereof)
delivered to the other Party before the applicable period of survival for such
covenant, agreement, representation or warranty terminates shall be deemed
timely made regardless of whether litigation or arbitration proceedings are
commenced by such date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, if either party makes a claim for indemnification in writing and in
accordance with the terms of this 

 



40  Agreement with respect to any matter for which indemnification is provided
under _Section 9.2.1_ or _9.2.2_ prior to the applicable expiration date as
provided in this  _Section 9.1.2_, the indemnification contained in this
_Article 9_ with respect to such claim shall survive with respect to all
Indemnifiable Losses resulting from or with respect to the claim identified in
such timely notice, whenever incurred, until such claim is finally resolved
in accordance with the terms hereof.

9.2 _Indemnification_. 

9.2.1 Following the Closing, and subject to the other sections of this
_Article 9_, Seller will indemnify, defend and hold harmless Buyer and its
Affiliates and their respective directors, officers, and agents from and
against all Indemnifiable Losses relating to, resulting from or arising out
of:

 

(i) any inaccuracy in or breach of any of the representations and warranties
made by Seller in _Article 3_ and the certificate provided by Seller
pursuant to _Section 7.2.4_ of this Agreement;

(ii) a breach by Seller of any covenant or agreement of Seller contained in
this Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents; and

(iii) any of the Excluded Liabilities.

9.2.2 Following the Closing, and subject to the other sections of this
_Article 9_, Buyer will indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller and its
Affiliates and their respective directors, officers and agents from and
against all Indemnifiable Losses relating to, resulting from or arising out
of:

(i) any inaccuracy in or breach of any of the representations or
warranties made by Buyer in _Article 4_ and the certificate provided by
Buyer pursuant to _Section 7.3.4_ of this Agreement;

(ii) a breach by Buyer of any covenant or agreement of Buyer contained in this
Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents; and

 

(iii) any of the Assumed Liabilities.

9.2.3 All payments made by Seller or by Buyer (or any of their respective
Affiliates), as the case may be, to or for the benefit of other Party pursuant
to _Section 2.5_ or this  _Article 9_ shall be treated as adjustments to
the Purchase Price for tax purposes, and such agreed treatment shall govern
for purposes of this Agreement. Buyer and Seller shall file all Tax Returns
consistent with such treatment. As between Buyer and Seller, upon the
settlement or resolution of any claim for indemnification while the Escrow
remains held by the Escrow Agent, Buyer and Seller agree to provide joint
written instructions to the Escrow Agent regarding the disbursement of funds
to the applicable Party, all in accordance with the Escrow Agreement.

9.3 _Limitations on Liability_.

9.3.1 For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms have the meanings
set forth below:

 

"Indemnification Payment" means any amount of Indemnifiable Losses required to
be paid pursuant to this Agreement; 

"Indemnitee" means any Person entitled to indemnification under this
Agreement;

 

"Indemnifying Party" means any Person required to provide indemnification
under this Agreement; and

 

"Indemnifiable Losses" means any losses, liabilities, damages, costs,
expenses, assessments, fines, interest, penalties, awards, deficiencies and
other obligations and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and
expenses and out-of-pocket expenses incurred in investigating, preparing or
defending the foregoing) actually incurred, including any actual
or threatened suits, claims, demands and assessments and all judgments and

 



41  settlements related thereto, in any such case (x) reduced by the amount of
insurance proceeds actually recovered from any Person or entity with respect
thereto and (y) excluding any such losses, liabilities, damages, costs and
expenses to the extent that the underlying liability or obligation or such
losses, liabilities, damages, costs or expenses is the result of the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of the Indemnitee, any of its Affiliates or
any officer, employee, agent or the Indemnitee or any of its Affiliates.

9.3.2 As between Seller and any Affiliate, successor or assign of Seller, on
the one hand, and Buyer and any Affiliate, successor or assign of Buyer, on
the other hand, the remedies, rights and obligations set forth in this
_Article 9 _will be the exclusive remedies, rights and obligations with
respect to the liabilities and obligations referred to in _Sections 9.2.1(i),
9.2.1(ii), 9.2.2(i) _and _9.2.2(ii)_ , except with respect to matters
involving fraud. Without limiting the foregoing, as a material inducement to
entering into this Agreement, to the fullest extent permitted by law, each of
the Parties waives any claim or cause of action that it otherwise might assert
based upon any breach of the covenants, agreements, representations or
warranties referenced in _Sections 9.2.1(i), 9.2.1(ii), 9.2.2(i) _and
_9.2.2(ii)_ of this Agreement, except for claims or causes of action brought
under and subject to the terms and conditions of this  _Article 9_ and
except with respect to matters involving fraud.

9.3.3 Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or of any
applicable law, except for Indemnifiable Losses arising out of or relating to
any breach of covenants or agreements required to be performed after Closing
or any breach or inaccuracy of representations and warranties under 
_Sections 3.1_, _3.2_ , _3.8_ , _4.1_ , _4.2_ and the first sentence only of
_Section 3.5_ (none of which shall be subject to this _Section 9.3.3_), no
Indemnitee will be entitled to indemnification for a claim against an
Indemnifying Party for any Indemnifiable Losses arising out of or relating to
any breach of any covenant, agreement or breach or inaccuracy of
representations or warranties under _Sections 9.2.1(i)_ and _9.2.1(ii)_  for
claims against Seller or under _Sections 9.2.2(i)_ and _9.2.2(ii)_ , for
claims against Buyer, until the aggregate amount of Indemnifiable Losses
incurred by such Indemnitee exceeds $1,000,000.00 (all amounts up to and
including such amount, the "Basket Amount"); provided, however, that in the
event that the aggregate amount of Indemnifiable Losses incurred by such
Indemnitee exceeds the Basket Amount, then such Indemnifying Party shall only
be liable for Indemnifiable Losses to the extent they exceed the Basket
Amount.

9.3.4 Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the
indemnification obligations of the Seller under _Sections 9.2.1(i)_ and
_9.2.1(ii)_ or the indemnification obligations of Buyer under _Section
9.2.2(i_) and _9.2.2(ii)_ shall not exceed an amount equal to the amount of
the Escrow, respectively (the "Cap Limitation"); provided, however, that the
Cap Limitation shall not apply to breaches of the representations and
warranties set forth in _Sections 3.1_, _3.2_ ,  _3.3_ , _3.8_ , _3.13 __,_
_3.19 __,_ _4.1_ , _4.2_ , _4.6_ and the first sentence only of _Section 3.5_
or to matters involving fraud. Subject to the limitations in this  _Article
9_ , including without limitation _Section 9.3.3_ and _9.3.4_ , Seller shall
be obligated to provide indemnification to Buyer from the Escrow Fund, and to
the extent the Escrow Fund is insufficient, Seller shall be obligated to
provide indemnification to Buyer directly, for all Indemnifiable Losses that
are properly and timely asserted pursuant to _Section 9.2.1_, subject to the
terms and conditions hereof. Buyer shall be obligated to
provide indemnification to Seller directly for all Indemnifiable Losses that
are properly and timely asserted pursuant to _Section 9.2.2_, subject to the
terms and conditions hereof.

 

9.3.5 No Indemnifying Party shall be liable to or obligated to indemnify any
Indemnitee hereunder for any punitive or exemplary damages, or any
consequential, special or multiple damages, except to the extent such damages
are asserted or have been recovered by a third person (including a
Governmental Authority) and are the subject of a Third Party Claim for
which indemnification is available under this _Article 9_.

9.3.6 No Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification hereunder for any
Indemnifiable Losses arising from a breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement set forth herein (and the amount of any Indemnifiable
Losses incurred in respect of such breach shall not be included in
the calculation of any limitations on indemnification set forth herein) to
the extent that such liability is included as a specific monetary amount in
the calculation of the Estimated Working Capital and/or the Closing Working
Capital.

 

9.3.7 Any liability for indemnification under this _Section 9.3_ shall be
determined without duplication of recovery by reason of the state of facts
giving rise to such liability constituting a breach of more than one
representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement.

 



42 9.4 _Defense of Claims_.

9.4.1 If any Indemnitee receives written notice of the assertion of any claim
or of the commencement of any action or proceeding by any Third Party (a
"Third Party Claim") against such Indemnitee, with respect to which an
Indemnifying Party is obligated to provide indemnification under this
Agreement, the Indemnitee will give such Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt
written notice thereof, but in any event not later than ten (10) calendar days
after receipt of notice of such Third Party Claim; provided, however, that the
failure of the Indemnitee to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall only
relieve the Indemnifying Party from its obligation to indemnify the Indemnitee
pursuant to this _Article 9_ to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is
materially prejudiced by such failure (whether as a result of the forfeiture
of substantive rights or defenses or otherwise). Upon receipt of notification
of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Parties, shall be entitled, upon
written notice to the Indemnitee, to assume the investigation and defense
thereof, provided, however, that the Indemnifying Parties shall not have the
right to assume and control the investigation and the defense (or to continue
to control the investigation and defense) if (i) the Third Party Claim relates
to or arises in connection with a criminal proceeding, action, indictment,
allegation or investigation by a Governmental Authority, (ii) an Indemnifying
Party has failed to defend or is failing to defend in good faith the Third
Party Claim, (iii) an Indemnifying Party and the Indemnitee are both named
parties to the Third Party Claim, and the Indemnitee reasonably concludes
based on the advice of counsel that representation of both parties by the same
counsel would be or could reasonably be expected to become inappropriate
under applicable ethical standards due to actual or potential conflicting
interests, (iv) in the case of any losses, liabilities, damages, claims,
awards, judgments, costs and expenses (including, without limitation,
reasonable attorneys fees) (collectively, "Losses") suffered by Buyer, such
Losses in Buyers good faith judgment could result in Indemnifiable Losses in
excess of the Cap Limitation, or (v) an Indemnifying Party does not, in the
Indemnitees reasonable judgment, have sufficient financial resources to
satisfy the amount of any adverse judgment that is reasonably likely to result
with respect to such Third Party Claim. Whether or not the Indemnifying Party
elects to assume the investigation and defense of any Third Party Claim, the
Indemnitee shall have the right to employ separate counsel and to participate
in the investigation and defense thereof; provided, however, that
the Indemnitee shall pay the fees and disbursements of such separate counsel
unless (i) the employment of such separate counsel has been specifically
authorized in writing by the Indemnifying Party, (ii) the Indemnifying Party
has failed to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim within a
reasonable time after receipt of notice thereof or has ceased (or is required
to cease) the defense of such claim, or (iii) the named parties to the
proceeding in which such claim, demand, action or cause of action has been
asserted include both the Indemnifying Party and such Indemnitee and, in the
reasonable judgment of counsel to such Indemnitee, there exists one or more
defenses that are in conflict with those available to the Indemnifying Party.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for
the fees and disbursements of more than one counsel for all Indemnitees in
connection with any one proceeding or any similar or related
proceedings arising from the same general allegations or circumstances.
Without the prior written consent of the Indemnitee, the Indemnifying Party
will not enter into any settlement of any Third Party Claim that would result
in (A) the imposition of a consent order, injunction, decree or judgment that
would restrict the future activity or conduct of, or impose any non-monetary
liability, obligation or commitment on, the Indemnitee or any of its
Affiliates, (B) a finding or admission of a violation of Law or violation of
the rights of any Person by the Indemnitee or any of its Affiliates, (C) a
finding or admission that would have an adverse effect on other claims made or
threatened or reasonably anticipated to be made against the Indemnitee or any
of its Affiliates, or (D) any monetary liability of the Indemnitee that shall
not be promptly paid or reimbursed by the Indemnifying Party. Any such
settlement or compromise shall include as an unconditional term thereof the
giving by the claimant of a release of the Indemnitee and the Indemnified
Party from all liability with respect to such Third Party Claim. If a
settlement offer solely for money damages is made by the applicable third
party claimant (which offer provides for a full and unconditional release of
the Indemnitee), and the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnitee in writing
of the Indemnifying Partys willingness to accept the settlement offer and pay
the amount called for by such offer without reservation of any rights or
defenses against the Indemnitee, the Indemnitee may continue to contest such
claim, free of any participation by the Indemnifying Party, and the
Indemnifying Party shall have no obligation to the Indemnitee hereunder with
respect to such claim and, if the Indemnifying Party is a co-defendant and as
a result of not being able to settle on the terms rejected by the Indemnitee,
the Indemnifying Party is found liable for, or settles the claims against
the Indemnifying Party for more than the Indemnifying Party could have
settled such claims, then the Indemnitee will indemnify the Indemnifying Party
hereunder for such excess.

9.4.2 Any claim by an Indemnitee on account of an Indemnifiable Loss that does
not result from a Third Party Claim will be asserted by giving the
Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt written notice thereof,

 



43  but in any event not later than 30 calendar days after the later to occur of
the incurrence or discovery thereof, provided, however, that the failure of
the Indemnitee to notify the Indemnifying Party within such 30 calendar days
shall only relieve the Indemnifying Party from its obligation to indemnify the
Indemnitee pursuant to this _Article 9_ to the extent that the Indemnifying
Party is materially prejudiced by such failure (whether as a result of the
forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses or otherwise); provided that no
Indemnifying Party will have any liability for a claim notice of which is not
received by the Indemnifying Party within 30 calendar days of the applicable
expiration date specified in Section 9.1.2 or 9.2.2, respectively. The
Indemnifying Party will have a period of 30 calendar days after receipt of a
timely notice of claim within which to respond in writing to such claim. If
the Indemnifying Party does not so respond within such thirty (30) calendar
day period following receipt of a timely claim, the Indemnifying Party will be
deemed to have rejected such claim, in which event the Indemnitee will be free
to pursue such remedies as may be available to the Indemnitee on the terms
and subject to the provisions of this _Article 9_.

 

9.4.3 If, after the making of any Indemnification Payment, the amount of the
Indemnifiable Loss to which such payment relates is reduced by actual
recovery, settlement or otherwise under any insurance coverage, or pursuant to
any claim, recovery, settlement or payment by or against any other entity, the
amount of such reduction (less any costs, expenses, premiums or
Taxes incurred in connection therewith) will promptly be repaid by the
Indemnitee to the Indemnifying Party. Upon making any Indemnification Payment,
the Indemnifying Party will, to the extent of such Indemnification Payment, be
subrogated to all rights of the Indemnitee against any third party in respect
of the Indemnifiable Loss to which the Indemnification Payment relates;
provided that (i) the Indemnifying Party shall then be in compliance with its
obligations under this Agreement in respect of such Indemnifiable Loss, and
(ii) until the Indemnitee recovers full payment of its Indemnifiable Loss, all
claims of the Indemnifying Party against any such third party on account of
said Indemnification Payment will be subrogated and subordinated in right of
payment to the Indemnitees rights against such third party on account of said
Indemnification Payment. Without limiting the generality or effect of any
other provision of this _Article 9_, each such Indemnitee and Indemnifying
Party will duly execute upon request all instruments reasonably necessary to
evidence and perfect the above-described subrogation and subordination rights.

10. _MISCELLANEOUS_. 

10.1 _Notices_. All notices, demands and requests required or permitted to
be given under the provisions of this Agreement shall be (i) in writing; (ii)

10.7 _Entire Agreement; Amendments_. This Agreement, all schedules and
exhibits hereto, and all documents and certificates to be delivered by the
Parties pursuant hereto collectively represent the entire understanding and

this Agreement shall be adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction to
be invalid, prohibited or unenforceable for any reason, so long as the
economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party, such provision, as to
such jurisdiction, shall be ineffective, without invalidating the remaining
provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of
this Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of such provision
in any other jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, so long as the
economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party, if such provision
could be more narrowly drawn so as not to be invalid, prohibited or
unenforceable in such jurisdiction, it shall, as to such jurisdiction, be so
narrowly drawn, without invalidating the remaining provisions of this
Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of such provision in
any other jurisdiction.

10.11 _Counterparts; Delivery of Signatures by Facsimile or
Electronic Delivery_. This Agreement may be signed in any number of
counterparts with the same effect as if the signature on each such counterpart
were upon the same instrument, and a facsimile transmission or electronic
delivery of a manual signature shall be deemed to be an original signature.

10.12 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement constitutes an
agreement solely among the Parties, and is not intended to and will not confer
any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities, legal or equitable on any
Person (including any employee or former employee of the Seller) other than
the Parties and their respective successors or permitted assigns and, solely
with respect to _Article 9_ , the Indemnitees, or otherwise constitute any
Person a third party beneficiary under or by reason of this Agreement.

 



46  

10.13 _Construction; Disclosure Schedules_. This Agreement has been
negotiated by Buyer and the Seller and their respective legal counsel, and
legal or equitable principles that might require the construction of this
Agreement or any provision of this Agreement against the party drafting this
Agreement shall not apply in any construction or interpretation of
this Agreement. In this Agreement (a) the words "hereof," "herein," "hereto,"
"hereunder," and words of similar import may refer to this Agreement as a
whole and not merely to a specific section, paragraph, or clause in which the
respective word appears, (b) words importing gender include the other gender
as appropriate, (c) any terms defined in this Agreement may, unless the
context otherwise requires, be used in the singular or the plural depending
on the reference, (d) unless otherwise stated, references to any Section,
Article, Schedule or Exhibit are to such Section or Article of, or Schedule or
Exhibit to, this Agreement, (e) the words "include", "includes", and
"including" are deemed in each case to be followed by the words "without
limitation," (f) the word "shall" denotes a directive and obligation, and not
an option, (g) references to a Person are also to its permitted successors
and assigns and (h) the word "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" means the
degree to which a subject or thing extends, and such phrase shall not simply
mean "if." Any reference to any federal, state, local or foreign statute or
law shall be deemed also to refer to all rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, unless the context requires otherwise, and any reference to any
agreement, instrument or statute herein means such agreement, instrument or
statute as from time to time amended, modified or supplemented, including (in
the case of agreements or instruments) by waiver or consent and (in the case
of statutes) by succession of comparable successor statutes and references to
all attachments thereto and instruments incorporated therein. Except where
expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, whenever a Party hereto is
allowed or required to provide a consent, approval or waiver or to take any
discretionary action or make any discretionary determination with respect to
any matter, unless the applicable provision explicitly states to the contrary,
such consent, approval, waiver action or determination may be given, taken,
made or withheld in such Partys sole, complete and absolute discretion.
Disclosure of information included on any disclosure schedule (or portion of
any disclosure schedule) shall be considered disclosures for all other
disclosure schedules (or other portions of other disclosure schedules) to the
extent that it is reasonably apparent from the face of such disclosure that
such disclosure is applicable to such other disclosure schedules (or other
portions of disclosure schedules). In addition, (a) the fact that any
disclosure on any schedule is not required to be disclosed in order to render
the applicable representation or warranty to which it relates true, or that
the absence of such disclosure on any schedule would not constitute a breach
of such representation or warranty, shall not be deemed or construed to expand
the scope of any representation or warranty hereunder or to establish a
standard of disclosure in respect of any representation or warranty and (b)
disclosure of a particular matter on any schedule shall not be construed to
mean that such matter is material or would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

 

10.14 _Specific Performance_. Seller acknowledges that the unique nature of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may render money damages an
inadequate remedy for the breach by Seller of its obligations under this
Agreement. Seller agrees that in the event of such breach by Seller, absent
any right of Seller at such time to terminate this Agreement in
accordance with its terms, (i) Buyer may, upon proper action instituted by
it, be entitled to seek a decree of specific performance of this Agreement,
and (ii) such rights are cumulative and in addition to any other remedy to
which Buyer may be entitled at law or equity; provided that Buyer may not
exercise the right of specific performance so as to avoid the application of
the risk of loss and other damages provisions of _Sections 5.23_ , _6.1.11_ or
_6.2.6_ or the indemnification provisions of _Article 9_ (including without
limitation the application of the limitations therein on the survival of
certain agreements, covenants, representations and warranties and the Basket
Amount and Cap Limitation). Seller shall not be entitled to seek specific
performance in order to cause Buyer to consummate the transaction contemplated
by this Agreement.

TRANSITION SERVICES

AND

POST CLOSING SERVICES AGREEMENT

 

This Transition Services and Post Closing Services Agreement ("Agreement") is
entered into this 15th day of October, 2010, by and between THE WORLD COMPANY,
a Kansas corporation ("Seller"), and KNOLOGY OF KANSAS, INC., a Delaware
corporation ("Buyer"). Seller and Buyer are each referred to herein as a
"Party" and are referred to together as the "Parties." 

WHEREAS, on August 3, 2010, Seller and Buyer entered into that certain Asset
Purchase Agreement (the "Asset Purchase Agreement") pursuant to which Buyer
shall purchase certain assets owned by Seller located in Kansas, as more fully
described in the Asset Purchase Agreement; and

WHEREAS, the Parties have agreed to enter into this Agreement (a) to more
specifically identify the forms of support, services and cooperation to be
provided by one Party to the other during the period following the date
hereof through and including a transitional period that will begin on the
Closing Date and extend through the one-year anniversary of the Closing Date,
and (b) to more specifically identify the post closing services to be
provided by Seller to Buyer and by Buyer to Seller; all of which shall be
provided in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of these premises, the mutual covenants
exchanged below, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, Seller and Buyer agree as
follows:

1\. _Definitions_. Except to the extent otherwise expressly provided in
this Agreement, capitalized terms used herein but not defined herein shall
have the meanings assigned to them in the Asset Purchase Agreement.

the date hereof and ending on the first to occur of (a) one (1) year after the
Closing Date, (b) termination of the Asset Purchase Agreement in accordance
with the terms of Section 8.1 thereof, (c) the completion of conversion
services and post closing services (collectively, the "Services") or (d) such
date upon which this Agreement is otherwise terminated (the "Termination
Date"). Buyer may elect to terminate any Services provided from Seller to
Buyer under this Agreement at any time, for any reason in its sole discretion,
upon providing sixty (60) days prior written notice to Seller and subject to
the payment by Buyer of any costs incurred by Seller in connection with such
termination; provided, however, that Buyer shall not be released by reason of
any such termination from any obligation to pay Seller in connection with any
Services provided before the date of such termination.

3.  _Conversion Related Services_.

3.1. Commencing on the date hereof and ending on the completion of the final
milestone set forth in Schedule 1 (the "Conversion Period"), the Parties will
perform and complete the applicable activities according to the milestones
established in Schedule 1 ("Conversion Transition Plan"), and Seller will
provide Buyer with all of the data, processes and deliverables in Sellers
possession which are necessary for the completion of the Conversion Transition
Plan. The Conversion Transition Plan will be completed during the Conversion
Period. Buyer and Seller will use commercially reasonable efforts to complete
the Conversion Transition Plan on the time frames set forth in Schedule 1.

3.2. Except as otherwise required by this Agreement or the Asset Purchase
Agreement, each Party shall be directly responsible for its own expenses,
liabilities and costs, and those of its Affiliates, that are incurred in
connection with the execution of the Conversion Transition Plan, provided,
however, that Buyer shall be responsible for any third party expenses related
to the conversion, and as long as Buyer has authorized such expenses,
Buyer shall reimburse Seller for any necessary and documented out-of-pocket
third party costs incurred by Seller in facilitating the conversion. For
purposes of this section, "third party expenses" shall not include expenses of
the Seller or its Affiliates unless specifically provided herein. 4\. _Post-Closing Services_.

 

4.1. Seller agrees to provide the services described in Schedule 2, and Buyer
agrees to provide the services described in Schedule 3 (collectively, the
"Post-Closing Services").

4.2. Seller, and any of its applicable Affiliates, hereby agrees to provide
to Buyer all telecommunications services granted to Seller or any of its
applicable Affiliates by any relevant authority, including, but not limited
to, the Federal Communications Commission, the Kansas Corporation Commission
or the State of Kansas, or as granted to Seller or any of its applicable
Affiliates under any telecommunications service interconnection agreement with
any third party, for a period not to exceed sixty (60) days following the
Closing.

4.3. Buyer will have use of the domains and URLs specified in the Asset
Purchase Agreement for the purposes of server support and e-mail services to
subscribers as these services are currently provided for the System. Seller
shall cooperate with Buyer in transitioning current subscriber accounts as
soon as practicable from the Systems to Buyers systems, including, without
limitation, forwarding employees e-mails to addresses on Buyers network for
a period requested by Buyer not to exceed twelve (12) months following the
Closing. Seller shall not charge Buyer for the support and services described
in this Section 4.3.

4.4. Buyer and Seller, respectively, shall pay the fees described in Schedule
2 and Schedule 3 for the Post-Closing Services. These fees shall be due on the
last day of each month such Post-Closing Services are received, or, at the
sole discretion of the Party entitled to receive such fee, otherwise in the
normal course of business. All fees due under this Section 4.4 shall be paid
within thirty (30) days after the due date.

4.5. Any services or payments to be provided under a separate agreement
between or involving the Parties shall be governed by such separate agreement.

 

5\. _Obligations of Cooperation_.

5.1. The Parties will cooperate in good faith with each other to make any
mutually acceptable revisions to the Conversion Transition Plan as reasonably
needed to transition the functions and operations of the Business as
contemplated herein.

5.2. Each Party will use good faith efforts to perform the tasks required of
it under the Conversion Transition Plan in accordance with the respective
schedules for the completion of such tasks. Each Party acknowledges and agrees
that if any tasks of a Party are necessarily conditioned on the completion of
any prerequisites or other tasks to be completed by the other Party (or any
third party vendors of the other Party), then the first Party will not be
obligated to perform its tasks until such conditions or prerequisites are
performed in an appropriate, proper and timely manner. Each Party agrees to
give the other Party prompt notice of the other Partys nonperformance or
inadequate performance under this Agreement. Buyer is responsible for the
overall management of the transition and will use good faith efforts to keep
the transition on schedule and to identify and resolve any problems in the
timely completion of each task.

6\. _Payment Disputes_. In the event that either Party disputes any amount of
the other Partys claim for fees or reimbursement payable under this
Agreement, the disputing Party shall promptly provide to the other Party a
written "Notice of Disagreement." During the 15-day period following the
delivery of a Notice of Disagreement, Seller and Buyer shall seek in good
faith to resolve any differences which they may have with respect to any
matter specified in the Notice of Disagreement, and each shall provide the
other with reasonable access to any books, records, working papers or other
information reasonably necessary or useful in the preparation or
calculation of the claim which is disputed in the Notice of Disagreement. If,
at the end of such 15-day period, any of the matters specified in the Notice
of Disagreement remain unresolved, then the Parties shall submit all such
unresolved matters to a nationally recognized independent public accounting
firm to be agreed upon by Seller and Buyer (the "Independent Accountants") for
the purpose of determining a final resolution. The Independent Accountants
shall 

 



50  render a decision resolving the matters submitted to the Independent
Accountants within 15 days following submission thereto (or as soon thereafter
as reasonably practicable). The fees and expenses of the Independent
Accountants incurred pursuant to this Agreement shall be shared equally by
Buyer and Seller.

 

7\. _Cessation of Services; Termination; Limitation of Damages_.

 

7.1. Sellers obligations under this Agreement to provide Services to Buyer
shall not in any way be deemed a promise by Seller or any of its Affiliates
to continue in its or their employ any person who is an employee of Seller on
the date of this Agreement or on the Closing Date. In addition, neither Seller
nor any of its Affiliates shall have any obligation to provide for the
replacement of any employee whose services are discontinued, whether
voluntarily or involuntarily, in any fashion, whether through hire,
reassignment or otherwise.

 

7.2. Except in the event of willful misconduct by a Party, neither Party will
be liable to the other Party for any consequential, special, punitive or
exemplary damages, including damages arising from loss or interruption of
business, profits, business opportunities or goodwill, loss or use of
facilities, loss of capital, claims of customers, or any cost or expenses
related thereto, except to the extent such damages have been recovered by a
third party and are subject to a claim for indemnity pursuant to this
Agreement or the Asset Purchase Agreement.

 

8\. _Indemnification_.

8.1. Buyer shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Seller and its
Affiliates and their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents
from and against any Indemnifiable Losses to person or property caused by the
willful acts of Buyer or its employees in connection with this Agreement.
Seller shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Buyer and its Affiliates and
their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents from and against
any Indemnifiable Losses to person or property caused by willful acts of
Seller or its employees in connection with this Agreement.

8.2. If the Services infringe any third party Intellectual Property, or if
Seller has reason to believe that the Services may infringe any third party
Intellectual Property, then in either such event, Seller will, at Buyers
request and expense, procure for Buyer the right to continue receiving the
Services or modify the Services to make them non-infringing. If Seller is
enjoined from providing any of the Services at any time, then Seller may
terminate/cancel such Services upon notice to Buyer.

8.3. Section 9.2 of the Asset Purchase Agreement is hereby incorporated by
reference into this Agreement and shall apply to any claims for indemnity
brought pursuant to this Section 8\.

9\. _Proprietary and Confidential Information_. Section 5.2 of the Asset
Purchase Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement shall govern the
disclosure of all confidential or proprietary information disclosed by one
Party to the other Party pursuant to this Agreement. For the avoidance of
doubt, Seller and Buyer may use information described in the Confidentiality
Agreement, as necessary, to provide or use the Services contemplated in this
Agreement.

10\. _Miscellaneous_.

 

10.1. This Agreement, together with the Asset Purchase Agreement and the other
agreements referenced therein, embodies the entire agreement and
understanding of the Parties hereto in respect of the subject matter contained
herein. This Agreement and the Asset Purchase Agreement supersede all prior
agreements and understandings between the Parties hereto with respect to such
subject matter, and this Agreement shall not be modified or amended except in
a subsequent writing signed by the Parties.

10.2. If any provision of this Agreement shall be held by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be invalid, unenforceable or void, then such provision shall
be construed, to the extent feasible, so as to render

 



51  it enforceable and to provide for the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby in substantially the same manner as originally set forth
herein and, if no feasible interpretation would save such provision, it shall
be severed from the remainder of this Agreement, which shall remain in full
force and effect unless the severed provision is essential and material to the
rights of either Party. In such event, the Parties shall negotiate, in good
faith, a substitute, valid and enforceable provision or agreement which most
nearly conveys the Parties intent in entering into this Agreement.

 

10.3. Neither the waiver by either Party of a breach of, or a default under,
any of the provisions of this Agreement, nor the failure of either Party, on
one or more occasions, to enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement or
to exercise any right or privilege hereunder shall thereafter be construed as
a waiver of any subsequent breach or default of a similar nature, or as a
waiver of any of such provisions, rights, or privileges hereunder.

10.4. The Parties acknowledge and agree that in the event any provision of
this Agreement conflicts with any provision of the Asset Purchase Agreement,
the terms of this Agreement shall control solely with respect to the Services
and payments provided hereunder. 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties, acting by and through their duly authorized
representatives, have executed this Agreement as of the day and year first
above written.

West Point, Georgia 31833

Ladies and Gentlemen:

This Restrictive Covenants Agreement (the "Agreement") is entered into this
___ day of _____________, 2010 (the "Effective Date") by and among The World
Company, a Kansas corporation ("Seller"), Dolph C. Simons, Jr., an individual
resident of the State of Kansas ("Dolph Simons"), Dan C. Simons, an individual
resident of the State of Kansas ("Dan Simons," and together with Dolph
Simons, the "Principals" and each individually, a "Principal"), and Knology
of Kansas, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Buyer"), and Knology, Inc., a
Delaware corporation ("Parent"). Reference is made to that certain Asset
Purchase Agreement, dated as of _______________, 2010 (the "Asset Purchase
Agreement"), by and between Seller and Buyer, pursuant to which Buyer has
purchased and acquired from Seller (with funds Buyer has received from
Parent), and Seller has sold, substantially all of the assets of Sellers
Division that conducts the Business. Capitalized terms used in this Agreement
but not defined in this Agreement shall have the meanings given to such terms
in the Asset Purchase Agreement. Further, the Asset Purchase Agreement is
hereby incorporated herein by this reference.

Parent is the ultimate stockholder of Buyer and will benefit, directly or
indirectly, from the transactions contemplated by the Asset Purchase
Agreement. Parent, Buyer and all of their respective subsidiaries are
hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Knology Group."

The Seller has several direct or indirect subsidiaries such as
Mediaphormedia, LLC, Orbiter, L.L.C., StoryMarket L.L.C. and Free State
Communications, LLC. and an Affiliate known as WorldWest Limited Liability
Company (collectively, the "Seller Parties"). Seller, Seller Parties and all
of their respective subsidiaries are hereinafter collectively referred to as
the "Seller Group."

The Seller Group has conducted and shall continue to conduct during and after
the Restricted Period (as defined below) within and without the Territory (as
defined below) multiple media businesses other than the Business conducted by
the Division (collectively, the "Seller Group Continuing Businesses"). The
Seller Group Continuing Businesses are described in more detail on _Exhibit B_
attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference.

Seller acknowledges that on the Closing Date, and immediately prior to the
consummation of the transaction contemplated by the Asset Purchase Agreement,
Seller owned all of the Assets, and therefore, Seller received all of the
consideration payable pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement on account of
the sale of the Assets thereunder. Sellers agreement to the restrictions set
forth herein is an essential condition to Buyers willingness to enter into
the Asset Purchase Agreement and for Buyer, with funds supplied by Parent, to
pay Seller the consideration contemplated thereunder. Without this Agreement
being made by Seller, Buyer and Parent would not consummate the transactions
contemplated by the Asset Purchase Agreement at any price.

Dolph Simons acknowledges that on the Closing Date, and immediately prior to
the consummation of the transaction contemplated by the Asset Purchase
Agreement, he was the beneficiary of an irrevocable trust which owned
approximately 2.55% of the securities of Seller, and therefore, he received a
material benefit as a beneficiary  of such trust from the transactions accomplished pursuant to the Asset
Purchase Agreement. Dolph Simons agreement to the restrictions set forth
herein is an essential condition to Buyers willingness to enter into the
Asset Purchase Agreement and for Buyer, with funds supplied by Parent, to pay
Seller the consideration contemplated thereunder. Without this Agreement being
made by Dolph Simons, Buyer and Parent would not consummate the transactions
contemplated by the Asset Purchase Agreement at any price.

Dan Simons acknowledges that on the Closing Date, and immediately prior to
the consummation of the transaction contemplated by the Asset Purchase
Agreement, he and his descendants were beneficiaries of several irrevocable
trusts which owned approximately 25% of the securities of Seller, and
therefore, he received a material benefit as a beneficiary of such trust from
the transactions accomplished pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement. Dan
Simons agreement to the restrictions set forth herein is an
essential condition to Buyers willingness to enter into the Asset Purchase
Agreement and for Buyer, with funds supplied by Parent, to pay Seller the
consideration contemplated thereunder. Without this Agreement being made by
Dan Simons, Buyer and Parent would not consummate the transactions
contemplated by the Asset Purchase Agreement at any price.

In consideration of the foregoing, for the sum of $100.00 cash in hand paid
to each of Seller, Dolph Simons and Dan Simons by each of Parent and Buyer,
and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency
thereof being hereby acknowledged, Seller and each Principal hereby covenant
and agree as follows:



   1. | During the period (the "Restricted Period") commencing on the date
hereof and continuing until ___________, 2013, except with Buyers
and Parents prior written consent, Seller will not, and it will not permit
the Seller Parties to, individually or collectively, own, manage, operate,
control, participate or engage (including as a partner in a joint venture or
similar arrangement), directly or indirectly, in the business of owning or
operating a Competing Business in the Territory. An enterprise (other than the
Seller Group Continuing Businesses operated by the Seller Group) shall be
deemed to be engaged in a "Competing Business" if it directly or indirectly
does any of the following (collectively, the "Services") by any means or
method whatsoever, including, without limitation, by wireless delivery: (i)
provides, or provides access to, television or video services; (ii) provides
internet access; (iii) provides, or provides access to, telephone or message
services; or (iv) provides, or provides access to, television programming or
video production services, in each case to any person or entity including,
without limitation, to individuals, businesses, wholesellers or resellers. The
term "Territory" shall mean any of the geographic areas that are as of the
date hereof covered by the franchises listed on _Exhibit A_ attached hereto.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this
Agreement shall be deemed to prohibit or restrict the Seller Group from, and
the term "Services" shall not include Seller Group or the Principals doing
any of the following: (A) performing Services at the written request of and on
behalf of the Knology Group, (B) owning the securities of any issuer that
provides Services in the Territory if such issuers securities are listed on
a national securities exchange, the NASDAQ Stock Market or otherwise publicly-
traded, which securities constitute less than 5% of the fully-diluted shares
of common stock of such issuer and are held for investment purposes only, (C)
owning, acquiring or otherwise holding, directly or indirectly, any passive
investments in any publicly-traded mutual fund to which such Principal does
not provide direction or have control, authority or input with respect to the
investment in and management of the companies in which such entity invests (a
"Fund"), any of which Funds may acquire interests in any publicly-traded
corporation engaged in a Competing Business or (D) engaging in the Seller
Group Continuing Businesses.

   2. |

During the Restricted Period commencing on the date hereof and continuing
until ___________, 2013 (date to be inserted will be three years from
closing date), except with Buyers and Parents prior written consent or as
provided in this Agreement, each Principal agrees that he will not serve as an
officer, director, employee, consultant or advisor of, or directly or
indirectly own any interest or investment in or make any loan to, any
individual proprietorship, partnership, corporation, limited liability
company, joint venture, or any other form of business entity or association
whatsoever (except on behalf of and at the written request of the Knology
Group), if such entity is directly or indirectly engaged in whole or in part
in any Competing Business in the Territory. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed
to prohibit or restrict such Principal from: (A) performing Services at the
written request of and on behalf of the Knology Group, (B) owning the
securities of any issuer that  

---|--- 
 



58  provides Services in the Territory if such issuers securities are listed on

traded, which securities constitute less than 5% of the fully-diluted shares
of common stock of such issuer and are held for investment purposes only, (C)
owning, acquiring or otherwise holding, directly or indirectly, any passive
investments in any publicly-traded mutual fund to which such Principal does
not provide direction or have control, authority or input with respect to the
investment in and management of the companies in which such Fund, any of which
Funds may acquire interests in any publicly-traded corporation engaged in a
Competing Business or (D) serving as an officer, director, employee,
consultant or advisor of, or directly or indirectly owning any interest or
investment in or make any loan to, any of the Seller Group Continuing
Businesses.  

---|--- 



   3. | Seller and each Principal agrees that the solicitation by Seller,
either Principal or any of the Seller Parties of any employee of Knology
Broadband, Inc. or Customer (as defined below) of the Knology Group would
have an adverse impact on the Knology Group. During the Restricted Period,
Seller and each Principal will not, and will cause the Seller Parties to not,
directly or indirectly: 
---|--- 
 



     | a) | solicit or attempt in any manner to solicit any Customer of
the Knology Group with respect to any Services, or to persuade or attempt to
persuade any Customer to cease to do business with the Knology Group, or to
reduce the amount of business that any Customer is then doing with the Knology
Group; or 
---|---|--- 



     | b) | divert or attempt to entice away from the employ of Knology
Broadband, Inc., or assist anyone else to divert or entice away from Knology
Broadband, Inc. who is then an employee of the Knology Broadband, Inc.; or 
---|---|--- 



     | c) | render any Services, or cause to be rendered any Services, to
or for any Customer. 
---|---|--- 
 

As used in this Agreement, "Customer" shall mean: (1) anyone who with respect
to the Services is a customer of the Division on the Closing Date, a customer
of the Knology Group on the Closing Date, or becomes a customer of the Knology
Group during the Restricted Period; (2) anyone who with respect to the
Services was a customer of the Division at any time during the six month
period immediately preceding the Closing Date; and (3) any prospective
customer with respect to the Services to whom the Division had made a formal
pitch or presentation at any time during the six month period immediately
preceding the Closing Date. Nothing in this Agreement (A) shall prohibit the
Seller Group from soliciting through general advertising or comparable forms
of general solicitation not specifically targeted at the Knology Groups
employees, (B) shall preclude the right of the Seller Group to employee such
personnel who on their initiative (including responding to employment
advertisements) seek employment with such person or (C) shall prohibit the
Seller Group from advertising to or soliciting its customers with respect the
Seller Group Continuing Businesses even if such customer is also a Customer of
the Division or the Knology Group.

 



   4. | Seller and each Principal will not at any time during the
Restricted Period disclose to any person or entity any confidential
information or trade secret of the Knology Group (such as, without
limitation, customer lists, marketing plans or budgets) or, except in
connection with the Seller Group Continuing Businesses, utilize such
confidential information or trade secret for Sellers or such Principals own
benefit or for the benefit of third parties, or disparage any member of the
Knology Group or any officer or director of any member of the Knology Group.
All memoranda, notes, records or other documents compiled by Seller or either
Principal that contains any such confidential information or trade secrets
shall also be subject to the foregoing sentence. The term "confidential
information or trade secret" does not include information that becomes
generally available to the public other than by breach of this paragraph.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller and each Principal shall be permitted to
disclose confidential information and trade secrets to Sellers or such
Principals advisors and legal representatives in connection with any dispute
among the parties pertaining to the subject matter of this Agreement or with
respect to the Seller Group Continuing Businesses; it being understood and
agreed that Seller and each Principal shall be and remain liable to the
Knology Group for any further disclosure by such party. 
---|--- 
 



59    5. | Each Principal acknowledges and agrees that his position with
Seller required the performance of services that were special, unique,
extraordinary and of an intellectual character; and his position with Seller
placed him in a position of confidence and trust with the customers and
employees of the Division. Accordingly, Seller and each Principal acknowledge
that the type and periods of the restrictions imposed by this Agreement are
fair and reasonable and are reasonably required for the protection of the
legitimate business interests of the Knology Group and the confidential
information, proprietary property and goodwill associated with the Assets and
the business being purchased pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement; and
that the time, scope, geographic area and other provisions of this Agreement
have been specifically negotiated by sophisticated commercial parties and are
given as an integral part of the transactions contemplated by the Asset
Purchase Agreement. If any of the covenants in this Agreement, or any part
hereof, is hereafter construed to be invalid or unenforceable, the same shall
not affect the remainder of the covenant or covenants, which shall be given
full effect, without regard to the invalid portions. In the event that any
covenant contained in this Agreement shall be determined by any court of
competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable by reason of its extending for too
great a period of time or over too great a geographical area or by reason of
its being too extensive in any other respect, it shall be interpreted to
extend only over the maximum period of time for which it may be
enforceable and/or over the maximum geographical area as to which it may be
enforceable and/or to the maximum extent in all other respects as to which it
may be enforceable, all as determined by such court in such action. The
existence of any claim or cause of action which Seller or either Principal
may have against the Knology Group or any of them shall not constitute a
defense or bar to the enforcement of any of the provisions of this Agreement
and must be pursued through separate court action by Seller or either
Principal. 
---|--- 



   6. | Seller and each Principal acknowledge that if Seller or either
Principal commits a breach or overtly threatens to commit a breach of any of
the covenants contained in this Agreement, Parent and/or Buyer shall have the
right to have the provisions of this Agreement specifically enforced without
being required to post bond or other security and without having to prove the
inadequacy of the available remedies at law; it being acknowledged and agreed
that any such breach or overtly threatened breach will cause irreparable
injury to Parent and Buyer and that money damages will not provide an adequate
remedy, and Seller and each Principal expressly waive the defense in any
equitable proceeding that there is an adequate remedy at law for any breach of
this Agreement. In addition, Parent and Buyer may take all such other actions
and remedies available to either of them under law or in equity and shall
be entitled to such damages as they can show they have sustained by reason of
such breach. 
---|--- 



   7. | Each party hereby represents and warrants to the other parties
hereto that: (i) such party has all corporate or other power and authority
necessary to execute this Agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder;
(ii) such partys execution and delivery of this Agreement and the performance
of its obligations hereunder have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate or other action; and (iii) this Agreement constitutes a valid and
binding obligation of such party, enforceable against such party in accordance
with its terms, such enforcement subject to bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or similar laws of general application affecting
creditors rights and the application of general principles of equity and
public policies. 
---|--- 



   8. | This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of
the parties hereto and their respective heirs, executors, administrators,
successors and assigns.  
---|--- 



   9. | This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance
with the laws of the State of Kansas (without reference to choice of law
provisions of Kansas law, to the extent such provisions require the
application of the laws of any other jurisdiction). 
---|--- 



   10. | This Agreement may not be changed orally, but only by an
agreement in writing signed by Buyer, Parent, Seller and each Principal;
provided that the Agreement may be amended in writing only as to the Seller
or only as to one Principal so long as the Buyer, Parent and the Seller or
such Principal, as the case may be, so agree in writing. 
---|--- 
 



   11. | This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, all of which
taken together shall constitute one instrument. 
---|--- 
 



60    12. | In the event any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of,
relating to, or in connection with this Agreement (including, without
limitation, any claim regarding or related to the interpretation, scope,
effect, enforcement, termination, breach, legality, remedies (including
specific enforcement) and other aspects of this Agreement or the conduct and
communications of the parties regarding this Agreement and the subject matter
of this Agreement) results in litigation, the prevailing party in such
litigation shall be entitled to reimbursement of its reasonable attorneys
fees and costs of suit. The parties agree that the applicable court in any
such litigation shall resolve any dispute between the parties as to the
identity of the "prevailing party" and the reasonableness of fees to be paid
pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph.

Sellers Group Continuing Businesses

The Seller Group Continuing Businesses will be organized as a multi-media
communications company engaged in collecting and disseminating news,
information and advertising on platforms that include print (e.g., without
limitation, daily and weekly newspapers, magazines and advertising circulars),
online (including, without limitation, Web sites, mobile applications,
advertising and news content distribution via niche news sites, e-mail, text
and mobile means), and video news and advertising content produced for and
through Free State Communications, LLC and as an integral part of its ongoing
print and video newsgathering work involving Channel 6, and for its television
station KTKA-TV, and for other users of video content, and for the various
Web sites that are a part of the continuing company.

Further, the company through its internal Web development operations and its
Mediaphormedia, LLC operation will continue to develop and enhance software,
mobile Web applications and other applications such as StoryMarket L.L.C.,
that involve it in media and other business relationships without geographic
restriction.

It is anticipated that the Seller Group Continuing Businesses will innovate
and evolve to take advantage of developing technologies so long as they do
not involve installing wired services to customer premises that would compete
with Knology Group in any geographic territory where Knology Group operates
and so long as they do not involve being a provider of wireless service in
competition with Knology Group in the areas in which it operates.

The ongoing Seller Group Continuing Businesses involve newspaper and related
enterprises operated as WorldWest Limited Liability Company, with offices in
Steamboat Springs and Craig, Colo., and Payson, Ariz.

Additionally, the new company will continue to be a contract printer of
newspapers and other periodicals, and will provide commercial distribution of
related products.

 

Many of the Seller Group Continuing Businesses will be located in communities
and territories served by the Knology Group and that co-location shall
not preclude the Seller Group Continuing Businesses from continuing their
business activities in those communities. Exhibit 5.21 

ESCROW AGREEMENT

This ESCROW AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ ") is made and entered into as of
the _ _ day of  _ _, 2010, by and among
KNOLOGY OF KANSAS, INC., a Delaware corporation (" _Buyer_ "), THE WORLD
COMPANY, a Kansas corporation (" _Seller_ "), and INTRUST Bank, N.A., a
national banking association, as escrow agent (the " _Escrow Agent_ "). Buyer
and Seller are collectively referred to as the " _Parties_ " and
individually, as a " _Party_."

WHEREAS, the Parties entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement dated August 3,
2010 (the " _Purchase Agreement_ ") pursuant to which, on the date hereof,
Buyer purchased substantially all of the Sellers assets with respect to
Sellers unincorporated division known as Sunflower Broadband and Channel 6
which is in the business of providing (i) cable television, high speed data,
voice and other services to residential and business customers in Lawrence,
Eudora, Linwood, Tonganoxie and Basehor, Kansas and in nearby rural areas in
Douglas, Leavenworth and Wyandotte Counties in Kansas and (ii) original
programming through the operation of Channel 6, a local origination channel
and video production services to commercial and corporate clients (the "
_Transaction_ "); and

WHEREAS, _Section 2.4.2_ of the Purchase Agreement provides for the escrow
of certain cash funds to reimburse Buyer for certain indemnifiable losses
pursuant to _Article 9_ of the Purchase Agreement; and

 

WHEREAS, the Parties desire to appoint the Escrow Agent as escrow agent for
the purpose of receiving, holding, investing and distributing the Escrow Fund
(as defined below), and the Escrow Agent is willing to act as escrow agent
with respect to the Escrow Fund subject to and in accordance with the terms
and conditions of this Agreement.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the consummation of the Transaction as
contemplated by the Purchase Agreement, and for other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged,
the parties hereto agree as follows:

1\. _Defined Terms_. As used herein, all capitalized terms not otherwise
defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Purchase
Agreement. " _Business Day_ " means any day other than a Saturday, Sunday or
any other day on which banks are legally permitted to be closed in Wichita,
Kansas.

 

2\. _Appointment and Agreement of the Escrow Agent_. Each of the Parties
hereby appoints the Escrow Agent to serve as, and the Escrow Agent hereby
agrees to act as, escrow agent upon the terms and conditions of this
Agreement.

3\. _Escrow Fund_. Pursuant to _Section 2.4.2_ of the Purchase Agreement,
Buyer has deposited with the Escrow Agent on the date hereof, the sum of Seven
Million Dollars and No/100ths ($7,000,000) (together with any
interest, dividends or other income received with respect thereto, the "
_Escrow Fund_ ") to be held in escrow pursuant to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement. Buyer represents and warrants to the Escrow Agent and Seller
that the Escrow Fund is free and clear of all liens in favor of any third
Person, except as may be created by the Purchase Agreement (as between the
Parties).

4\. _Funds_. " _Funds_ " means all cash held in the Escrow Fund from time to
time. The Funds shall be held by the Escrow Agent for the benefit of Buyer and
Seller to reimburse Buyer for all Indemnifiable Losses that are the subject
of indemnifiable claims pursuant to the provisions of _Article 9_ of the
Purchase Agreement (the " _Indemnification Claims_ ," and each an "
_Indemnification Claim_ "). The Escrow Agent shall hold the Funds in escrow
for the benefit of Buyer and Seller and shall invest the Funds in accordance
with _Section 6_ hereof.

 

5\. _Release of Funds_.

(a) The Funds shall be available to indemnify Buyer against certain breaches
of the Purchase Agreement, as provided in _Article 9_ of the Purchase
Agreement. If Buyer makes an Indemnification Claim pursuant to _Article 9_ of
the Purchase Agreement, then Buyer shall provide written notice of such
Indemnification Claim, together with the amount and reasons for such
Indemnification Claim, to Seller and the Escrow Agent, and Buyer  shall specifically indicate in such notice that it is an " _Indemnification
Notice_ " furnished pursuant to this _Section 5(a)_; _provided_ , _however_
, that no such Indemnification Notice shall be effective unless it is
received by Seller and the Escrow Agent prior to _ _  _
_, 2011 [TO BE FIRST ANNIVERSARY OF CLOSING DATE]. Seller shall confirm
receipt of the Indemnification Notice and the date of such receipt in writing
to the Escrow Agent; _provided_ , _however_ , that Sellers failure to
confirm such receipt shall not invalidate an Indemnification Notice delivered
in accordance with this _Section 5(a)_. Within 30 days of Sellers receipt of
an Indemnification Notice, as evidenced by the confirmation of receipt
delivered by Seller to the Escrow Agent, if Seller objects to the
Indemnification Claim, Seller shall transmit a written notice to Buyer and the
Escrow Agent indicating such disagreement (an " _Indemnification
Dispute Notice_ "). If Seller does not deliver an Indemnification Dispute
Notice within such 30-day period, then Seller and Buyer shall provide promptly
a joint written notice to the Escrow Agent directing the Escrow Agent to make
a cash payment to Buyer out of the Funds in an amount equal to (i) the amount
of such Indemnification Claim, which amount shall be set forth in such joint
written notice, _plus_ (ii) an amount equal to the interest earned on such
amount from the date hereof until the date on which such amount is paid by
the Escrow Agent to Buyer. If Seller issues an Indemnification Dispute Notice,
then the Parties shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to settle
such dispute in a reasonably prompt manner. Upon any resolution of such
dispute in favor of Buyer, Seller and Buyer shall provide promptly a joint
written notice to the Escrow Agent directing the Escrow Agent to make a cash
payment to Buyer out of the Funds in an amount equal to (i) the amount of
such resolved Indemnification Claim, which amount shall be set forth in such
joint written notice, _plus_ (ii) an amount equal to the interest earned on
such amount from the date hereof until the date on which such amount is paid
by the Escrow Agent to Buyer. Upon any resolution of such dispute in favor of
Seller, Seller and Buyer shall provide promptly a joint written notice to the
Escrow Agent directing the Escrow Agent to continue to hold the remainder
of the Funds together with any interest or income thereon in escrow;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if such dispute is resolved after _
_  _ _, 2011, the Funds shall be released as provided in _Section 5(b)_
below.

(b) Within five (5) Business Days after _ _ _ _, 2011,
Seller and Buyer shall deliver joint written notice to the Escrow Agent
(which notice shall include complete wire instructions for delivery to Seller)
requesting that an amount equal to (i) the Escrow Fund, _less_ (ii) all
amounts paid to Buyer pursuant to _Section 5(a) _or _ Section 5(b)_, and
_less_ (iii) all amounts subject to unresolved Indemnification Claims as of _
_  _ _, 2011 be paid to Seller, which notice shall confirm the amount of
the unresolved Indemnification Claims. If at the time of delivery of such
joint written notice, any claims made pursuant to an Indemnification
Notice delivered before _ _ _ _, 2011 remain unresolved
between Buyer and Seller, then the Parties shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to settle such disputes in a reasonably
prompt manner. Upon any resolution of any of such disputes in favor of Buyer,
Seller and Buyer shall provide promptly a joint written notice to the Escrow
Agent directing the Escrow Agent to make a cash payment to Buyer out of the
Funds in an amount equal to (i) the amount of such resolved Indemnification
Claim, which amount shall be set forth in such joint written notice, _plus_
(ii) an amount equal to the interest earned on such amount from the date
hereof until the date on which such amount is paid by the Escrow Agent to
Buyer. Upon any resolution of any of such disputes in favor of Seller, Seller
and Buyer shall provide promptly a joint written notice to the Escrow Agent
directing the Escrow Agent to make a cash payment to Seller out of the Funds
in an amount equal to (i) the amount of such resolved Indemnification Claim,
which amount shall be set forth in such joint written notice, _plus_  (ii) an
amount equal to the interest earned on such amount from the date hereof until
the date on which such amount is paid by the Escrow Agent to Seller.

(c) The Escrow Agent shall pay the Funds together with any interest or income
thereon to the Parties only: (i) in accordance with _Section 5(a) _hereof; or
(ii) ten (10) Business Days after a copy of a court order has been delivered
to the Escrow Agent with respect to any Indemnification Claims to the extent
said court order contains instructions as to whom to disburse all or part of
the remaining funds. In no event shall the Escrow Agent be obligated under
this _Section 5_ to pay any amounts to Seller or Buyer in excess of the Funds
and any interest earned thereon.

6\. _Investment of Funds_.

(a) The Escrow Agent hereby acknowledges receipt of the Funds and agrees to
act as escrow agent in accordance with the terms and conditions hereof, and
the Escrow Agent will hold and dispose of the Funds in accordance with the
terms and conditions herein contained. The Escrow Agent will have no
discretion with respect to the management, disposition or investment of the
Funds. Unless otherwise directed in writing jointly by Buyer and Seller, the
Escrow Agent will invest the Funds in the Marshall Prime Money Market Fund.
The Escrow Agent

 



66  will invest and reinvest from time to time the Funds in such other Permitted

obligations of any state of the United States of America or any political

or from Moodys;

from the date of acquisition thereof and having, at such date of acquisition,
the highest credit rating obtainable from SandP or from Moodys; 
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | investments in certificates of deposit, bankers
acceptances and time deposits (including eurodollar time deposits) maturing
within 180 days from the date of acquisition thereof issued or guaranteed by

lender of Buyer or any domestic office of any commercial bank organized under
the laws of the United States of America or any State thereof which has a
combined capital and surplus and undivided profits of not less than
$500,000,000; 
---|---|--- 



     | (iv) | fully collateralized repurchase agreements with a term of
not more than 30 days for securities described in clause (i) above and entered
into with a financial institution satisfying the criteria described in clause

longer periods as Buyer and Seller may agree in joint written directions
furnished to the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall sell or liquidate any of
the foregoing investments and withdraw cash from the Funds only if required
to make such disbursements as authorized herein. The Escrow Agent shall not
invest the proceeds except as provided in this _Section 6_. The Escrow Agent
shall not have any liability for any loss suffered as a result of any
investment made as provided above, any liquidation of any such investment
prior to its maturity, or the failure of Seller and Buyer to give the Escrow
Agent any written instruction to invest or reinvest the Funds or any interest
or income thereon. The Escrow Agent shall rely conclusively and without
inquiry on investment instructions provided pursuant hereto and shall have no
obligation to determine whether such investments conform to the requirements
set forth above.

(d) The Funds will be held by the Escrow Agent and used to reimburse Buyer for
all Indemnifiable Losses that are the subject of Indemnification Claims
pursuant to _Article 9_ of the Purchase Agreement and in accordance with the
provisions of this Agreement, and no other Person other than Seller and Buyer
will have any right, title or interest therein until such Funds have been

to any lien by any third Person and will be used solely for the purposes and
subject to the conditions set forth herein and the Purchase Agreement. None
of the Parties may grant, transfer or assign any

 



67  interest in the Funds. None of the Parties shall create or grant a lien,
security interest or other encumbrance in favor of any Person in the Escrow
Fund.

9\. _Duties of the Escrow Agent_. The Parties agree that the duties of the
Escrow Agent are purely ministerial in nature. The Escrow Agents duties and
responsibilities shall be limited to those expressly set forth in this
Agreement, and the Escrow Agent shall not have any duties under, be subject
to, nor be obliged to recognize, any other agreement between any or all of
the Parties hereto, including but not limited to the Purchase Agreement, even
though reference thereto may be made herein. This Agreement may be amended at
any time or times by an instrument in writing signed by all of the then
parties hereto, including the Escrow Agent. The duties and obligations of the
Escrow Agent hereunder shall be determined solely by the express provisions of
this Agreement and applicable law, and no implied duties or obligations shall
be read into this Agreement against the Escrow Agent. Except as specifically
set forth herein, the Escrow Agent shall be under no obligation to refer to
the Purchase Agreement or any other documents between or among the Parties
related in any way to this Agreement. The Escrow Agent shall have no duty as
to the collection or protection of the Funds, nor as to the preservation of
any rights pertaining thereto, beyond the safe custody of any such property
actually in its possession. The Escrow Agent shall have no liability with
respect to the transfer or distribution of any funds effected by the Escrow
Agent pursuant to wiring or transfer instructions provided to the Escrow Agent
in accordance with the terms hereof, provided the Escrow Agent follows the
instructions issued in compliance with this Agreement. The Escrow Agent shall
not be obligated to take any legal action or to commence any proceedings in
connection with the Funds or this Agreement, or to prosecute or defend any
such legal action or proceedings. 

10\. _Limitation on Liability_. The Escrow Agent, its shareholders, officers,
directors, employees, attorneys, agents and affiliates shall not be liable to
anyone by reason of any error of judgment, or for any act done or step taken
or omitted by it in good faith, or for any mistake of fact or law, or for
anything which it may do or refrain from doing in connection herewith, unless
caused by or arising out of its own fraud, gross negligence or willful
misconduct. In no event shall the Escrow Agent be liable for incidental,
indirect, special, consequential or punitive damages. The Escrow Agent
hereby executes this Agreement in and only in its capacity as the Escrow
Agent and not in any other capacity whatsoever. The Escrow Agent shall not be
liable for collection items until the proceeds of the same in actual cost have
been received.

 

11\. _Reliance_. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely and shall be
protected in acting in reliance upon any writing furnished to it in
accordance with the terms hereof, and shall be entitled to treat as genuine,
and as the document it purports to be, any letter, paper or other document
furnished to it by any Party and believed by the Escrow Agent in good faith
to be genuine and to have been signed by the proper Party. The Escrow Agent
may consult with counsel with respect to any question relating to its duties
or responsibilities hereunder and shall not be liable for any action taken or
omitted in good faith on advice of such counsel.

12\. _Conflicting Claims_. In the event of any disagreement between the
Parties hereto resulting in conflicting claims and demands being made in
connection with or against the Funds, as the case may be, the Escrow Agent
shall refuse to comply with any claim or demand of any Party until such
disagreement is finally resolved in the manner provided below, but shall
continue to comply with the other terms and conditions of this Agreement, and
in so doing the Escrow Agent shall not be or become liable to any Party. In
the event of a conflict or dispute over the release 

 



69  of funds under _Section 5_, the Escrow Agent shall retain the disputed
amount of Funds (the " _Disputed Amount_ "), together with any interest or
income thereon in escrow, and the term of this Agreement with respect to such
Disputed Amount shall be extended with respect thereto until the earlier of:
(i) five (5) Business Days following the delivery to the Escrow Agent of joint
written instructions signed by the Parties directing the Escrow Agent as to
whom all or any part of the Disputed Amount and any and all interest or income
thereon is to be distributed; or (ii) ten (10) Business Days after a copy of a
final, non-appealable court order with respect to any Indemnification Claims
has been delivered to the Escrow Agent to the extent said court order contains
instructions as to whom to disburse all or part of the Disputed Amount
together with interest or income thereon;  _provided_ , _however_ , the
Escrow Agent shall have notified the Parties and provided the Parties with
copies of said court order at least four (4) Business Days before the Escrow
Agent proposes to release all or any part of the Disputed Amount pursuant to
the court order. In the event of a disagreement as described above in which
the Escrow Agent reasonably believes that it will likely become a party to
such disagreement, the Escrow Agent shall have the right, in addition to the
rights described above and at the election of the Escrow Agent, to tender into
the registry or custody of any court having jurisdiction, all money and
property comprising the Funds and may take such other legal action as may be
appropriate or necessary, in the reasonable opinion of the Escrow Agent. Upon
such tender, the parties hereto agree that the Escrow Agent shall be
discharged from all further duties under this Agreement; provided, however,
that the filing of any such legal proceedings shall not deprive the Escrow
Agent of its compensation hereunder earned prior to such filing and discharge
of the Escrow Agent of its duties hereunder.

13\. _Attachment, Garnishment, Etc._ If all or any part of the Funds is at any
time attached, garnished or levied upon, or in case the payment, assignment,
transfer, conveyance or delivery of all or any part of the Funds shall be
stayed or enjoined by any court order, or in case any order or judgment shall
be made or entered by any court affecting all or any part of the Funds, then
in any of such events, the Escrow Agent shall give written notice to the
Parties of such matter and shall rely upon and comply with any such order,
writ, judgment or decree, which it believes in good faith is binding upon it,
and if it complies with any such order, writ, judgment or decree, it
shall not be liable to any of the Parties hereto or to any other Person by
reason of such compliance, even though such order, writ, judgment or decree
may be subsequently reversed, modified, annulled, set aside or vacated.

 

14\. _Taxes_. The Escrow Agent shall be indemnified by the Parties and held
harmless against any liability for taxes and for any penalties or interest in
respect of taxes on such investment income or payments recognized or
reportable by the Parties relating to the Funds in the manner provided in
_Section 15_. On or before the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
each of Buyer and Seller shall furnish to the Escrow Agent a completed Form
W-9. The Escrow Agent shall have no duty to, but may, at its sole discretion,
prepare or file any tax return or report with respect to the deposit or the
Funds or any earnings thereon.

15\. _Indemnification_. Buyer and Seller shall jointly and severally
reimburse and indemnify and hold harmless the Escrow Agent, its shareholders,
employees, directors, officers and agents for, and against, any loss,
liability, claim or expense of every nature whatsoever, including, without
limitation, reasonable attorneys fees, incurred without fraud, gross
negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Escrow Agent arising
directly or indirectly out of, or in connection with the acceptance of, or the
performance of, its duties and obligations under this Agreement. Promptly
after the receipt by the Escrow Agent of notice of any demand or claim or the
commencement of any action, suit or proceeding, the Escrow Agent shall notify
Buyer and Seller in writing of such notice; provided, however, that the
Escrow Agents failure to provide such notice shall not relieve Buyer and
Seller of their obligations hereunder, except to the extent the Parties are
prejudiced thereby. For the purposes hereof, the term "expense or loss" shall
include all amounts paid or payable to satisfy any claim, demand or liability,
or in settlement of any claim, demand, action, suit or proceeding settled with
the express written consent of the indemnifying party, and all reasonable
costs and expenses, including, but not limited to, counsel fees and
disbursements paid or incurred in investigating or defending against any such
claim, demand, action, suit or proceeding. The Escrow Agent shall have no
right of setoff under this Agreement or otherwise against the Funds. Solely
as between the Parties, payments to the Escrow Agent shall be apportioned 50%
to Buyer and 50% to Seller.

16\. _Resignation or Removal of the Escrow Agent_. The Escrow Agent may at any
time resign by written notice of such resignation to the Parties, in which
event the Parties shall designate a successor escrow agent within thirty (30)
days following the receipt of such notice. The Parties shall have the right at
any time by mutual written agreement to remove the Escrow Agent and appoint a
successor. If the Escrow Agent shall resign or be removed, a successor escrow
agent, which shall be a bank or trust company having assets in excess of $2
billion, shall be appointed

 



70  by the Parties by written instrument executed by each of the parties and
delivered to the Escrow Agent and to such successor escrow agent and,
thereupon, the resignation or removal of the predecessor Escrow Agent shall
become effective and such successor escrow agent, without any further act,
deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all right, title and interest to
the Funds of such predecessor Escrow Agent, and such predecessor Escrow Agent
shall, on the written request of the Parties or the successor escrow agent,
execute and deliver to such successor escrow agent all the right, title and
interest hereunder in and to the Funds of such predecessor Escrow Agent and
all other rights hereunder of such predecessor Escrow Agent. If no successor
escrow agent shall have been appointed within 30 Business Days of a notice of
resignation by the Escrow Agent, the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to deposit
into the registry or custody of any court of competent jurisdiction any part
or all of the Funds. Upon its resignation and delivery of the Funds as set
forth above, the Escrow Agent shall be discharged from any and all further
obligations arising thereafter in connection with the escrow contemplated by
this Agreement. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to its compensation earned
prior to any removal or resignation.

17\. _Termination_. This Agreement shall terminate on the date on which there
is no property remaining in the Escrow Fund; _provided_ that the rights of the
Escrow Agent under  _Sections 8_, _10_ and _15_ hereunder and the other
Parties hereto under _Section 5_ hereunder shall survive the termination
hereof and the resignation or removal of the Escrow Agent;  _provided
further_ that other than as contemplated by _Section 10_ hereof with respect
to the Escrow Agent, nothing herein shall relieve any Party from liability for
any breach of this Agreement.

 

18\. _Further Assurances_. From time to time on and after the date hereof, the
Parties hereto shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the Escrow Agent
such further documents and instruments and shall do and cause to be done such
further acts as the Escrow Agent shall reasonably request (it being understood
that the Escrow Agent shall have no obligation to make any such request) to
carry out more effectively the provisions and purposes of this Agreement, to
evidence compliance herewith or to assure itself that it is protected in
acting hereunder.

 

19\. _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the
State of Kansas without regard to the principles of conflicts of laws. "Court
of Competent Jurisdiction" includes, without limitation, the District Court of
Sedgwick County, Kansas, or, if permitted by law, the United States District
Court for the District of Kansas, sitting in Wichita, Kansas.

20\. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which
together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of an executed
counterpart hereof by facsimile shall be effective as manual delivery of such
counterpart; _provided_ , _however_ , that each party hereto will promptly
thereafter deliver counterpart originals of such counterpart facsimiles
delivered by or on behalf of such party.

21\. _Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure
to the benefit of, the parties hereto and their respective successors and
assigns, provided, however, there shall be no assignment hereof or any
interest herein without the express, written consent of the Escrow Agent and
each of the Parties.

VIDEO LICENSE AGREEMENT

This Video License Agreement ("Agreement") is entered into on this [ _
_] day of September 2010, by and between THE WORLD COMPANY, a Kansas
corporation, ("Licensee") and KNOLOGY OF KANSAS, INC., a Delaware corporation,
("Licensor"). Licensee and Licensor are each referred to herein as a "Party"
and are referred to together as the "Parties."

RECITALS

WHEREAS, on August 3, 2010, Licensee and Licensor entered into that certain
Asset Purchase Agreement (the "Asset Purchase Agreement") pursuant to which
Licensor shall purchase certain assets owned by Licensee located in Kansas,
including but not limited to the rights to video content or video recordings
with accompanying audio, including, but not limited to, news, sports and other
video archives together with all copyrights and any other rights related
thereto (collectively, the "Purchased Video Content"). Capitalized terms used
but not defined in this Agreement will have the meanings ascribed to them in
the Asset Purchase Agreement.

 

WHEREAS, subsequent to the closing date of the Asset Purchase Agreement,
Licensor will own and operate Channel-6 and, through the operation of
Channel-6 will produce, create or acquire additional video content or video
recordings with accompanying audio, including, but not limited to, news,
sports and other video archives together with all copyrights and any other
rights related thereto, (collectively, together with the Purchased Video
Content, the "Video Content").

WHEREAS, Licensor desires to license the Video Content to Licensee, and
Licensee desires to license the Video Content from Licensor.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of these premises, the mutual covenants
exchanged below, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, Licensor and Licensee agree as
follows:

 

AGREEMENT

1\. License 

1.1 _License Grant_. Licensor grants to Licensee a worldwide, non-exclusive,
royalty-free license (the "License"):

(a) to publish, display, adapt, digitize, prepare derivative works of,
reproduce and distribute copies of, each original work of authorship
comprising the Video Content, released by Licensor and delivered to Licensee
by Licensor pursuant to Section 2, for any purpose, in any medium, now
existing or hereafter developed, throughout the universe and in perpetuity,
in all languages as Licensee determines, in its sole discretion. Licensor
grants to Licensee all necessary reproduction rights to effectuate the intent
of this Agreement. Without limiting the license granted above,

(i) Licensee may adapt, digitize, modify, create improvements upon and create
derivative works from any original work of authorship comprising the Video
Content. Any adaptations, modifications, improvements to or derivative works
of the Video Archive developed by Licensee, its employees or agents will be
the exclusive property of Licensee. Licensee has no obligation to inform
Licensor of any such adaptations, modifications, improvements or other
derivative works. (ii) Licensee may reproduce, digitize, display publicly and reproduce on
its own servers, in whole or in part, and in multiple bit rates and formats,
the Video Content over the Internet through websites owned or controlled by
Licensee (the "Websites").

 

(b) Licensor also grants Licensee a limited right and license to use, copy,
encode, store, archive, distribute, transmit, render into an audible format
and publicly display Licensors brands, trademarks and other intellectual
property: (1) in connection with the presentation of the Video Content on the
Websites; and (2) in connection with the marketing and promotion of the
Websites.

1.2 _Right to Sublicense_. Licensee may sublicense the rights granted under
this Agreement to affiliates of Licensee or to service providers engaged by
Licensee to conduct its business on or after the Closing Date.

1.3 _Prevention of Downloading_. Licensor acknowledges that it is not possible
to guarantee the security of the Video Content once it is placed on the
Internet. Licensee shall, however, use commercially reasonable efforts to
prevent the Video Content from being copied from the Websites by unauthorized
third parties. The Parties agree that for purposes of this Section
"commercially reasonable efforts" means, with respect to the security of the
Video Content posted on the Internet, the efforts, consistent with past
practices, that a reasonable person in the position of the Licensee would use
so as to achieve such security as expeditiously and cost effectively
as possible. Moreover, the Parties acknowledge that although Licensee makes
such commercially reasonable efforts, due to the nature of software and
computer hardware reliability, the security of client/server media
distribution systems could be intentionally breached.

2\. Delivery

Licensor shall deliver to Licensee copies of the Video Content, in a format to
be agreed upon by the Parties, or in which the Video Content was maintained as
of the closing date of the Asset Purchase Agreement within ten (10) days of a
request from Licensee for such Video Content.

3\. Term of License and Termination

 

3.1 _Term of License_. This Agreement shall terminate (a) if Licensor shall
terminate the operation of Channel-6 or (b) if Licensee shall engage in a
transaction for the sale of all or substantially all of its assets or any
other transaction in which more than 50% of its voting securities are
transferred.

 

3.2 _Effect of Termination_.

(a) If this Agreement terminates due to Licensors termination of the
operation of Channel-6, provided that no termination event has occurred with
respect to the transfer of the assets or voting securities of Licensor, then
ownership of the Video Content will transfer from Licensor to Licensee
effective upon the date on which Licensor terminates the operation of
Channel-6.

 

(b) If this Agreement terminates under Section 3.1(b), Licensees right to use
the copy of the Video Content in its possession will not be affected, but
Licensees exclusivity with respect to use in connection with the operation of
a newspaper will terminate and Licensee will no longer receive copies of
additional works created by Licensor in the ordinary course of the Business
and delivered to Licensee under Section 2\.

 



75 3.3 _First Right of Refusal_. Licensor hereby grants Licensee a right of
first refusal to purchase the Video Content in the event Licensor ever elects
to sell the same. The terms of such purchase will be the same as the terms
offered by the third party offering to purchase the Video Content from the
Licensor.

4\. Licensors Rights

 

4.1 _Reservation of Rights_. The License is non-exclusive, and Licensor
reserves the right to make any use of the Video Content, or to license any
rights with respect to the Video Content to any third party; however, Licensee
will be the exclusive user of the Video Content in connection with the
operation of a newspaper (both print and electronic). The Video Content shall
remain the sole and exclusive property of Licensor during the term of this
Agreement and Licensor shall retain all right, title, and interest, including
without limitation any rights under United States or foreign copyright laws,
in the Video Content. 

5\. General

 

5.1 _Modification of Agreement_. No alteration, amendment, or modification of
the terms of this Agreement shall be valid or effective unless in writing and
signed by both Parties.

5.2 _Choice Of Law_. This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of Kansas, without giving effect to Kansas conflict of law
provisions or to constructive presumptions favoring either Party.

5.3 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the Asset Purchase Agreement
contains the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the subject
matter of this Agreement, and it supersedes all other prior and contemporary
agreements, understandings, and commitments between the Parties with respect
to the subject matter of this Agreement. If any term of this Agreement
conflicts with the Asset Purchase Agreement, the terms of the Asset Purchase
Agreement will control. Nothing in this Agreement is to be construed as a
waiver of, or an amendment to, any rights or obligations under the Asset
Purchase Agreement.

5.4 _Assignment_. The Agreement will bind and inure to the benefit of each
partys permitted successors and assigns. Neither party may assign the
Agreement, in whole or in part, without the other partys written consent.
Any attempt to assign or transfer the Agreement other than in accordance with
this provision will be null and void.

5.5 _Notices_. All notices, requests and other communications shall comply
with Section 10.01 of the Asset Purchase Agreement.

 

5.6 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of
which will be deemed an original, but all of which together constitute one
agreement. Signature pages of this Agreement transmitted by facsimile or by
electronic mail in portable document format will have the same legal effect as
a manually executed signature page.

 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties, acting through their duly authorized
representatives, have executed this Agreement as of the day and year first
above written.
