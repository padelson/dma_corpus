AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

  

This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of January
25, 2016, is entered into by and between Chemical Financial Corporation, a
Michigan corporation (" _Chemical_ "), and Talmer Bancorp, Inc., a Michigan
corporation (" _Talmer_ "). Each of Chemical and Talmer is referred to herein
as a " _Party_ " and, together, as the " _Parties_."

  

W I T N E S S E T H:

  

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Chemical and Talmer (the " _Chemical
Board_ " and the " _Talmer Board_ ," respectively) have determined that it is
in the best interests of their respective companies and their shareholders to
consummate the strategic business combination transaction provided for in
this Agreement in which Talmer will, on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, merge with and into Chemical (the "
_Merger_ "), so that Chemical is the surviving corporation in the Merger
(sometimes referred to in such capacity as the " _Surviving Corporation_ ");

  

WHEREAS, the Chemical Board and the Talmer Board have each adopted this
Agreement, duly authorized the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby, and resolved to recommend that the shareholders of each of Chemical
and Talmer approve this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Merger;

  

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, each member of
the Chemical Board and each member of the Talmer Board is entering into
a voting and support agreement substantially in the forms attached hereto as
_Exhibit A-1_ and _Exhibit A-2_ , respectively (each, a " _Support Agreement_
");

  

WHEREAS, it is intended that, following the Merger, Talmer Bank and Trust, a
Michigan banking corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Talmer (" _Talmer
Bank_ "), will be merged with and into Chemical Bank, a Michigan banking
corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Chemical (" _Chemical Bank_ "), so
that Chemical Bank is the surviving bank (sometimes referred to in such
capacity as the " _Surviving Bank_ ");

  

WHEREAS, for federal income Tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger
shall qualify as a reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a) of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended and including the Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Code_ "); and

  

WHEREAS, the Parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and
agreements in connection with the Merger and to prescribe certain conditions
precedent to the Merger.

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations,
warranties, and agreements contained in this Agreement, and other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the Parties agree as
follows:

  

   

 | 1| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

Article I 
 THE MERGER

  

1.1 _The  Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, in accordance with the Michigan Business Corporation Act (the "
_MBCA_ "), at the Effective Time, Talmer shall merge with and into Chemical.
Chemical shall be the surviving entity in the Merger and shall continue its
corporate existence under the laws of the State of Michigan. As of the
Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of Talmer shall cease.

  

1.2 _Effective Time_. The Merger shall become effective on the date and
at the time for effectiveness set forth in the Certificate of Merger (the "
_Effective Time_ ") accepted for filing by the Michigan Department of
Licensing and Regulatory Affairs (the " _Certificate of Merger_ "). The
Parties agree, if requested by Chemical, that the Effective Time shall occur
on either the last day or the first day of a month, but shall not occur
during a month in which a calendar quarter ends.

  

1.3 _Effects of the Merger_. At and after the Effective Time, the
Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement and in the relevant
provisions of the MBCA. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and
subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges,
powers, and franchises of Talmer shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and
all debts, liabilities, and duties of Talmer shall become the debts,
liabilities, and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

  

1.4 _Conversion of Shares_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any further action on the part of Chemical, Talmer, or the
holder of any of the following securities:

  

(a) Each share of Common Stock, $1.00 par value per share, of Chemical
(the " _Chemical Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall remain issued and outstanding and shall not be
affected by the Merger.

  

(b) All shares of Class A Common Stock, $1.00 par value per share, of
Talmer (the " _Talmer Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time that are owned, directly or indirectly, by Talmer
or Chemical (other than Trust Account Shares and other than shares of
Talmer Common Stock held as a result of debts previously contracted) shall no
longer be outstanding, shall automatically be cancelled, and shall cease to
exist, and no Chemical Common Stock or other consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor.

  

(c) Subject to _Section 1.4(e)_, each share of Talmer Common
Stock, except for shares of Talmer Common Stock owned by Chemical, Talmer,
or any of their respective wholly-owned Subsidiaries (other than Trust
Account Shares and shares of Talmer Common Stock held as a result of debts
previously contracted), shall be converted into the right to receive (i)
0.4725 shares (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") of validly issued, fully paid, and
nonassessable shares of Chemical Common Stock (the " _Stock Consideration_
"); and (ii) $1.61 in cash, without interest (the " _Cash Consideration_ "
and, together with the Stock Consideration, the " _Merger Consideration_ ").

  

   

 | 2| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

(d) All of the shares of Talmer Common Stock converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Article I_ shall no
longer be outstanding, shall automatically be cancelled, and shall cease to
exist as of the Effective Time, and each book entry notation of record
ownership and each certificate previously representing any such shares of
Talmer Common Stock shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration into which the shares of Talmer Common Stock represented
by such book entry notation of record ownership or such certificate have been
converted pursuant to this _Section 1.4_, as well as any dividends to which
holders of Talmer Common Stock become entitled in accordance with _Section
2.2_.

  

(e) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, there
is declared (with an effective time prior to the Effective Time) or effected
a reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization, stock split
(including a reverse stock split), split-up, stock dividend or stock
distribution (including any dividend or distribution of securities
convertible into Chemical Common Stock or Talmer Common Stock), combination,
exchange, or readjustment of shares with respect to, or rights issued in
respect of, Chemical Common Stock or Talmer Common Stock, the Exchange Ratio
shall be proportionately adjusted accordingly to provide to the holders of
Talmer Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this
Agreement prior to such event. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this
_Section 1.4(e)_, no adjustment shall be made in the event of the issuance of
additional shares of Chemical Common Stock or Talmer Common Stock pursuant to
any dividend reinvestment plan or direct investment plan of Chemical or
Talmer, as applicable, pursuant to the exercise of stock options awarded
under any director, employee or affiliate stock option plans of Chemical or
Talmer, as applicable, or their Subsidiaries, or upon the grant or sale of
shares or rights to receive shares to or for the account of any director,
employee, or Affiliate of Chemical or Talmer, as applicable, or any of their
Subsidiaries pursuant to any stock option or other compensation or benefit
plans of Chemical or Talmer, as applicable, or in connection with the
issuance of shares as consideration in a transaction where Chemical or
Talmer, as applicable, is the surviving corporation or in connection with any
offering of shares where Chemical or Talmer, as applicable, receives
consideration in exchange for the shares so offered.

  

1.5 _Stock Options and Other Stock-Based Awards_.

  

(a) Unless otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, the provisions
of this _Section 1.5_ pertain to all plans sponsored by Talmer under which
options, restricted stock and other stock-based awards are granted, and the
award agreements thereunder (collectively, the " _Talmer Stock Plans_ ").

  

(b) As of the Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase a share
or shares of Talmer Common Stock (each, a " _Talmer Stock Option_ "),
excluding any Talmer Stock Options cancelled immediately prior to the
Effective Time in accordance with _Section 1.5(c)_ ) (the " _Cancelled Talmer
Stock Options_ "), shall be assumed by Chemical substantially in accordance
with the terms of the Talmer Stock Plans and the option grants or other award
agreements by which they are evidenced in accordance with the terms of the
applicable Talmer Stock Plans, such that after the Merger and without any
action on the part of the holders of such Talmer Stock Options, the Talmer
Stock Options shall be converted into and become stock options with respect
to Chemical Common Stock (each, a " _Surviving Corporation Stock_

   

 | 3| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

 _Option_ "). From and after the Effective Time, (i) each Talmer Stock Option
may be exercised solely for shares of Chemical Common Stock; (ii) the number
of shares of Chemical Common Stock subject to such Talmer Stock Option shall
be equal to the product of (A) the total number of shares of Talmer Common
Stock subject to such Talmer Stock Option _multiplied by_ (B) the Equity Award
Exchange Ratio, rounded up or down, if necessary, to the nearest whole share
of Chemical Common Stock; and (iii) the per-share exercise price under each
such Talmer Stock Option shall be adjusted to equal the quotient of (x) the
exercise price per share of such Talmer Stock Option at which such Talmer
Stock Option was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time _divided
by_ (y) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio, rounded up or down to the nearest
whole cent, if necessary. For purposes of this Agreement, the " _Equity Award
Exchange Ratio_ " shall mean the sum of (1) the Exchange Ratio _plus_ (2) the
quotient of (I) the Cash Consideration  _divided by_ (II) the Chemical
Closing Price.

  

(c) Talmer may offer to cancel, effective immediately prior to the
Effective Time, up to twenty-five percent (25%) of the Talmer Stock Options
outstanding as of the date of this Agreement. In exchange for the cancellation
of any such Cancelled Talmer Stock Options, each holder thereof shall be
entitled to receive, for each Cancelled Talmer Stock Option, cash in an
amount equal to the Option Cash-Out Consideration, less any required
withholding taxes. For purposes of this Agreement, the " _Option Cash-Out
Consideration_ " shall mean, for each Cancelled Talmer Stock Option, cash in
an amount equal to the difference between (i) the sum of (A) the product of
(x) the Exchange Ratio _multiplied by_ (y) the Chemical Closing Price, _plus_
 (B) the Cash Consideration, _minus_ (ii) the per-share exercise price under
each such Cancelled Talmer Stock Option. Prior to any offer by Talmer to
cancel Talmer Stock Options in accordance with this _Section 1.5(c)_ , the
Parties shall mutually agree regarding which holders of Talmer Stock Options
may be given the opportunity to cancel Talmer Stock Options in exchange
for the Option Cash-Out Consideration in accordance with this _Section
1.5(c)_ and the manner in which Talmer would make any such offer to any such
holders of Talmer Stock Options.

  

(d) Each restricted stock award granted under a Talmer Stock Plan (a "
_Talmer Stock Award_ ") which is unvested or contingent and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease, at the Effective Time,
to represent any rights with respect to shares of Talmer Common Stock and
shall be converted, without any action on the part of the holder thereof,
into a restricted stock award of Chemical (a " _Surviving Corporation Stock
Award_ "), on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under the
applicable Talmer Stock Plans (but taking into account any changes thereto,
including any acceleration of vesting thereof, provided for in the applicable
Talmer Stock Plans or in the related award document by reason of the Merger).
The number of shares of Chemical Common Stock subject to each such Surviving
Corporation Stock Award shall be equal to the product of (i) the total number
of shares of Talmer Common Stock subject to the Talmer Stock Award
_multiplied by_ (ii) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio, rounded up or down, if
necessary, to the nearest whole share of Chemical Common Stock. Talmer or
Chemical, as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold such
amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld under the Code and any
applicable state or local Tax laws with respect to the lapsing of any
restrictions on Talmer Stock Awards pursuant to this _Section 1.5(d)_.

  

(e) Chemical shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve a
sufficient number of shares of Chemical Common Stock for delivery upon the
exercise or settlement of

   

 | 4| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

each of the Surviving Corporation Stock Options and the Surviving Corporation
Stock Awards. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, if
and to the extent necessary to cause a sufficient number of shares of Chemical
Common Stock to be registered and issuable upon the exercise or settlement of
the Surviving Corporation Stock Options and the Surviving Corporation Stock
Awards, Chemical shall file a post-effective amendment to the Form S-4 or one
or more registration statements on Form S-8 (or any successor or other
appropriate form) with respect to the shares of Chemical Common Stock subject
to the Surviving Corporation Stock Options or Surviving Corporation Stock
Awards and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain
the effectiveness of such registration statement or registration statements
(and maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained
therein) for so long as such Surviving Corporation Stock Options and Surviving
Corporation Stock Awards remain outstanding.

  

(f)  At or prior to the Effective Time, Chemical, the Chemical Board,
and the compensation committee of the Chemical Board, as applicable, and
Talmer, the Talmer Board and the compensation committee of the Talmer Board,
as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions (including
obtaining any Talmer or Talmer Bank employee or other participant consents or
providing any required or advisable notices to any Talmer or Talmer Bank
employee) necessary to effectuate the provisions of this _Section 1.5_.

  

1.6 _Articles of Incorporation_. At the Effective Time, the Articles of
Incorporation of Chemical, including any amendments thereto (the " _Chemical
Articles_ "), shall be the Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable Law.

  

1.7 _Bylaws_. At the Effective Time, the Bylaws of Chemical, including
any amendments thereto (the " _Chemical Bylaws_ "), shall be the Bylaws of
the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with
applicable Law.

  

1.8 _Tax _ _Consequences_. It is intended that the Merger shall
constitute a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code, and that this Agreement shall constitute a "plan of reorganization" for
purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code (collectively, the " _Intended
Tax Treatment_ "). Each Party shall not, and shall not permit any of its
respective Subsidiaries to, take any action or fail to take any action that
would reasonably be expected to jeopardize the qualification of the Merger as
a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code. Each Party shall use
commercially reasonable efforts, and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to use commercially reasonable efforts, to cause the Merger to
qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code, including providing reasonable and customary representations, covenants
and certificates requested by legal counsel. Within forty-five (45) days
following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall comply with the
reporting requirements of Section 1.6045B-1(a)(2) of the Treasury Regulations.
Each Party shall report the Merger as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code on its United States federal income Tax
Return, unless otherwise required pursuant to a "determination" within the
meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code.

  

1.9 _Bank Merger_. Following the Merger, Talmer Bank shall merge with and
into Chemical Bank (the " _Bank Merger_ "). Chemical Bank shall be the
surviving entity in the Bank

   

 | 5| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

Merger and shall continue its corporate existence. Following the Bank
Merger, the separate corporate existence of Talmer Bank shall cease. The Bank
Merger shall be effected pursuant to a subsidiary plan of merger in a form to
be mutually agreed upon by the Parties (the " _Subsidiary Plan of Merger_ ").
In order to obtain the Regulatory Approvals for the Bank Merger, the Parties
shall cause the following to be accomplished prior to the filing of
applications for such Regulatory Approvals: (a) Chemical shall cause Chemical
Bank to approve the Subsidiary Plan of Merger; (b) Chemical, as the sole
shareholder of Chemical Bank, shall approve the Subsidiary Plan of Merger; (c)
Chemical shall cause Chemical Bank to duly execute and deliver the Subsidiary
Plan of Merger to Talmer; (d) Talmer shall cause Talmer Bank to approve the
Subsidiary Plan of Merger; (e) Talmer, as the sole shareholder of Talmer
Bank, shall approve the Subsidiary Plan of Merger; and (f) Talmer shall cause
Talmer Bank to duly execute and deliver the Subsidiary Plan of Merger to
Chemical.

  

1.10   _Directors and Officers_. At the Effective Time, (a) the
directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be as set forth in _Section
6.11(a)_ until such time as their successors are duly elected and qualified;
and (b) the officers of the Surviving Corporation shall be as set forth in
_Section 6.11(c)_.

  

1.11 _Name_. At the Effective Time, the name of the Surviving
Corporation shall be "Chemical Financial Corporation."

  

1.12 _Additional Actions_. At any time after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation may determine that deeds, assignments, or assurances or
any other acts are necessary or desirable to vest, perfect, or confirm, of
record or otherwise, in the Surviving Corporation its rights, title, or
interest in, to, or under any of the rights, properties, or assets of Chemical
and Talmer acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a
result of, or in connection with, the Merger, or to otherwise carry out the
purposes of this Agreement. Chemical and Talmer grant to the Surviving
Corporation an irrevocable power of attorney to execute and deliver all
such deeds, assignments, and assurances and to do all acts necessary, proper,
or convenient to accomplish this purpose. This irrevocable power of attorney
shall only be operative following the Effective Time and at such time the
officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be fully authorized
in the name of Chemical and Talmer to take any and all such actions
contemplated by this Agreement.

  

1.13 _Right to Revise Structure_. At Chemical's election, the Merger may
be alternatively structured so that (a) Talmer is merged with and into any
direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Chemical or (b) any direct or
indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Chemical is merged with and into Talmer;
_provided, however_ , that no such change shall (i) alter or change the amount
or kind of the Merger Consideration or the treatment of the holders of Talmer
Common Stock; (ii) prevent the Parties from obtaining the opinions of legal
counsel referred to in _Section 7.2(e)_ and _Section 7.3(e)_ or otherwise
cause the Merger to fail to qualify for the Intended Tax Treatment; or (iii)
materially impede or delay consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. In the event of such an election, the Parties agree to
execute an appropriate amendment to this Agreement (to the extent such
amendment only changes the method of effecting the business combination and
does not substantively affect this Agreement or the rights and obligations of
the Parties or their respective shareholders) in order to reflect such
election.

of Talmer Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time (" _Talmer
Certificates_ ," it being understood that any reference herein to "Talmer

this Agreement and exchanged pursuant to _Section 2.2(a)_ in exchange for
outstanding shares of Talmer Common Stock, and (b) cash in an amount
sufficient to pay (i) the Cash Consideration and (ii) cash in lieu of issuing
any fractional shares (such cash and Chemical Certificates described in the
foregoing clauses (a) and (b), together with any dividends or distributions
with respect thereto, being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_
").

  

2.2 _Exchange of Shares_.

  

(a) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event
later than ten (10) days thereafter, Chemical shall cause the Exchange Agent
to mail to each holder of record of one or more Talmer Certificates
representing shares of Talmer Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective
Time that have been converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Article I_ , a letter of transmittal
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Talmer Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Talmer Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Talmer Certificates in exchange for
certificates representing the number of whole shares of Chemical Common
Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional shares, and the Cash Consideration that
the shares of Talmer Common Stock represented by such Talmer Certificate or
Talmer Certificates shall have been converted into the right to receive

any cash in lieu of fractional shares which such holder has the right to
receive in respect of the Talmer Certificate or Talmer
Certificates surrendered pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_ ,
and (C) any dividends or distributions which the holder thereof has the right
to receive pursuant to this _Section 2.2_ , and the Talmer Certificate or
Talmer Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.2_ , each Talmer Certificate
shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive, upon surrender, the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu
of fractional shares payable pursuant to _Section 2.2(e)_ , and any cash in
respect of dividends or distributions as contemplated by this _Section 2.2_.

  

(b) No dividends or other distributions declared with respect to Chemical

Certificate until the holder thereof has surrendered such Talmer Certificate
in accordance with this _Article II_. After the surrender of a Talmer
Certificate in accordance with this _Article II_ , the record holder thereof
shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or other distributions,

Talmer Certificate have been converted into (i) with a record date and
a payment date on or after the Effective Time and on or prior to the date of
such surrender, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, with a record date
on or after the Effective Time but prior to the date of such surrender and a
payment date subsequent to the date of such surrender.

  

(c) If any Chemical Certificate representing shares of Chemical Common
Stock is to be issued in a name other than that in which the Talmer
Certificate or Talmer Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor is or are
registered, it shall be a condition to the issuance thereof that the Talmer
Certificate or Talmer Certificates so surrendered shall be properly endorsed
(or accompanied by an appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in
proper form for transfer, and that the Person requesting such exchange shall
pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other similar taxes
required by reason of the issuance of a Chemical Certificate
representing shares of Chemical Common Stock in any name other than that of
the registered holder of the Talmer Certificate or Talmer
Certificates surrendered, or required for any other reason, or shall
establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has
been paid or is not payable.

  

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of Talmer of the shares of Talmer Common Stock that were issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Talmer Certificates representing such shares are presented
for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for
the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares, and dividends or
distributions that the holder presenting such Talmer Certificates is entitled
to, as provided in this _Article II_.

  

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no
Chemical Certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Chemical
Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Talmer
Certificates, no dividend or distribution with respect to Chemical Common
Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional share, and such
fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to
any other rights of a

   

 | 8| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

shareholder of Chemical. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional
share, Chemical shall pay to each former shareholder of Talmer who otherwise
would be entitled to receive such fractional share an amount in cash (rounded
up to the nearest cent), without any interest thereon, equal to the product of
(i) the Chemical Closing Price  _multiplied by_ (ii) the fraction of a share
(rounded to the nearest thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of
Chemical Common Stock which such holder would otherwise be entitled to
receive pursuant to _Section 1.4_.

  

(f) Any former holders of Talmer Common Stock who have not exchanged
their Talmer Certificates pursuant to this _Article II_ shall look only to
the Exchange Agent for payment of the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of
fractional shares, and any unpaid dividends and distributions on the Chemical
Common Stock deliverable in respect of each former share of Talmer Common
Stock such shareholder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in
each case, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
none of Chemical, Talmer, the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent or
any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of Talmer Common Stock
for any amount delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat, or similar laws.

  

(g) Chemical shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the
Exchange Agent to deduct and withhold, from the Merger Consideration, any
cash in lieu of fractional shares of Chemical Common Stock, cash dividends or
distributions payable pursuant to this _Section 2.2_ , or any other cash
amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Talmer
Common Stock such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of
state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld
by Chemical or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, and paid over to the
appropriate governmental authority, the withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Talmer
Common Stock in respect of which the deduction and withholding was made by
Chemical or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be.

  

(h) In the event any Talmer Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Talmer Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and the
posting by such Person of a bond in such amount as the Exchange Agent would
charge other similarly situated holders of Chemical Common Stock as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Talmer
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Talmer Certificate the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of
fractional shares deliverable in respect thereof, and any dividends
or distributions that the holder presenting such Talmer Certificates is
entitled to, each as provided pursuant to this Agreement.

forward-looking statement of risk that does not contain a reasonable level of

---|---|--- 

 



    

delivered by Talmer to Chemical prior to or concurrently with the execution
of this Agreement (the " _Talmer Disclosure Schedules_ "), it being understood
and agreed that the disclosure of any item in the Talmer SEC Reports shall be
deemed a disclosure only to the extent the relevance of such disclosure to
the sections or subsections of this _Article III_ is reasonably apparent on
the face of such disclosure, Talmer represents and warrants to Chemical that:

  

3.1 _Authorization, No Conflicts, Etc_.

  

(a) Talmer has the requisite corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement, and, subject to receipt of the Talmer Shareholder
Approval, to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. This
Agreement has been duly adopted, and the consummation of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement have been duly authorized,
by the Talmer Board. The Talmer Board has (i) determined that the terms of
this Agreement are fair to and in the best interests of Talmer and the Talmer
Shareholders, and (ii) adopted this Agreement and authorized the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and resolved to make the Talmer Board
Recommendation. Except for the Talmer Shareholder Approval, no other
corporate proceedings on the part of Talmer are necessary to authorize this
Agreement or to consummate the Merger (other than the submission to the
Talmer Shareholders of an advisory (non-binding) vote on the compensation that
may be paid or become payable to Talmer's named executive officers that is
based on or otherwise related to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement). This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by, and
(assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by Chemical) constitutes
valid and binding obligations of, Talmer and is enforceable against Talmer in
accordance with its terms, except to the extent that (A) such enforcement may
be subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or
other similar laws, now or hereafter in effect, relating to creditors' rights
generally and (B) equitable remedies of specific performance and
injunctive and other forms of equitable relief may be subject to equitable
defenses and to the discretion of the court before which any
proceeding therefor may be brought.

  

(b) The execution, delivery, and performance of this Agreement by Talmer
and the consummation of the Merger, do not and will not violate,
conflict with, or result in a breach of: (i) any provision of the articles of
incorporation or bylaws (or similar organizational documents) of Talmer or
any Subsidiary of Talmer (each a " _Talmer Subsidiary_ " and collectively, the
" _Talmer Subsidiaries_ "); or (ii) any Law or Order applicable to Talmer or
any Talmer Subsidiary, assuming the timely receipt of each of the approvals
referred to in _Section 3.1(d)_.

  

(c) The execution, delivery, and performance of this Agreement by Talmer
and the consummation of the Merger do not and will not violate,
conflict with, result in a breach of, constitute a default under, or require
any consent, approval, waiver, extension, amendment, authorization, notice,
or filing under, any cease and desist order, written agreement, memorandum of
understanding, board resolutions or other Regulatory Agreement or commitment
with or from a Governmental Entity to which Talmer or any Talmer Subsidiary is
a party or subject, or by which Talmer or any Talmer Subsidiary is bound or
affected.

  

(d) No notice to, filing with, authorization of, exemption by, or consent
or approval of, any Governmental Entity is necessary for the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by Talmer other than in
connection or compliance with the

   

 | 10| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

provisions of the MBCA, compliance with federal and state securities laws,
and the consents, authorizations, approvals, or exemptions required under the
BHC Act and the Michigan Banking Code. Talmer has no Knowledge of any reason
why the Regulatory Approvals referred to in this  _Section 3.1(d)_ cannot be
obtained or why the regulatory approval process would be materially impeded.

  

3.2 _Organization and Good Standing_. Talmer is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing, and in good standing under the laws of the
State of Michigan. Talmer has all requisite corporate power and authority to
own, operate, and lease its properties and assets and to carry on its
business as it is now being conducted in all material respects. Talmer is a
bank holding company duly registered as such with the Federal Reserve Board
under the BHC Act. Talmer is not, and is not required to be, qualified or
admitted to conduct business as a foreign corporation in any other state,
except where such failure to be so qualified has not had, and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on Talmer.

  

3.3 _Subsidiaries_.

  

(a) Talmer has provided to Chemical a true and complete list of each
Talmer Subsidiary as of the date of this Agreement. Other than the
Talmer Subsidiaries, Talmer does not have "control" (as defined in Section
2(a)(2) of the BHC Act, using five percent (5%) rather than twenty-five
percent (25%)), either directly or indirectly, of any Person engaged in an
active trade or business or that holds any significant assets. Talmer or a
Talmer Subsidiary owns all of the issued and outstanding capital stock or
other equity interests of each of the Talmer Subsidiaries, free and clear of
any claim or Lien of any kind. There is no legally binding and enforceable
subscription, option, warrant, right to acquire, or any other similar
agreement pertaining to the capital stock or other equity interests of any
Talmer Subsidiary.

  

(b) Each of the Talmer Subsidiaries (i) is duly organized and validly
existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization; (ii) is
duly qualified to do business and in good standing in all jurisdictions
(whether federal, state, or local) where its ownership or leasing of property
or the conduct of its business requires it to be so qualified; and (iii) has
all requisite corporate power and authority to own or lease its properties
and assets and to carry on its business as now conducted, except in each of
(ii) and (iii) as has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Talmer.

  

(c) The deposits of Talmer Bank are insured by the FDIC to the fullest
extent permitted by Law, and all premiums and assessments to be paid in
connection therewith have been paid when due. No proceeding for the
revocation or termination of such deposit insurance is pending or, to the
Knowledge of Talmer, threatened. Talmer and each Talmer Subsidiary has paid as
and when due all material fees, charges, assessments, and the like as
required by Law to each and every Governmental Entity having jurisdiction over
Talmer or each Talmer Subsidiary.

date of this Agreement, there are no other compensatory awards outstanding
pursuant to which Talmer Common Stock has been issued or is issuable, or that
relate to or are determined by reference to the value of Talmer Common Stock.

reserved for issuance under the Talmer Stock Plans when issued in accordance
with the respective terms of the Talmer Stock Plans, are or will be duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and not issued in
violation of any preemptive rights, purchase option, call or right of first

have the right to vote on the approval of the Merger or this Agreement, or
that entitle the holder or holders to consent to, or withhold consent on, the
Merger or this Agreement.

adjustments (the effect of which has not had, and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on Talmer) and the absence of notes (that, if presented, would not differ

Subsidiaries under any applicable Law, except for any Action arising out of or
relating to the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

any Transaction Document will contain any untrue statement of material fact
or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary

Talmer Subsidiary (a " _Regulatory Agreement_ "), nor has Talmer nor any
Talmer Subsidiary been advised by any Governmental Entity that a Governmental

(a) All material Tax Returns required by applicable Law to have been
filed by Talmer and each Talmer Subsidiary since January 1, 2010 have
been filed when due (taking into account any extensions), and each such Tax
Return is complete and accurate and correctly reflects the liability for

Adverse Effect on Talmer.

or any Talmer Subsidiary, none of Talmer nor any Talmer Subsidiary (i) has

for which adequate accruals or reserves have been established on the books and
records of Talmer or (ii) (A) has received written notice of any pending, and
to the Knowledge of Talmer there is no threatened, condemnation
proceeding with respect to any of such real property or (B) has received
written notice from any Governmental Entity that such real property is not in
compliance with any applicable Law, except as have not had, and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on Talmer.

  

(d) No lease or license pursuant to which Talmer or any Talmer
Subsidiary, as lessor, lessee, licensor or licensee, has possession of, or
leases or licenses to others, any real or personal property, excluding any
personal property lease with payments of less than $500,000 per year,
contains any provision, including any prohibition against assignment by Talmer
or any Talmer Subsidiary, by operation of Law or otherwise, that would
require any third party consent or approval for, or that would materially
interfere with, the possession, use or rights with respect to the property by
the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries for the same purposes and upon
the same rental and other terms following consummation of the Merger.

  

3.15 _Intellectual Property_. Talmer and the Talmer Subsidiaries
exclusively own, or have a valid license or other valid right to use, all
material Intellectual Property as used in their business as presently
conducted; it being understood that the foregoing shall not be construed to
expand or diminish the scope of the non-infringement representations and
warranties that follow in this _Section 3.15_. No Actions, suits or other
proceedings are pending or, to the Knowledge of Talmer, threatened that Talmer
or any of the Talmer Subsidiaries is infringing, misappropriating or
otherwise violating the rights of any Person with regard to any Intellectual
Property. To the Knowledge of Talmer, no Person is materially infringing,
misappropriating or otherwise violating the rights of Talmer or any of the
Talmer Subsidiaries with respect to any material Intellectual Property owned
or purported to be owned by Talmer or any of the Talmer Subsidiaries
(collectively the " _Talmer-Owned Intellectual Property_ "). Except as have
not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Talmer, to the Knowledge of Talmer:
(a) no circumstances exist which could reasonably be expected to give rise to
any (i) Action that challenges the rights of Talmer or any of the Talmer
Subsidiaries with respect to the validity or enforceability of the Talmer-
Owned Intellectual Property or (ii) claim of infringement, misappropriation,
or violation of the Intellectual Property rights of any Person, and (b) the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not give

alter, impair, extinguish or restrict any Talmer-Owned Intellectual Property
or Intellectual Property licensed to Talmer or any Talmer Subsidiary.

  

3.16 _Required Licenses, Permits, Etc_. Talmer and each Talmer

auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of Talmer or any
Talmer Subsidiary or their respective internal accounting controls, including

of an advisory (non-binding) vote on the compensation that may be paid or
become payable to Chemical's named executive officers that is based on or
otherwise related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement). This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by, and (assuming due
authorization, execution and delivery by Talmer) constitutes valid and
binding obligations of, Chemical and is enforceable against Chemical in

be subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium
or other similar laws, now or hereafter in effect, relating to creditors'
rights generally and (B) equitable remedies of specific performance and

equitable relief may be subject to equitable defenses and to the
discretion of the court before which any proceeding therefor may be brought.

  

(b) The execution, delivery, and performance of this Agreement by
Chemical, the issuance of shares of Chemical Common Stock constituting the

(a) Chemical has provided to Talmer a true and complete list of each
Chemical Subsidiary as of the date of this Agreement. Other than the

Chemical Subsidiary have been paid.

  

(b) There is no audit or other proceeding pending against or with respect
to Chemical or any Chemical Subsidiary with respect to any material amount of

the Chemical Subsidiaries that arose in connection with any failure (or
alleged failure) to pay any Tax, other than Liens for Taxes not yet due and
payable.

  

(c) Neither Chemical nor any Chemical Subsidiary has waived any statute
of limitations in respect of Taxes or agreed to any extension of time with

Chemical nor any Chemical Subsidiary is a general partner in any partnership
that is material to its business operations.

Subsidiary has been a "distributing corporation" or a
"controlled corporation" in a distribution intended to qualify for tax-free
treatment under Section 355 of the Code.

Chemical and each Chemical Subsidiary has complied in all material respects
with the terms of all leases to which it is a party. All material leases to
which Chemical or any Chemical Subsidiary is a party and under which it is in
possession of any personal or real property are valid and binding contracts
and are in full force and effect, and neither Chemical nor any Chemical
Subsidiary has received any written notice alleging violation, breach, or
default of such lease. Chemical and each Chemical Subsidiary is in possession
of the properties or assets purported to be leased under all its material
leases (except where Chemical or a Chemical Subsidiary is the lessor). The
tangible personal and real property and assets of Chemical and all Chemical
Subsidiaries are in good operating condition and repair, reasonable wear and
tear excepted, and, subject to maintenance and repair in the ordinary course
of business consistent with past practice, are adequate for the uses to which
they are being put.

Subsidiary, none of Chemical nor any Chemical Subsidiary (i) has received
written notice of any pending, and to the Knowledge of Chemical there is no
threatened, condemnation proceeding against any of such real property or (ii)

contested in good faith for which adequate accruals or reserves have been
established on the books and records of Chemical or (ii) (A) has received
written notice of any pending, and to the Knowledge of Chemical there is no
threatened, condemnation proceeding with respect to any of such real property
or (B) has received written notice from any Governmental Entity that such real
property is not in compliance with any applicable Law, except as have not
had, and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Chemical.

  

(d) No lease or license pursuant to which Chemical or any Chemical
Subsidiary, as lessor, lessee, licensor or licensee, has possession of, or
leases or licenses to others, any real or personal property, excluding any
personal property lease with payments of less than $500,000 per year,
contains any provision, including any prohibition against assignment by
Chemical or any Chemical Subsidiary, by operation of Law or otherwise, that
would require any third party consent or approval for, or that would
materially interfere with, the possession, use or rights with respect to the
property by the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries for the same
purposes and upon the same rental and other terms following consummation of
the Merger.

  

4.15 _Intellectual Property_. Chemical and the Chemical Subsidiaries
exclusively own, or have a valid license or other valid right to use,
all material Intellectual Property as used in

   

 | 36| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

their business as presently conducted; it being understood that the foregoing
shall not be construed to expand or diminish the scope of the non-
infringement representations and warranties that follow in this
_Section 4.15_. No Actions, suits or other proceedings are pending or, to the
Knowledge of Chemical, threatened that Chemical or any of the Chemical
Subsidiaries is infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating the rights
of any Person with regard to any Intellectual Property. To the Knowledge of
Chemical, no Person is materially infringing, misappropriating or otherwise
violating the rights of Chemical or any of the Chemical Subsidiaries with
respect to any material Intellectual Property owned or purported to be owned
by Chemical or any of the Chemical Subsidiaries (collectively the " _Chemical-
Owned Intellectual Property_ "). Except as have not had, and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on Chemical, to the Knowledge of Chemical: (a) no
circumstances exist which could reasonably be expected to give rise to any
(i) Action that challenges the rights of Chemical or any of the Chemical
Subsidiaries with respect to the validity or enforceability of the Chemical-
Owned Intellectual Property or (ii) claim of infringement, misappropriation,
or violation of the Intellectual Property rights of any Person, and (b) the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not give
rise to any claim by any Person to a right to own, purchase, transfer, use,
alter, impair, extinguish or restrict any Chemical-Owned
Intellectual Property or Intellectual Property licensed to Chemical or any
Chemical Subsidiary.

  

4.16 _Required Licenses, Permits, Etc_. Chemical and each Chemical
Subsidiary hold all material Permits and other rights from all
appropriate Governmental Entities necessary for the conduct of its business
as presently conducted. All such material Permits and rights are in full

terms and conditions of employment or service of any director, officer,
employee, or consultant, except (i) in the ordinary course of business

attachments for all meetings since January 1, 2013, have been made available
for Talmer's review prior to the date of this Agreement without material

dates, (b) consistent with GAAP and reasonable and sound banking practices,
and (c) in conformance with recommendations and comments in reports of
examination in all material respects.

complaint, allegation, assertion or claim regarding the accounting or
auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of Chemical or any
Chemical Subsidiary or their respective internal accounting controls,
including any written complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that Chemical

commercially reasonable efforts to promptly prepare and file all necessary
documentation, to effect all applications, notices, petitions and filings,
to obtain as promptly as practicable all permits, consents, approvals, and
authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Entities that are
necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including the Merger and the Bank Merger), and to comply with the
terms and conditions of all such permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of all such third parties or Governmental Entities
(collectively, the " _Regulatory Approvals_ "). As soon as practicable after
the date of this Agreement (but in no event more than 75 days after the date
hereof), Chemical shall prepare and file with the Federal Reserve Board and
each other Governmental Entity having jurisdiction all applications and
documents required to obtain the Regulatory Approvals (excluding the
Regulatory Approvals applicable solely to the Bank Merger), and shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain each necessary approval of or
consent to consummate the Merger. Chemical shall provide Talmer with
reasonable opportunities to review and comment upon such documents before
filing and to make such amendments and file such supplements thereto as
Talmer may reasonably request. Chemical shall provide Talmer with copies of
all material correspondence received from such Governmental Entities and all
material responsive correspondence sent thereto. Chemical and Talmer shall
have the right to review in advance, and each will consult the other on, in
each case subject to applicable laws relating to the confidentiality of
information, all other information relating to Chemical or Talmer, as the
case may be, and any of their respective Subsidiaries, that appears in any
filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party or any
Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. In exercising the foregoing right, each of the Parties shall act
reasonably and as promptly as practicable. Each Party shall consult with the
other in advance of any meeting or conference with any Governmental Entity in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and, to the
extent permitted by such

   

 | 57| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

Governmental Entity, give the other Party and its counsel the opportunity to
attend and participate in such meetings and conferences. The Parties shall
consult with each other with respect to the obtaining of all permits,
consents, approvals, and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental
Entities necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, and each Party will keep the other apprised of the status
of matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall be
deemed to require Chemical, Talmer, or any of their respective Subsidiaries
to take any action, or commit to take any action, or agree to any condition
or restriction, in connection with obtaining the foregoing permits, consents,
approvals, and authorizations of third parties or Governmental Entities, that
would have a Material Adverse Effect on the Surviving Corporation (a "
_Materially Burdensome Regulatory Condition_ ");  _provided_ , __ that a
Materially Burdensome Regulatory Condition shall not be deemed to include (i)
the applicability of any regulatory condition or requirement affecting
the Surviving Corporation as a result of its expected asset size following
the Merger; or (ii) except as would have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Surviving Corporation, any requirement by a Governmental Entity that, as a
condition to the Parties consummating the Merger, either Party or the
Surviving Corporation divest of any amount of deposit liabilities, banking
offices and/or loans.

  

(b) Each of Chemical and Talmer shall, upon request, furnish to the
other all information concerning itself and its Subsidiaries, directors,
officers, and shareholders, and such other matters as may be reasonably
necessary or advisable in connection with the applications necessary to

any other statement, filing, notice, or application made by or on behalf of
Chemical, Talmer, or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental
Entity in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

  

(c) Each of Chemical and Talmer shall promptly advise the other upon
receiving any communication from any Governmental Entity, the consent or
approval of which is required for consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, that causes such Party to believe that there
is a reasonable likelihood that any Regulatory Approval will not be obtained
or that the receipt of any such approval may be materially delayed or subject
to a Materially Burdensome Regulatory Condition.

  

(d) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Chemical or Talmer,
directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations of the
other Party prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, subject
to _Article V_ , as applicable, Chemical and Talmer each shall exercise,
consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control
and supervision over their respective business operations.

  

(e) From the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, each Party

any Governmental Entity or any other Person (a) challenging or
seeking material damages in connection with the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (b) seeking to restrain or
prohibit the consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. If any Action or Order is instituted (or threatened to be
instituted) challenging any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
as violative of any Law, each Party shall, and shall cause their

   

 | 58| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

respective Representatives to, cooperate and use their commercially
reasonable efforts to contest and resist, except insofar as the Parties may
otherwise agree, any such Action or Order, including any Action or Order that

prohibit, prevent or restrict consummation of the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel,
advisors, agents, and other Representatives of the other Party reasonable
access, during normal business hours throughout the period before the
Effective Time, to all its properties, books, contracts, commitments and
records, and, during such period, such Party shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, make available to the other Party (i) a copy of each report,
schedule, registration statement, and other document filed or received by it
during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal securities laws or
federal or state banking or insurance laws (other than reports or
documents that such Party is not permitted to disclose under applicable
Law) and (ii) all other information concerning its business, properties, and
personnel as the other Party may reasonably request. Neither Party, nor any
of its Subsidiaries, shall be required to provide access to or to disclose
information where such access or disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-
client privilege of such Party or its Subsidiaries or contravene any Law,
rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty, or binding
agreement entered into before the date of this Agreement. The Parties shall
make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in
which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

  

(b) Each Party shall, and shall cause its respective agents and
Representatives to, maintain in confidence all information received from the
other Party (other than disclosure to that Party's agents and
Representatives in connection with the evaluation and consummation of the
Merger) in connection with this Agreement or the Merger pursuant to the
provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement and use such information solely
to evaluate the Merger;  _provided that_ , the disclosure of such information
shall be permitted if (i) the receiving Party in good faith believes that the
use of such information is necessary or appropriate in making any filing or
obtaining any consent required for the Merger (in which case the receiving
Party shall advise the other Party before making the disclosure) or (ii) the
receiving Party in good faith believes that the furnishing or use of such
information is required by or necessary or appropriate in connection with any
applicable laws or any listing or trading requirement concerning its publicly
traded securities (in which case the receiving Party shall advise the other
Party before making the disclosure).

  

(c) No investigation by a Party or its agents or Representatives shall
affect the representations and warranties of the other Party set forth in
this Agreement.

(c) The Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect for not less than
six (6) years from the Effective Time the current policies of directors' and
officers' liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by
Talmer and the Talmer Subsidiaries for the Indemnified Parties prior to the

Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies of substantially the
same coverage containing terms and conditions that, taken as a whole, are no
less advantageous to the Indemnified Parties. After the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay premiums for insurance
coverages in excess of 300% of the last annual premium (such 300% threshold,
the " _Maximum Amount_ ") paid by Talmer prior to the date of this
Agreement in respect of the coverages required to be obtained pursuant to
this _Section 6.6(c)_ , but in such case shall purchase the greatest coverage
available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Amount. Alternatively, the
Surviving Corporation may purchase at or after the Effective Time, at a cost
not exceeding the Maximum Amount, a six-year prepaid "tail" policy on
terms and conditions providing substantially equivalent benefits as the
current policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance and
fiduciary liability insurance maintained by Talmer and the Talmer Subsidiaries
for the Indemnified Parties with respect to matters occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time, including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
If such "tail" prepaid policy has been obtained, the Surviving Corporation

obligations thereunder.

Talmer Subsidiary) or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full title to all
properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities, and franchises of either
Party to the Merger, the proper officers and directors of each Party and
their respective Subsidiaries shall take all such necessary action as may be
reasonably requested by Chemical.

  

6.8 _Advice of Changes_. Each of Chemical and Talmer shall promptly
advise the other of any change or event (a) having or reasonably likely to
have a Material Adverse Effect on it or (b) that it believes would or would
be reasonably likely to cause or constitute a material breach of any of its
representations, warranties, or covenants contained in this Agreement;
_provided, however_ , that no such notification shall affect the
representations, warranties, covenants, or agreements of the Parties (or
remedies with respect thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of the
Parties under this Agreement; _provided, further_ , that a failure to comply
with this _Section 6.8_ shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement or
the failure of any condition set forth in _Article VII_ to be satisfied unless
the underlying Material Adverse Effect or material breach would independently
result in the failure of a condition set forth in _Article VII_ to
be satisfied.

  

6.9 _No Solicitation by Talmer_.

10.4 _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to
articles, sections, exhibits, or schedules, such reference shall be to an
article or section of, or exhibit or schedule to, this Agreement, unless
otherwise indicated. The table of contents and headings contained in this
Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include,"
"includes," or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed
to be followed by the words "without limitation." The schedules and all
exhibits hereto, shall be deemed part of this Agreement and included in any
reference to this Agreement. This Agreement shall not be interpreted or
construed to require any Person to take any action, or fail to take any
action, if to do so would violate any applicable Law.

  

10.5 _Entire  Agreement_. This Agreement (including the schedules and
exhibits hereto, and the other documents and instruments referred to in this
Agreement), together with the Confidentiality Agreement, constitutes the
entire agreement between the Parties and supersedes all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, between the Parties with respect to
the subject matter of this Agreement, other than the Confidentiality
Agreement.

  

   

 | 95| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

10.6 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed and construed in
accordance with the internal Laws of the State of Michigan applicable to
contracts made and performed within such state, without regard to any
applicable conflict of laws principles.

  

10.7 _Exclusive Jurisdiction_. Each of the Parties to this Agreement
irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the Circuit Courts of the State of Michigan or any
federal courts of the United States of America sitting in the State of
Michigan, and any appellate courts from any thereof, in any Action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or for recognition or
enforcement of any judgment, and agrees that all claims in respect of
any such Action or proceeding shall be heard and determined in such Michigan
court or, to the extent permitted by Law, in such federal court.

  

10.8 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each of the Parties waives to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law any right it may have to a trial by jury
with respect to any Action or proceeding directly or indirectly arising out
of, under, or in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

10.9 _Publicity_. Neither Party shall, and neither Party shall permit
any of its Subsidiaries or agents to, issue or cause the publication of any
press release or other public announcement with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the prior consent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) of the other Party;  _provided,
however_ , that either Party may, without the prior consent of the other Party
(but after prior consultation with the other Party to the extent practicable
under the circumstances) issue or cause the publication of any press release
or other public announcement to the extent required by Law or by the rules
and regulations of NASDAQ after consultation with outside legal counsel.

  

10.10 _Assignment; Third- Party Beneficiaries_.

  

(a) Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests, or
obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned by either of the Parties
(whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent
of the other Party. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall
be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, each of the
Parties and their respective successors and assigns. Other than (i) as
otherwise specifically provided in _Section 6.6_ and (ii) _Articles I_ and
_II_ (which, after the Effective Time, shall be for the benefit of holders of
Talmer Common Stock and any holder of an award granted under a Talmer Stock
Plan), this Agreement (including the documents and instruments referred to in
this Agreement) is not intended to and does not confer upon any Person other
than the Parties any rights or remedies under this Agreement.

  

(b) No provision in this Agreement modifies or amends or creates any
employee benefit plan, program, or document (each, a " _Benefit Plan_ ")
unless this Agreement explicitly states that the provision "amends" or
"creates" that Benefit Plan, and no third party shall be entitled to enforce
any provision of this Agreement on the grounds that it is an amendment to, or
a creation of, a Benefit Plan, unless that provision explicitly states that
such enforcement rights are being conferred. This provision shall not prevent
the Parties to this

   

 | 96| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

Agreement from enforcing any provision of this Agreement. If a Person not
entitled to enforce this Agreement brings a lawsuit or other action to
enforce any provision in this Agreement as an amendment to, or creation of a
Benefit Plan, and that provision is construed to be such an amendment or
creation despite not being explicitly designated as one in this
Agreement, that provision shall lapse retroactively, thereby precluding it
from having any effect.

  

10.11 _Enforcement_. The Parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. Accordingly, each of the Parties shall be entitled to seek specific
performance of the terms hereof, including an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement, this being in addition to any other remedy to
which such Party is entitled at law or in equity. Each of the Parties hereby
further waives (a) any defense in any action for specific performance that a
remedy at law would be adequate and (b) any requirement under any Law to post
security as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.

  

10.12 _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant, or restriction
contained in this Agreement is held by a final and unappealable Order of a
court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void, or unenforceable, then
the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants, and restrictions contained
in this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect, and shall in no way
be affected, impaired, or invalidated unless the effect would be to cause
this Agreement to not achieve its essential purposes.

  

10.13 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts which, taken together, shall constitute one and the same
instrument. Executed counterparts of this Agreement shall be deemed to have
been fully delivered and shall become legally binding if and when
executed signature pages are received by facsimile or electronic mail
transmission from a Party. If so delivered by facsimile or electronic mail
transmission, the Parties agree, if requested by the other Party, to promptly
send original, manually executed copies by nationwide overnight delivery
service.

  

10.14 _Construction_. The Parties have participated jointly in the
negotiation and drafting of this Agreement, and, in the event an ambiguity or
question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement will be construed
as if drafted jointly by the Parties, and no presumption or burden of proof
will arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of
any of the provisions of this Agreement.

  

10.15 _Calculation of Dates and Deadlines_. Unless otherwise specified,
any period of time to be determined under this Agreement shall be deemed to
commence at 12:01 a.m. on the first full day after the specified starting
date, event, or occurrence. Any deadline, due date, expiration date, or
period-end to be calculated under this Agreement shall be deemed to end at
11:59 p.m. on the last day of the specified period. The time of day shall be
determined with reference to the then-current local time in Michigan.
