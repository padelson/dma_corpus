part of the Parties or any holder of any capital stock of Versum, each share
of Versum Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time other than Excluded Shares (such shares of Versum Common
Stock, the " _Eligible Shares_ ") shall automatically be converted into, and

-6- 

    

2.2. _Conversion of Shares of Versum Common Stock_. At the Effective
Time, as a result of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
Parties or any holder of any capital stock of Versum, all of the Eligible
Shares shall represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant
to this  _Article_ __ _ II_, shall cease to be outstanding, shall be
cancelled and shall cease to exist as of the Effective Time, and each
certificate formerly representing any of the Eligible Shares (each, a "
_Certificate_ ") and each book-entry account formerly representing any non-
certificated Eligible Shares (each, a " _Book-Entry Share_ ") shall thereafter
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration and the right,
if any, to receive pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.5_ cash in lieu of fractional
shares into which such Eligible Shares have been converted pursuant to this 
_Section_ __ _ 2.2_ and any dividends or other distributions pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 3.3_; _provided_ , that nothing in this Agreement (including
this _Article_ __ _ II_ and  _Article_ __ _ III_) shall (a) affect the
right of the holders of shares of Versum Common Stock to receive any dividend
or other distribution which was declared on Versum Common Stock, and the
record date of which occurred, prior to the Effective Time in accordance with
the provisions of this Agreement or (b) give holders of Versum Common Stock
the right to receive any dividend or other distribution declared on Entegris
Common Stock and for which the record date occurred prior to the Effective
Time in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.

2.3. _Treatment of Equity Awards_. This _Section_ __ _ 2.3 _shall govern
the treatment of such Partys equity awards in connection with the
Transactions.

 

(a) _Versum Options_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding option to
purchase shares of Versum Common Stock granted under the Versum Prior Stock
Plan (each, a " _Versum Option_ ") shall be deemed fully vested and
exercisable, and each Versum Option shall, automatically and without any
action on the part of the holder thereof, cease to represent an option to
purchase shares of Versum Common Stock and shall be assumed and converted into
an option to purchase a number of shares of Entegris Common Stock (each such
option, a " _Converted Versum Option_ ") equal to the product of (i) the
number of shares of Versum Common Stock subject to such Versum Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the Exchange Ratio (rounded
down to the nearest whole share number), with an exercise price per share
equal to (A) the exercise price per share of Versum Common Stock of such
Versum Option immediately prior to the Effective Time _divided_ _by_ (B) the
Exchange Ratio (rounded up to the nearest whole cent); _provided_ , 
_however_ , that the exercise price and the number of shares of Entegris
Common Stock purchasable pursuant to Converted Versum Options shall be
determined in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the
Code;  _provided_ , _further_ , that in the case of any Versum Option to
which Section 422 of the Code applies, the exercise price and the number of
shares of Entegris Common Stock purchasable pursuant to such Converted Versum
Option shall be determined in accordance with the foregoing, subject to such
adjustments as are necessary in order to satisfy the requirements of Section
424(a) of the Code. Except as specifically provided above, following the
Effective Time, each Converted Versum Option shall continue to be governed by
the same terms and conditions (including, as applicable, exercisability and
forfeiture terms) as were applicable to the corresponding former Versum Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 



-7- 

    

(b) _RSUs_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding time
vesting restricted stock unit granted under the Versum Stock Plan (each, a "
_Versum RSU_ ") and under the Versum Prior Stock Plan (each, a " _Prior Plan
Versum RSU_ ") corresponding to shares of Versum Common Stock shall, in each
case, be canceled and converted into that number of restricted stock units
corresponding to shares of Entegris Common Stock (each, a " _Replacement RSU_
") equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Versum Common Stock
subject to such Versum RSU or Prior Plan Versum RSU immediately prior to the
Effective Time and (ii) the Exchange Ratio. Each Replacement RSU shall (A)
vest and settle on terms (including acceleration events) at least as
favorable as were applicable to the corresponding Versum RSU or Prior Plan
Versum RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time; and (B) vest in full to
the extent the holder of a Replacement RSU is subject to a Covered
Termination, with such Replacement RSU settled in shares of Entegris Common
Stock as soon as practicable, but in no event later than five (5) Business
Days following, such Covered Termination, or such later time as required to
comply with Section 409A of the Code.

(c) _Versum PSUs_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding restricted
stock unit corresponding to shares of Versum Common Stock and subject to
performance-based vesting criteria, including market-based restricted stock
units and performance-based restricted stock units (each, a " _Versum PSU_ "),
shall be converted into that number of replacement restricted stock units
corresponding to shares of Entegris Common Stock (each, a " _Substitute RSU_
") equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Versum Common Stock
subject to such Versum PSU and (ii) the Exchange Ratio. For purposes of
clause (i) of the immediately preceding sentence, the number of shares of
Versum Common Stock subject to a Versum PSU immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall equal the number of Versum PSUs that would have vested pursuant to
the terms of the applicable award agreement if the applicable performance
period ended immediately prior to the Effective Time, based on actual
performance through such truncated period, as determined in the good faith
discretion of the compensation committee of the Versum Board (the " _Versum
Compensation Committee_ ") (which determination shall be effective as of the
Effective Time). Following the Effective Time, the Substitute RSUs covered by
this _Section_ __ _ 2.3(c)_ shall (A) vest and settle on terms (including
acceleration events) at least as favorable as were applicable to the
corresponding Versum PSU immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) vest
in full to the extent the holder of a Substitute RSU is subject to a Covered
Termination, with such Substitute RSU settled in shares of Entegris Common
Stock as soon as practicable, but in no event later than five (5)
Business Days following, such Covered Termination, or such later time as
required to comply with Section 409A of the Code.

 

(d) _Versum Deferred Director Awards_. At the Effective Time, each
deferred stock unit (each, a " _Versum DSU_ ") held in a participants stock
account under the Versum Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors (the "
_Director Deferral Plan_ ") shall be fully vested and shall be converted into
the right to receive a number of shares of Entegris Common Stock equal to the
product of (i) the number of shares of Versum Common Stock covered by the
Versum DSUs held in such participants Director Deferral Plan stock account
and (ii) the Exchange Ratio, with such shares distributed to such participant
no later than thirty (30) Business Days following the Closing Date.

 



-8- 

    

(e) _Versum Dividend Equivalent Rights_. Any Versum dividend equivalent
rights associated with any Versum RSU, Prior Plan Versum RSU, Versum PSU or
Versum DSU (collectively, the " _Versum Dividend Equivalents_ ") (i) credited
in the form of additional Versum RSUs, Prior Plan Versum RSUs, Versum PSUs or
Versum DSUs shall be treated in the same manner as the award to which such
dividend equivalent rights relate in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 2.3_
and (ii) credited in the form of cash shall be paid at the same time or times
the award to which such dividend equivalent rights relate is paid or settled
in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 2.3_, in each case, consistent with
the terms of the Versum Stock Plan, Versum Prior Stock Plan or other Versum
Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time. Following the Effective
Time, each Replacement RSU and Substitute RSU shall accrue and be entitled to
dividend equivalents to the same extent as the related Versum RSU, Prior Plan
Versum RSU or Versum PSU.

(f) _Versum Actions_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Versum and
the Versum Board (and the Versum Compensation Committee), as applicable,
shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions that are necessary to
effectuate the treatment of Versum Options, Versum RSUs, Prior Plan Versum
RSUs, Versum PSUs, Versum DSUs and Versum Dividend Equivalents (collectively,
the " _Versum Equity Awards_ ") pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.3(a)_ through
_Section_ __ _ 2.3(e)_.

 

(g) _Entegris Actions_. Entegris shall take all actions that are necessary
for the treatment of Versum Equity Awards pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.3(a)_
through _Section_ __ _ 2.3(e)_, including the reservation, issuance and
listing of Entegris Common Stock as necessary to effect the transactions
contemplated by this  _Section_ __ _ 2.3_. If registration of any plan
interests in any Benefit Plan or the shares of Entegris Common Stock issuable
in satisfaction of any (i) Versum Equity Awards or (ii) Converted Versum
Options, Replacement RSUs or Substitute RSUs (collectively, " _Converted
Awards_ ") following the Effective Time (and giving effect to this _Section_
__ _ 2.3_) is required under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "
_Securities Act_ "), Entegris shall file with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the " _SEC_ ") as soon as reasonably practicable on or after the
Closing Date a registration statement on Form S-8 with respect to such
interests or Entegris Common Stock, and shall use its reasonable best efforts
to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement for so long as
the relevant Versum Stock Plan, Versum Prior Stock Plan or other Versum
Benefit Plans, Versum Equity Awards or Converted Awards, as applicable, remain
outstanding or in effect and such registration of interests therein or the
shares of Entegris Common Stock issuable thereunder continues to be required.

(h) _Future Grants of Equity Awards_. Notwithstanding anything in 
_Section_ __ _ 2.3(a)_ through _Section_ __ _ 2.3(e)_ to the contrary, but
subject to _Section_ __ _ 7.1(a)_, to the extent the terms of any Versum
Equity Award or Entegris Equity Award (i) granted on or after the date of
this Agreement and not in violation of this Agreement or (ii) mutually agreed
by the Parties and a holder of any Versum Equity Award (or Converted Award) or
Entegris Equity Award expressly provide for treatment in connection with the
occurrence of the Effective Time that is different from the treatment
prescribed by this _Section_ __ _ 2.3_, then in each case of clause (i) and
(ii), the terms of such Versum Equity Award (or Converted Award) or Entegris
Equity Award, as applicable or so agreed by the Parties and such holder, shall
control (and the applicable provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 2.3_ shall not
apply).

Exchange Agent as reasonably directed by Entegris; _provided_ , that no such
deposit or investment (or any loss resulting therefrom) shall affect the

promptly as reasonably practicable (but in any event within three (3)
Business Days) after the Effective Time, (A) a statement reflecting the number

to receive in non-certificated book-entry form pursuant to _Article_ __ _ II_

effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section_ __ _ 3.8_)
of (x) any cash in lieu of fractional shares _plus_ (y) any unpaid cash

such holder has the right to receive pursuant to this _Article_ __ _ III_.

 

(d) No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable for Eligible
Shares pursuant to this  _Article_ __ _ III_.

3.3. _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares of Versum
Common Stock; Voting_. All shares of Entegris Common Stock to be issued
pursuant to the Merger shall be deemed issued and outstanding as of the
Effective Time and whenever a dividend or other distribution is declared by
Entegris in respect of Entegris Common Stock, the record date for which is at
or after the Effective Time, that declaration shall include dividends or other
distributions in respect of all shares issuable pursuant to this Agreement. No
dividends or other distributions in respect of shares of Entegris Common
Stock with a record date at or after the Effective Time shall be paid to any
holder of any unsurrendered Certificate until the Certificate (or affidavit of
loss in lieu of a Certificate as provided in  _Section_ __ _ 3.7_) is
surrendered for exchange in accordance with this _Article_ __ _ III_. Subject
to applicable Law, there shall be issued or paid to the holder of record of

-11- 

    

 for Eligible Shares in accordance with this _Article_ __ _ III_, without
interest, (a) at the time of such surrender, the dividends or other
distributions with a record date at or after the Effective Time theretofore
payable with respect to such whole shares of Entegris Common Stock and not
paid, and (b) at the appropriate payment date, the dividends or other
distributions payable with respect to such whole shares of Entegris Common
Stock with a record date at or after the Effective Time and prior to surrender
but with a payment date subsequent to surrender.

 

3.4. _No Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer books of Versum of the shares of Versum
Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of Versum
Common Stock except as otherwise provided herein or by applicable Law. If,
after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Combined Company
for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this
Agreement. 

3.5. _Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, no fractional shares of Entegris Common Stock will be issued
upon the conversion of shares of Versum Common Stock pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 2.1_. All fractional shares of Entegris Common Stock that a holder of
Eligible Shares would be otherwise entitled to receive pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 2.1_, but for this _Section_ __ _ 3.5_, shall be aggregated and such
holder shall be entitled to receive a cash payment, without interest, in lieu
of any such fractional share, equal to the product (rounded to the nearest
whole cent) of (a) the amount of such fractional share interest in a share of
Entegris Common Stock to which such holder would, but for this _Section_ __ _
3.5_, be entitled under _Section_ __ _ 2.1_, and (b) an amount equal to the
average of the daily volume weighted average price per share of Entegris
Common Stock on the NASDAQ (as such daily volume weighted average price per
share is reported by Bloomberg L.P. or, if not reported therein, in another
authoritative source mutually selected by Entegris and Versum) calculated for
the ten (10) consecutive Trading Days ending on the second (2nd) full Trading
Day immediately prior to (and not including) the Closing Date. No holder of
Eligible Shares shall be entitled by virtue of the right to receive cash in
lieu of fractional shares of Entegris Common Stock described in this _Section_
__ _ 3.5_ to any dividends, voting rights or any other rights in respect of
any fractional share of Entegris Common Stock. The payment of cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Entegris Common Stock is not a separately bargained-for
consideration but merely represents a mechanical rounding-off of the
fractions in the exchange.

 

3.6. _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any deposit of the Exchange Fund and any shares of
Entegris Common Stock) that remains unclaimed as of the date that is six (6)
months after the Closing Date shall be delivered to Entegris. Any holder of
Eligible Shares who has not theretofore complied with this _Article_ __ _
III_ shall thereafter look only to Entegris for delivery of the Merger
Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares of Entegris Common Stock, if
any, and any unpaid cash dividends and any other dividends or other
distributions, in each case, that such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to this _Article_ __ _ III_.

 



-12- 

    

3.7. _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and the posting by such Person of a bond in customary
amount and upon such terms as may be required as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange
Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate,
the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares of Entegris
Common Stock, if any, and any unpaid cash dividends and any other dividends or
other distributions, in each case, payable or issuable pursuant to this
_Article_ __ _ III_, as if such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate had
been surrendered.

3.8. _Withholding Rights_. Each of Entegris, the Combined Company, the
Exchange Agent and any other withholding agent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
to any holder of shares of Versum Common Stock and Versum Equity Awards, such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under the Code or any other applicable state, local or foreign
Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Entegris, the
Combined Company, the Exchange Agent or such other withholding agent, as
applicable, such withheld amounts (a) shall be timely remitted by Entegris,
the Combined Company, the Exchange Agent or such other withholding agent, as
applicable, to the applicable Governmental Entity, and (b) shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of shares
of Versum Common Stock and Versum Equity Awards in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by Entegris, the Combined Company, the
Exchange Agent, or such other withholding agent.

3.9. _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, if, from the date of this Agreement to the earlier
of the Effective Time and termination in accordance with _Article_ __ _ IX_,
the issued and outstanding shares of Versum Common Stock or securities
convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of Versum Common
Stock or the issued and outstanding shares of Entegris Common Stock or
securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of
Entegris Common Stock, shall have been changed into a different number of
shares or securities or a different class by reason of any reclassification,
stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock dividend
or distribution, recapitalization, merger, issuer tender or exchange offer,
or other similar transaction, or a stock dividend with a record date within
such period shall have been declared, then the Merger Consideration shall be
equitably adjusted to provide the holders of shares of Versum Common Stock
and Entegris Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this
Agreement prior to such event, and such items, so adjusted shall, from and
after the date of such event, be the Merger Consideration. Nothing in this
_Section_ __ _ 3.9_ shall be construed to permit the Parties to take any
action except to the extent consistent with, and not otherwise prohibited by,
the terms of this Agreement.

 

3.10. _No Liability_. None of Versum, Entegris, the Combined Company or
the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any portion of
the Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate or
Book-Entry Share has not been surrendered prior to seven (7) years after the
Effective Time, or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any shares
of Entegris Common Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Entegris
Common Stock and any unpaid cash dividends and any other dividends or other
distributions, in each case, that a holder of any Eligible Shares has the
right to receive pursuant to this _Article_ __ _ III_ in respect of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share would otherwise escheat to or become
property of any Governmental Entity, any such shares, cash, dividends or
other distributions in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall,
to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Entegris,
free and clear of all claims or interests of any Person previously entitled
thereto.

all forms, schedules, prospectuses, statements, certifications, reports and
documents required to be filed or furnished by it with the SEC pursuant to the

Date_ ") (the forms, schedules, prospectuses, statements, reports and
documents filed or furnished to the SEC since the Applicable Date and those
filed or furnished to the SEC subsequent to the date of this Agreement,
including any amendments thereto, such Partys " _Reports_ "). Each of such
Partys Reports, at the time of its filing or being furnished (and, in the
case of registration statements and proxy statements, on the dates of
effectiveness and the dates of mailing, respectively), complied, or if not
yet filed or furnished, will comply in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. As of
their respective dates (or, if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the
date of this Agreement, then as of the date of such filing), such Partys
Reports did not, and any of such Partys Reports filed with or furnished to
the SEC subsequent to the date of this Agreement will not, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements made therein, in light of
the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading. No Subsidiary of
such Party is subject to periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act
other than as part of such Partys consolidated group or required to file any
form, report or other document with the SEC, the NYSE, NASDAQ, any other
stock exchange or comparable Governmental Entity other than routine and

Affiliates has made, arranged or modified (in any material way) any extensions
of credit in the form of a personal loan to any executive officer or director
of such Party.

 



-17- 

    

(c) Since the Applicable Date, such Party has maintained
disclosure controls and procedures required by Rule 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e)
under the Exchange Act. Such disclosure controls and procedures are effective
to ensure that information required to be disclosed by such Party under the
Exchange Act is recorded and reported within the time periods specified in the
Exchange Act and all such information required to be disclosed under the
Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the management of such Party,
as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

 

(d) Neither Party is a party to, or has any commitment to become a party
to, any joint venture, partnership agreement or any similar Contract
(including any Contract relating to any transaction, arrangement or
relationship between or among such Party, on the one hand, and any
unconsolidated Affiliate, including any structured finance, special purpose or
limited purpose entity or Person, on the other hand (such as any arrangement
described in Section 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K of the SEC)) where the
purpose or effect of such arrangement is to avoid disclosure of any material
transaction involving, or material liabilities of, such Party in such Partys
consolidated financial statements.

 

(e) Such Party maintains "internal control over financial reporting" (as
defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f), as applicable, under the Exchange
Act). Such internal control over financial reporting is effective in providing
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
United States generally accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") and
includes policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of
records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of such Party, (ii) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts
and expenditures of such Party are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of such Party, and (iii)
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of such Partys assets that could
have a material effect on its financial statements. The records, systems,
controls, data and information of such Party and its Subsidiaries that are
used in the systems of disclosure controls and procedures and of financial
reporting controls and procedures described above are recorded, stored,
maintained and operated under means that are under the exclusive ownership
and direct control of such Party or a wholly owned Subsidiary of such Party or
its accountants, except as would not reasonably be expected to adversely
affect or disrupt, in any material respect, such Partys systems of
disclosure controls and procedures and of financial reporting controls and
procedures or the reports generated thereby.

 

(f) Since the Applicable Date, none of such Partys auditors, such Partys
board of directors and the audit committee of the board of directors of such
Party has received any oral or written notification of (i) any "significant
deficiency" in the design or operation of its internal controls over financial
reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect such Partys ability
to record, process, summarize and report financial information and has
identified for such Partys auditors, such Partys board of directors and the
audit committee of the board of 

 



-18- 

    

 directors of such Party any "material weakness" in internal controls over
financial reporting and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in such Partys
internal controls over financial reporting. Since the Applicable Date, no
material complaints from any source regarding accounting, internal accounting
controls or auditing matters, and no concerns from such Partys employees
regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters, have been received by
such Party. Since the Applicable Date, no attorney representing such Party or
any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by such Party or any of its
Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a material violation of securities Laws
or breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by such Party or any of its
officers, directors, employees or agents to such Partys chief legal officer,
audit committee (or other committee designated for the purpose) pursuant to
the rules adopted pursuant to Section 307 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act or such
Partys policy contemplating such reporting, including in instances
not required by those rules.

5.6. _Financial Statements_. The financial statements of such Party
included in the Reports of such Party at the time filed (and, in the case of
registration statements and proxy statements, on the dates of effectiveness
and the dates of mailing, respectively) complied as to form in all material

Entegris Vote is obtained, in response to an unsolicited, _bona fide_ written
Acquisition Proposal received after the date of this Agreement (that did not

-40- 

    

(i) provide information in response to a request therefor
(including nonpublic information regarding it or any of its Subsidiaries) to
the Person who made such Acquisition Proposal, _provided_ that such
information has previously been made available to, or is made available to,
Versum or Entegris, as applicable, prior to or substantially concurrently
with the time such information is made available to such Person and that,
prior to furnishing any such information, Versum or Entegris, as applicable,
receives from the Person making such Acquisition Proposal an executed
confidentiality agreement containing terms that are generally not less
restrictive to the other party than the terms in the Confidentiality Agreement
are on Versum or Entegris, as applicable ( _provided_ that such
confidentiality agreement need not include any "standstill" terms), and which
confidentiality agreement does not prohibit compliance with either of Versum
or Entegris with this _Section_ __ _ 7.2(b)(i)_; and

 

(ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations with any such Person
regarding such Acquisition Proposal;

 

in each case, if, and only if, prior to taking any action described in clauses
(i) or (ii) above, the Versum Board or the Entegris Board, as applicable,
determines in good faith after consultation with its outside legal counsel
that, based on the information then available and after consultation with its
financial advisor, such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior
Proposal or could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal.

(c) _Representatives_. Any violation of the restrictions contained in
this _Section_ __ _ 7.2(a) _by any of a Partys Representatives shall be
deemed to be a breach of this _Section_ __ _ 7.2(a) _by such Party. The
Parties shall use reasonable best efforts to ensure that their respective
Representatives are aware of the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 7.2(a)_.

 

(d) _Notice of Acquisition Proposals_. Versum and Entegris each shall
promptly (and, in any event, within twenty-four (24) hours) give notice to
the other Party if (i) any inquiries, proposals or offers with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal are received by, (ii) any information is requested in
connection with any Acquisition Proposal from, or (iii) any discussions or
negotiations with respect to an Acquisition Proposal are sought to be
initiated or continued with, it or any of its Representatives, setting forth
in such notice the name of such Person and the material terms and conditions
of any proposals or offers (including, if applicable, complete copies of any
written requests, proposals or offers, including proposed agreements) and
thereafter shall keep the other Party informed, on a current basis (and, in
any event, within twenty-four (24) hours), of the status and material terms
of any such proposals or offers (including any amendments thereto) and the
status of any such discussions or negotiations, including any change in its
intentions as previously notified.

(e) _No Change of Recommendation_.

 

(i) Except as permitted by _Section_ __ _ 7.2(e)(ii)_, _Section_ __ _
7.2(e)(iii)_ or _Section_ __ _ 7.2(f)_, each of the Versum Board and the
Entegris Board, including any committee thereof, agrees it shall not:

 

(A) withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify (or publicly propose or resolve
to withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify) the Versum Recommendation or the
Entegris Recommendation, as applicable, in a manner adverse to Versum or
Entegris, as applicable;

 



-41- 

    

(B) fail to include the Versum Recommendation or the

Entegris, as applicable), in each case, within ten (10) Business Days after
the commencement of such tender offer or exchange offer (or, if earlier, prior
to the Versum Stockholders Meeting or Entegris Stockholders Meeting, as
applicable) (for the avoidance of doubt, the taking of no position or a
neutral position by the Versum Board or the Entegris Board, as applicable, in
respect of the acceptance of any such tender offer or exchange offer as
of the end of such period shall constitute a failure to recommend against
acceptance of any such offer);

(D) approve or recommend, or publicly declare advisable or publicly
propose to approve or recommend, or publicly propose to enter into, any letter
of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition
agreement, merger agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement,
partnership agreement or other agreement (other than a confidentiality
agreement referred to in _Section_ __ _ 7.2(b)_ entered into in compliance
with _Section_ __ _ 7.2(b)_) relating to any Acquisition Proposal (an "
_Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ", and any of the actions set forth in the
foregoing clauses (A), (B), (C) and (D), a " _Change of Recommendation_ ");
or 

(E) cause or permit Versum or Entegris, as applicable, to enter into an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement.

 

(ii) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, prior to
the time, but not after, in the case of Versum, the Requisite Versum Vote is
obtained or, in the case of Entegris, the Requisite Entegris Vote is obtained,
if an unsolicited, _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal received after the
date of this Agreement that did not arise from or in connection with a breach
of the obligations set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.2(a)_ is received by Versum
or Entegris, as applicable, and is not withdrawn, and the Versum Board or the
Entegris Board, as applicable, determines in good faith, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel and its financial advisor that such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Versum Board or the Entegris
Board, as applicable, may (x) effect a Change of Recommendation or (y)
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.3(c)_ or _Section_ __ _
9.4(c)_, as applicable, in order to enter into a definitive written agreement
with respect to such Superior Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that, prior
to taking such action described in clauses (x) or (y) above, Versum has given
Entegris or Entegris has given Versum, as applicable, written notice of such
action and the basis therefor four (4) Business Days in advance, which notice
shall set forth in writing that the Versum Board or the Entegris Board, as
applicable, intends to consider whether to take such action (such notice, the
" _Board Recommendation Notice_ ") and comply in form, substance and delivery
with the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 7.2(d)_. After giving such Board
Recommendation Notice and prior to taking any action described in clauses (x)
or (y) above, Versum or Entegris, as applicable, shall negotiate in good
faith with the other Party (to the extent the other Party wishes to
negotiate), to make such revisions to the terms of this Agreement as would
cause such Acquisition Proposal to cease to be a Superior Proposal. At the
end of the four (4) Business Day period, prior to and as a condition to taking
any action described in clauses (x) or (y) above, the Versum Board or the
Entegris Board, as 

 



-42- 

    

 applicable, shall take into account any changes to the terms of this
Agreement proposed in writing by the other Party and any other information
offered by the other Party in response to the Board Recommendation Notice,
and shall have determined in good faith after consultation with its outside
legal counsel and its financial advisor that in the case of a Superior
Proposal, such Superior Proposal would continue to constitute a
Superior Proposal, if such changes offered in writing by the other Party were
to be given effect. Any amendment to the financial terms and any other
material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to be a new
Acquisition Proposal for purposes of _Section_ __ _ 7.2(d)_ and this
_Section_ __ _ 7.2(e)(ii)_ and require a new Board Recommendation Notice,
except that references in this _Section_ __ _ 7.2(e)(ii)_ to "four (4)
Business Days" shall be deemed to be references to "two (2) Business Days" and
such two (2) Business Day period shall expire at 11:59 p.m. on the second
(2nd) Business Day immediately following the day on which such new Board
Recommendation Notice is delivered (it being understood and agreed that in no
event shall any such additional two (2) Business Day period be deemed to
shorten the initial four (4) Business Day period).

 

(iii) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, prior to
the time, but not after, in the case of Versum, the Requisite Versum Vote is
obtained or, in the case of Entegris, the Requisite Entegris Vote is obtained,
the Versum Board or the Entegris Board, as applicable, may effect a Change of
Recommendation (A) if an Intervening Event has occurred, and (B) prior to
taking such action, the Versum Board or Entegris Board, as applicable,
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel
and its financial advisor, that failure to take such action in response to
such Intervening Event would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with
the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that prior to making such Change of Recommendation, Versum has given Entegris
or Entegris has given Versum, as applicable, a Board Recommendation Notice
four (4) Business Days in advance, which notice shall comply in form,
substance and delivery with the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 7.2(d)_
and include a reasonably detailed description of such Intervening Event.
After giving such Board Recommendation Notice and prior to effecting a Change
of Recommendation, Versum or Entegris, as applicable, shall negotiate in good
faith with the other Party (to the extent the other Party wishes to
negotiate), to make such revisions to the terms of this Agreement. At the end
of the four (4) Business Day period, prior to and as a condition to effecting
a Change of Recommendation, the Versum Board or the Entegris Board, as
applicable, shall take into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement
proposed in writing by the other Party and any other information offered by
the other Party in response to the Board Recommendation Notice, and shall
have determined in good faith after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and its financial advisor that (I) such Intervening Event remains in
effect and (II) the failure to effect a Change of Recommendation in response
to such Intervening Event would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with
the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law if such changes offered
in writing by the other Party were to be given effect.

  



-43- 

    

(f) _Certain Permitted Disclosure_. Nothing contained in this  _Section_
__ _ 7.2_ shall prohibit Versum or Entegris, as applicable, from (i)
complying with its disclosure obligations under applicable United States
federal or state Law with regard to an Acquisition Proposal or (ii) making
any "stop, look and listen" or similar communication of the type contemplated
by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act pending disclosure of its position
thereunder; _provided_ , _that_ , the foregoing notwithstanding, neither
Entegris nor Versum may effect a Change of Recommendation except in accordance
with _Section_ __ _ 7.2(e)(ii)_ or  _Section_ __ _ 7.2(e)(iii)_.

(g) _Existing Discussions_. Versum and Entegris each shall, and shall
cause their respective Subsidiaries and shall use its reasonable best efforts
to cause their respective Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to
be terminated any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any
Person conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, or
proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal.
Versum and Entegris, as applicable, shall promptly deliver a written notice to
each such Person providing only that each of Versum and Entegris, as
applicable, is ending all discussions and negotiations with such Person with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal, or proposal or transaction that would
reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, which notice shall
also request the prompt return or destruction of all confidential information
concerning Versum and any of its Subsidiaries or Entegris and any of its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, heretofore furnished to such Person by or on
behalf of Versum or Entegris, as applicable, or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, as applicable. Versum and Entegris, as applicable, will promptly
terminate all physical and electronic data access previously granted to
such Persons.

(h) _Standstill Provisions_. During the period commencing with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to
occur of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article_ __ _ IX_ and
the Effective Time, Versum and Entegris, as applicable, shall not terminate,
amend, modify or waive any provision of any confidentiality, "standstill" or
similar agreement to which Versum and Entegris, as applicable, or any of their
respective Subsidiaries is a party and shall enforce, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law, the provisions of any such agreement,
including by obtaining injunctions to prevent any breaches of such agreements
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions thereof.

_Proxy/Prospectus_ "), and Entegris shall prepare and file with the SEC,
Entegriss registration statement on Form S-4 (as amended or supplemented from
time to time, the " _Registration Statement_ ", with the Proxy/Prospectus
constituting a part thereof). Versum and Entegris each shall use its
reasonable best efforts to respond promptly to comments from the SEC and have
the Registration Statement declared effective under the Securities Act as
promptly as practicable after such filing, to promptly thereafter mail the
Proxy/Prospectus (including the Registration Statement) to the respective
stockholders of each of Versum and Entegris, and to maintain the effectiveness
of the Registration Statement for as long as necessary to consummate the
Transactions. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
Parties hereby agree that for purposes of this Agreement, the Registration
Statement will be deemed to have been declared effective so long as the
Parties have abided by any policies and procedures put forth by the SEC
relating to making registration statements effective during a federal
government shutdown, if applicable.

 



-44- 

    

(b) Each of Versum and Entegris shall promptly notify the other of the
receipt of all comments from the SEC and of any request by the SEC for any
amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or the Proxy/Prospectus
or for additional information and shall promptly provide to the other copies
of all correspondence between it or any of its Representatives and the SEC
with respect to the Registration Statement or Proxy/Prospectus. Each of
Entegris and Versum shall advise the other, promptly after receipt of notice
thereof, of the time of effectiveness of the Registration Statement, the
issuance of any stop order relating thereto or the suspension of the
qualification of shares of Entegris Common Stock for offering or sale in any
jurisdiction, and each of Entegris and Versum shall use its reasonable best
efforts to have any such stop order or suspension lifted, reversed or
otherwise terminated. Entegris shall use its reasonable best efforts to take
any other action required to be taken under any applicable securities
Laws, rules or regulations in connection with the Transactions, the issuance
of shares of Entegris Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement and the
treatment of Versum Options and other Versum Equity Awards pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 2.3_, and Versum shall furnish all information concerning
Versum and the holders of Versum Common Stock, Versum and other Versum Equity
Awards as may be reasonably requested in connection with any such action.

 

(c) Each of Versum and Entegris agrees, as to itself and its Subsidiaries,
that none of the information supplied or to be supplied by it or its
Subsidiaries for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i) the
Registration Statement will, at the time the Registration Statement becomes
effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and (ii) the
Proxy/Prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto will, at the date of
mailing to the stockholders of Versum and Entegris and at the times of the
Versum Stockholders Meeting and Entegris Stockholders Meeting, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. Versum and Entegris will cause the Proxy/Prospectus and
Entegris will cause the Registration Statement to comply as to form in all
material respects with the applicable provisions of the Securities Act and the
rules and regulations thereunder. If, at any time prior to the Effective Time,
either Party obtains knowledge of any information pertaining to it or
previously provided by it for inclusion in the Registration Statement or the
Proxy/Prospectus that would require any amendment or supplement to the
Registration Statement or the Proxy/Prospectus so that any of such documents
would not include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, such Party
shall promptly advise the other Party and the Parties shall cooperate in the
prompt filing with the SEC of any necessary amendment or supplement to the
Proxy/Prospectus and the Registration Statement and, as required by applicable
Law, in disseminating the information contained in such amendment or
supplement to the Versum stockholders and the Entegris stockholders.

 



-45- 

    

(d) Each of Versum and Entegris will provide their respective
legal counsel with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on drafts
of the Proxy/Prospectus, the Registration Statement, responses to any comments
from the SEC with respect thereto, and other documents related to the Versum
Stockholders Meeting, the Entegris Stockholders Meeting or the issuance of
the shares of Entegris Common Stock in respect of the Merger, prior to filing
such documents with the applicable Governmental Entity and mailing such
documents to the stockholders of Versum and Entegris, as applicable. Each
Party will include in the Proxy/Prospectus, the Registration Statement and
such other documents related to the Versum Stockholders Meeting, the Entegris
Stockholders Meeting or the issuance of the shares of Entegris Common Stock
in respect of the Merger all comments reasonably and promptly proposed by the

 Subsidiaries businesses, product lines or assets or (z) agreeing to enter

Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or the Combined Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in each case, from and after the Effective

intended communication, the other Party shall have a reasonable period of
time to review and comment on the communication, and the relevant party shall

to create any third-party beneficiary rights in any Employee of Versum,
Entegris or any of their Subsidiaries, any beneficiary or dependent thereof,
or any collective bargaining representative thereof (including any Labor
Organization), with respect to the compensation, terms and conditions of
employment and/or benefits that may be provided to any Versum Continuing

expenses), judgments, inquiries, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities
incurred in connection with, arising out of or otherwise related to any
Proceeding, in connection with, arising out of or otherwise related to
matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, including in
connection with (i) this Agreement or the Transactions, and (ii) actions to
enforce this provision or any other indemnification or advancement right of
any Indemnified Party, and the Combined Company shall also advance expenses as
incurred to the fullest extent that such individual would have been entitled

directors and officers insurance policies, and (ii) Versums existing
fiduciary liability insurance policies, in each case for a claims reporting or
discovery period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time (the "

with respect to directors and officers liability insurance and
fiduciary liability insurance (collectively, " _D andO Insurance_") with terms,
conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are at least as favorable
to the insureds as Versums existing policies with respect to

as of the Effective Time, the Combined Company shall continue to maintain in

for such purpose; and _provided_ , _further_ , that if the cost of such
insurance coverage exceeds such amount, the Combined Company shall obtain a

(c) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this 
_Section_ __ _ 7.14_, upon learning of any such Proceeding, shall promptly
notify the Combined Company thereof in writing, but the failure to so notify
shall not relieve the Combined Company of any liability it may have to
such Indemnified Party except to the extent such failure materially
prejudices the indemnifying party. In the event of any Proceeding: (i) the
Combined Company shall have the right to assume the defense thereof ( _it_
_being_   _understood_ that by electing to assume the defense thereof, the
Combined Company will not be deemed to have waived any right to object to the

Company shall be obligated pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.14(c)_ to pay
for only one firm of legal counsel for all Indemnified Parties in any
jurisdiction unless the use of one legal counsel for such Indemnified Parties
would present such legal counsel with a conflict of interest ( _provided_ that
the fewest number of legal counsels necessary to avoid conflicts of interest
shall be used); (ii) the Indemnified Parties shall cooperate in the defense
of any such matter if the Combined Company elects to assume such defense, and
the Combined Company shall cooperate in the defense of any such matter if the
Combined Company elects not to assume such defense; (iii) the Indemnified
Parties shall not be liable for any settlement effected without their prior
written consent if the Combined Company elects to assume such defense and the
Combined Company shall not be liable for any settlement effected without
their prior written consent the Combined Company elects not to assume such
defense; (iv) the Combined Company shall not have any obligation hereunder to
any Indemnified Party if and when a court of competent jurisdiction shall
ultimately determine, and such determination shall have become final, that the
indemnified action of such Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby
is prohibited by applicable Law; and (v) all rights to indemnification in
respect of any such Proceedings shall continue until final disposition of all
such Proceedings.

 

(d) During the Tail Period, all rights to indemnification and exculpation
from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time and rights to advancement of expenses relating thereto now existing in
favor of any Indemnified Party as provided in the Organizational Documents of
Versum and its Subsidiaries or any indemnification agreement between such
Indemnified Party and Versum or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case, as in
effect on the date of this Agreement, shall survive the Transactions unchanged
and shall not be amended, restated, repealed or otherwise modified in any
manner that would adversely affect any right thereunder of any such
Indemnified Party.

(e) If the Combined Company or any of their respective successors or
assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall
not be the continuing or surviving Person of such consolidation or merger or
(ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of the Combined Company shall assume all of
the obligations set forth in this  _Section_ __ _ 7.14_.

other applicable Contracts of Versum or Laws.

(g) This _Section_ __ _ 7.14_ is intended to be for the benefit of, and
from and after the Effective Time shall be enforceable by, each of the
Indemnified Parties, who shall be third-party beneficiaries of this _Section_

Merger in respect of any calendar quarter or fail to receive a dividend on
either shares of Versum Common Stock or Entegris Common Stock received in the

acquisitions of shares of Entegris Common Stock (including derivative
securities) in connection with the Transactions by any individual who is
subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange
Act with respect to Versum or Entegris or will become subject to such
reporting requirements with respect to Entegris, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act, to the extent permitted by applicable
Laws.

7.18. _Stockholder Litigation_. Each of Versum and Entegris shall promptly
advise the other Party of any litigation commenced after the date hereof
against such Party or any of its directors (in their capacity as such) by any
stockholders of such Party (on their own behalf or on behalf of such Party)
relating to this Agreement or the Transactions, and shall keep the other
Party reasonably informed regarding any such litigation. Each of Versum and
Entegris shall give the other Party the opportunity to participate in the
defense or settlement of any such stockholder litigation, and no such
settlement shall be agreed to without the other Partys prior written consent
