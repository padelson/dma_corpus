 **AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER**

 



 

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ ") is entered into as of
December 11, 2012, by and among The Medicines Company, a Delaware corporation
(the " _Buyer_ "), Silver Surfer Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and
a wholly owned subsidiary of the Buyer (the " _Transitory Subsidiary_ "),
Fortis Advisors LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, solely in its
capacity as the Representative (the " _Representative_ "), and Incline
Therapeutics, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "). The Buyer, the
Transitory Subsidiary, the Company and the Representative are sometimes
referred to herein individually as a " _Party_ " and collectively as the "
_Parties_ ". All capitalized terms used in this Agreement shall have the
meanings given to them in Section 9.1.

 



 

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of the Buyer and the Company deem it
advisable and in the best interests of each corporation and their respective
stockholders that the Buyer acquire the Company in order to advance the long-
term business interests of the Buyer and the Company;

 



 

WHEREAS, the acquisition of the Company by the Buyer shall be effected through
the merger of the Transitory Subsidiary with and into the Company in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the DGCL, as a result of which
the Company shall become a wholly owned direct or indirect subsidiary of the
Buyer;

 



 

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, and as a condition
of the willingness of the Buyer to enter into this Agreement, certain
employees of the Company are entering into non-competition and non-
solicitation agreements with the Buyer; and

 



 

WHEREAS, the Parties intend that, as soon as practicable following the
execution of this Agreement, and as a condition of the willingness of the
Buyer and the Company to enter into this Agreement, certain stockholders of
the Company will cause written consents to approve the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement to be executed by themselves or by their proxy
holders.

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth below, and for
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
are hereby acknowledged, the Buyer, the Transitory Subsidiary and the Company
agree as follows:

 



 

ARTICLE I

 



 

 **THE MERGER**

 



 

1.1 _Effective Time of the Merger_. Subject to the provisions of this
Agreement, prior to the Closing, the Buyer and the Company shall jointly
prepare or cause to be prepared, and immediately following the Closing the
Surviving Corporation shall cause the Certificate of Merger to be filed with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and shall make all other
filings or recordings required under the DGCL in order to give effect to the
Merger. The Merger shall become effective at the Effective Time.

      
 

 



 

1.2 _Closing_. The Closing shall take place at 10:00 a.m., Eastern time, on

time is agreed to in writing by the Buyer and the Company.

 



 

1.3 _Effects of the Merger_. At the Effective Time (a) the separate existence
of the Transitory Subsidiary shall cease and the Transitory Subsidiary shall
be merged with and into the Company and (b) the certificate of incorporation
of the Company as in effect on the date of this Agreement shall be amended and
restated in its entirety to read as set forth on _Exhibit A_. In addition,
the Buyer shall cause the by-laws of the Surviving Corporation to be amended
and restated in their entirety so that, immediately following the Effective
Time, they are identical to the by-laws of the Transitory Subsidiary as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that all references to
the name of the Transitory Subsidiary therein shall be changed to refer to the
name of the Company. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in Section
259 of the DGCL.

 



 

1.4 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_.

ARTICLE II

 



 

 **CONVERSION OF SECURITIES**

 



 

2.1 _Conversion of Capital Stock_.

 



 

(a) _Capital Stock of the Transitory Subsidiary_. At the Effective Time, each
share of the Common Shares of the Transitory Subsidiary issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger, be
converted into and become one (1) fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock, $0.0001 par value per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Buyer-Owned Stock_. At the Effective
Time, all Company Shares that are owned by the Company as treasury stock and
any Company Shares owned by the Buyer, the Transitory Subsidiary or any other
wholly owned subsidiary of the Buyer immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall, by virtue of the Merger, be cancelled and shall cease to exist and no
payment or consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) _Conversion of Company Shares_. Each Company Share issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (i) Company Shares
referenced in Section 2.1(b) and (ii) Dissenting Shares) shall, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the Buyer or any holder of
Company Stock, be converted into the right of the holder of such Company Share
to receive (A) the Closing Stock Consideration and (B) its Pro Rata Share of
the Escrow Payment, Net Milestone Payments, Closing Adjustment Surplus and
Representative Account Payment payable with respect to such Company Share in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

 



 

(d) _Total Consideration_. The total consideration payable by the Buyer to the
Company Equityholders, on behalf of itself or the Surviving Corporation (the "
_Total Consideration_ "), shall be comprised of:

 



 

(i) the Aggregate Closing Stock Consideration, payable in cash on the Closing
Date to the Paying Agent (to be further distributed to holders of Company
Shares as set forth on the Closing Date Allocation Schedule in accordance with
the provisions of Section 2.2);

 



 

(ii) the Aggregate Closing Option Consideration, payable to the holders of
Options in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.5;

 



 

(iii) the Escrow Payment, payable to the Company Equityholders in proportion
to each Company Equityholders Pro Rata Share;

 



 

(iv) the Net Milestone Payments, payable to the Company Equityholders in
proportion to each Company Equityholders Pro Rata Share, in accordance with
the provisions of Section 2.6(d);

 



 

(v) the Closing Adjustment Surplus, payable to the Company Equityholders in
proportion to each Company Equityholders Pro Rata Share, in accordance with
Section 2.7(e); and

 



 

(vi) the Representative Account Payment, payable to the Company Equityholders
in proportion to each Company Equityholders Pro Rata Share, in connection
with any release of the Representative Expense Amount in accordance with
Section 2.4(c).

 



 

(e) _Adjustments to Stock Consideration_. The Stock Consideration shall be
adjusted to reflect fully any reclassification, stock split, reverse split,
stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities
convertible into Company Shares), reorganization, recapitalization or other
like change with respect to Company Shares occurring (or for which a record
date is established) after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time;
_provided_ that in no event shall any such event result in an increase or
decrease in the aggregate amount payable by the Buyer or its Affiliates
hereunder.

 



      
 

 



 

(f) _Escrow_. At Closing, Buyer will deliver the Original Escrow Amount to the
Escrow Agent. The Escrow Fund shall be held by the Escrow Agent and released
by the Escrow Agent to the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or the
Buyer, as applicable, in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement.
Any portion of the Escrow Fund released to the Paying Agent pursuant to the
terms of the Escrow Agreement shall be for the benefit of the holders of
Company Shares and shall be paid by the Paying Agent (reduced by any
applicable withholding) to holders of Company Shares in accordance with their
Pro Rata Shares, as set forth on the Closing Date Allocation Schedule. Any
portion of the Escrow Fund released to the Surviving Corporation pursuant to
the terms of the Escrow Agreement shall be for the benefit of holders of
Options and shall be paid by the Surviving Corporation (reduced by any
applicable withholding) to holders of Options in accordance with their Pro
Rata Shares, as set forth on the Closing Date Allocation Schedule.

 



 

2.2 _Payment Fund_. The procedures for exchanging outstanding Company Shares
for the consideration to be paid to the holders of such Company Shares in
connection with the Merger are as follows:

 



 

(a) _Paying Agent_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Buyer shall deposit
the Payment Fund with the Paying Agent for the benefit of the holders of
Company Shares for payment through the Paying Agent in accordance with this
Section 2.2 in exchange for all of the outstanding Company Shares. Any
earnings from investment of the Payment Fund shall accrue to the benefit of
the Buyer.

 



 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly (and in any event within three (3)
Business Days) after the Effective Time, the Buyer shall cause the Paying
Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate (i) a Letter of
Transmittal and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of such
Certificate in exchange for the applicable portion of the Stock Consideration
payable with respect thereto, _provided_ that the Buyer shall assist the
Company in developing arrangements for the delivery of such materials to those
Company stockholders designated by the Company to facilitate the payment of
the applicable portion of the Stock Consideration to such designated
stockholders immediately following the Effective Time. Upon surrender of a
Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with a duly
executed Letter of Transmittal, the holder of such Certificate shall be paid
promptly (and in any event within three (3) Business Days) in exchange
therefor cash in an amount equal to (i) the portion of the Aggregate Closing
Stock Consideration that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the
provisions of this Article II in respect of all Company Shares represented by
such Certificate, plus (ii) as and when payable, the portion of all other
Stock Consideration that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the
provisions of this Article II in respect of all Company Shares represented by
such Certificate. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Shares
which is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the applicable
Stock Consideration may be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose
name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate is
presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents required to
evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable

 



      
 

 



 

stock transfer Taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
Section 2.2(b), each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the
applicable Stock Consideration as contemplated by this Section 2.2(b).

 



 

(c) _Allocation Schedules_.

 



 

(i) The Initial Allocation Schedule attached hereto as _Exhibit B_ sets forth
a summary of the allocation (estimated as of the date hereof) of the amounts
payable at the Closing to the Company Equityholders and Leerink Swann LLC
(which amount payable to Leerink Swann LLC shall be as set forth in the
calculation of the Closing Purchase Price). The Company shall deliver to the
Buyer and the Paying Agent, at least three (3) Business Days prior to the
Closing, the Closing Date Allocation Schedule (which schedule shall reflect
the amounts set forth on the Estimated Closing Adjustment Statement). The
Paying Agent shall make all payments constituting the Aggregate Closing Stock
Consideration to the applicable Company Stockholders in accordance with the
Closing Date Allocation Schedule and the Letters of Transmittal.

 



 

(ii) It is expressly acknowledged and agreed that the preparation of the
Closing Date Allocation Schedule and the allocation of the Total Consideration
set forth therein are the sole responsibility of the Representative and that
Buyer, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to
rely thereon, without any obligation to investigate or verify the accuracy or
correctness thereof and to make payments in accordance therewith. None of
Buyer, the Surviving Company, the Paying Agent or any of their Affiliates
shall have any liability in connection with any claims by any Company
Equityholder or any other Person relating to any alleged inaccuracy or
miscalculations in, or otherwise relating to, the preparation of the Closing
Date Allocation Schedule and the allocation of the Total Consideration set
forth therein or payments made in accordance therewith. In consideration for
its receipt of its allocation of Total Consideration in accordance with (and
subject to) the Closing Date Allocation Schedule, each Company Equityholder
hereby irrevocably waives, releases and promises never to assert any claims or
causes of action, promises or similar rights of any type (however described
and however arising) that such Company Equityholder may currently have, or may
have in the future, whether or not now known, against the Company, the Buyer,
the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective predecessors, successors,
parent corporations, subsidiaries, stockholders, directors, officers,
employees, consultants, attorneys, agents, assigns and employee benefit plans
(the " _Released Parties_ ") with respect to any matter related to such
allocation, including the accuracy or correctness of the Closing Date
Allocation Schedule (the " _Released Claims_ "). Each Company Equityholder
acknowledges that it may hereafter discover facts other than or different from
those that it knows or believes to be true with respect to the subject matter
of the Released Claims, but it hereby expressly agrees that, on and as of the
Effective Time, such Company Equityholder shall have waived and fully, finally
and forever settled and released any known or unknown, suspected or
unsuspected, asserted or unasserted, contingent or

 



      
 

 



 

noncontingent claim with respect to the Released Claims, whether or not
concealed or hidden, without regard to the subsequent discovery or existence
of such different or additional facts.

 



 

(iii) Each Company Equityholder hereby acknowledges and agrees that if it
should hereafter make any claim or demand or commence or threaten to commence
any action, claim or proceeding against any Released Party with respect to any
Released Claim, this Section 2.2(c) may be raised as a complete bar to any
such action, claim or proceeding, and the applicable Released Party may
recover from such Company Equityholder all costs incurred in connection with
such action, claim or proceeding, including attorneys fees.

 



 

(d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Shares_. All Stock Consideration
paid or payable upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates in accordance
with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to such shares of Company Shares. From and after the
Effective Time there shall be no further registration of transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the Company Shares which
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided
in this Article II.

 



 

(e) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of Company Shares for one (1) year after
the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Buyer (subject to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law), upon demand, and any holder of
Company Shares who has not previously complied with this Section 2.2 shall be
entitled to receive from the Buyer (subject to abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law) the Stock Consideration that such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to the provisions of this Article II.

 



 

(f) _No Liability_. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, none of the
Buyer, the Transitory Subsidiary, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or
the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of Company Shares delivered to
a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.

 



 

(g) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Paying Agent, the Buyer (and its payroll
agent), the Escrow Agent and the Surviving Corporation (and its payroll agent)
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration otherwise
payable to the Company Equityholders pursuant to this Agreement such amounts
as it reasonably determines it is required to deduct and withhold with respect
to the making of such payment under the Code, or any other applicable Law. To
the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld by the Paying Agent, the
Buyer (or its payroll agent), the Escrow Agent or the Surviving Corporation
(or its payroll agent), as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be (i)
remitted by the Paying Agent, the Buyer (or its payroll agent), the Escrow
Agent or the Surviving Corporation (or its payroll agent), as the case may be,
to the applicable Governmental Entity, and (ii) if so remitted, treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to such Company
Equityholder in respect of which such

 



       
 

 



 

deduction and withholding was made by the Paying Agent, the Buyer, the Escrow
Agent or the Surviving Corporation (or its payroll agent), as the case may be.

 



 

(h) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact and a customary
indemnification of the Company and the Buyer in a form reasonably satisfactory
to the Buyer by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed, the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the Stock Consideration deliverable in respect thereof
as and when payable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

 



 

2.3 _Dissenting Shares_.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into or represent the right to
receive any portion of the Stock Consideration in accordance with Section 2.1,
but shall be entitled only to such rights as are granted by the DGCL to a
holder of Dissenting Shares.

 



 

(b) If any Dissenting Shares shall lose their status as such (through failure
to perfect or otherwise), then, as of the later of the Effective Time or the
date of loss of such status, such shares shall automatically be converted into
and shall represent only the right to receive the portion of the Stock
Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement, without
interest thereon, upon surrender of the Certificate formerly representing such
shares.

 



 

(c) The Company shall give the Buyer: (i) prompt notice of any written demand
for appraisal received by the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to
the DGCL, any withdrawal of any such demand and any other demand, notice or
instrument delivered to the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to
the DGCL that relate to such demand and (ii) the opportunity to direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demand, notice or
instrument. Neither the Representative nor the Company shall settle or make
any payment or settlement offer prior to the Effective Time with respect to
any such demand, notice or instrument unless the Buyer shall have given its
written consent to such settlement, payment or settlement offer.

 



 

2.4 _Representative_.

 



 

(a) By their execution of the Letter of Transmittal and/or Option Surrender
Agreement, approval of the Merger and adoption of this Agreement and/or their
acceptance of any consideration pursuant to this Agreement, the Company
Equityholders hereby appoint the Representative as the representative,
attorney-in-fact and agent of the Company Equityholders in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and in
any litigation or arbitration involving this Agreement and/or the Escrow
Agreement. In connection therewith, the Representative is authorized to do or
refrain from doing all further acts and things, and to execute all such
documents as the Representative shall deem necessary or

 



      
 

 



 

appropriate, and, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement,
shall have the power and authority to:

 



 

(i) act for the Company Equityholders with regard to all matters pertaining to
this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement; including, employ, obtain and rely
upon the advice of legal counsel, accountants and other professional advisors
as the Representative, in its sole discretion, deems necessary or advisable in
the performance of the duties of the Representative;

 



 

(ii) act for the Company Equityholders to transact matters of litigation;

 



 

(iii) execute and deliver all amendments, waivers, ancillary agreements,
certificates and documents that the Representative deems necessary or
appropriate in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement;

 



 

(iv) receive funds, make payments of funds, and give receipts for funds;

 



 

(v) do or refrain from doing any further act or deed on behalf of the Company
Equityholders that the Representative deems necessary or appropriate in its
discretion relating to the subject matter of this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement as fully and completely as the Company Equityholders could do if
personally present;

 



 

(vi) give and receive all notices required to be given or received by the
Company Equityholders under this Agreement;

 



 

(vii) give any written direction to the Escrow Agent;

 



 

(viii) agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of and
comply with arbitration awards and court orders with respect to claims for
indemnification made by the Buyer under Article VII; and

 



 

(ix) receive service of process in connection with any claims under this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.

 



 

(b) All decisions and actions by the Representative shall be binding upon all
Company Equityholders, and no Company Equityholder shall have the right to
object, dissent, protest or otherwise contest the same.

 



 

(c) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, upon the Closing,
the Buyer shall wire to the Representative the Representative Expense Amount
pursuant to wire instructions provided to the Buyer, which shall be held by
the Representative as agent in a segregated client account and shall be used
for the purposes of paying directly, or reimbursing

 



      
 

 



 

the Representative for, any expenses incurred pursuant to this Agreement, the
Escrow Agreement or any Representative engagement agreement. The
Representative will hold these funds separate from its corporate funds. The
Company Equityholders shall not receive interest or other earnings on amounts
in the Representative Expense Amount and the Company Equityholders irrevocably
transfer and assign to the Representative any ownership right that they may
have in any interest that may accrue on amounts in the Representative Expense
Amount. The Company Equityholders acknowledge that the Representative is not
providing any investment supervision, recommendations or advice. The
Representative shall have no responsibility or liability for any loss of
principal of the Representative Expense Amount other than as a result of its
gross negligence or willful misconduct. As soon as practicable following the
later of (i) the final release of the final Net Milestone Payment or (ii) the
final resolution of any claims made under this Agreement, the Representative
shall distribute the Representative Account Payment (if any) to the Buyer
and/or its paying agent for distribution to the Company Equityholders. For tax
purposes, the Representative Expense Amount shall be treated as having been
received and voluntarily set aside by the Company Equityholders at the time of
Closing. The Representative is not acting as a withholding agent or in any
similar capacity in connection with the Representative Expense Amount.

 



 

(d) _Representative Limitation of Liability and Indemnification_.

 



 

(i) To the maximum extent permissible by applicable Law, the Representative
shall incur no liability of any kind to any Company Equityholders or any
Affiliate of any Company Equityholder with respect to any action or inaction
taken or failed to be taken, by it or by its agents, in connection with its
services as the Representative, except with respect to its own willful
misconduct or gross negligence. Anything in this Agreement to the contrary
notwithstanding, in no event shall the Representative be liable under this
Agreement or any of the ancillary agreements to the Company Equityholders for
special, indirect, punitive or consequential loss or damage of any kind
whatsoever (including but not limited to lost profits), regardless of whether
or not any such damages were foreseeable or contemplated and even if the
Representative has been advised of the likelihood of such loss or damage, no
matter the form of action. The Representative may act in reliance upon any
signature believed by it to be genuine and may reasonably assume that such
person has proper authorization to sign on behalf of the applicable Company
Equityholder or other party. In all questions arising under this Agreement or
any of the ancillary agreements, the Representative may rely on the advice of
counsel, accountants or other skilled persons, and the Representative will not
be liable to any Company Equityholders or any Affiliate of any Company
Equityholder for anything done, omitted or suffered in good faith by the
Representative based on such advice of counsel, accountants or other skilled
persons, as the case may be. No provision of this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby shall require the Representative to expend or
risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the exercise
or performance of any of its powers, rights, duties or privileges under this
Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or any ancillary agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby. Furthermore, the Representative shall not be
required to take any action unless the Representative has been provided with
funds,

 



      
 

 



 

security or indemnities which, in its determination, are sufficient to protect
the Representative against the costs, expenses and liabilities which may be
incurred by the Representative in performing such actions.

 



 

(ii) The Representative and its members, managers, directors, officers, agents
and employees shall be indemnified, defended and held harmless as set forth
from and against any and all losses or damages arising out of or in connection
with the Representatives execution and performance of this Agreement, the
Escrow Agreement and the ancillary agreements, or otherwise in connection with
acting as the Representative, in each case as such loss or damage is incurred.
Any such losses or damages shall be recovered first from the Representative
Fund, next, from any distribution of the Escrow Fund or Net Milestone Payments
otherwise distributable to the Company Equityholders pursuant to the terms
hereof and the Escrow Agreement at the time of distribution in accordance with
written instructions delivered by the Representative to the Escrow Agent (the
" _Distributable Funds_ "), and finally, directly from the Company
Equityholders (with each Company Equityholder liable for its Pro Rata Share of
any such claim).

 



 

(iii) The Representative is hereby granted a lien on, right of set-off against
and security interest in the Distributable Funds for the payment of any claim
for indemnification, compensation, expenses and amounts due hereunder.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, none of Buyer or
the Company or any of their respective Affiliates shall have any liability or
obligation to indemnify, defend or hold harmless the Representative. In
addition, certain Company Equityholders (the " _Advisory Group_ ") have
concurrently herewith entered into a letter agreement with the Representative
regarding direction to be provided by the Advisory Group to the
Representative. The Advisory Group shall incur no liability to any Company
Equityholder while acting in good faith and arising out of or in connection
with the acceptance or administration of their duties (it being understood
that any act done or omitted pursuant to the advice of counsel shall be
conclusive evidence of such good faith). All of the immunities and powers
granted to the Representative under this Agreement shall survive the
resignation or removal of Representative and the Closing and/or any
termination of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.

 



 

(iv) The parties hereto agree that to the extent the Representative receives
documents, spreadsheets or other forms of information from any party and the
Representative is required to deliver any such document, spreadsheet or other
form of information to another party, the Representative is not responsible
for the content of such materials, nor is the Representative responsible for
confirming the accuracy of any information contained in such materials or
reconciling the content of any such materials with any other documents,
spreadsheets or other information).

 



 

(e) The Company and the Buyer shall, subject to the provisions of Section
2.4(f), provide the Representative with (i) reasonable access to relevant
information about the

 



      
 

 



 

Company and the Buyer and (ii) reasonable assistance from the Companys and
the Buyers employees for purposes of performing its duties and exercising its
rights hereunder.

 



 

(f) The Representative shall treat confidentially and not use other than in
the performance of its duties as the Representative and not disclose to any
other Person any information disclosed to it pursuant to this Agreement to
anyone except as required by Law, provided that (i) the Representative may
disclose to legal counsel and other advisors under an obligation of
confidentiality and non-use in such advisors capacity as such (for the
purpose of advising the Representative and the Company Equityholders on any
information disclosed to the Representative pursuant to this Agreement), (ii)
the Representative (or legal counsel or other advisor to whom information is
disclosed pursuant to clause (i) above) may disclose in any Legal Proceeding
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (or, in
either case, discussion in preparation therefor) any information disclosed to
the Representative pursuant to this Agreement and (iii) the Representative may
disclose to Alan Levy, 5 AM Venture Management, LLC, Frazier Healthcare,
Technology Partners, Adams Street Partners, LLC Saints Capital and Emergent
Medical Partners, L.P. (but not to any other Person, including any investor in
any of the foregoing Persons) any information disclosed to the Representative,
subject to the Persons to whom the disclosure is to be made agreeing with the
Buyer in writing to restrictions on the disclosure and use of such information
consistent with the restrictions to which the Representative is subject
pursuant to this Section 2.4(f).

 



 

(g) In the event the Representative becomes unable to perform its
responsibilities hereunder or resigns from such position, the Company
Equityholders (acting by a written instrument signed by holders of Company
Shares who held, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, a majority (by
voting power) of the then outstanding Company Shares) shall select another
representative to fill the vacancy of the Representative, and such substituted
representative shall be deemed to be the Representative for all purposes of
this Agreement. The Representative may only be removed upon delivery of
written notice to the Buyer signed by Persons who, as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time, held a majority (by voting power) of the then outstanding
Company Shares. The Representative shall provide the Buyer prompt written
notice of any replacement of the Representative, including the identity and
address of the new Representative. Upon any replacement of the Representative,
the Representative being replaced shall transfer to the new Representative the
balance of any unexpended Representative Expense Amount.

 



 

(h) For all purposes of this Agreement:

 



 

(i) the Buyer shall be entitled to rely conclusively on the instructions and
decisions of the Representative as to the settlement of any disputes or claims
under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, or any other actions required
or permitted to be taken by the Representative hereunder, and no party
hereunder shall have any cause of action against the Buyer for any action
taken by the Buyer in reliance upon the instructions or decisions of the
Representative;

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) the provisions of this Section 2.4 are independent and severable, are
irrevocable and coupled with an interest and shall be enforceable
notwithstanding any rights or remedies that any Company Equityholder may have
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and

 



 

(iii) the provisions of this Section 2.4 shall be binding upon the executors,
heirs, legal representatives, personal representatives, successor trustees and
successors of each Company Equityholder, and any references in this Agreement
to a Company Equityholder shall mean and include the successors to the rights
of each applicable Company Equityholder hereunder, whether pursuant to
testamentary disposition, the Laws of descent and distribution or otherwise.

 



 

2.5 _Treatment of Options and Restricted Stock_.

 



 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall (i) take such actions as
may be necessary so that all Options shall be (A) duly exercised and shares of
Common Stock issued in respect of the Option in accordance with the terms of
the applicable Option agreement prior to the Effective Time, (B) surrendered
and cancelled as of the Effective Time and converted into the right to receive
the Option Consideration payable in cash to the holder thereof, without
interest thereon, pursuant to this Section 2.5 upon delivery by the holder of
an Option of an executed option surrender agreement, which agreement shall be
effective as of the Effective Time, in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit
C_ (an " _Option Surrender Agreement_ ") in exchange for the payments
described, and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this Section
2.5 or (C) terminated as of immediately prior to the Effective Time; and (ii)
take such actions as may be necessary so that all Common Shares that are
unvested or are subject to a repurchase option in favor of the Company (the "
_Restricted Shares_ ") shall be accelerated as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time and shall, by virtue of the Merger, be converted into the right
to receive the portion of the Stock Consideration payable pursuant to Section
2.1(c) of this Agreement with respect to Common Shares. The installment
payments received by a holder of an Option under this Section 2.5(a) are
intended to be separate "payments" for purposes of Section 409A of the Code
and the guidance and regulations thereunder.

 



 

(b) At the Effective Time, each Option that is then outstanding (whether such
Option is vested or unvested, but only to the extent it has not yet been
exercised as of such time) shall be cancelled and converted into the right to
receive the Option Consideration, subject to withholding as provided in
Section 2.2(g). After the Effective Time, any such cancelled Option shall no
longer be exercisable by the holder thereof for Company Shares (or any other
equity security), but shall only entitle such holder to the Option
Consideration described in the preceding sentence.

 



 

(c) The Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay as promptly as
practicable (and in any event, no later than the next payroll date of the
Surviving Corporation) to each holder of Options the applicable Closing Option
Consideration in accordance with the

 



      
 

 



 

Closing Date Allocation Schedule. The Buyer shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to pay to each holder of Options each additional payment of the
Option Consideration (i) concurrently with the payment of such portion of the
Total Consideration to the holders of Company Shares and (ii) in accordance
with the Closing Date Allocation Schedule.

 



 

2.6 _Milestone Payments_. The Company Equityholders shall be entitled to
payments following the Closing as set forth in this Section 2.6 or as
otherwise agreed following the Closing by the Buyer and the Representative
with the written consent of the Required Stockholders (such payments, as set
forth below, the " _Milestone Payments_ ").

 



 

(a) _Milestone Events; Notice of Achievement_. The Buyer shall provide written
notice to the Representative of the achievement by or on behalf of any member
of the Buyer Rights Chain Group of each of the milestone events (each, a "
_Milestone Event_ ") for each applicable milestone set forth in the table
below (each, a " _Milestone_ ") within (i) for Milestone A, Milestone #1 and
Milestone #2, 20 Business Days after the date of first achievement of such
Milestone Event and (ii) for Milestone #3 and Milestone #4, 40 Business Days
after the end of the calendar quarter in which such Milestone Event is first
achieved, and upon such achievement, shall pay, on the terms set forth in
Section 2.6(d), the applicable Milestone Payment in an amount equal to the
corresponding amount of the Milestone Payment set forth in the chart below:

received within [**] months from the effective date of such Japan Agreement;
and provided further, that in both such cases ((i) and (ii)) any amounts

(b) _Diligence_.

 



 

(i) Following the Closing, until the expiration of the Diligence Period, the
Buyer shall itself and/or with or through other members of the Buyer Rights
Chain Group, as applicable, use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to achieve the
Milestone Events. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyers obligations under
this Section 2.6(b):

 



 

(a) shall expire (A) as to Milestone #1 on the [**] if Regulatory Approval has
not been achieved in the United States as of such [**], (B) as to Milestone #2
on the date [**] if Regulatory Approval has not been achieved in the European
Union as of the end of such [**] period and (C) as to Milestone A, [**] months
after the Closing Date if a Japan Agreement has not been entered into as of
such date;

 



      
 

 



 

(b) if the Buyer enters into any agreement for the sale, transfer, assignment
or exclusive license of the Product for any territories other than Japan, the
Buyer shall not be obligated to include the territory of Japan in such
Agreement;

 



 

(c) shall not include an obligation to seek any additional Regulatory Approval
or label expansion for the Product (A) in the United States following the
initial Regulatory Approval in the United States or (B) in the European Union
following the initial Regulatory Approval in the European Union; and

 



 

(d) shall not include an obligation to conduct any clinical trial or
nonclinical study of the Product other than the completion of those studies
set forth on _Schedule 2.6(b)(iii)_ , whether or not such studies result in
any Regulatory Approval.

 



 

(ii) If the Buyer terminates or abandons all development and, if commenced as
of such time, commercialization activities with respect to the Product, the
Buyer shall send written notice thereof to the Representative together with an
explanation of the reasons for such cessation of activities.

 



 

(iii) If the Representative in good faith believes that the Buyer has
materially breached its obligations under this Section 2.6, then the
Representative may provide the Buyer with written notice thereof, which notice
shall specify the alleged material breach. If such notice is given, the Buyer
shall designate one or more Buyer Milestone Representatives to meet with the
Representative (in person at the Buyers offices or by telephone) within
fifteen (15) Business Days from the date of such notice to address the
Representatives belief that the Buyer has materially breached its obligations
under this Section 2.6. The discussion between the Buyer Milestone
Representative(s) and the Representative shall be subject to the
confidentiality obligations of Section 2.4(f) and regarded as for settlement
purposes only, and no statement made in the course of the discussion shall be
admissible in any subsequent Legal Proceeding, although the fact that
something is stated in the course of the discussion will not preclude a party
to a Legal Proceeding from adducing other evidence of an identical or similar
nature that otherwise would be permitted in the Legal Proceeding. In the event
that the Representative and the Buyer Milestone Representatives are unable to
resolve the Representatives claim of the alleged material breach by (A) the
date that is thirty (30) Business Days after such meeting, or (B) the date
that is sixty (60) Business Days after the written notice from the
Representative to the Buyer of the alleged material breach if no meeting
(whether in person or by telephone) has been held by such date, then the
Representative may pursue any available remedies, subject to Section
2.6(b)(iv), unless the Buyer and the Representative mutually agree to an
extension to the foregoing time periods.

 



       
 

 



 

(iv) Nothing herein shall constitute a guarantee by the Buyer of the
achievement of any or all of the Milestone Events. The Buyers maximum
aggregate liability for any and all breaches by the Buyer of its obligations
under this Section 2.6(b) shall be limited to the unpaid portion(s), if any,
of the Milestone Payment(s) that Buyer would have become obligated to pay if
the Buyer had exercised the requisite Commercially Reasonable Efforts.

 



 

(c) _Reporting; Recordkeeping; Audits_.

 



 

(i) _Reporting_. Until the earlier of (A) such time as all Milestone Payments
have been paid by the Buyer pursuant to this Section 2.6 or (B) the expiration
of the Diligence Period, the Buyer shall provide the Representative, on a
semi-annual basis (i.e., every six months), on or about October 1st and April
1st of each year within such period, a written summary in reasonable detail
regarding the status of efforts to achieve the Milestone Events, the Buyers
progress with respect thereto, including a report of Net Sales generated
during such period, and the Buyers then-current plans for progressing toward
the achievement thereof (each such report, an " _Update Report_ "). Within
twenty (20) Business Days after delivery of an Update Report, if the
Representative requests in writing a meeting with representatives of the Buyer
to discuss such report, the Buyer shall make available for such a meeting to
be held in the Buyers offices one or more representatives (as determined by
the Buyer) (each such person, a " _Buyer Milestone Representative_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that, for the avoidance of doubt, at any such
meeting, other representatives (including counsel and advisors) of the Buyer
may be present. The Representative may not request more than one (1) meeting
with the Buyer in any twelve (12) month period. In the absence of a timely
written request by the Representative for such a meeting, the Buyer shall not
have any further obligations to hold any meeting. All information contained in
any Update Report, or conveyed to the Representative in any meeting or other
communication regarding an Update Report, shall be subject to the
confidentiality obligations set forth in Section 2.4(f). Each of the Buyer and
the Representative shall be solely responsible for bearing its own costs
associated with exercising its rights or performing its obligation under this
Section 2.6(c)(i).

 



 

(ii) _Recordkeeping_. Until the earlier of (A) such time as all Milestone
Payments with respect to Milestone #3 and Milestone #4 have been paid by the
Buyer pursuant to this Section 2.6 or (B) the expiration of the time period
for the achievement of Milestone #4 (or such earlier time as the Buyers
diligence obligations shall have terminated in accordance with the provisions
of Section 2.6(b)) (the " _Audit Period_ "), and thereafter as needed for any
audit requested during the Audit Period with respect to such Milestone Events,
the Buyer shall, and shall cause each other Person in the Buyer Rights Chain
Group to, maintain reasonable documentation, consistent with each such
Persons customary practices and in compliance with applicable Laws, regarding
its activities relating to seeking and obtaining Regulatory Approval in the
United States and the European Union, and keep complete and accurate books and
records of Net Sales to the extent necessary to ascertain properly and to
verify the payments owed hereunder.

 



      
 

 



 

(iii) _Audits_. Upon the written request of the Representative, the Buyer
shall, and shall cause each other Person in the Buyer Rights Chain Group to,
permit a nationally recognized independent accounting firm (the " _Independent
Auditor_ ") selected by the Representative and reasonably satisfactory to
Buyer or, in the case of Persons in the Buyer Rights Chain Group who are not
the Buyer or its Affiliates, selected by the Representative and reasonably
satisfactory to such Person, at the Company Equityholders expense (and
subject to entry into a customary confidentiality agreement), to have access
solely in response to a request made during the Audit Period, upon reasonable
prior notice and during normal business hours, but no more than one (1) time
during any calendar year, to inspect the books and records specified in
Section 2.6(c)(ii) for the three (3) preceding years (but only to the extent
not previously audited pursuant to a previous audit pursuant to this Section
2.6(c)(iii)) and only if in response to a request made during the Audit Period
for the purpose of determining the accuracy of the reports of Net Sales
described in Section 2.6(c)(i).

 



 

(d) _Payments_.

 



 

(i) Each Net Milestone Payment shall, subject to the provisions of Section
7.5, be paid in cash by the Buyer to the Paying Agent or the Surviving
Corporation for further distribution to the Company Equityholders, within the
time period set forth in Section 2.6(a) within which the Buyer is obligated to
notify the Representative of the achievement of the applicable Milestone
(i.e., not later than 20 Business Days after the date of first achievement of
Milestones A, #1 and #2, and not later than 40 Business Days after the end of
the calendar quarter in which Milestone Event Milestone #3 and Milestone #4 is
first achieved). Any portion of any Net Milestone Payment paid to the Paying
Agent shall be paid by the Paying Agent (reduced by any applicable
withholding) to holders of Company Shares. Any portion of any Net Milestone
Payment paid to the Surviving Corporation shall be for the benefit of holders
of Options and shall be paid by the Surviving Corporation (reduced by any
applicable withholding) to holders of Options. The Buyer shall, subject to the
provisions of Section 7.5, pay to Leerink Swann LLC the portion of each
Milestone Payment set forth on the Closing Date Allocation Schedule.

 



 

(ii) For the avoidance of doubt, no Milestone Payment may become payable more
than one time.

 



 

(e) _Non-Transferability_. The right of any Company Equityholder to receive
any amounts with respect to a Net Milestone Payment (i) shall not be evidenced
by a certificate or other instrument, (ii) shall not be assignable or
otherwise transferable by such Company Equityholder, except by will, upon
death or by operation of Law and (iii) does not represent any right other than
the right to receive the consideration set forth this Section 2.6. Any
attempted transfer of the right to any amounts with respect to a Net Milestone
Payment by any holder thereof (other than as specifically permitted by the
immediately preceding sentence) shall be null and void.

 



      
 

 



 

(f) _License, Sublicense, Assignment or Transfer of Intellectual Property_.
Until the expiration of the time period for the achievement of Milestone #4
(or such earlier time as the Buyers diligence obligations shall have
terminated in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.6(b), the Buyer, the
Buyers Affiliates and the Surviving Corporation or their direct or indirect
subsidiaries shall not, directly or through one or more intermediaries (i.e.,
whether through one or more assignments, one or more levels of licenses and/or
sublicenses, any combination thereof or otherwise) license, sublicense, assign
or transfer the Intellectual Property covering the Product as of the Closing
Date (other than licensing or sublicensing to third party contractors and
service providers who are not granted the right to sell, market or otherwise
distribute the Product), or otherwise transfer or convey the right to market
or sell the Product, to any Person other than the Buyer, the Buyers
Affiliates or the Surviving Corporation or their direct or indirect
subsidiaries, unless (A) the Buyer remains ultimately responsible for the
payment of all applicable Milestone Payments if and as they become due and
owing; and (B) such licensee, sublicensee, assignee or transferee agrees to
provide timely information to and to cooperate with the Buyer to allow the
Buyer to meet its obligations pursuant to Section 2.6(c). In addition, the
Buyer shall notify the Representative within twenty (20) Business Days after
the consummation of such license, sublicense, assignment or transfer.

 



 

2.7 _Adjustment Before and After the Closing_. The Total Consideration shall
be subject to adjustment as follows:

 



 

(a) Not later than eight (8) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall prepare and deliver to the Buyer a statement (the " _Estimated
Closing Adjustment Statement_ ") setting forth the Estimated Closing
Adjustment, together with all relevant backup materials, in detail reasonably
acceptable to the Buyer. If within three (3) Business Days following the
Buyers actual receipt of the Estimated Closing Adjustment Statement, the
Buyer has not given the Company notice of its objection to the Estimated
Closing Adjustment, the Closing Purchase Price shall be adjusted as set forth
in the Estimated Closing Adjustment Statement. If the Buyer gives such notice
of objection, the Company and the Buyer will work together in good faith to
resolve the issues in dispute. If all disputed issues are resolved, the
amounts as agreed upon by the Buyer and the Company shall be used to complete
the Estimated Closing Adjustment. If the Buyer and the Company are unable to
resolve all such disputed issues within two (2) Business Days following the
Buyers delivery of the notice of objection to the Estimated Closing
Adjustment Statement, the Estimated Closing Adjustment shall be as determined
by the Buyer.

 



 

(b) Not later than 60 calendar days after the Closing Date, the Buyer shall
deliver to the Representative the Closing Adjustment Statement. The Closing
Adjustment Statement shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP applied
consistently with the Companys past practices (to the extent such past
practices are consistent with GAAP). The Closing Adjustment Statement
delivered pursuant to paragraph (b) above shall be accompanied by (i) all
relevant backup materials, in detail reasonably acceptable to the
Representative, and (ii) a

 



      
 

 



 

statement setting forth the amount, if any, by which the total of the Closing
Adjustment Items is greater than, or less than, the Estimated Closing
Adjustment.

 



 

(c) In the event that the Representative disputes the Closing Adjustment
Statement or the amount of the Closing Adjustment Items, the Representative
shall notify the Buyer in writing (the " _Dispute Notice_ ") of the amount,
nature and basis of such dispute, within 30 calendar days after delivery of
the Closing Adjustment Statement. Any such Dispute Notice shall specify those
items or amounts as to which the Representative disagrees, and the
Representative shall be deemed to have agreed with all other items and amounts
contained in the Closing Adjustment Statement and the amount of the Closing
Adjustment Items delivered pursuant to Section 2.7(b). In the event of such a
dispute, the Buyer and the Representative shall first use their Reasonable
Best Efforts to reach agreement on the disputed items or amounts in order to
determine the amount of the Closing Adjustment Items, which amount shall not
be less than the Buyers calculation delivered pursuant to Section 2.7(b) nor
more than the Representatives calculation delivered pursuant to this Section
2.7(c). If the Buyer and the Representative are unable to resolve the dispute
within 30 calendar days after delivery of the Dispute Notice, then any
remaining items in dispute shall be submitted to an independent nationally
recognized accounting firm selected in writing by the Representative and the
Buyer or, if the Representative and the Buyer fail or refuse to select a firm
within ten (10) calendar days after written request therefor by the
Representative or the Buyer, such an independent nationally recognized
accounting firm shall be selected in accordance with the rules of the New
York, New York office of the AAA (the " _Neutral Accountant_ "). All
determinations and calculations pursuant to this paragraph (c) shall consider
only those Closing Adjustment Items as to which the Representative has
disagreed, shall be in writing and shall be delivered to the Buyer and the
Representative as promptly as practicable. The determination of the Neutral
Accountant as to the resolution of any dispute shall be binding and conclusive
upon all Parties. A judgment on the determination made by the Neutral
Accountant pursuant to this Section 2.7 may be entered in and enforced by any
court having jurisdiction thereover.

 



 

(d) The fees and expenses of the Neutral Accountant in connection with the
resolution of disputes pursuant to Section 2.7(c) shall be shared equally by
the Company Equityholders (from the Escrow Fund), on the one hand, and the
Buyer, on the other hand; _provided_ that if the Neutral Accountant determines
that one such party has adopted a position or positions with respect to the
Closing Adjustment Statement or the amount of the Closing Adjustment Items
that is frivolous or clearly without merit, the Neutral Accountant may, in its
discretion, assign a greater portion of any such fees and expenses to such
party.

 



 

(e) Immediately upon the expiration of the 30 calendar day period for giving
the Dispute Notice, if no such notice is given, or upon notification by the
Representative to the Buyer that no such notice will be given, or immediately
upon the resolution of disputes, if any, pursuant to this Section 2.7, the
Closing Purchase Price shall be adjusted as follows (the " _Adjusted Closing
Purchase Price_ "):

 



      
 

 



 

(i) If the amount of the Final Closing Adjustment exceeds the amount of the
Estimated Closing Adjustment, the Buyer shall be entitled to recover such
deficiency pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

 



 

(ii) If the amount of the Final Closing Adjustment is equal to the amount of
the Estimated Closing Adjustment, the Closing Purchase Price shall not be
adjusted; and

 



 

(iii) If the amount of the Estimated Closing Adjustment exceeds the Final
Closing Adjustment, the amount of such surplus, less (A) any portion thereof
payable to Leerink Swann LLC and (B) Applicable Employment Taxes (the "
_Closing Adjustment Surplus_ ") shall be paid in cash by the Buyer to the
Paying Agent or the Surviving Corporation for further distribution to the
Company Equityholders.

the Surviving Corporation or any member of the Buyer Rights Chain

the ALZA License) for which the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any
member of the Buyer Rights Chain Group has been or will be required to
reimburse ALZA pursuant to Section 5.6 of the ALZA License. None of the ALZA

material respect at any time after the date of this Agreement until the

(a) During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall not, and the Company
shall require each of its officers, directors, employees, representatives and
agents not to, directly or indirectly, through any officer, director,
employee, Affiliate, agent or representative or otherwise, (i) initiate,
solicit, knowingly encourage or otherwise knowingly facilitate any inquiry,
proposal, offer or discussion with any party (other than the Buyer or its
representatives) concerning any acquisition, equity or debt financing, joint
venture, merger, reorganization, consolidation, recapitalization, business

or assets of the Company or any Subsidiary or the Company Shares to any party
in connection with, or to facilitate or induce the making of, an Acquisition
Proposal (other than the Buyer or its representatives) or (iii) engage in
negotiations or enter into any agreement with any party (other than the Buyer
or its representatives) concerning any Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Section 5.7, if, prior to the date the
Company obtains the Requisite Stockholder Approval, the Company receives an
unsolicited, bona fide written Acquisition Proposal from a third party that
its Board of Directors, after consultation with the Companys financial
advisor and outside counsel, has in good faith concluded is, or is reasonably
likely to lead to, a Superior Offer, the Company may (A) furnish nonpublic
information to the third party making such Acquisition Proposal and (B) engage
in negotiations with the third party with respect to the Acquisition Proposal
to the extent the Companys Board of Directors determines in good faith that
the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its obligations under
applicable Law.

 



 

(b) The Company shall immediately notify any party with which discussions or
negotiations of the nature described in Section 5.7(a) were pending that the
Company is terminating such discussions or negotiations. If the Company
receives any inquiry, proposal or offer of the nature described in paragraph
(a) above, the Company shall, within one (1) Business Day after such receipt,
notify the Buyer of such inquiry, proposal or offer, including the identity of
the other party and the terms of such inquiry, proposal or offer; _provided_ ,
that if such disclosure would be prohibited by the terms of any non-disclosure
agreement in effect before the date hereof, the Company shall give the Buyer
the choice of whether or not to receive such disclosure and, if the Buyer
elects to receive such disclosure, the resulting breach of such non-disclosure
agreement shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement or an indemnifiable
claim under Article VII.

 



      
 

 



 

5.8 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, the Buyer will
pay all fees and expenses (including legal and accounting fees and expenses)
incurred by it in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. All

borne and paid fifty percent (50%) by the Company Equityholders and fifty
percent (50%) by the Buyer.

Tax Return.

 



 

5.10 _280G Covenant_. Not less than five (5) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall submit to a stockholder vote, in a manner that
satisfies the stockholder approval requirements under Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of
the Code and regulations promulgated thereunder (which vote, for the avoidance
of doubt, shall not be made by the Representative), the right of any
"disqualified individual" (as defined in Section 280G(c) of the Code) to
receive any and all payments (or other benefits) contingent on the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (within the
meaning of Section 280G(b)(2)(A)(i) of the Code) to the extent necessary so
that no payment received by such "disqualified individual" would be a
"parachute payment" under Section 280G(b) of the Code (determined without
regard to Section 280G(b)(4) of the Code). Such vote shall establish the
"disqualified individuals" right to the payment or other compensation, and
the Company shall obtain any required waivers or consents from the
"disqualified individual" prior to the vote. In addition, the Company shall
provide adequate disclosure to Company Stockholders that hold voting Company
Shares of all material facts concerning all payments to any "disqualified
individual" that, but for such vote, could be deemed "parachute payments" to a
"disqualified individual" under Section 280G of the Code in a manner that
satisfies Section 280G(b)(5)(B)(ii) of the Code and regulations promulgated
thereunder. At least three (3) Business Days prior to the vote, the Buyer and
its counsel shall have the right to review and comment on all documents to be
delivered to the Company Stockholders in connection with such vote and any
required disqualified individual waivers or consents, and the Company shall
reflect all reasonable comments of the Buyer thereon. Buyer and its counsel
shall be provided copies of all documents executed by the Companys
stockholders and disqualified individuals in connection with the vote.

 



 

5.11 _FIRPTA_. Prior to the Closing, (a) the Company shall deliver to the
Buyer a certification that the Company Shares are not United States real
property interests as defined in Section 897(c) of the Code, together with a
notice to the Internal Revenue Service, in accordance with Treasury
Regulations under Sections 897 and 1445 of the Code, or (b) each of the
Company Stockholders shall deliver to the Buyer certifications that they are
not foreign persons in

 



      
 

 



 

accordance with the Treasury Regulations under Section 1445 of the Code. If
the Buyer does not receive either the certifications and/or notices described
above on or before the Closing Date, the Buyer, the Transitory Subsidiary, the
Paying Agent or the Escrow Agent shall be permitted to withhold from the
payments to be made pursuant to this Agreement any required withholding Tax
under Section 1445 of the Code.

 



 

5.12 _Employee Benefits Covenants_.

 



 

(a) Prior to the Closing Date, the Buyer shall make (and the Company hereby
consents to the Buyer making), offers of employment (for employment commencing
at the Effective Time) to all of the employees of the Company or any
Subsidiary who are employed by the Company or any Subsidiary on the date of
this Agreement or at any time thereafter prior to the Closing Date, on an at-
will basis and with (i) total cash compensation (including wages, salaries,
commissions and bonuses) on at least the same level as are currently provided
by the Company and (ii) participation in Company Plans or Employee Benefit
Plans maintained or sponsored by the Buyer or any ERISA Affiliate for the
Buyers current employees (each a " _Buyer Benefit Plan_ ") that in all
material respects are no less favorable in the aggregate than the employee
benefits as in effect for other similarly situated employees of the Buyer
immediately prior to the Closing Date.

 



 

(b) To the extent that employees of the Company who accept any employment
offers made by the Buyer (" _Continuing Employees_ ") participate in any Buyer
Benefit Plan, such Continuing Employees shall receive credit for service with
the Company for purposes of eligibility and vesting (if applicable) and
entitlement to benefits (but excluding benefit accrual under a defined benefit
pension plan); _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein shall result in
the duplication of any benefits for the same period of service. With respect
to any Buyer Benefit Plan that is a welfare benefit plan, the Buyer shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that its third party insurance
carriers shall (i) cause there to be waived any eligibility requirements or
pre-existing condition limitations solely to the extent permitted under such
Buyer Benefit Plan, and (ii) for the plan year that includes the Effective
Time, give effect, in determining any deductible and maximum out-of-pocket
limitations, to the amounts paid during the plan year that included the
Effective Time by such Continuing Employees with respect to similar plans
maintained by Company provided that prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall timely furnish relevant data to the Buyer in a commercially reasonable
format. Except as otherwise provided in Section 5.12(c), nothing in this
Section 5.12(b) is intended to prevent the Buyer from terminating any of its
benefit plans from time to time or changing the form of benefits provided to
the Continuing Employees after the Closing Date.

 



 

(c) The Company will terminate the Change in Control Severance Plans
immediately prior to the Effective Time and, to the extent required, shall
obtain the consent of each Person entitled to benefits thereunder. From and
after the Closing, the Buyer shall cause all Continuing Employees who were
participants in the Companys Executive Change in Control Severance Plan to be
covered by the Buyers severance plan.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) No Person is an intended third party beneficiary of this Section 5.12 and
no provision of this Section 5.12 constitutes an amendment to any Employee
Benefit Plan.

 



 

5.13 _Termination of 401(k) Plan_. Upon the Buyers written request made not
later than five (5) Business Days prior to Closing, the Company shall
terminate any and all Company Plans intended to qualify under Section 401(k)
of the Code, or any successor statute, effective not later than the day
immediately preceding the Closing Date. Upon the termination of such plans,
the Company shall provide the Buyer with evidence that such 401(k) plans have
been terminated pursuant to resolution of the Companys board of directors not
later than the day immediately preceding the Closing Date.

 



 

5.14 _Confidentiality_. The parties acknowledge that the Buyer and the Company
have previously executed the Confidentiality Agreement, which Confidentiality

terms, except as expressly modified herein.

business acquisition required to be described in answer to Item 2.01 of Form

such additional information as the Buyer may reasonably request in order to
comply with the requirements for proforma and historic financial statements
included in the periodic reports the Buyer is required to file under the
Exchange Act. The fees and expenses incurred by the Company in connection with
the obligations under this Section 5.15 shall be paid by the Buyer.

obligations under the Waiver, Consent and Option Termination Agreement dated

Cadence the Buy-Out Price (as defined in the Cadence Agreement).

 



 

5.17 _Redwood City Lease_. Unless prevented from doing so by (a) the
occurrence of a Force Majeure Event or (b) a breach of the landlords
obligations under any such lease, the Buyer shall cause the Surviving

facility or a comparable facility no more than five miles from the location of
the current Redwood City, California facility through June 1, 2016.

damages, or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit,
proceeding, or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or
investigative to the extent provided for under the terms and conditions of the
certificate of incorporation of the Company in effect on the date of this
Agreement, the by-laws of the Company in effect on the date of this Agreement
and indemnification agreements between the Company or any Subsidiary and its
current and former officers and directors (each as in effect as of the date
hereof and each as has been furnished or made available to the Buyer before
the date hereof). The indemnification obligations of the Surviving Corporation
pursuant to this Section 5.19(a) shall extend to acts or omissions occurring
at or before the Effective Time (including with respect to any acts or
omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby) and all rights to
indemnification conferred hereunder shall continue as to an individual who has
ceased to be a director or officer of the Company or any Subsidiary prior to
the Effective Time and shall inure to the benefit of such individuals heirs,
executors and personal and legal representatives. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be obligated to provide
indemnification to any Indemnified Party with respect to any matter for which
the Buyer is entitled to indemnification under this Agreement.

 



 

(b) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, to the
extent permitted by Law, keep in full force and effect, and comply with the
terms and conditions of, any agreement in effect as of the date of this
Agreement between or among the Company or any Subsidiary and any Indemnified
Party providing for the indemnification of such Indemnified Party.

 



 

(c) If the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns shall (i)
consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving Person of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person,
then, in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation, assume all of the
obligations of the Surviving Corporation set forth in this Section 5.19.

 



 

(d) The provisions of this Section 5.19 shall survive the consummation of the
Merger for a period of six (6) years and (i) are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be

 



      
 

 



 

enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and
representatives and (ii) are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have
by contract or otherwise. Unless required by Law, the obligations of the
Surviving Corporation under this Section 5.19 shall not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of any Indemnified
Party under this Section 5.19 without the consent of such affected Indemnified
Party.

 



 

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall procure a "tail" policy
(the " _Tail Policy_ ") under the Companys existing directors and officers
insurance policy which (i) has an effective term of six (6) years from the
Effective Time, (ii) covers those persons who are currently covered by the
Companys directors and officers insurance policy in effect as of the date
hereof for actions and omissions occurring on or prior to the Effective Time
and (iii) contains terms and conditions that are, in the aggregate, no less
favorable to the insured than those of the Companys directors and officers
insurance policy in effect as of the date hereof.

conditions of this Article VII, the Company Equityholders shall indemnify the
Buyer in respect of, and hold it harmless against, any and all Damages
incurred or suffered by the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the Buyer or
any Affiliate thereof resulting from, relating to or constituting:

 



 

(a) any breach or inaccuracy, as of the date of this Agreement or as of the
Closing Date, of any representation or warranty of the Company contained in
this Agreement or in the Company Certificate (in each case, as such
representation or warranty (other than the representations and warranties in
Section 3.7(a)) would read if all qualifications as to materiality, including
each reference to the defined term "Company Material Adverse Effect", were
deleted therefrom);

 



       
 

 



 

(b) any failure to perform any covenant or agreement of the Company contained
in this Agreement;

 



 

(c) any claim for appraisal or dissenters rights, including any payment in
respect of Dissenting Shares in excess of the amount of payments otherwise
payable to the stockholder seeking such rights under this Agreement;

 



 

(d) any inaccuracy in the Closing Date Allocation Schedule;

 



 

(e) any Damages suffered by the Buyer as a result of or relating to the
subject matter of the Warning Letter (file# 12-NWJ-21) issued by the FDA to

(f) any claims relating to the matters set forth in Section 7.1(f) of the
Disclosure Schedule; or

 



 

(g) any claim for fraud or Knowing Misrepresentation arising in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

7.2 _Indemnification Claims_.

 



 

(a) The Buyer shall give written notification to the Representative of the
commencement of any Third Party Action. Such notification shall be given
within 30 days after receipt by the Buyer of notice of such Third Party
Action, and shall describe in reasonable detail (to the extent then known by
the Buyer) the facts constituting the basis for such Third Party Action and
the amount of the claimed damages. No delay or failure on the part of the
Buyer in so notifying the Representative shall relieve the Company
Equityholders of any liability or obligation hereunder except to the extent of
any damage or liability caused by or arising out of such delay or failure.
Within 30 days after delivery of such notification, the Representative may,
upon written notice thereof to the Buyer, assume control of the defense of
such Third Party Action with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Buyer;
_provided_ that (i) the Representative may only assume control of such defense
if (A) it acknowledges in writing to the Buyer on behalf of all of the Company
Equityholders that any damages, fines, costs or other liabilities that may be
assessed against the Buyer in connection with such Third Party Action
constitute Damages for which the Buyer shall be indemnified pursuant to this
Article VII, (B) the ad damnum in such Third Party Action, taken together with
the estimated costs of defense thereof and the Claimed Amount with respect to
any unresolved claims for indemnification then pending, is less than or equal
to the current balance of the Escrow Fund, and (C) an adverse resolution of
the Third Party Action would not have a material adverse effect on the
goodwill or reputation of the Buyer or the business, operations or future
conduct of the Buyer and (ii) the Representative may not assume control of the
defense of any Third Party Action involving Taxes or criminal liability or in
which equitable relief is sought against the Buyer or any of its subsidiaries.
If the Representative does not, or is not permitted under the terms hereof to,
so

 



      
 

 



 

assume control of the defense of a Third Party Action, the Buyer shall control
such defense. The Non-controlling Party may participate in such defense at its
own expense. The Controlling Party shall keep the Non-controlling Party
advised of the status of such Third Party Action and the defense thereof and
shall consider in good faith recommendations made by the Non-controlling Party
with respect thereto. The Non-controlling Party shall furnish the Controlling
Party with such information as it may have with respect to such Third Party
Action (including copies of any summons, complaint or other pleading which may
have been served on such party and any written claim, demand, invoice, billing
or other document evidencing or asserting the same) and shall otherwise
cooperate with and assist the Controlling Party in the defense of such Third
Party Action. The fees and expenses of counsel to the Buyer with respect to a
Third Party Action shall be considered Damages for purposes of this Agreement
if (i) the Buyer controls the defense of such Third Party Action pursuant to
the terms of this Section 7.2(a) or (ii) the Representative assumes control of
such defense and the Buyer reasonably concludes that the Company Equityholders
and the Buyer have conflicting interests or different defenses available with
respect to such Third Party Action. Neither the Company Equityholders nor the
Representative shall agree to any settlement of, or the entry of any judgment
arising from, any Third Party Action without the prior written consent of the
Buyer, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed;
_provided_ that the consent of the Buyer shall not be required if the
Representative, on behalf of all of the Company Equityholders, agrees in
writing to pay any amounts payable pursuant to such settlement or judgment and
such settlement or judgment includes a complete release of the Buyer from
further liability and has no other adverse effect on the Buyer. The Buyer
shall not agree to any settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising
from, any such Third Party Action without the prior written consent of the
Representative, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed.

 



 

(b) In order to seek indemnification under this Article VII, the Buyer shall
deliver a Claim Notice to the Representative. Within 30 days after delivery of
a Claim Notice, the Representative shall deliver to the Buyer a Response, in
which the Representative, on behalf of all of the Company Equityholders,
shall: (i) agree that the Buyer is entitled to receive all of the Claimed
Amount (in which case the Response shall be accompanied by a letter from the
Representative instructing the Escrow Agent to disburse to the Buyer from the
Escrow Fund an amount in cash equal to the Claimed Amount), (ii) agree that
the Buyer is entitled to receive the Agreed Amount (in which case the Response
shall be accompanied by a letter from the Representative instructing the
Escrow Agent to disburse to the Buyer from the Escrow Fund an amount in cash
equal to the Agreed Amount) or (iii) dispute that the Buyer is entitled to
receive any of the Claimed Amount. If no Response is delivered by the
Representative within such 30-day period, the Company Equityholders shall be
deemed to have agreed that all of the Claimed Amount is owed to the Buyer.
Acceptance by the Buyer of partial payment of any Claimed Amount shall be
without prejudice to the Buyers right to claim the balance of any such
Claimed Amount.

 



 

(c) Any Dispute shall be resolved in a state or federal court sitting in the
State of Delaware, in accordance with Section 10.11. If the Buyer is seeking
to enforce the claim that

 



      
 

 



 

is the subject of the Dispute pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, the
Representative and the Buyer shall deliver to the Escrow Agent, promptly
following the resolution of the Dispute (whether by mutual agreement, judicial
decision or otherwise), a written notice executed by both parties instructing
the Escrow Agent as to what (if any) portion of the Escrow Fund shall be
distributed to the Buyer (which notice shall be consistent with the terms of
the resolution of the Dispute).

 



 

7.3 _Survival of Representations and Warranties_.

 



 

(a) Unless otherwise specified in this Section 7.3 or elsewhere in this
Agreement, all provisions of this Agreement shall survive the Closing and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and shall continue in
full force and effect in accordance with their terms until the expiration of
the applicable statute of limitations; _provided_ , _however_ , that except
for claims based on fraud or a Knowing Misrepresentation, which shall expire
on the fifth (5th) anniversary of the Closing, all representations and
warranties that are covered by the indemnification obligations in Section
7.1(a) shall expire on the date that is 18 months after the Closing Date;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the representations and warranties set forth
in Sections 3.1 (Organization, Qualification and Corporate Power), 3.2 (a),
(b), (c) and (e) (Capitalization), 3.3 (Authorization), 3.9 (Tax Matters),
3.13(o) (Intellectual Property-Alza License), 3.14(d) (Contracts- Cadence),
3.20 (Employee Benefits)(to the extent related to Tax) and 3.25 (Brokers)
shall survive until 60 days after the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations and (ii) the representations and warranties set forth in Sections
3.13 (Intellectual Property) (other than Section 3.13(o) and Section 3.13(p))
(the " _IP Representations_ ") shall survive until two (2) years after the
Closing Date (such representations and warranties in clauses (i) and (ii)
hereof, the " _Fundamental Representations_ ").

 



 

(b) If the Buyer delivers to the Representative, before expiration of a
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement, either a Claim Notice based
upon a breach of such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement or an
Expected Claim Notice based upon a breach of such representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement then the applicable representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement shall survive until, but only for purposes of, the resolution of
the matter covered by such notice. If the legal proceeding or written claim
with respect to which an Expected Claim Notice has been given is definitively
withdrawn or resolved in favor of the Buyer, the Buyer shall promptly so
notify the Representative. The rights to indemnification set forth in this
Article VII shall not be affected by (i) any investigation conducted by or on
behalf of the Buyer or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired)
by the Buyer, whether before or after the date of this Agreement or the
Closing Date, with respect to the inaccuracy or noncompliance with any
representation, warranty, covenant or obligation which is the subject of
indemnification hereunder, or (ii) any waiver by the Buyer of any closing
condition relating to the accuracy of representations and warranties or the
performance of or compliance with agreements and covenants.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) It is the express intent of the parties that, if the applicable survival
period for an item as contemplated by this Article VII is shorter than the
statute of limitations that would otherwise have been applicable to such item,
then, by contract, the applicable statute of limitations with respect to such
item shall be reduced to the shortened survival period contemplated hereby.
The parties further acknowledge that the time periods set forth in this
Article VII for the assertion of claims under this Agreement are the result of
arms-length negotiation among the parties and that they intend for the time
periods to be enforced as agreed by the parties.

 



 

7.4 _Limitations_.

 



 

(a) With respect to claims for Damages arising under Section 7.1(a), the
Company Equityholders shall not be liable for any such Damages until the
aggregate amount of all such Damages exceeds the Deductible (at which point
the Company Equityholders shall become liable for all Damages under Section
7.1(a) in excess of one half (1/2) of the amount of the Deductible); provided
that the limitation set forth in this sentence shall not apply to (i) claims
based on fraud or Knowing Misrepresentation or (ii) any claim pursuant to
Section 7.1(a) relating to a breach of any of the Fundamental Representations.

 



 

(b) Except for claims based on fraud or Knowing Misrepresentation, the Escrow
Fund and the Offset Right shall be the sole and exclusive means for the Buyer
to recover any Damages for which it is entitled to indemnification under this
Article VII. In the case of claims based upon fraud or Knowing
Misrepresentation, where the claim of such fraud or Knowing Misrepresentation
is asserted by the Buyer on or prior to the fifth (5th) anniversary of the
Closing, the Company Equityholders shall have personal liability, on a several
and pro rata basis (based on proceeds actually received by the Company
Equityholders), for all Damages incurred by the Buyer resulting from any such
fraud or Knowing Misrepresentation, but in no event shall any Company
Equityholder be liable for an amount in excess of the amount of the
consideration actually received by such Company Equityholder pursuant to this
Agreement and in no event shall any Company Equityholder be liable for claims
of fraud or Knowing Misrepresentation asserted by the Buyer after the fifth
(5th) anniversary of the Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Buyer
shall not attempt to collect any Damages directly from any Company
Equityholder unless there are insufficient unclaimed Escrow Funds remaining to
satisfy such Damages pursuant to the Escrow Agreement.

 



 

(c) No Company Equityholder shall have any right of contribution against the
Company or the Surviving Corporation with respect to any breach by the Company
of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements.

 



 

(d) The rights of the Buyer under this Article VII shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy of the Buyer with respect to claims under or otherwise
relating to the transactions that are the subject of this Agreement. Without
limiting the generality of the

 



      
 

 



 

foregoing, in no event shall any party, its successors or permitted assigns be
entitled to claim or seek rescission of the transactions consummated by this
Agreement.

 



 

(e) Any payments made to a Party pursuant to this Article VII or pursuant to
the Escrow Agreement shall be treated as an adjustment to the Total
Consideration for Tax purposes to the extent permitted by Law.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company
Equityholders shall not have any liability to the Buyer if any Tax attributes
of the Company or any Subsidiary (including net operating loss carryovers,
capital loss carryovers, adjusted basis or credits) are not available to the
Company, any Subsidiary, the Buyer, or any of their Affiliates for any taxable
period or portion thereof ending after the Closing Date.

 



 

7.5 _Offset Rights_.

 



 

(a) The Buyer shall have the right and is hereby authorized at any time and
from time to time to set off and apply against any and all Milestone Payments
the amount of any Damages specified in a Claim Notice or Expected Claim Notice
delivered by the Buyer hereunder prior to the date of the Milestone Payment
against which such set off is applied, including the Buyers good faith
estimate of any Damages identified on such Claim Notice or Expected Claim
Notice which have not been liquidated (the amount so withheld and set-off
pursuant to this Section 7.5, the " _Offset Amount_ "); _provided_ , _however_
, that, except in the case of fraud or Knowing Misrepresentation, the
aggregate amount of Damages for which the Buyer may exercise such set off
rights shall not exceed ten percent (10%) of the applicable Milestone Payment
except in the case of claims:

 



 

(i) based on breaches of the IP Representations (other than Section 3.13(o)
and Section 3.13(p)), in which case the aggregate amount of Damages for which
the Buyer may exercise such set off rights in respect of such claim shall not
exceed fifty percent (50%) of the applicable Milestone Payment;

 



 

(ii) based on breaches of Section 3.13(p), in which case the aggregate amount
of Damages for which the Buyer may exercise such set off rights in respect of
such claim shall not exceed seventy-five percent (75%) of the applicable
Milestone Payment; and

 



 

(iii) based on breaches of the Fundamental Representations (excluding the IP
Representations and Section 3.13(p), but including Section 3.13(o)) or made
pursuant to Sections 7.1(b), 7.1(c), 7.1(d), 7.1(e) or 7.1(f), in which case
the aggregate amount of Damages for which the Buyer may exercise such set off
rights in respect of such claim shall not exceed one hundred percent (100%) of
the applicable Milestone Payment.

 



 

Any amount set off under this Section 7.5(a) shall reduce the amount of any
Net Milestone

 



      
 

 



 

Payment each Company Equityholder is entitled to receive proportionately based
on their respective rights to receive a portion of such Net Milestone Payment.

 



 

(b) In the event the Buyer exercises its set off rights pursuant to Section
7.5(a) and withholds an Offset Amount from any Milestone Payment, the Buyer
shall notify the Representative thereof in writing (the " _Offset
Notification_ ") no later than two (2) Business Days after such Milestone
Payment is due, which Offset Notification shall describe in particular the
claim for indemnification with respect to which such set off rights have been
exercised.

 



 

(c) In the event the Buyer exercises its set off rights pursuant to Section
7.5(a) and withholds an Offset Amount from any Milestone Payment with respect
to any Damages specified in the applicable Claim Notice or Expected Claim
Notice, upon the final resolution of the claim for indemnification with
respect to which the Claim Notice or Expected Claim Notice is delivered, the
Buyer shall cause the Company Equityholders to be paid the amount, if any, by
which the Offset Amount exceeds the amount of Damages to which the Buyer has
been finally determined to be entitled in connection with such resolution.
