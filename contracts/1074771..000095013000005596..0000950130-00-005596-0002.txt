certificate of incorporation in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the Surviving Corporation\'s certificate of incorporation and
(ii) Acquiror\'s bylaws in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be the Surviving Corporation\'s bylaws, in each case until amended in
accordance with applicable law.   2.3. Directors and Officers.

successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified), (i) Acquiror\'s
directors at the Effective Time shall be the Surviving Corporation\'s

ARTICLE 3   CONVERSION OF SECURITIES AND RELATED MATTERS   3.1.
Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Acquiror Owned Shares. As of the 
-------------------------------------------------------- Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any
Company Shares, each Company Share held by the Company as treasury stock or
owned by Acquiror, any Acquiror Subsidiary or any Company Subsidiary
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and retired, and no
payment shall be made or consideration delivered in respect thereof.   3.2.
Conversion of Company Shares.  ----------------------------   (a) As of the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
the holder of any Company Shares, except as otherwise provided in this
Section 3.2, each Company Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than shares to be cancelled in accordance with
Section 3.1) shall be converted into the right to receive .4107 Acquiror
Shares (the "Stock Consideration") and the right to receive in cash from
Acquiror, without interest, an amount equal to $3.50 (the $3.50 and
the increase, if any, contemplated by Section 3.2(b) is hereinafter referred
to as the "Cash Consideration" and, together with the Stock Consideration,
the "Merger Consideration").   (b) In the event that the 20 trading day
average closing price of an Acquiror Share (as reported on NASDAQ) for the
period ending five Business Days prior to the date of the Company Stockholder
Meeting (the "Meeting Price") is less than $21.00, the Company shall have the
right, in its sole discretion, and no later than four Business Days prior to
the Company Stockholder Meeting, to give notice to Acquiror of the Company\'s
intention to terminate this Agreement (a "Price Deficiency Notice");
provided, however, that if the Company gives a Price Deficiency Notice,
Acquiror shall have the right, in its sole discretion and by the giving of
notice to the Company no later than two (2) Business Days after the Company
gives the Price Deficiency Notice, to increase the Cash Consideration, by an
amount equal to the difference between the Meeting Price and $21.00,
multiplied by .4107, rounded up to the nearest whole cent. If Acquiror does
not exercise its right to increase the Cash Consideration, the Company shall
have the right to terminate this Agreement as provided in
Section 10.1(c)(i).   (c) Fractional Shares. No fractional shares shall be
issued in the  ----------------- Merger All fractional shares that a holder
of any Company Shares or Company Stock Options would otherwise be entitled to
receive as a result of the Merger shall be aggregated. If a fractional
Acquiror Share results from the aggregation, the holder shall be entitled to
receive, in lieu thereof, a cash amount, without interest, determined by
multiplying the fraction of an Acquiror Share to which the holder would
otherwise have been entitled by the Meeting Price rounded up to the nearest
whole cent. As promptly as practicable after the determination of the amount
of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of fractional share interests, the
Exchange Agent shall so notify Acquiror, and Acquiror shall deposit that
amount with the Exchange Agent and shall cause the Exchange Agent  
7   to forward payments to the holders of fractional share interests,
subject to and in accordance with the terms of this Section 3.2.   3.3.
Capitalization Changes. If at any time during the period between the 
---------------------- date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any
change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of Acquiror or securities
convertible or exchangeable into capital stock of Acquiror shall occur,
including by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or
combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any dividend or
distribution thereon (other than regular quarterly cash dividends) or a
record date with respect to any of the foregoing shall occur during such
period, the number of Acquiror Shares constituting part of the Merger
Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to provide to the holders of
the Acquiror Shares and the Company Shares the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to the consummation of such event.  
3.4. Exchange of Certificates.  ------------------------   (a) Exchange
Agent. Promptly after the date hereof, Acquiror shall 
-------------- appoint a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the
Company as an agent (the "Exchange Agent") for the benefit of holders of
Company Shares for the purpose of exchanging, pursuant to this Article 3,
certificates representing the Company Shares (the "Certificates"). Acquiror
will make available to the Exchange Agent, as needed, the Merger
Consideration, together with any dividends or distributions with respect
thereto, if any, to be paid in respect of Company Shares pursuant to this
Article 3 (the "Exchange Fund"), and, except as contemplated by Section
3.4(e) or Section 3.4(g) hereof, the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any
other purpose.   (b) Exchange Procedures. As promptly as practicable after
the Effective  ------------------- Time, Acquiror shall send, or shall cause
the Exchange Agent to send, to each record holder of Certificates a letter of
transmittal and instructions (which shall be in customary form and specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only
upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent), for use in the
exchange contemplated by this Section 3.4. Upon surrender of a Certificate to
the Exchange Agent, together with a duly executed letter of transmittal, the
holder shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration and any unpaid dividends and distributions thereon as provided
in this Article 3 in respect of the Company Shares represented by the
Certificate (after giving effect to any required withholding tax). Until
surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.4, each Certificate shall be
deemed after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration and any unpaid dividends and distributions thereon
as provided in this Article 3. If any portion of the Merger Consideration is
to be paid to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate,
it shall be a condition to payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall
be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the
Person requesting payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or
other taxes required as a result of payment to a Person other than the
registered holder of the Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the
Exchange Agent that the tax has been paid or is not payable.   (c)
Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares. Whenever a dividend 
------------------------------------------------ or other distribution is
declared by Acquiror in respect of the Acquiror Shares, the record date for
which is at or after the Effective Time, that declaration shall include
dividends or other distributions in   8   respect of all Acquiror Shares
issuable pursuant to this Agreement. No dividends or other distributions
declared or made after the Effective Time with respect to Acquiror Shares
constituting part of the Merger Consideration shall be paid to the holder of
any unsurrendered Certificate, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional
shares shall be paid to any holder, until the Certificate is surrendered as
provided in this Section 3.4. Following surrender, there shall be paid,
without interest, to the Person in whose name the Acquiror Shares have been
registered (i) at the time of surrender, the amount of dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time previously
paid or payable on the date of surrender with respect to whole Acquiror
Shares, less the amount of any withholding taxes that may be required
thereon, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date subsequent to surrender,
the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment date subsequent to
surrender payable with respect to whole Acquiror Shares, less the amount of
any withholding taxes which may be required thereon.   (d) No Further
Rights in Company Shares. All Acquiror Shares issued or 
----------------------------------- cash paid upon surrender of Certificates
in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been issued in
full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to Company Shares represented
thereby. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates shall
cease to have any rights with respect to Company Shares, except as otherwise
provided herein or by law. As of the Effective Time, the stock transfer books
of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the Company\'s stock transfer books of any Company Shares. If,
after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided
in this Section 3.4.   (e) Return of Merger Consideration. Upon demand by
Acquiror, the Exchange  ------------------------------ Agent shall deliver
to Acquiror any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the
Exchange Agent pursuant to this Section 3.4 that remains undistributed to
holders of Company Shares six months after the Effective Time. Holders of
Certificates who have not complied with this Section 3.4 prior to the demand
by the Acquiror shall thereafter look only to Acquiror for payment of
any claim to the Merger Consideration and dividends or distributions, if any,
in respect thereof.   (f) No Liability. Neither Acquiror nor the Exchange
Agent shall be liable  ------------ to any Person in respect of any Company
Shares (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) for any amounts
paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar law.   (g) Withholding Rights. Acquiror shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold  ------------------ from the Merger Consideration
(and any dividends or distributions thereon) otherwise payable hereunder to
any Person, and to deduct and withhold from any cash or Acquiror Shares paid
to any holder of a Company Option, any amounts which it is required to deduct
and withhold with respect to payment under any provision of federal, state or
local income, employment or other tax law. To the extent that Acquiror
withholds those amounts, the withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Company
Shares in respect of which deduction and withholding was made
by Acquiror.   9    (h) Lost Certificates. If any Certificate has been
or is claimed to have  ----------------- been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming that
Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Acquiror,
the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Acquiror
may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to that Certificate, the Exchange Agent will deliver in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the proper amount of the Merger
Consideration, together with any unpaid dividends and distributions on any
Acquiror Shares, as contemplated by this Article 3.   3.5. Company Stock
Options.  ---------------------  (a) At the Effective Time, each option to
purchase Company Shares (each, a "Company Option") outstanding under any
stock option or compensation plan or arrangement of the Company, whether or
not vested or exercisable, shall be converted, at the holder\'s election
(made prior to the Effective Time) to either (i) the right to receive, as
soon as practicable following the Effective Time, cash and a number of
Acquiror Shares determined as follows:  x Cash Consideration  cash =
_______________________ x Spread  Total Option Consideration   number of =
.4107 x the Meeting Price x Spread  -------------------------  Acquiror
Shares Total Option Consideration   ________________________________ 
Meeting Price  or (ii) a fully vested and exercisable option to purchase, on
the same terms and conditions as were applicable to such Company Option as of
the Effective Time (A) a number of Acquiror Shares determined by dividing the
Total Option Consideration by the Meeting Price and multiplying the result by
the number of Company Shares subject to the Company Option (rounded to the
nearest whole Acquiror share), (B) at a price per share equal to the
aggregate eeercise price with respect to the Company Option divided by the
total number of Acquiror Shares subject to the new option (as determined
under (A) immediately above), rounded up to the nearest whole cent; provided,
in the case of any Company Option that would continue to qualify as an
"incentive stock option" under Section 422 of the Code, such adjustment shall
be made in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 424(a) of the
Code. If no such election is made by the holder, the Company Option shall be
treated as provided in (ii) above.  For purposes of the
foregoing:  "Total Option Consideration" means the Cash Consideration +
(.4107 x the Meeting Price)    ~~  "Spread" means (Total Option
Consideration - exercise price number of  per Company Share x Company
Shares  of the Company Option) subject to the  Company Option    10   
(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company and the Acquiror shall take all
actions (including amending the terms of any Company stock option
or compensation plan or arrangement) necessary to give effect to the
transactions contemplated by Section 3.5(a), including obtaining all
necessary consents.   3.6. Employee Stock Purchase Plan. 
----------------------------   (a) The Company shall take all necessary
action to provide that, not later than five (5) Business Days prior to the
Effective Time, (i) any outstanding options to purchase Company Shares under
the Company\'s Employee Stock Purchase Plans (collectively, the "ESPP") shall
terminate (the "ESPP Termination Date"), and (ii) all amounts allocated to
each participant\'s account under the ESPP shall thereupon, at the election
of the participant (x) be used to purchase from the Company newly-issued
whole Company Shares at a price equal to the lower of 85% of (A) the closing
price per Share on the first day of the plan year, or (B) the ESPP
Termination Date, or (y) returned to the participant, and (iii) the ESPPs
will terminate. At the Effective Time, any Company Shares so purchased will
be treated as provided in Section 3.2 of this Agreement. The Company
shall take all actions necessary so as not to allow participants to increase
the rate of their contributions to the ESSP.   (b) Prior to the Effective
Time, the Company shall take all actions (including amending the terms of the
ESPP) necessary to give effect to the transactions contemplated by Section
3.6(a).   3.7. Dissenting Shares.  -----------------   (a)
Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Company
Shares that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which
are held by persons who shall not have voted in favor of this Agreement and
the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who shall have
properly demanded in writing appraisal for such shares in accordance with
Section 262 of the DGCL (collectively, the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be
converted into or represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration as
provided hereunder. Such persons shall be entitled to receive payment of the
appraised value of such Company Shares in accordance with the provisions of
Section 262 of the DGCL, except that all Dissenting Shares held by persons
who shall have failed to perfect or who effectively shall have withdrawn or
lost their right to appraisal of such shares under Section 262 shall
thereupon be deemed to have been converted into, as of the Effective Time,
the right to receive the Merger Consideration without any interest thereon
upon surrender of the certificate therefor in the manner provided
hereunder.   (b) The Company shall give Acquiror (i) prompt notice of any
demands for appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands
and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the
Company and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company
shall not, except with the prior written consent of Acquiror, make any
payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or offer to settle or
settle any such demands. All payments made to any Dissenting Shareholder
shall be made by the Company out of the Company\'s own funds and shall not be
reimbursed by Acquiror or any Acquiror Subsidiary.   11    ARTICLE 4

Company\'s or any Company Subsidiary\'s certificate of incorporation, bylaws
or any similar organizational documents, (ii) assuming compliance with the

Balance  Sheet or the notes thereto;   (ii) liabilities or obligations

(iii) liabilities or obligations under this Agreement or incurred  in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby; and   (iv) other
liabilities or obligations, which would not be reasonably  likely to have,

information to be supplied by the Company for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus will (i) in the case of the

as  -------------------------- otherwise expressly contemplated by this
Agreement, the Company and each of its Subsidiaries have conducted their
business in the ordinary course consistent with past practice and there has
not been (a) any damage, destruction or other casualty loss (whether or not
covered by insurance) affecting the business or assets of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary that would be reasonably likely to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, (b) any action, event,
occurrence, development, transaction, commitment, dispute, change, violation,
inaccuracy or other condition (financial or otherwise) of any character
(whether or not in the ordinary course of business) that would be reasonably
likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect, or (c) any action prohibited by Section 6.1 of this Agreement.  
4.11. Litigation. There is no claim, action, suit, investigation, 
---------- arbitration or proceeding pending, or to the Knowledge of the
Company threatened, against, relating to or affecting the Company or any
Company Subsidiary or any of their respective assets or properties before any
arbitrator or Governmental Entity that would be reasonably likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. Neither
the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is subject to any judgment, decree,
injunction, rule or order of any arbitrator or Governmental Entity which
prohibits or restricts the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby or has had or would be reasonably likely to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.   4.12 Taxes. All
material tax returns, statements, reports and forms  ----- (collectively,
the "Company Returns") required to be filed with any taxing authority by, or
with respect to, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries have been filed in
accordance with all applicable laws; the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
have timely paid all taxes shown as due and payable on the Company Returns
that have been so filed, and, as of the time of filing, the Company Returns
correctly and completely reflected the facts regarding the income, business,
assets, operations, activities and the status of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries (other than taxes which are being contested in good faith and
for which adequate reserves are reflected on the Company Balance Sheet);
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries have made adequate provision for all
taxes payable by them for which no Company Return has yet been filed; the
charges, accruals and reserves for taxes with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries reflected on the Company Balance Sheet are adequate under GAAP
to cover the tax liabilities   16   accruing through the date thereof;
there is no action, suit, proceeding, audit or claim now proposed or pending
against or with respect to the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries in
respect of any material amount of tax; neither the Company nor any of the
Company Subsidiaries has been a member of an affiliated, consolidated,
combined or unitary group, other than one of which the Company was the common
parent; neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is a party to any tax
allocation or sharing agreement; neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary has executed any outstanding waivers or comparable
consents regarding the application of the statute of limitations with respect
to any taxes or tax returns; and neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary has engaged in any transaction that could give rise to (i) a
registration obligation with respect to any Person under Section 6111 of the
Code or the regulations thereunder, (ii) a list maintenance obligation with
respect to any Person under Section 6112 of the Code or the regulations
thereunder, or (iii) a disclosure obligation as a "reportable transaction"
under Section 6011 of the Code and the regulations thereunder. The total
adjusted basis for federal income tax purposes of the assets to be
transferred to Acquiror by the Company in the Merger will, at the time of the
Merger, equal or exceed the sum of the liabilities to be assumed (within the
meaning of (S)357(d) of the Code) by Acquiror.   4.13. Employee Benefits. 
-----------------   (a) With respect to each material "employee benefit
plan", as defined in Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act of 1974 ("ERISA"), each employment, severance or similar contract, plan,
arrangement or policy and each other plan or arrangement (written or oral)
providing for compensation, bonuses, profit-sharing, stock option or other
stock related rights or other forms of incentive or deferred compensation,
vacation benefits, insurance coverage (including any self-insured
arrangements), health or medical benefits, disability benefits, workers\'
compensation, supplemental unemployment benefits, severance benefits and
post-employment or retirement benefits (including compensation, pension,
health, medical or life insurance benefits) which is maintained, administered
or contributed to by the Company or any ERISA Affiliate (as defined below)
and covers any consultant, director, employee or former employee of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary, the Company has delivered or will make
available upon request copies of the plans (and, if applicable, related trust
agreements) and all amendments thereto and written interpretations thereof to
Acquiror together with the most recent annual report (Form 5500 including, if
applicable, Schedule B thereto) prepared in connection with any plan. The
material plans are referred to collectively herein as the "Company Employee
Plans". An "ERISA Affiliate" of any Person means any other Person which,
together with such Person, would be treated as a single employer
under Section 414 of the Code.   (b) With respect to each Company Employee
Plan that constitutes a "multiemployer plan", as defined in Section 3(37) of
ERISA (a "Multiemployer Plan"), or any other plan subject to Title IV of
ERISA (a "Retirement Plan"), no "accumulated funding deficiency", as defined
in Section 412 of the Code, has been incurred with respect to any Company
Employee Plan which is a Retirement Plan, whether or not waived. With respect
to any Company Employee Plans subject to Title IV of ERISA, the actuarially
determined present value of all "benefit liabilities" within the meaning of
Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA (as determined on the basis of the actuarial
assumptions contained in the plans\' most recent actuarial valuation) did not
exceed the then current value of the assets of such plans, and there has not
been an adverse change in the financial condition of such plans which would
have caused a material change in the   17   funded status of such plans.
To the Knowledge of the Company, no condition exists and no event has
occurred that would be reasonably likely to constitute grounds for
termination of any Company Employee Plan which is a Retirement Plan or, with
respect to any Company Employee Plan which is a Multiemployer Plan, presents
a material risk of a complete or partial withdrawal under Title IV of ERISA
and neither the Company nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has incurred
any liability under Title IV of ERISA arising in connection with the
termination of, or complete or partial withdrawal from, any plan covered or
previously covered by Title IV of ERISA that would be reasonably likely to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. To
the Knowledge of the Company, nothing has been done or omitted to be done and
no transaction or holding of any asset under or in connection with any
Company Employee Plan has occurred that will make the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, or any officer or director of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, subject to any liability under Title I of ERISA or liable for any
tax pursuant to Section 4975 of the Code (assuming the taxable period of any
such transaction expired as of the date hereof) that would be reasonably
likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.   (c) Each Company
Employee Plan which is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the
Code is so qualified and has been so qualified during the period from its
adoption to date, and each trust forming a part thereof is exempt from tax
pursuant to Section 501(a) of the Code. The Company has furnished, or will
make available upon request, to Acquiror copies of the most recent Internal
Revenue Service determination letters with respect to each Company Employee
Plan. Each Company Employee Plan has been maintained in substantial
compliance with its terms and with the requirements prescribed by any and all
statutes, orders, rules and regulations, including ERISA and the Code, which
are applicable to such Company Employee Plan.   (d) There is no contract,
agreement, plan or arrangement covering any employee or former employee of
the Company that, individually or collectively, would be reasonably likely to
give rise to the payment of any amount that would not be deductible pursuant
to the terms of Section 280G of the Code. The execution of, and performance
of the transactions contemplated in, this Agreement will not (either alone or
upon the occurrence of any additional or subsequent events) constitute an
event under any Company Employee Plan that will result in any payment
(whether of severance pay or otherwise), acceleration of, forgiveness of
indebtedness owing from, vesting of, distribution of, or increase in or
obligation to fund, any benefits with respect to any current or
former employee, director or consultant of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary.   (e) There has been no amendment to, written interpretation or
announcement (whether or not written) relating to, or change in employee
participation or coverage under, any Company Employee Plan which would
increase materially the expense of maintaining such Company Employee Plan
above the level of the expense incurred in respect thereof for the fiscal

Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has received notice from the
regulatory authorities which enforce the statutory or regulatory provisions
in respect of either the Medicare or Medicaid program of any pending or
threatened investigations, and neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any reason to believe that any such investigations
or surveys are pending, threatened or imminent which may have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.   4.16. Title to
Properties.  -------------------   (a) The Company and each Company
Subsidiary have good and marketable title to, or valid leasehold interests

do not detract from the value, or interfere with the present use of the
property subject thereto or affected thereby or otherwise impair
the Company\'s or any Company Subsidiary\'s business operations and (ii) in
the aggregate, would not be reasonably likely to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. All of these assets
and properties, other than assets and properties in which the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries has leasehold interests, are free and clear of all Liens,
except for Liens that, in the aggregate, would not have a Company Material
Adverse Effect.   (b) Except as would not be reasonably likely to have a

patent, trade secret, copyright, know-how (including any registrations or
applications for registration of any of the foregoing) or any other similar
type of proprietary intellectual property right (collectively, the "Company
Intellectual Property") necessary to carry on the business of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as currently conducted. Neither
the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has received any written notice of
infringement of or challenge to the validity or enforceability of, and, to
the Company\'s Knowledge, there are no claims pending with respect to the
rights of others to the use of, any Company Intellectual Property that, in
any such case would be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. To the Company\'s Knowledge,
there is no basis for any such claims. To the Company\'s Knowledge, no other
person is infringing any Company Intellectual Property, except such
infringement as would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary, nor
the respective businesses thereof as currently conducted, violates
or infringes the intellectual property or proprietary rights of any other  
20   Person, except such violations and infringements as would not have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

any consultant, director, employee or former employee of Acquiror or any
Acquiror Subsidiary, Acquiror has delivered or will make available upon
request copies of the plans (and, if applicable, related trust agreements)
and all amendments thereto and written interpretations thereof to the Company
together with the most recent annual report (Form 5500 including,
if applicable, Schedule B thereto) prepared in connection with any plan.
The material plans are referred to collectively herein as the "Acquiror
Employee Plans".   (b) With respect to each Acquiror Employee Plan that
constitutes a Multiemployer Plan or any Retirement Plan, no "accumulated
funding deficiency", as defined in Section 412 of the Code, has been incurred
with respect to any Acquiror Employee Plan which is a Retirement Plan,
whether or not waived. With respect to any Acquiror Employee Plans subject to
Title IV of ERISA, the actuarially determined present value of all "benefit
liabilities" within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA (as
determined on the basis of the actuarial assumptions contained in the plans\'
most recent actuarial valuation) did not exceed the then current value of the
assets of such plans, and there has not been an adverse change in the
financial condition of such plans which would have caused a material change
in the funded status of such plans. To the Knowledge of Acquiror, no
condition exists and no event has occurred that would be reasonably  
28   likely to constitute grounds for termination of any Acquiror Employee
Plan which is a Retirement Plan or, with respect to any Acquiror Employee
Plan which is a Multiemployer Plan, presents a material risk of a complete or
partial withdrawal under Title IV of ERISA and neither Acquiror nor any of
its ERISA Affiliates has incurred any liability under Title IV of ERISA
arising in connection with the termination of, or complete or partial
withdrawal from, any plan covered or previously covered by Title IV of ERISA
that would be reasonably likely to have , individually or in the aggregate,
an Acquiror Material Adverse Effect. To the Knowledge of Acquiror, nothing
has been done or omitted to be done and no transaction or holding of any
asset under or in connection with any Acquiror Employee Plan has occurred
that will make Acquiror or any Acquiror Subsidiary, or any officer or
director of the Acquiror or any Acquiror Subsidiary, subject to any liability
under Title I of ERISA or liable for any tax pursuant to Section 4975 of the
Code (assuming the taxable period of any such transaction expired as of the
date hereof) that would be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, an Acquiror Material Adverse Effect.   (c) Each Acquiror Employee
Plan which is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code is so
qualified and has been so qualified during the period from its adoption to
date, and each trust forming a part thereof is exempt from tax pursuant to
Section 501(a) of the Code. Acquiror has furnished, or will make available
upon request, to the Company copies of the most recent Internal Revenue
Service determination letters with respect to each Acquiror Employee Plan.
Each Acquiror Employee Plan has been maintained in substantial compliance
with its terms and with the requirements prescribed by any and all statutes,
orders, rules and regulations, including ERISA and the Code, which
are applicable to such Acquiror Employee Plan.   (d) There is no contract,
agreement, plan or arrangement covering any employee or former employee of
Acquiror that, individually or collectively, would be reasonably likely to
give rise to the payment of any amount that would not be deductible pursuant
to the terms of Section 280G of the Code. The execution of, and performance
of the transactions contemplated in, this Agreement will not (either alone or
upon the occurrence of any additional or subsequent events) constitute an
event under any Acquiror Employee Plan that will result in any payment
(whether of severance pay or otherwise), acceleration of, forgiveness of
indebtedness owing from, vesting of, distribution of, or increase in or
obligation to fund, any benefits with respect to any current or former
employee, director or consultant of the Acquiror or any
Acquiror Subsidiary.   (e) There has been no amendment to, written
interpretation or announcement (whether or not written) relating to, or
change in employee participation or coverage under, any Acquiror Employee
Plan which would increase materially the expense of maintaining such Acquiror
Employee Plan above the level of the expense incurred in respect thereof for
the fiscal year ended December 31, 1999.   (f) Neither Acquiror nor any
Acquiror Subsidiary has any obligations to provide retiree health and life
insurance or other retiree death benefits under any Acquiror Employee Plan,
other than benefits mandated by Section 4980B of the Code or under applicable
State law, and each such Acquiror Employee Plan may be amended or terminated
without incurring liability thereunder.   29    (g) To the Knowledge of
Acquiror, no Acquiror Employee Plan is threatened with any dispute, lawsuit,
claim (other than routine claims for benefits), investigation or complaint
to, or by, any Person or Governmental Entity. No Acquiror Employee Plan is
the subject of an audit or, to the Knowledge of Acquiror, under investigation
by the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Labor, the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation or any other Governmental Entity, nor, to the Knowledge
of Acquiror, is any such audit or investigation threatened.   5.14. Labor
Matters. There is no pending or, to the Knowledge of Acquiror, 
------------- threatened union organizational effort, material labor dispute,
strike or work stoppage against Acquiror or any Acquiror Subsidiary or charge
or complaint against Acquiror or any Acquiror Subsidiary by the National
Labor Relations Board or any similar Governmental Entity alleging any unfair
labor practice by Acquiror or any Acquiror Subsidiary in connection with the
operation of their respective business. Acquiror and all Acquiror
Subsidiaries have in the past been and are currently in compliance in all
material respects with all applicable collective bargaining agreements and
laws respecting employment, employment practices, labor relations, safety and
health (other than environmental), wages, hours and terms and conditions of
employment. Neither Acquiror nor any Acquiror Subsidiary has experienced
within the past 12 months a "plant closing" or "mass layoff" within the
meaning of the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, 29 U.S.C.
(S)(S) 2101 et seq. Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement, nor
the consummation by Acquiror of transactions contemplated in accordance with
the terms hereby will violate any of Acquiror\'s or Acquiror Subsidiaries\'
collective bargaining agreement(s) with any labor organization(s).   5.15.
Compliance with Laws; Licenses, Permits and Registrations. 
---------------------------------------------------------   (a) Neither
Acquiror nor any Acquiror Subsidiary is in violation of, or has violated, any
applicable provisions of any laws, statutes, ordinances, regulations,
judgments, injunctions, orders or consent decrees, except for violations
which would not be reasonably likely to have, individually or in
the aggregate, an Acquiror Material Adverse Effect.   (b) Acquiror and each
Acquiror Subsidiary has been and is in compliance with all permits, licenses,
franchises, variances, exceptions, orders, consents, approvals,
authorizations of and registrations with and under all federal, state, local
and foreign laws, and from all Governmental Entities required by Acquiror and
each Acquiror Subsidiary to carry on their respective businesses as currently
conducted, except where the failure to have or be in compliance with the
permits, licenses, franchises, variances, exceptions, orders,
consents, approvals, authorizations or registrations would not be reasonably
likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, an Acquiror Material
Adverse Effect.   (c) Acquiror and each Acquiror Subsidiary are, to the
extent applicable to their operations, certified for participation or
enrollment in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, have a current and valid
provider contract with the Medicare and Medicaid programs, are in substantial
compliance with the conditions of participation of such programs and have
received all approvals or qualifications necessary for capital reimbursement
of Acquiror\'s and the Acquiror\'s Subsidiaries\' assets, except where the
failure to be so certified, to have such contracts, to be in such compliance
or to have such approvals or qualifications would not be reasonably likely to
have, individually or in the aggregate, an Acquiror Material Adverse
Effect.   30   Neither Acquiror nor any Acquiror Subsidiary has received
notice from the regulatory authorities which enforce the statutory or
regulatory provisions in respect of either the Medicare or Medicaid program
of any pending or threatened investigations, and neither Acquiror nor any
Acquiror Subsidiary has any reason to believe that any such investigations or
surveys are pending, threatened or imminent which may have, individually or
in the aggregate, an Acquiror Material Adverse Effect.   5.16. Title to
Properties.  -------------------   (a) Acquiror and each Acquiror
Subsidiary have good and marketable title to, or valid leasehold interests
in, all their properties and assets, except for those which are no longer
used or useful in the conduct of their businesses, except for defects in
title, easements, restrictive covenants and similar Liens, encumbrances or
impediments that (i) are not substantial in character, amount or extent and
do not detract from the value, or interfere with the present use of the
property subject thereto or affected thereby or otherwise impair
Acquiror\'s or any Acquiror Subsidiary\'s business operations and (ii) in the
aggregate, would not be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, an Acquiror Material Adverse Effect. All of these assets and
properties, other than assets and properties in which Acquiror or any
Acquiror Subsidiary has leasehold interests, are free and clear of all Liens,
except for Liens that, in the aggregate, would not have an Acquiror Material
Adverse Effect.   (b) Except as set forth on the Acquiror Disclosure
Schedule or as would not be reasonably likely to have an Acquiror Material
Adverse Effect, (i) Acquiror and each Acquiror Subsidiary are in compliance
with the terms of all leases to which they are a party and under which they
are in occupancy, and all of these leases are in full force and effect and
(ii) Acquiror and each Acquiror Subsidiary enjoy peaceful and undisturbed
possession under all such leases.   5.17. Intellectual Property. Except as
would not be reasonably likely to  --------------------- have, individually
or in the aggregate, an Acquiror Material Adverse Effect, Acquiror and the
Acquiror Subsidiaries own or have a valid license to use each trademark,
service mark, trade name, mask work, invention, patent, trade
secret, copyright, know-how (including any registrations or applications
for registration of any of the foregoing) or any other similar type of
proprietary intellectual property right (collectively, the "Acquiror
Intellectual Property") necessary to carry on the business of Acquiror and
the Acquiror Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as currently conducted. Neither
Acquiror nor any Acquiror Subsidiary has received any written notice of
infringement of or challenge to the validity or enforceability of, and, to
Acquiror\'s Knowledge, there are no claims pending with respect to the rights
of others to the use of, any Acquiror Intellectual Property that, in any
case, would be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate,
an Acquiror Material Adverse Effect. To Acquiror\'s Knowledge, there is no
basis for any such claims. To the Acquiror\'s Knowledge, no other person is
infringing any Acquiror Intellectual Property, except such infringement as
would not have, individually or in the aggregate, an Acquiror Material
Adverse Effect. Neither Acquiror nor any Acquiror Subsidiary, nor the
respective businesses thereof as currently conducted, violates or infringes
the intellectual property or proprietary rights of any other Person, except
such violations and infringements as would not have, individually or in the
aggregate, an Acquiror Material Adverse Effect.   31    5.18. Finders\'

accordance with the terms of the agreement with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner

of a definitive agreement relating to or the consummation of such transaction
would not (i) impose any material delay in   39   the obtaining of, or
significantly increase the risk of not obtaining, any authorizations,
consents, orders, declarations or approvals of any Governmental Entity
necessary to consummate the Merger or the expiration or termination of any
applicable waiting period, (ii) significantly increase the risk of
any Governmental Entity entering an order prohibiting the consummation of the

Liability.  ------------------------------   (a) Continuing Protection.
Acquiror and the Surviving Corporation agree  --------------------- that the
Surviving Corporation shall adopt prior to the Effective Time, in
its Certificate of Incorporation and bylaws, the same indemnification,
limitation of or exculpation from liability and expense advancement
provisions as those set forth in the Company\'s certificate of incorporation
and bylaws, in each case as of the date of this Agreement, and that such
provisions shall not be amended, repealed, revoked or otherwise modified for
a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of the individuals who on or prior to
the Effective Time were directors, officers, employees or agents of the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries or are otherwise entitled to the benefit
of such provisions.   (b) Indemnification. To the fullest extent permitted
under applicable  --------------- law, after the Effective Time, Acquiror
shall, and Acquiror shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify,
defend and hold harmless, each present and former director or officer of the
Company and each Company Subsidiary and each Person entitled to
indemnification under the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation (collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") against all
costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys\' fees), judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages, liabilities and settlement amounts paid in
connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether
arising before or after the Effective Time), arising out of or pertaining to
any action or omission in their capacity as director, officer, trustee,
partner or fiduciary in each case occurring on or before the Effective Time
(including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement). Without limiting
the foregoing, in the event of any claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation, (i) Acquiror and the Surviving Corporation shall (x)
periodically advance reasonable fees and expenses (including attorneys fees)

from the Effective Time, the Surviving  --------- Corporation shall, and the
Acquiror shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide to the Company\'s
and each Company Subsidiary\'s directors and officers liability and fiduciary
liability insurance protection with substantially the same coverage and in
substantially the same amount, and on terms no less favorable to the
directors and officers than, that provided by the Company\'s directors\' and
officers\' liability insurance policies in effect on the date hereof;
provided, however, that the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated
to purchase and maintain such insurance only to the extent such insurance
is available; and provided, further, the Surviving Corporation shall not
be required in order to maintain or procure such coverage to pay an annual
premium in excess of 150% of the current annual premium paid by the Company
for its existing coverage (the "Cap"). If equivalent coverage cannot be
obtained, or can be obtained only by paying an annual premium in excess of
the Cap, Acquiror shall only be required to obtain as much coverage as can be
obtained by paying an annual premium equal to the Cap. With the Acquiror\'s
consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, the Company may
purchase such insurance prior to the Closing on a prepaid noncancellable
basis, so long as the premium does not exceed six times the Cap.   7.4.
Employee Benefits. For one (1) year from the Effective Time, Acquiror 
----------------- shall provide (or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
provide) employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries with salary
and benefits under employee benefit plans that are comparable in the
aggregate than those currently provided by the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries to its employees (including benefits pursuant to qualified and
nonqualified retirement plans, savings plans, medical, dental, disability and
life insurance plans and programs, deferred compensation arrangements, bonus
and retiree benefit plans, policies and arrangements). For purposes of any
employee benefit plan or arrangement maintained by Acquiror or any Acquiror
Subsidiary, Acquiror shall recognize (or cause to be recognized), as vesting
and eligibility service, any service with the Company and its Subsidiaries
and any predecessor entities under similar benefit plans (and any other
service credited by the Company under similar benefit plans). In
addition, such service shall be recognized for benefit accrual purposes under
any vacation and severance plans of Acquiror or any Acquiror Subsidiary;
provided, however, that solely to the extent necessary to avoid duplication
of benefits, amounts payable under employee benefit plans provided by
Acquiror or an Acquiror Subsidiary may be reduced by amounts payable under
similar Company Employee Plans with respect to the same periods of service).
From and after the Effective Time, Acquiror shall, and Acquiror shall cause
the Acquiror Subsidiaries to, waive any pre-existing condition limitations
and credit any flexible spending account balances, deductibles and out-of-
pocket expenses to the same extent applicable and/or covered under the
Company Employee Plans, and are incurred by the employees and their
beneficiaries during the portion of the plan year prior to participation in
the benefit plans provided by Acquiror and the Acquiror Subsidiaries. The
provisions of this Section 7.4 shall not create in any employee or former
employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary any rights to employment
or   41   continued employment with Acquiror or the Company or any of
their respective Subsidiaries, successors or Affiliates. The provisions of
this Section 7.4 shall apply to employees and the Company who are on
disability or leave of absence.   Participants in the Company\'s 401(k) plan
and non-qualified retirement plans will receive all Company contributions for
the partial year ending on the Effective Time without regard to any last day
of the plan year requirement or service requirement.   7.5. Severance Plan.
For one (1) year from the Effective Time, Acquiror  -------------- shall
provide employees of the Company and the Company\'s subsidiaries with
a Severance Plan that is no less favorable than the Company\'s plan currently
in effect. Acquiror shall recognize (or cause to be recognized) service with
the Company and its Subsidiaries or any predecessor entities (and any other
services credited by the Company under similar severance plans) for all
purposes under such severance plan; provided, however, that solely to the
extent necessary to avoid duplication of benefits, amounts payable under
other severance plans provided by Acquiror or an Acquiror Subsidiary may be
reduced by the amounts payable under the Company\'s Severance Plan.   7.6.
Change in Control. With respect to the Executive Employment 
----------------- Agreements, the Severance Agreements and the Plans listed
on Schedule 7.6(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (the "Change in Control
Plans"), (a) the consummation of the Merger will constitute a Change in
Control as of the Effective Time for purposes of each Change in Control Plan
and (b) any termination of employment at or following the Effective Time of
or by any individual listed on Schedule 7.6(b) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule shall be deemed to be for "Good Reason" for purposes of any Change
in Control Plan in which such individual participates or to which he or she
is a party.   7.7. Health Insurance. Acquiror will permit the individuals
listed in  ---------------- Schedule 7.7 of the Company Disclosure Schedule
and their dependents to receive benefits under the Acquiror\'s healthcare
plans until such individual reaches age 65 or is employed by another employer
offering health care coverage (including coverage of then pre-existing
conditions), for the same net cost to such individual as he or she was paying
while employed by the Company (subject to adjustment based on changes in the
consumer price index).   7.8. Third Party Beneficiaries. 
-------------------------   (a) From and after the Effective Time, Acquiror
will, and will cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor, pay and perform all
obligations under each Change in Control Plan (including each employment,
bonus, severance, termination or similar agreement or arrangement with any
current or former officer or other employee of Company or any Company
Subsidiary) in accordance with this Agreement and the terms thereof in effect
as of the date hereof (or, with the written approval of Acquiror, as the same
may be amended from time to time after the date hereof). The obligations of
Acquiror under Sections 7.3, 7.6, 7.7 and 7.8, shall not be terminated,
amended, repealed, revoked or modified in any manner which will adversely
affect any director or officer to whom such Section applies without the
consent of the affected director or officer (it being expressly agreed that
each director and officer to whom such Sections apply shall be third-party
beneficiaries of such Sections).   42    (b) If Acquiror or any of its
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in a
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each case, proper provision
shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Acquiror honor the
obligations set forth in Sections 7.3, 7.6, 7.7 and 7.8.   7.9. Stock
Exchange Listing. Acquiror shall cause the Acquiror Shares to

7.11. Investment Banking Fee. Pursuant to the agreement referenced in 
----------------------- Section 4.18(a), promptly following the Effective
Time, Acquiror shall pay or cause to be paid all fees and expenses due to

attorneys\' fees, subject to execution of a settlement agreement acceptable
to the Company and DOJ and a corporate integrity agreement acceptable to the
Company and the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and
Human Services (collectively, the "Settlement Documents").   Acquiror
agrees to participate in good faith with the Company in negotiating the
Settlement Documents and executing such agreements as soon as possible after
the date hereof. The Company agrees to permit the Acquiror to participate in
such discussions. Acquiror further agrees to continue such good faith
negotiations if, as of the Effective Time, the Settlement Documents have not
been signed.   7.13. Acquiror Standstill. If this Agreement is terminated,
then, for  ------------------- two (2) years after the date of termination,
Acquiror and each of its successors or assigns will not, and will cause its
Affiliates not to:   (i) acquire, offer or propose or otherwise seek to
acquire, or agree  to acquire, directly or indirectly, by merger, purchase or
otherwise,  beneficial ownership of any assets or in excess of 1% of any

assets  or in excess of 1% of any class of securities of the Company or its 
Affiliates;   (ii) make, or in any way participate in, directly or
indirectly, any  "solicitation" of "proxies" (as such terms are defined in
Rule 14a-1 of  Regulation 14A promulgated by the SEC as of the date hereof,
disregarding  clause (iv) of Rule 14a-1(1)(2), but including any solicitation
exempted  pursuant to Rule 14a-2(b)(1) to vote (including by the execution of
actions  by written consent), or seek to advise, encourage or influence any
person  or entity with respect to the voting of, any voting securities of
the  Company;   43    (iii) call, or in any way participate in a call
for, any meeting of  Stockholders of the Company (or take any action with
respect to  Stockholders acting by written consent);   (iv) form, join or
in any way participate in a "group" (within the  meaning of Section 13(d)(3)
of the Exchange Act) with respect to any voting  securities of the Company;
or   (v) otherwise act to control or influence, or seek to control or 
influence, the Company or the management, Board of Directors, policies or 
affairs of the Company, including, (A) making any offer or proposal to 
acquire any securities or assets of the Company or any of its Affiliates or

inconsistent with this Section 7.13, including an  intent, purpose, plan or
proposal that is conditioned on, or would require,  waiver, amendment,
nullification or invalidation of any provision of this  Section 7.13, or take
any action that could require the Company or any of  its Affiliates to make
any public disclosure relating to any such intent,  purpose, plan, proposal
or condition, or (E) assisting, advising or  encouraging any person with
respect to, or seeking to do, any of the  foregoing.   7.14. Preparation of
Ruling Request. Acquiror shall be responsible for 
----------------------------- preparing a ruling request for submission by
Acquiror to the Internal Revenue Service (the "Ruling Request") requesting
rulings to the effect that the transactions contemplated hereunder and
related transactions will not cause section 355(e) of the Code to apply to
the spin-off of Acquiror or LifePoint Hospitals, Inc. by Columbia/HCA
Healthcare Corporation and will not adversely affect the tax treatment of the
internal restructuring transactions that preceded such spin-off or any
portion thereof. Prior to submitting the Ruling Request or any supplement
thereto to the Internal Revenue Service, Acquiror shall deliver to the
Company a draft of such item for review and comment, and the Company shall
provide its comments to Acquiror within three (3) Business Days of the
Company\'s receipt of such draft. Acquiror shall in good faith consider any
changes, modifications, additions or deletions suggested by the Company.
Acquiror shall furnish the Company with copies of all correspondence and an
oral description of all oral communications with the Internal Revenue Service
by or to Acquiror relating to the Ruling Request or the subject
matter thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Acquiror shall not be
obligated to provide to the Company any information that Acquiror determines
is confidential information with respect to HCA-The Healthcare Company or
LifePoint Hospitals, Inc. The Company shall not take any action reasonably
likely to negatively affect the receipt by Acquiror or HCA-The Healthcare
Company of the Internal Revenue Service rulings described in Section
9.1(f).   44    7.15. Alternative Financing. If Merrill Lynch Capital
Corporation  --------------------- ("MLCC") terminates the Commitment
Letters or indicates to Acquiror that any condition to MLCC\'s obligation to
provide the financing contemplated by the Commitment Letters is not likely to
be satisfied or if for any other reason the funding contemplated by the
Commitment Letters is reasonably likely to be unavailable at Closing,
Acquiror will promptly notify the Company of such fact and will use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain funding from another source or sources to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. From the date
hereof until the Effective Time, Acquiror shall advise the Company of any
termination and of any material amendment or modification of the
Commitment Letters or any substitute therefor, including providing copies
thereof to the Company, and will provide the Company with copies of all
agreements and documents relevant to the Company\'s obligations under Section
6.6.   ARTICLE 8   COVENANTS OF ACQUIROR AND THE COMPANY   The parties
hereto agree as set forth below.   8.1. Reasonable Best Efforts. 
-----------------------   (a) Subject to the terms and conditions hereof,
each party will use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions, to file, or caused to be filed, all documents and to do, or
cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable
laws and regulations to consummate and make effective the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable. Acquiror and the
Company shall have the right to review in advance, and to the extent
reasonably practicable each will consult the other on, all the information
relating to the other and its Subsidiaries, that appear in any filing made
with, or written materials submitted to, any third party or any Governmental
Entity in connection with the Merger; provided, however, that with respect to
documents that one party reasonably believes should not be disclosed to the
other party, such party shall instead furnish those documents to counsel for
the other party pursuant to a mutually satisfactory confidentiality
agreement. In exercising the foregoing right, each of the Company and
Acquiror shall act reasonably and as promptly as reasonably practicable.  
(b) Acquiror and the Company shall promptly respond to any request
for additional information pursuant to the HSR Act. Upon the terms and
subject to the provisions hereof, Acquiror and the Company shall each use
their reasonable best efforts to resolve objections, if any, as may be
asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger under any
antitrust or trade or regulatory laws or regulations of any Governmental
Entity, which, in the case of Acquiror, will include if necessary to resolve
such objections, offering, and agreeing to enter into any necessary
agreements, including agreements to sell, license or otherwise dispose of, or
hold separate or otherwise divest itself of, all or any portion of
Acquiror\'s businesses or assets or any portion of the businesses or assets
of any of its Subsidiaries or any portion of the businesses or assets of the
Company or the Company\'s Subsidiaries. Acquiror shall reasonably consult
with the Company with regard to matters covered in this Section 8.1.  
45    8.2. Certain Filings; Cooperation in Receipt of Consents. 
---------------------------------------------------   (a) Promptly after the

with the SEC the Registration Statement, in which the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus will be included as Acquiror\'s prospectus. Each of the
Company and Acquiror shall use reasonable best efforts to have
the Registration Statement declared effective under the Securities Act as
promptly as practicable after the filing and to keep the Registration
Statement effective as long as is necessary to consummate the Merger. Each of
the Company and Acquiror shall mail the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to their
respective Stockholders as promptly as practicable after the Registration
Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act and, if necessary,
after the Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall have been so mailed, promptly
circulate amended, supplemental or supplemented proxy material, and, if
required in connection therewith, resolicit proxies. Acquiror shall also take
any action required to be taken under any applicable state securities or blue
sky laws in connection with the issuance of Acquiror Shares in the
Merger.   (b) No amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus
will be made by the Company or Acquiror without the approval of the other
party, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Each
party will advise the other party, promptly after it receives notice thereof,
of the time when the Registration Statement has become effective or any
supplement or amendment has been filed, the issuance of any stop order, the
suspension of the qualification of the Acquiror Shares issuable in connection
with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any request by
the SEC for amendment of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or comments thereon
and responses thereto or requests by the SEC for additional information. If
at any time prior to the Effective Time, the Company or Acquiror discovers
any information relating to either party, or any of their respective
Affiliates, officers or directors, that should be set forth in an amendment
or supplement to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, so that the document will
not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, the party that discovers any
misleading information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and an
appropriate amendment or supplement describing the information shall be
promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by law or regulation,
disseminated to the Stockholders of the Company and Acquiror.   (c) The
Company and Acquiror shall cooperate with one another in (i) determining
whether any other action by or in respect of, or filing with,
any Governmental Entity is required, or any actions, consents, approvals or
waivers are required to be obtained from parties to any material contracts,
in connection with the Merger, (ii) seeking any consents, approvals or
waivers, taking any actions, or making any filings, furnishing information
required in connection therewith and seeking promptly to obtain any consents,
approvals or waivers and (iii) setting a mutually acceptable date, as close
to the anticipated Closing Date as is reasonably practicable, for the
Company Stockholder Meeting and the Acquiror Stockholder Meeting, if any, so
as to enable them to occur, to the extent practicable, on the same date. Each
party shall permit the other party to review any communication given by it
to, and consult with each other in advance of any meeting or conference with,
any Governmental Entity or, in connection with any proceeding by a private
party, with any other Person, and to the extent permitted by the
applicable Governmental Entity or other Person, give the other party the
opportunity to attend   46   and participate in the meetings and
conferences, in each case in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby.   8.3. Public Announcements. The parties shall consult with each
other  -------------------- before issuing any press release or making any
public statement with respect to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby and, except as may be required by applicable law or any
listing agreement with any national securities exchange, will not issue any
such press release or make any public statement prior to such
consultation.   8.4. Access to Information; Notification of Certain Matters.
From the  ------------------------------------------------------ date hereof
until the Effective Time and subject to applicable law, the Company and
Acquiror shall (i) give to the other party, its counsel, financial
advisors, auditors and other authorized representatives reasonable access to
its personnel, offices, properties, books and records, (ii) furnish or
make available to the other party (and to any third party who has entered
into a confidentiality agreement with Acquiror, which agreement acknowledges
that the Company is a beneficiary thereunder and a copy is delivered to each
party hereto), its counsel, financial advisors, auditors and other
authorized representatives any financial and operating data and other
information as those Persons may reasonably request and (iii) instruct its
employees, counsel, financial advisors, auditors and other authorized
representatives to cooperate with the reasonable requests of the other party
in its investigation. Any investigation pursuant to this Section shall be
conducted in a manner, which will not interfere unreasonably with the conduct
of the business of the other party. Unless otherwise required by law, each of
the Company and Acquiror will hold, and will cause its respective officers,
employees, counsel, financial advisors, auditors and other authorized
representatives to hold, any nonpublic information obtained in any
investigation in confidence in accordance with Section 8.6.   8.5. Further
Assurances. At and after the Effective Time, the officers 
------------------ and directors of the Surviving Corporation will be
authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company,
any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in
the name and on behalf of the Company, any other actions and things to vest,
perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any
and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights,
properties or assets of the Company acquired or to be acquired by the
Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger.  
8.6. Confidentiality. Subject to Schedule 8.6, prior to the Effective 
--------------- Time and after any termination of this Agreement, each party
hereto will hold, and will use its reasonable best efforts to cause its
officers, directors, employees, accountants, counsel, consultants, advisors
and agents to hold, in confidence, unless compelled to disclose by judicial
