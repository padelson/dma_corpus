---|---

 |  

If, between the Accounts Date and Completion, any member of the Seller's Group
makes a capital contribution to the Company that is deemed reasonably
necessary or prudent by the Seller in order to continue to conduct the
business of the Company after prior consultation with the Purchaser (each a
"Capital Contribution"), the amount payable by the Purchaser pursuant to
Clause 3.1 shall be increased on a KRW for KRW basis equal to any such Capital

 |  

Leakage 

---|---

 |

there has been no Leakage, and undertakes that from the date of this Agreement

---|--- 

 

20

   

    

4.2

 |  

Subject to Clause 4.3, in the event of any Leakage between the Accounts Date
and Completion, the Seller shall within 5 (five) Business Days after such
Leakage notify the Purchaser of such Leakage. The Purchaser shall be entitled
to adjust the Consideration by an amount equal to the aggregate amount of all
Leakages incurred up to the Completion (such amount, the "Leakage
Adjustment"). In connection with the Leakage Adjustment, the Seller shall
prepare and provide to the Purchaser, on or prior to the date that is 10 (ten)
Business Days prior to the intended Completion Date, its good faith estimate,
duly certified by the chief financial officer of the Company, of any Leakage
that has occurred or is expected to occur between the Accounts Date and the
Completion (the "Pre-Closing Estimate"), with reasonably detailed supporting
documents. The Purchaser and its Authorised Representatives shall be entitled
to review the Pre-Closing Estimate and, by no later than within 7 (seven)
Business Days prior to the intended Completion Date, may provide its written
comments on the Pre-Closing Estimate to the Seller (along with reasonable
supporting documentation for such comments). In relation to the foregoing, the
Seller shall, and shall cause the Company to, grant the Purchaser and its
Authorised Representatives such reasonable access as provided for under Clause
6.2 as is necessary for them to duly and timely review the Pre-Closing
Estimate. Upon receipt of such written comments from the Purchaser, the Seller
may, in its sole discretion, take into account and reflect the comments (if
any) of the Purchaser on the Pre-Closing Estimate (for the avoidance of doubt,
whether or not the Seller determines to reflect any comments of the Purchaser
shall not delay or otherwise affect the timing for the Completion or
otherwise), following which the Seller shall deliver to the Purchaser a
written notice setting forth in reasonable detail the final estimate by the
Seller for the Leakage Adjustment pursuant to Clause 6.3 (the "Estimated
Leakage Adjustment"). For the avoidance of doubt, the Seller's right to
reflect the comments (if any) of the Purchaser pursuant to the foregoing
sentence shall not otherwise affect the Purchaser's rights to receive payment
under Clause 4.3 in connection with any Leakage not included in the Estimated
Leakage Adjustment. The adjustment of the Consideration and Claims under this
Clause 4.2 (a "Leakage Claim") shall be the sole remedies available to the
Purchaser arising from a breach of Clause 4.1. 

---|--- 

 

    

4.3

 |  

The Seller is not liable to make a payment under this Clause 4.3 unless
Completion has occurred. To the extent after Completion the Purchaser becomes
aware of any Leakage that was not included in the Estimated Leakage
Adjustment, the Purchaser shall deliver to the Seller written notice of the
occurrence of such Leakage, stating in reasonable detail the nature of the
Leakage and the amount claimed, provided that such notice shall be delivered
on or before the date falling 12 (twelve) months after the Completion Date (it
being agreed that no claim for Leakage shall be made after such date). Except
where the Seller disputes the Leakage claimed by the Purchaser, the Seller
shall pay (on a USD for USD/KRW for KRW basis) to the Purchaser an amount in
cash equal to the amount of such Leakage, as soon as practicable but no later
than 5 (five) Business Days after such notice is received by the Seller from
the Purchaser. For the avoidance of doubt, any payment made to the Purchaser
under this Clause 4.3 shall be regarded as an adjustment to the Consideration. 

---|--- 

 

    

4.4

 |  

The aggregate liability of the Seller in respect of this Clause 4 shall not
exceed (on a USD for USD/KRW for KRW basis) an amount equal to the Leakage
paid or payable by the Company. Any payment made under this Agreement pursuant
to a Leakage Claim shall be treated as an adjustment to the Consideration. 

---|--- 

 

    

4.5

 |  

If any Party disputes any Claims relating to any Leakage ("Leakage Claim
Dispute"), the dispute shall be resolved in accordance with the provisions of
Schedule 7. 

---|--- 

 

    

4.6

 |  

If Completion does not occur, the Seller shall have no liability to the
Purchaser under this Clause 4.

---|--- 

 

    



 |  

(a)

 |  

The Purchaser shall have obtained the Purchaser Required Approval;

 |  

(b)

 |  

No Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction shall have enacted,
issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any Applicable Law or Order
prohibiting or making illegal the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby (provided, that if any Governmental Authority enacts,
issues, promulgates, enforces or enters any such Order, the Purchaser shall
use its best endeavours to ensure such Order is vacated by pursuing all
available legal challenges and appeals thereto); 

---|---|--- 

 

    



 |  

(c)

 |  

Each of the Seller's Warranties shall be true and correct in all respects, in
each case, as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Completion Date as
though made on and as of such date (other than Seller's Warranties which by
their terms address matters only as of another specified date, which shall be
true and correct only as of such date), except where the failure of such
Seller's Warranties to be so true and correct has not had, individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect; 

---|---|--- 

 

    



 |  

(d)

 |  

The Seller shall have, in all material respects, performed and complied with
the agreements and covenants required hereunder to be performed or complied
with by it at or prior to the Completion; and

22

   

    



 |  

(e)

 |  

There shall not have occurred and be continuing any Material Adverse Effect. 

---|---|--- 

 

    

5.3

 |  

Each Party undertakes to use its best endeavours to ensure that the conditions
set forth in Clauses 5.1 and 5.2 (collectively, the "Conditions") which it is
in control of, or responsible for hereunder, are fulfilled as soon as
reasonably practicable and, in any event, by the Long Stop Date. If it becomes
apparent that the FSC will not otherwise give the Purchaser Required Approval,
the Purchaser shall promptly notify the Seller and shall promptly offer,
accept and agree to all such conditions, obligations, undertakings and/or
modifications as are required by the FSC to obtain the Purchaser Required
Approval. 

---|--- 

 

    

5.4

 |  

Without prejudice to the generality of Clause 5.3, the Purchaser shall within
5 (five) Business Days after the date of this Agreement commence unofficial
discussion with the FSC regarding its filing of a formal application for the

confirmation for the submission of the formal application. 

---|--- 

 

    

5.5

 |  

Without prejudice to Clauses 5.3 and 5.4, the Purchaser shall ensure that any
notifications and/or filings made by it in connection with the Purchaser
Required Approval are made as soon as reasonably practicable and with all due
care and that such notifications and/or filings are accurate and complete, in
all material respects, with regard to all requirements specified by the
relevant Governmental Authority. In furtherance of the foregoing, the Seller
shall: 

---|--- 

 

    



 |  

(a)

 |  

render to the Purchaser such assistance as may reasonably be requested by the
Purchaser in respect of the Purchaser's obligations to obtain the Purchaser
Required Approval; and 

---|---|--- 

 

    



 |  

(b)

 |  

as soon as reasonably practicable following a request from the Purchaser,
provide the Purchaser with all information reasonably necessary to make any
notification or filing in connection with the Purchaser Required Approval or
as requested by any Governmental Authority, 

---|---|--- 

 

provided that neither the Seller nor any member of the Seller's Group shall be
required under this Clause 5.5 to provide the Purchaser or any member of the
Purchaser's Group with documents or information which contain commercially
sensitive or confidential information which the Seller considers (acting in
good faith and on a reasonable basis) the disclosure of which would be in
violation of any Applicable Law.

 

    

5.6

 |  

Each Party shall keep the other Party promptly informed of, and shall consult
with the other Party regarding, the progress of satisfying the Conditions
which it is in control of, or responsible for hereunder. Each Party shall
immediately inform the other Party of all developments which would or might
reasonably be expected to result in such Party becoming unable to comply with,
or satisfy in any respect, any Condition, which it is in control of, or
responsible for hereunder. Without any prejudice to the generality of the
foregoing, the Purchaser shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law and
the requirements of Governmental Authorities: 

---|--- 

 

    



 |  

(a)

 |  

consult with the Seller or its nominated professional advisers prior to
communicating with the FSC (including by email, telephone and text) in any
material respect in connection with the Purchaser Required Approval;

requests) procure permission for the attendance of Authorised Representatives
of the Seller at, substantive meetings and teleconferences with applicable
Governmental Authorities in connection with the Purchaser Required Approval; 

---|---|--- 

 

23

   

    



 |  

(c)

 |  

provide the Seller with draft copies of all material written submissions to
any Governmental Authority in relation to the Purchaser Required Approval
(other than any such submission or any part thereof that the Purchaser
considers (acting in good faith and on a reasonable basis) to be competitively
sensitive or required to be kept confidential under contractual obligations or
Applicable Law) at such time as will permit the Seller a reasonable
opportunity to provide comments on such material submissions before they are
submitted or sent or made and, in completing such material submissions or
communications, and to the extent reasonably practicable, have due regard to
any reasonable comments made by the Seller; and 

---|---|--- 

 

    



 |  

(d)

 |  

promptly provide the Seller upon receipt with copies of all correspondence
received from the relevant Governmental Authorities in any material respect in
connection with the Purchaser Required Approval (other than any such
correspondence or any part thereof that the Purchaser considers (acting in
good faith and on a reasonable basis) to be competitively sensitive or
required to be kept confidential under contractual obligations or Applicable
Law).

financials (including those that are reconciled pursuant to K-IFRS) and

positions of the Parties and the sensitive nature of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; provided, further, that the auditors and
independent accountants of the Seller, the Company or any of their respective
Affiliates shall not be obliged to make any work papers available to any
person unless and until such person has signed a customary confidentiality and

substance reasonably acceptable to such auditors or independent accountants;
and provided, further, that notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, neither the Seller nor the Company nor any of their Authorised

related work papers, except, in each case, for materials or portions thereof
that relate solely to the Company. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, the Seller shall not be required prior to Completion to
disclose, or cause the Company or their respective Representatives to
disclose, to the Purchaser or any of its Representatives (or provide access to
any offices, premises or records of the Seller or the Company) that could
result in the disclosure to such persons or others of, any information (a) the
disclosure of which is prohibited by Applicable Law (including any relevant
competition law), (b) that is reasonably regarded as confidential to the
activities of the Seller or its Affiliates otherwise than in relation to the
Company, (c) that is commercially sensitive information (including customer

withheld. 

---|---

Company with the Purchaser after separation from the Seller's systems and

shall be entitled (in addition to and without prejudice to all other rights
and remedies available) by written notice to the non-compliant Party:

---|--- 

 

Undertakings of the Purchaser

 

    

10.1

 |  

The Purchaser undertakes to the Seller that it shall not, and shall procure
that each member of the Purchaser's Group will not, during the period of [***]
from the Completion Date, directly or indirectly, solicit or contact with a
view to his or her engagement or employment by a member of the Purchaser's
Group, a director, officer, senior manager or senior employee of any member of
the Seller's Group to whom the Purchaser or the relevant member of the
Purchaser's Group has access as a result of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, except to the extent expressly required or permitted by any
Transaction Document. 

---|--- 

 

    

10.2

 |  

Nothing contained in this Agreement shall preclude or restrict the Purchaser
or any member of the Purchaser's Group from engaging or employing any person

to the Purchaser or the relevant member of the Purchaser's Group. 

---|--- 

 

    

10.3

 |  

The Purchaser acknowledges and confirms that the provisions of Clause 10.1 are
reasonable in all the circumstances and any breach of Clause 10.1 would have a
material impact on the Seller's Group (or the relevant member(s) of the
Seller's Group) and therefore the provisions of Clause 10.1 are wholly
reasonable as to scope, nature and duration to protect the legitimate
interests of the Seller's Group. The Purchaser acknowledges that the
acceptance of these provisions by the Purchaser is a material inducement for
the Seller's entry into this Agreement. 

---|--- 

 

    

10.4

 |  

Each covenant contained in Clause 10.1 shall be construed as separate and
severable and if any such covenant is held to be unenforceable in whole or
part for any reason, the remaining covenants shall continue to bind the
Purchaser, and if such covenant would be valid if part of the wording thereof
were deleted or the periods thereof reduced, the said restriction shall apply
with such modifications as may be necessary to make it valid and effective. 

---|--- 

 

    

10.5

 |  

The Purchaser acknowledges that damages may not be an adequate remedy for
breach of Clause 10.1, in which case the relevant member of the Seller's Group
may seek an injunction or such other equitable relief as a court of competent
jurisdiction may see fit to award to enforce such covenants. 

---|--- 

 

Undertakings of the Seller

 

    

10.6

 |  

The Seller undertakes to the Purchaser that it shall not, and shall procure

officer, Employee, contractor or agent, including any Life Planner of the
Company, except to the extent expressly required or permitted by any
Transaction Document. 

---|--- 

 

    

10.7

 |  

Nothing contained in this Agreement shall preclude or restrict the Seller or
any member of the Seller's Group from engaging or employing any person who has
responded to a bona fide recruitment advertisement or other solicitation
(whether through a recruitment agency or otherwise) not specifically targeted
at such person, or who has made an unsolicited approach to the Seller or the
relevant member of the Seller's Group.

 |  

purchasing or holding for passive investment purposes (but without restriction
to actions that may be necessary in the event of a subsequent distress in the
asset) the equity or debt of any person engaged in, directly or indirectly,
any Competing Activity; provided, that the consolidated beneficial ownership
of the Seller's Group (on a fully-diluted basis) in any class of securities of
such person shall be less than [***]% of the total issued and outstanding
securities of such person; 

---|---|--- 

 

    



 |  

(b)

 |  

purchasing or acquiring any business or person or group of persons (whether by
merger, share purchase or purchase of assets or otherwise) that is engaged,
directly or indirectly, in any Competing Activity, provided that (i) the
Competing Activity of such person or group in Korea accounted for no more than
[***]% of the total revenues (on a consolidated basis, if applicable) of such
business, person or group during the 12 (twelve) months immediately preceding
the purchase or acquisition of such business or person, and (ii) such business
or person does not use any name, mark or logo which consists of or comprises,
or is likely to be confused or associated with, any Prudential Trademarks,
Life Planner Trademarks or other similar Trademarks; or 

---|---|--- 

 

    



 |  

(c)

 |  

entering into reinsurance contracts with persons carrying on any Competing
Activity in the ordinary course of business of the Seller's Group. 

---|---|--- 

 

    

10.10

 |  

If as part of a transaction the Seller or any member of the Seller's Group
acquires a business or person or group of persons with revenues that exceed
the limitations set out in Clause 10.9(b), the Seller shall not be in breach
of Clause 10.8 if it procures the entry into a definitive agreement for the
divestment of the relevant part of such business and/or procures the cessation
of the activities of the relevant part of such business or person or group of
persons to a degree that the limitations set out in Clause 10.9(b) are no
longer exceeded, in each case within 12 (twelve) months from the date of such
acquisition; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Seller shall at
all times procure that such person or group does not use in Korea any name,
mark or logo which consists of or comprises, or is likely to be confused or
associated with, any Prudential Trademarks, Life Planner Trademarks or other
similar Trademarks. 

---|--- 

 

    

10.11

 |  

The Seller acknowledges and confirms that the provisions of Clauses 10.6 and
10.8 are reasonable in all the circumstances and any breach of Clauses 10.6
and 10.8 would have a material impact on the Purchaser's Group (or the
relevant member(s) of the Purchaser's Group) and therefore the provisions of
Clauses 10.6 and 10.8 are wholly reasonable as to scope, nature and duration
to protect the legitimate interests of the Purchaser's Group. The Parties
acknowledge that the acceptance of these provisions by the Seller is a
material inducement for the Purchaser's entry into this Agreement. 

---|--- 

 

    

10.12

 |  

Each covenant contained in Clauses 10.6 and 10.8 shall be construed as
separate and severable and if any such covenant is held to be unenforceable in
whole or part for any reason, the remaining covenants shall continue to bind
the Seller, and if such covenant would be valid if part of the wording thereof
were deleted or the periods thereof reduced or the range of activities or area
dealt with thereby reduced in scope, the said restriction shall apply with
such modifications as may be necessary to make it valid and effective. 

---|--- 

 

    

10.13

 |  

The Seller acknowledges that damages may not be an adequate remedy for a
breach of Clauses 10.6 and 10.8, in which case the Purchaser may seek an
injunction or such other equitable relief as a court of competent jurisdiction
may see fit to award to enforce such covenants.

12.1

 |  

The Parties hereby agree that the Company shall not be entitled to carry on
business under the name "Prudential" or any confusingly similar name.
Accordingly, notwithstanding the Prudential Trademark Use Term, the Purchaser
hereby undertakes to the Seller to procure that by no later than 1 (one) year
after Completion (which period may be extended by an additional up-to 1
(one)-year period to be discussed in good faith, taking into account the
reasonable need of the Company for such extension, and mutually agreed between
the Parties) the corporate name of the Company is changed to a name which does
not contain the word "Prudential" and is not confusingly similar to the
current name of the Company (the "New Name"). The Sub-Licence shall only apply
to the use of any Prudential Trademarks in respect of the existing Company
name for the period permitted by this Clause 12.1. 

---|--- 

 

    

12.2

 |  

Notwithstanding the Prudential Trademark Use Term, the Purchaser hereby
undertakes to the Seller to procure that by no later than 1 (one) year after
Completion (which period may be extended by an additional up-to 1 (one)-year
period to be discussed in good faith, taking into account the reasonable need
of the Company for such extension, and mutually agreed between the Parties),
the Company shall cease using the Prudential Trademarks in respect of the
following Materials: (i) business cards; (ii) invoices; (iii) receipts; (iv)
forms; (v) product, training and service literature and materials; and (vi)
website and domain names, and shall destroy all such Materials with the
Prudential Trademarks which are reasonably capable of destruction. The Sub-
Licence shall only apply to the use of any Prudential Trademarks in respect of
the Materials listed in this Clause 12.2 for the period permitted by this
Clause 12.2 and provided such use is consistent with past practice.
Furthermore, notwithstanding the period to which the Sub-Licence applies to
the Materials listed in this Clause 12.2, the Purchaser hereby undertakes to
procure that, upon adoption of the New Name in accordance with Clause 12.1,
the Company will nonetheless clearly state the New Name as specified by
Applicable Laws on those Materials requiring such display to which the Sub-
Licence applies from the date of approval of use of the New Name.

12.4

 |  

From Completion, neither the Company nor any member of the Purchaser's Group
shall be authorized to use any of the Life Planner Trademarks or Life Planner
Materials except as permitted hereunder and under the IP Agreements. 

---|--- 

 

    

12.5

 |  

Other than as specified in the Seller's Warranties, the Seller is making no
representation with respect to the Life Planner Programme or any of the Life
Planner Materials. 

---|--- 

 

    

12.6

 |  

Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary in this Agreement, "Love Cards"
or "Love Letters" completed by insureds and held in trust by the Company do
not need to have the Prudential Trademarks removed or covered, do not have to
be destroyed and may continue to be used as intended. For the avoidance of
doubt, "Love Cards" or "Love Letters" that have not yet been completed or are
otherwise blank are subject to the terms of this Clause 12 and Schedule 6.

The Parties intend for the purchase of the Shares by the Purchaser to be
treated as a "qualified stock purchase" within the meaning of Section
338(d)(3) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code")
of the Company, as to which the Purchaser is the "purchasing corporation"
within the meaning of Section 338(d)(1) of the Code. Except as provided in
this Clause 13.1, the Purchaser shall not make or permit to be made, an
election under Section 338(g) (a "Section 338 Election") of the Code with
respect to the Company in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby. 

---|--- 

 

    



 |  

(a)

 |  

The Purchaser hereby warrants to the Seller that, as of the Completion Date,
the Purchaser is classified as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax
purposes. 

---|---|--- 

 

    



 |  

(b)

 |  

At the election of the Seller, exercisable at any time prior to the date that
is 150 days following the Completion Date, the Purchaser shall make, or cause
to be made, such timely and effective election under Section 338(g) of the
Code with respect to the purchase of Shares of the Company as the Seller
designates. 

---|---|--- 

 

    



 |  

(c)

 |  

Within 30 days following the delivery by the Seller of notice to the Purchaser
that it directs the Purchaser to make a Section 338 Election, the Seller shall
prepare a properly completed IRS Form 8883 and IRS Form 8023 or any successor
thereto and any other required forms or schedules thereto (collectively, the
"Section 338 Election Forms") with respect to the Company. 

---|---|--- 

 

    



 |  

(d)

 |  

The Purchaser shall take all actions necessary and appropriate to effect and
preserve the Section 338 Election, including signing and timely filing the
Section 338 Election Forms. The Purchaser shall cooperate with the Seller with
respect to the Section 338 Election Forms and shall furnish a copy of such
Section 338 Election Forms promptly after they are filed together with proof
of filing; 

---|---|--- 

 

provided that the Seller shall bear the Purchaser's reasonable out-of-pocket
costs incurred in connection with making and filing such Section 338 Election.

 

    

13.2

 |  

The Purchaser consents to the Seller's making or causing to be made, if the
Seller so chooses, the election to close the tax year of the Company for U.S.
federal income tax purposes pursuant to temporary U.S. Treasury Regulation
§1.245A-5T(e)(3)(i) (or any successor guidance). 

---|--- 

 

    

13.3

 |  

Without the prior written consent of the Seller, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, the Purchaser shall not, and
shall not permit any of its Affiliates to, amend any Tax returns or make or
change any Tax elections or accounting methods, in each case with respect to
the Company relating to a taxable period (or portion thereof) ending on or 

---|--- 

 

31

   

    |  

before the Completion Date except to the extent required by applicable Tax
law. Upon a determination by the Purchaser or any such Affiliate that such
amendment or making or changing of any Tax elections or accounting methods is
so required by law, the Purchaser shall promptly notify the Seller of such
determination. 

---|--- 

 

    

13.4

 |  

The Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that, in connection with Completion, the
Seller will terminate or cancel the Company's registration with the United
States taxing authorities (and if applicable, corresponding non-U.S. taxing
authorities) regarding compliance with the provisions of Sections 1471-1474 of
the Code, the Treasury Regulations, rules or guidance issued thereunder, and
any laws, rules, guidance or other requirements relating to an applicable
intergovernmental agreement (collectively, "FATCA"). The Purchaser agrees to
reasonably cooperate with the Seller to effect such deregistration and to take
all necessary steps to cause the Company to comply with its obligations under
FATCA from and after the Completion Date. 

---|--- 

 

    

13.5

 |  

The Purchaser shall promptly notify the Seller in writing (but in no event
later than 10 (ten) Business Days after becoming aware thereof) upon receipt
by the Company, or the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates of notice of any Tax
audits, examinations or assessments for a taxable period (or portion thereof)
ending on or prior to the Completion Date, provided that the Purchaser's
failure so to notify the Seller shall not limit the Purchaser's rights under
this Agreement except to the extent the Seller is materially prejudiced by
such failure. Thereafter, the Purchaser shall deliver to the Seller, within 5
(five) Business Days after receipt thereof, copies of all notices and
documents received by the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates relating to such
Tax audit, examination or proceeding (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
any Tax audit, examination or assessment that began on or before the
Completion Date). Except as otherwise provided herein, (a) the Seller shall,
if it so chooses, control at the Seller's own expense any such Tax audit,
examination or proceeding (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Tax
audit, examination or assessment that began on or before the Completion Date)
that relates to Taxes of the Company for which the Seller may be liable under
this Agreement with the counsel of its choice and (b) the Purchaser shall
control any Tax audit, examination or proceeding that is not described in
paragraph (a). Each Party that controls the conduct of a Tax audit,
examination or proceeding pursuant to this Clause 13.5 (which includes, for
the avoidance of doubt, any Tax audit, examination or assessment that began on
or before the Completion Date, in particular, including the tax audit of the
Seoul Regional Tax Service that the Company is currently undergoing) shall (w)
notify such other Party of significant developments with respect to such Tax
audit, examination or proceeding and keep such other Party reasonably informed
and consult with such other Party as to the resolution of any issue that would
materially affect such other Party, (x) give such other Party a copy of any
Tax adjustment or assessment proposed in writing with respect to such Tax
audit, examination or proceeding and copies of any other written
correspondence with the relevant Tax Authority relating to such Tax audit,
examination or proceeding, (y) not settle or compromise any issue without the
prior written consent of the Purchaser or the Seller, as applicable, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed and (z) otherwise permit
the Purchaser or the Seller, as applicable, to participate in (but not
control) all aspects of such Tax audit, examination or proceeding, at such
other Party's own expense. Except to the extent provided in Clause 13.3, the
conduct of any Tax audit, examination or proceeding solely with respect to any
taxable period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Completion Date shall
be exclusively within the control of the Purchaser. 

---|--- 

 

    

13.6

 |  

The Seller shall file or cause the Company to timely prepare and file with the
appropriate Tax Authorities any Tax Returns with respect to the Company due on
or prior to the Completion Date subject to applicable extensions. The
Purchaser shall cause the Company to timely prepare and file with the
appropriate Tax Authorities all Tax Returns with respect to the Company due
after the Completion Date (such Tax Returns, other than Tax Returns for which
the Seller shall have filing responsibility under this Clause 13.6, the
"Company Returns"). The 

---|--- 

 

32

   

    |  

Purchaser shall provide the Seller with a copy of any Company Returns
(including any schedules and workpapers relating thereto) with respect to a
taxable period (or portion thereof) ending on or before the Completion Date,
for review and comment, at least 20 (twenty) Business Days prior to the
respective due date of such Company Returns, and the Seller shall provide the
Purchaser with comments on such Company Returns not later than 10 (ten)
Business Days prior to the respective due dates of such Company Returns. The
Parties shall cooperate in good faith to resolve any disagreements with
respect to such comments and (i) in the case of Company Returns for which the
applicable taxable period began prior to the Accounts Date, the Purchaser
shall revise such Company Returns to incorporate all reasonable comments, and
(ii) in the case of any other Company Returns, the Purchaser agrees to
cooperate in good faith with the Seller and not act unreasonably with respect
to any comments the Seller may make with respect to Company Returns (including
related accounting matters) for taxable periods (or portions thereof)
beginning after the Accounts Date, provided that if the Purchaser reasonably
proposes not to incorporate any of the Seller's comments with respect to a
Company Return described in clause (ii), the Purchaser shall nevertheless
incorporate such comment if the Seller agrees to indemnify the Purchaser and
the Company against any incremental Taxes resulting therefrom without regard
to the limitations on the quantum of indemnification contained in paragraph 2
of Schedule 4. The procedural rules of paragraph 4 of Schedule 4 and Clause
13.5, as applicable, shall govern any claim for such indemnification. The
Purchaser shall promptly deliver to Seller an as-filed copy of all Company
Returns relating to a Tax period (or portion thereof) ending on or before the
Completion Date. 

---|--- 

 

    

13.7

 |  

The Purchaser acknowledges and confirms that the provisions of Clauses 13.1 to
13.6 are reasonable in all the circumstances and any breach of Clauses 13.1 to
13.6 would have a material impact on the Seller's Group (or the relevant
member(s) of the Seller's Group) and therefore the provisions of Clauses 13.1
to 13.6 are wholly reasonable as to scope, nature and duration to protect the
legitimate interests of the Seller's Group. The Purchaser acknowledges that
the acceptance of these provisions by the Purchaser is a material inducement
for the Seller's entry into this Agreement. 

---|--- 

 

    

13.8

 |  

Each covenant contained in Clauses 13.1 to 13.6 shall be construed as separate
and severable and if any such covenant is held to be unenforceable in whole or
part for any reason, the remaining covenants shall continue to bind the
Purchaser, and if such covenant would be valid if part of the wording thereof
were deleted or the periods thereof reduced or the range of activities or area
dealt with thereby reduced in scope, the said restriction shall apply with
such modifications as may be necessary to make it valid and effective. 

---|--- 

 

    

13.9

 |  

The Purchaser acknowledges that damages may not be an adequate remedy for
breach of Clauses 13.1 to 13.6 in which case the Seller may seek an injunction
or such other equitable relief as a court of competent jurisdiction may see
fit to award to enforce such covenants. 

---|--- 

 

    

14.

 |  

Other Covenants 

---|--- 

 

    

14.1

 |  

The Purchaser shall use reasonable endeavours to procure by Completion or, to
the extent not done by Completion, as soon as reasonably practicable
thereafter, the release with effect from Completion of the Seller or any
member of the Seller's Group or any person connected with any of them (the
"Guarantors" and "Guarantor" means any one of them), from any securities,
guarantees or indemnities given by or binding upon a Guarantor relating to a
liability of the Company. Pending such release, the Purchaser shall indemnify
each member of the Seller's Group against all amounts paid by any of them
pursuant to any such securities, guarantees and indemnities in respect of such
liability of the Company which arises out of any event occurring after
Completion. 

---|--- 

 

33

   

    

14.2

 |  

The Purchaser undertakes to the Seller, that from Completion until the 6th
(sixth) anniversary thereof, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, it
shall promptly afford (and will procure that the Company promptly affords) to
the Seller and its Affiliates and their respective Authorised Representatives,
at reasonable times during normal business hours, and in a manner so as not to
interfere with the normal business operations of the Company, access to the
books, records, officers, employees, auditors and other advisors of the
Company, and shall provide information with respect to the Company in a
readily accessible form, to the extent reasonably required by the Seller or
any of its Affiliates for any lawful business purpose, including litigation,
disputes, compliance, financial and Tax reporting, and the Purchaser shall
cooperate fully (and will procure that the Company shall cooperate fully) with
the Seller or its relevant Affiliates and their respective Authorised
Representatives to furnish such books and records and information and make
available such officers, employees, auditors and other advisors of the
Company. The Seller shall reimburse the Purchaser promptly for any reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Company and any of its Affiliates or
Authorised Representatives in complying with any request by or on behalf of
the Seller or any of its Authorised Representatives in connection with this
Clause 14.2, provided, that the Purchaser shall provide its reasonable
estimates of such expenses to the extent practicable. 

---|--- 

 

    

14.3

 |  

Subject to Completion and to the maximum extent permitted under Applicable
Law, the Purchaser hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees and
undertakes not to (and to cause the Purchaser's Group, including the Company,
not to) make or bring any action or claim against the Company's directors and
audit committee members as at the date of this Agreement (the "Indemnified
Persons"), in each case based on any act or omission by any of the Indemnified
Persons in relation to the Company prior to Completion, except in the case of
wilful misconduct, or fraud by the Indemnified Persons. 

---|--- 

 

    

14.4

 |  

Subject to Completion and to the maximum extent permitted under Applicable
Law, the Purchaser hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees and
undertakes to keep fully harmless and indemnify any Indemnified Persons from
and against any Action or Claim based on any act or omission by any such
Indemnified Persons in relation to the Company prior to Completion, where such
Action or Claim is made or brought following the Completion by the Company or
the Purchaser (and not, for the avoidance of doubt, by any other person),
except in the case of wilful misconduct or fraud by the Indemnified Persons,
provided, that the Seller shall not actively terminate any existing directors'
and officers' liability insurance covering the Indemnified Persons with
respect to their acts and omissions occurring at or prior to the Completion.

by either Party, in the event that any of the Conditions shall not have been

At Completion, each Party shall be released from its obligations under the

any such information is required by Applicable Law, a Governmental Authority
or a Tax Authority to be disclosed; 

---|---|---

any such information is reasonably necessary to be disclosed in connection
with any Action or in any dispute with respect to the Transaction Documents
(including in response to any summons, subpoena or other legal process or
formal or informal investigative demand issued to the disclosing Party in the
course of any litigation, investigation or administrative proceeding); 

---|---|--- 

 

    



 |  

(e)

 |  

any such information was or becomes available to such Party on a non-

any Affiliate or Authorised Representative of such Party) that is not bound by
a confidentiality agreement with respect to such information; or 

---|---|--- 

 

    



 |  

(f)

 |  

any such information that becomes known or available pursuant to or as a
result of the carrying out of the provisions of a Transaction Document (which

Subject to Clause 17.2, each Party shall ensure that no disclosure or
announcement relating to the existence or subject matter of the Transaction
Documents shall be made or issued by or on behalf of it or any member of the
Purchaser's Group or the Seller's Group (as applicable) without the prior
written approval of the other Party, provided that such restrictions shall not
apply to any disclosure or announcement if required by Applicable Law, any
Governmental Authority or the rules of any stock exchange on which the shares
or other securities of a member of the Seller's Group or the Purchaser's Group
(as applicable) are listed or traded.

20.1

 |  

The Transaction Documents constitute the entire and only agreement between the
Parties relating to the subject matter of the Transaction Documents and, for
the avoidance of doubt, the Transaction Documents supersede any and all

communications (whether written or oral) between the Parties with respect to
the subject matter of the Transaction Documents. 

---|--- 

 

    

20.2

 |  

Each Party acknowledges and agrees that it has not been induced to enter into

action arising out of, any warranty, representation, statement, assurance,
covenant, agreement, undertaking, indemnity or commitment of any nature
whatsoever other than as are expressly set out in the Transaction Documents. 

---|--- 

 

    

20.3

 |  

Except as otherwise expressly set out in the Transaction Documents, all
representations or warranties implied by law in any jurisdiction (whether by
statute, or otherwise) in relation to the sale of the Shares or the
transactions under this Agreement are excluded to the fullest extent permitted
by law or, if incapable of exclusion, any rights or remedies in relation to
them are irrevocably waived. 

---|--- 

 

    

21.

 |  

Withholding 

---|--- 

 

    

21.1

 |  

All sums payable under this Agreement shall be paid free and clear of all set-
off, counterclaims, deductions or withholdings unless Applicable Law requires
a deduction or withholding to be made (including the STT), provided that (i)
the Purchaser shall pay the Consideration from a Korean bank account and shall
not take or permit to be taken any action after the date hereof (such as an
assignment of the Agreement to another member of the Purchaser\'s Group) that
would require any deduction or withholding to be made from the Consideration
(other than STT) which would otherwise not have been required but for such
action, and (ii) if any deduction or withholding becomes required (including
as a result of a post-Completion audit, assessment or challenge by a taxing
authority) as a result of any action described in Clause 21.1(i), or as a
result of any portion of the Consideration being characterized as interest for
Tax purposes, the Party making such payment shall pay such additional amount
as will ensure that the net amount the payee receives equals the full amount
which it would have received had such deduction or withholding not been
required. 

---|--- 

 

    

21.2

 |  

At Completion, the Purchaser shall withhold an amount equal to the STT
required to be withheld from the Consideration and duly pay such withheld STT
to the KNTS in respect of the sale of the Shares. The Purchaser shall promptly
provide to the Seller a copy of the STT payment receipt from the KNTS and
shall promptly remit to the Seller any refund of STT (and associated interest,
if any) received by the Purchaser or its Affiliates. 

---|--- 

 

    

21.3

 |  

The Seller shall prepare and provide to the Purchaser, prior to the Completion
Date, with an "Application for Tax Exemption in Accordance with Tax Treaty" in
respect of CGT, together 

---|--- 

 

38

   

    |  

with an original copy of the certificate of tax residency issued by the
relevant Tax Authority (i.e., IRS Form 6166) in respect of the Seller and
other documents and information reasonably requested by the Purchaser (the
"Tax Exemption Package"), and the Purchaser shall not withhold any CGT in
respect of the Consideration payable to the Seller. All information provided
by the Seller in the Tax Exemption Package shall be true and correct. The
Purchaser shall timely and properly file such Tax Exemption Package with the
relevant Tax Authority as soon as practicable and in no event later than the
9th (ninth) day of the month immediately following the month during which the
Completion Date takes place. The Purchaser shall keep the Seller informed on a
timely basis regarding the status of the Tax Exemption Package and, if the Tax
Exemption Package is approved by the KNTS, the Purchaser shall deliver to the
Seller a copy of such approval promptly following the receipt of such
approval.

Subject to any clauses of any Transaction Documents entitling any Party to

If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable in any respect under the
law of any jurisdiction, then such provision shall (so far as it is invalid or

this Agreement but without invalidating any of the remaining provisions of
this Agreement. Any provision of this Agreement held invalid or unenforceable
only in part or degree will remain in full force and effect to the extent not
held invalid or unenforceable. The Parties shall then use all reasonable
endeavours to replace the invalid or unenforceable provision(s) by a valid and

Purchaser's Group). 

---|--- 

 

    

26.3

 |  

Provided that, in the case of an assignment pursuant to Clause 26.2, then the
liability of any Party to such an assignee and all other persons shall not be
greater than it would have been had such an assignment not taken place, and
all rights, benefits and protections afforded to a Party shall continue to
apply to the benefit of that Party as against the assignee as they would have
applied as against the person who is a Party to this Agreement.

4.

 |  

Third Party Claims 

---|--- 

 

    

4.1

 |  

If any Party (the "Notified Party") receives notice of assertion or
commencement of a Third Party Claim against any such Party in respect of which
the other Party (the "Compensating Party") may be obligated to provide
indemnification under this Agreement, the Notified Party shall give the
Compensating Party reasonably prompt written notice thereof (but in no event
later than 20 Business Days after becoming aware thereof) and such notice
shall include a reasonable description of the claim based on the facts known
at the time and any documents relating to the claim and an estimate of the
Loss and shall reference the specific sections of this Agreement that form the
basis of such claim. Thereafter, the Notified Party shall deliver to the
Compensating Party, within 10 Business Days after the Notified Party's receipt
thereof, copies of all notices and documents (including court papers) received
by the Notified Party relating to the Third Party Claim. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, the failure to so notify by the Notified
Party under this paragraph 4.1 of Schedule 4 shall not relieve the
Compensating Party of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent such
failure shall have actually prejudiced the Compensating Party. 

---|--- 

 

    

4.2

 |  

The Compensating Party shall be entitled to participate in the defence of any
Third Party Claim by notifying the Notified Party of its intent to participate
in such defense promptly following the receipt of a notice from the Notified
Party under paragraph 4.1 of Schedule 4 and, if it so chooses, to assume the
defence thereof with a counsel of its choice at its own expense; provided that
the Compensating Party shall (i) defend such Claim diligently, (ii) not effect
any settlement (x) unless the Notified Party has been fully released from any
Liabilities in connection with such Claim, or (y) that imposes injunctive or
other equitable relief against the Notified Party and (iii) prior to such
assumption of the settlement or defense of the Claim, furnish the Notified
Party with reasonable evidence that the Compensating Party has adequate
resources to defend the Claim and fulfill its indemnity obligations hereunder.
If the Compensating Party assumes such defence, the Notified Party shall have
the right to participate in the defence thereof and to employ counsel, at its
own expense, separate from the counsel employed by the Compensating Party, it
being understood that the Compensating Party shall control such defence. The
Compensating Party shall be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of
counsel employed by the Notified Party for any period during which the
Compensating Party has not assumed the defence thereof. If the Compensating
Party chooses to defend any Third Party Claim hereunder, the Parties shall
cooperate in the defence thereof. Such cooperation shall include the
retention and (upon the Compensating Party's request) the provision to the
Compensating Party of records and information that are relevant to such Third
Party Claim, and making employees reasonably available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder. The Notified Party shall not admit any liability
with respect to, or pay, settle, compromise or discharge, such Third Party
Claim without the other Party\'s prior written consent, which shall not be 

---|--- 

 

62

   

    |  

unreasonably withheld or delayed. The Compensating Party shall not pay,
settle, compromise or discharge such Third Party Claim without the other
Party's prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed, unless such settlement consists solely of monetary damages paid by
the Compensating Party. To the extent of any conflict between the provisions
of this paragraph 4 and those of Clause 13.5, the provisions of Clause 13.5
shall prevail.

5.

 |  

Specific Limitations 

---|--- 

 

    

5.1

 |

Claim to the extent that the matter or circumstances giving rise to that
Claim: 

---|--- 

 

    



 |  

(a)

 |  

was specifically reflected in the Accounts (including, without limitation, by
way of a note or a statement in any report forming part thereof); 

---|---|--- 

 

    



 |  

(b)

 |  

is, or arises from, any matter or circumstance fairly disclosed in the
Disclosure Letter or the Data Room, in each case, where such disclosure is in
sufficient detail and a manner to enable a purchaser of the Shares to fairly
assess and identify the nature and consequences of such matter or
circumstance; 

---|---|--- 

 

    



 |  

(c)

 |  

are Leakages fully paid to the Purchaser pursuant to Clause 4.3; or 

---|---|--- 

 

    



 |  

(d)

 |  

have been refunded or otherwise paid to and actually received by the Purchaser
or the Company. 

---|---|--- 

 

    

5.2

 |  

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement or
provided for under Applicable Law with respect to any Claim, each Party shall
not be liable to any other person, either in contract or in tort, for any
consequential, incidental, indirect, special or punitive damages of such other
person, or any loss of future revenue, or income or profits, or any diminution
in value or multiples of earnings damages relating to the breach or alleged
breach hereof; provided, however, that the foregoing limitation shall not
relieve such Party from such Liability to the extent that such Losses are
awarded to a third party in connection with a Third Party Claim. 

---|--- 

 

    

6.

 |  

Recovery of Losses 

---|--- 

 

    

6.1

 |  

If, before any amount is paid in discharge of all or part of any Claim, a
Party seeking indemnity hereunder is entitled for whatever reason to recover
(whether by payment, third party insurance cover, discount, credit, relief or
otherwise) from a third party, including an insurer, an amount which
indemnifies or compensates (in whole or in part) such Party or otherwise in
respect of the Loss which is the subject of the Claim, such Party shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to take, before steps are taken to enforce
such Claim, all reasonable steps (including any of which the Compensating
Party may reasonably require) to enforce such recovery from the third party,
and any actual recovery (less any Taxes and reasonable out of pocket expenses
incurred in obtaining the same) shall reduce or satisfy, as the case may be,
such Claim to the extent of such recovery. Subject to Applicable Law relating
to rights of subrogation, the Compensating Party shall be subrogated to all
rights that the Notified Party has or would otherwise have in respect of the
claim against the third party. 

---|--- 

 

    

6.2

 |  

If any amount is paid in discharge of all or part of any Claim and an amount
is subsequently recovered by the Party seeking indemnity hereunder (whether by
payment, third party 

---|--- 

 

63

   

    |  

insurance cover, discount, credit, set-off or otherwise) from a third party
(including any Tax Authority or insurer) in respect of the matter in relation
to which the Claim was made, such Party shall forthwith promptly repay to the
Compensating Party a sum corresponding to the amount recovered from the third
party net of Taxes incurred by such Party with respect to receipt of the
recovered amount and reasonable out of pocket expenses of such Party relating
to such recovery and subject to the maximum repayment being equal to the
amount paid by the Compensating Party in discharge of all or part of such
Claim. 

---|--- 

 

    

6.3

 |  

If the event giving rise to a Claim produces an actual saving or benefit for
the Purchaser and/or a member of the Purchaser\'s Group (including in relation
to Tax), the Purchaser shall procure that the saving or benefit and the amount
of it will either be taken into account in reducing the amount of the Claim
or, if the Seller has paid an amount in discharge of that Claim without such
saving or benefit being taken into account, then the amount by which such
saving or benefit would have reduced the liability so discharged shall be
repaid promptly to the Seller less the Purchaser\'s reasonable out of pocket
expenses (if any) incurred in obtaining the saving or benefit. 

---|--- 

 

    

7.

 |  

Adjustment of Purchase Price 

---|--- 

 

Any payment made under this Agreement pursuant to a Claim to each Party shall
be regarded as an adjustment to the Consideration.

 

    

8.

 |  

Mitigation 

---|--- 

 

Each Party agrees to take all reasonable steps to avoid or mitigate its Losses
upon and after becoming aware of any event which would reasonably be expected
to give rise to any Claim.

 

    

9.

 |  

No Liability for Contingent or Non-quantifiable Claims 

---|--- 

 

If any Claim arises by reason of some Loss of a Party which, at the time such
breach or claim is notified to the other Party, is contingent only or
otherwise not capable of being quantified, then the other Party shall not be
under any obligation to make any payment in respect of such Claim unless and
until such liability ceases to be contingent or becomes capable of being
quantified, provided that nothing in this paragraph 9 shall prevent such Party
from notifying the other Party of any Claim or commencing Actions in respect
thereof as required under paragraph 1.

 

    

10.

 |  

Future Legislation, Tax Policy and Agreed Matters 

---|--- 

 

No liability of a Party shall arise under any Transaction Document in respect
of any matter, act, omission or circumstance (or any combination thereof),
including the aggravation of a matter or circumstance and any Losses arising
therefrom, to the extent that the same would not have occurred but for:

 

    



 |  

(a)

 |  

the passing of, or any change in, any Applicable Law after the Completion Date
including (without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing) any increase
in the rates of Tax or any imposition of Tax or any withdrawal of relief from
Tax not actually (or prospectively) introduced at the Completion Date; or 

---|---|--- 

 

64

   

    



 |  

(b)

 |  

any change in accounting or Tax policy, bases or practice of the other Party
or the Company introduced or having effect after Completion. 

---|---|--- 

 

    

11.

 |  

Acts and Knowledge 

---|--- 

 

Each Party shall not be liable in respect of any Claim to the extent:

 

    



 |  

(a)

 |  

such Claim would not have arisen but for any act, omission, transaction or
arrangement carried out at, and in accordance with, the written request of the
other Party before Completion; or 

---|---|--- 

 

    



 |  

(b)

 |  

such Claim would not have arisen but for any act done or omitted to be done
after Completion by the other Party; or 

---|---|--- 

 

    



 |  

(c)

 |  

the facts, matters or circumstances which are the subject of the Claim have
been disclosed by the Disclosure Letter or the Data Room. 

---|---|---

Agreement, the only remedies available to each Party under this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby are indemnification under Clauses 8.2 and
15.2, and paragraph 3 of Schedule 4 (subject to the limitations set forth
herein), as applicable, and, for the avoidance of doubt, without limiting the
foregoing, it shall not have any right to rescind or terminate this Agreement
following Completion either for breach of contract or for negligent or
innocent misrepresentation or otherwise. In furtherance of the foregoing, each
Party, on behalf of itself and each of its Affiliates and Representatives,
hereby waives, from and after Completion, to the fullest extent permitted
under Applicable Law, any and all rights, claims and causes of action it may

under common law or any other Applicable Law), except as specified in the
immediately preceding sentence.

(the "Reserves") and has not relied on the Seller's assessment in doing so; 

---|---|--- 

 

    



 |  

(b)

 |  

the Purchaser acknowledges its understanding that an insurer is required by
applicable laws, rules and regulation to maintain a minimum level of reserves
and that new policies or requirements may be promulgated or implemented by a
Governmental Authority from time to time and/or alternative interpretations of
existing rules or requirements may be applied by the relevant regulator from
time to time regarding the calculation of such reserves; and the Purchaser is
responsible for assessing the need for independent actuarial and other
professional advice in this regard;

documents contained in, attached to or referred to in the Data Room or the

 |  

notwithstanding anything otherwise contained in this Agreement or in any other
document to be executed pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement or
any document in the Data Room or which has been or will be provided to the
Purchaser 

---|---|--- 

 

66

   

    



 |  |  

or its Affiliates or its or their Representatives, no part of this Agreement
or of any such other document shall be construed as constituting, directly or
indirectly, such a representation or warranty, and none of the Seller nor any
member of the Seller's Group or any of their Representatives shall be under
any liability to any member of the Purchaser's Group or any other person to
the extent that (for whatever reason) that member of the Purchaser's Group or
other person suffers any loss or liability as a consequence of its, or its
advisers' assessment of (a) the amount or the sufficiency of the Reserves or
the value in force of any policies written or assumed by the Company, (b) the
appropriateness of any actuarial principle, assumption or methodology, or (c)
the future performance, probable success or future profitability of the

inaccurate.

14.4

 |  

If the Purchaser or any of its Representatives has received any Forward
Looking Information (including in connection with any financial analysis,
modelling or actuarial analysis conducted by the Purchaser or any of its
Representatives), the Purchaser agrees that: 

---|--- 

 

    



 |  

(a)

 |  

there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make forward looking
opinions, estimates, projections, business plans, budgets and forecasts and
the Purchaser is familiar with these uncertainties; and 

---|---|--- 

 

    



 |  

(b)

 |  

the Purchaser will make its own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all
Forward Looking Information furnished to it, 

---|---|--- 

 

and the Purchaser shall have no Claim against the Seller in respect thereof.

 

    

14.5

 |  

If there is any conflict between the provisions of this paragraph 14 and any
other provision of this Agreement or of any other document to be executed

 |  

For the period of 1 (one)-year from Completion (which period may be extended

Trademark Use Term") or such shorter period as is required under Clause 12,
subject to the provisions of this Schedule and Applicable Law PICA hereby
grants to the Company a non-exclusive, non-transferable sub-licence to use the

and service literature and materials and other materials necessary for the

each case which are in existence at Completion and consistent with recent past
practice of the Company (the "Sub-Licence"). 

---|--- 

 

    

2.

 |  

Neither the Company nor any other member of the Purchaser's Group shall, by
virtue of the Sub-Licence granted hereunder, obtain or claim any right, title
or interest (express or implied) in or to the Prudential Trademarks except the
rights of use as are specifically set out in paragraph 1 of this Part A of
Schedule 6. Any and all goodwill generated by or associated with the
Company's or any of its permitted sub-licencees' use of the Prudential
Trademarks shall inure solely to the benefit of the Seller. 

---|--- 

 

    

3.

 |  

The Sub-Licence is granted on an "as-is" basis and the Seller does not warrant
the validity of any Prudential Trademarks or the absence of any infringement
by any third party; provided that, during the Prudential Trademark Use Term,
the Seller shall, and shall procure the relevant member(s) of the Seller's
Group to, use their due care and reasonable efforts to duly maintain any
Prudential Trademarks and prevent any infringement by any third party,
including any renewal or objection pertaining thereto. 

---|--- 

 

    

4.

 |  

The Purchaser shall procure that the Company does not use the Prudential
Trademarks other than in strict accordance with the terms of this Agreement,
and shall procure that no member of its Group (including the Company) does,
assists the doing of, or permits to be done, any act or omission which would
or might jeopardise or invalidate any registration of the Prudential
Trademarks, or the Seller's Group's right or title to any Prudential
Trademarks. 

---|--- 

 

    

5.

 |  

The Purchaser hereby undertakes to procure that the Company will clearly mark
any Materials to which the Sub-Licence applies with the symbols or words
required or allowed under the laws of Korea to indicate that the Prudential
Trademarks are registered trademarks (or, as the case may be, unregistered
trademarks) used by the Company under sub-licence and that the Company is not
part of the Seller's Group. 

---|--- 

 

    

6.

 |  

The Purchaser hereby undertakes to procure that the Company shall not,
directly or indirectly, do anything which may jeopardise or adversely affect
the distinctiveness, 

---|--- 

 



 



   

    |

associated with the Prudential Trademarks, the validity of any current or
future registration for any Prudential Trademark or the reputation of the
Seller's Group (or any member thereof). 

---|--- 

 

    

7.

 |  

Upon the Seller's written request, the Purchaser shall procure that the
Company, at its own cost and expense, makes such applications to the relevant
authorities requested by the Seller and submits such forms and evidence in
Korea as may be necessary or desirable to record the Company as a sub-licencee
of the Prudential Trademarks. Any such entry shall be cancelled by the Seller
(or any member of its Group) upon expiry of the Prudential Trademark Use Term,
and the Purchaser shall procure that the Company will assist the Seller (or
any member of its Group) so far as may be necessary to achieve such
cancellation, including executing any necessary documents. 

---|--- 

 

    

8.

 |  

The Company shall not grant permission to other members of the Purchaser's
Group or any agents, brokers or other third parties to use or reproduce the
Prudential Trademarks without the prior written consent of the Seller, other
than to the General Agencies and Life Planners that are currently using the
Prudential Trademarks, from whom the Company shall obtain written agreements
including the terms set forth below. Where the Seller provides its written
consent to such use or reproduction, the Purchaser shall procure that any
permitted sub-licence will contain (but not be limited to): 

---|--- 

 

    



 |  

(a)

 |  

undertakings by the sub-licencee to comply with terms equivalent to the terms
of this Schedule so far as they are applicable;

 |  

(e)

---|---|--- 

 

    

9.

 |  

The Company will be responsible for the compliance by any permitted sub-
licencees with the terms of any sub-licence and will be directly liable to the
Seller for any breach by the sub-licencee of any of its terms and promptly
notify the Seller in the case of any such breach. To the extent a sub-
licencee fails to comply with any of its obligations under its sub-licence,
the Company shall (and the Purchaser will procure that the Company shall) give
such sub-licencee notice terminating the relevant sub-licence with immediate
effect. 

---|--- 

 

    

10.

 |  

The Purchaser shall promptly advise the Seller of any act of infringement,
passing-off or unauthorised use of the Prudential Trademarks which comes to

matter without first having obtained the prior written approval of the Seller. 

---|--- 

 

    

11.

 |  

If the Purchaser or the Company becomes aware that any third party alleges
that the Prudential Trademarks are invalid or that use of the Prudential
Trademarks infringes any 

---|--- 

 

73

   

    |  

third party right, the Purchaser will promptly notify the Seller of such. The
Purchaser hereby agrees that it will not, and will procure that the Company
does not, make any comment or admission to anyone else regarding such matters. 

---|--- 

 

    

12.

 |  

The Purchaser shall, and will procure that the Company shall, co-operate fully
in any action brought by the Seller or its Group in connection with any act of
infringement, passing-off or unauthorised use of the Prudential Trademarks, or
any dispute as to the validity of the Prudential Trademarks, but shall have no
right to take any independent action. The Seller (or any other member of the
Seller's Group) may settle any dispute relating to the use of the Prudential
Trademarks without notice or compensation to the Purchaser or the Company and
shall retain the proceeds of any action. 

---|--- 

 

    

13.

Affiliates own and have always owned the Prudential Trademarks and associated

Prudential Trademarks, any part thereof or any allusion thereto, transfer
ownership and/or control of any such internet domain names to the Seller or to
