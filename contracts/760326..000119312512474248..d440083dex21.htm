(i) Each share of OUTD Common Stock with respect to which an election to
receive cash has been made and not revoked prior to the Election Deadline
(each such share, a " _Cash Election Share_ ") will be converted into the
right to receive $8.00 in cash, without interest (the " _OUTD Cash
Consideration_ ").

 



5 (ii) Each share of OUTD Common Stock with respect to which an election
to receive stock has been made and not revoked prior to the Election Deadline
(each such share, a " _Stock Election Share_ ") will be converted into the
right to receive that portion of a share of Parent Common Stock equal to the
OUTD Exchange Ratio (together with any fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock to be paid in accordance with Section 2.11, the " _OUTD Stock
Consideration_ ").

 

(iii) Each share of OUTD Common Stock with respect to which an election to
receive mixed stock and cash has been made and not revoked prior to the
Election Deadline (each such share, a " _Mixed Election Share_ ") or for which
no election to receive cash or stock has been made prior to the Election
Deadline (each such share, a " _No Election Share_ ") will, in each case, be
converted into the right to receive (which shall hereinafter be referred to as
the " _OUTD Mixed Consideration_ ") (A) $4.46 in cash, without interest (the "
_OUTD Mixed Consideration Cash_ "), and (B) that portion of a share of Parent
Common Stock equal to 0.443 (together with any fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock to be paid in accordance with Section 2.11, the " _OUTD Mixed
Consideration Stock_ ").

From and after the Effective Time, the OUTD Common Stock converted into the
OUTD Merger Consideration pursuant to this Section 2.1(a) will no longer
remain outstanding and will automatically be cancelled and will cease to
exist, and each holder of a certificate previously representing any such OUTD
Common Stock or shares of OUTD Common Stock that are in non-certificated
book-entry form (either case being referred to in this Agreement, to the
extent applicable, as an " _OUTD Certificate_ ") will thereafter cease to have
any rights with respect to such OUTD Common Stock except the right to receive
the OUTD Merger Consideration.

(b) _Cancellation of Certain Shares of OUTD Common Stock_. Each share of
OUTD Common Stock held by OUTD as treasury stock, each share of OUTD Common
Stock held by any direct or indirect Subsidiary of OUTD, and each share of
OUTD Common Stock owned by Parent, IM, either Merger Subsidiary or any direct
or indirect Subsidiary thereof, in each case as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time, automatically shall be cancelled and cease to exist without
any conversion thereof, and no consideration shall be paid with respect
thereto.

 

(c) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if and to
the extent required by the DGCL, shares of OUTD Common Stock which are issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by
holders of such shares of OUTD Common Stock who have properly exercised
appraisal rights with respect thereto (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL, will not be converted into the right
to receive the OUTD Merger Consideration, and holders of such Dissenting
Shares will be entitled to receive in lieu of the OUTD Merger Consideration
payment of the appraised value of such Dissenting Shares determined in
accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL unless and until
such holders fail to perfect or effectively withdraw or otherwise lose their
rights to appraisal and payment under the DGCL. If, after the Effective Time,
any such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses such right,
such Dissenting Shares will thereupon be treated as if they had been 

 



6  converted into and to have become exchangeable for, at the Effective Time,
the right to receive the OUTD Cash Consideration payable in respect of Cash
Election Shares, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Section 2.1(c), if this Agreement is terminated
prior to the Effective Time, then the right of any stockholder to be paid the
fair value of such stockholders Dissenting Shares pursuant to Section 262 of
the DGCL will cease. OUTD will give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written
demands received by OUTD for appraisal of Dissenting Shares, withdrawals of
such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL which are
received by OUTD relating to such holders rights of appraisal, and (ii) the
opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands
for appraisal under the DGCL. OUTD will not, except with the prior written
consent of Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
make any payment with respect to any demand for appraisal or offer to settle
or settle any such demands, and Parent will not commit to make any
such payment or enter into any such settlement prior to the Effective Time
without the prior written consent of OUTD.

(d) If after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time, OUTD pays a
stock dividend in, splits, combines into a smaller number of shares, or issues
by reclassification any shares of OUTD Common Stock, then the OUTD Merger
Consideration, the OUTD Stock Consideration, the OUTD Cash Consideration, the
OUTD Mixed Consideration, the OUTD Exchange Ratio and any other similarly
dependent items, as the case may be, will be appropriately adjusted to provide
to the holders of the OUTD Common Stock the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action, and as so adjusted will,
from and after the date of such event, be the OUTD Merger Consideration, the
OUTD Stock Consideration, the OUTD Cash Consideration, the OUTD
Mixed Consideration, the OUTD Exchange Ratio or other dependent item, as
applicable, subject to further adjustment in accordance with this provision.

Section 2.2 _Proration_.

(a) If the sum of (A) the product of the aggregate number of Cash Election
Shares and the OUTD Cash Consideration (such product being the " _OUTD Elected
Cash Consideration_ ") and (B) the Aggregate OUTD Mixed Consideration Cash
exceeds the Available Cash Amount, then: 

(i) all Stock Election Shares will be converted into the right to receive the
OUTD Stock Consideration; 

(ii) all Mixed Election Shares and all No Election Shares will be converted
into the right to receive the OUTD Mixed Consideration; and

(iii) a portion of the Cash Election Shares of each holder of OUTD Common
Stock will be converted into the right to receive the OUTD Cash
Consideration, with such portion being equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (A) the number of such holders Cash Election Shares by (B) a
fraction, the numerator of which will be (1) the Available Cash Amount _less_
(2) the Aggregate OUTD Mixed Consideration Cash, and the denominator of which
will be the OUTD

 



7  Elected Cash Consideration, with the remaining portion of such holders Cash
Election Shares being converted into the right to receive the OUTD Stock
Consideration.

 

(b) If the sum of (A) the OUTD Elected Cash Consideration and (B) the
Aggregate OUTD Mixed Consideration Cash is less than the Available Cash
Amount (such difference being the " _Shortfall Number_ "), then:

(i) all Cash Election Shares will be converted into the right to receive the
OUTD Cash Consideration;

(ii) all Mixed Election Shares and all No Election Shares will be converted
into the right to receive the OUTD Mixed Consideration; and

(iii) a portion of the Stock Election Shares of each holder of OUTD Common
Stock (if any) will be converted into the right to receive the OUTD Cash
Consideration, with such portion being equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (x) the number of Stock Election Shares of such holder by (y) a
fraction, the numerator of which is the Shortfall Number and the denominator
of which is the product obtained by multiplying the aggregate number of Stock
Election Shares by $8.00, with the remaining portion of such holders Stock
Election Shares being converted into the right to receive the OUTD Stock
Consideration.

 

(c) In the event that (i) a holder of OUTD Common Stock has made an election
to receive cash for 55.74% of such holders aggregate outstanding shares
(rounded to the nearest whole share) and has made an election to receive stock
for 44.26% of such holders aggregate shares (rounded to the nearest whole
share), and (ii) indicates its intent on the Election Form to receive the
equivalent of Mixed Consideration for all of such holders shares, such
holders shares will not be subject to Sections 2.2(a)(iii) or 2.2(b)(iii).

 

Section 2.3 _Elections_.

(a) Concurrently with the mailing of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to OUTD
stockholders (the " _Mailing Date_ "), an election form in such form as Parent
will have specified prior to the Mailing Date and which is reasonably
acceptable to OUTD (the " _Election Form_ ") will be mailed to each holder of
record of shares of OUTD Common Stock (including shares underlying OUTD Equity
Awards that become vested or settled on the Closing Date) as of the record
date for the OUTD Stockholders Meeting.

(b) Each Election Form will permit the holder (or the beneficial owner
through customary documentation and instructions) to specify (i) the number of
shares of such holders OUTD Common Stock with respect to which such holder
elects to receive the OUTD Stock Consideration, (ii) the number of shares of
such holders OUTD Common Stock with respect to which such holder elects to
receive the OUTD Cash Consideration or (iii) the number of shares of such
holders OUTD Common Stock with respect to which such holder elects to
receive the OUTD Mixed Consideration. In addition, if such holder holds
multiple blocks of OUTD Common Stock, the Election Form will permit such
holder to designate (i) the shares with respect to which each election
is made, (ii) if the same election

 



8  is made with respect to shares in more than one block, the order of priority
of shares to which the election is to be effective in the event of proration
and (iii) if no election is made, the order of priority of shares to be
exchanged for cash. Any OUTD Common Stock with respect to which the Exchange
Agent does not receive a properly completed Election Form during the period
(the " _Election Period_ ") from the Mailing Date to 5:00 p.m., New York
time, on the 10th day preceding the date of the OUTD Stockholders Meeting or
such other date as Parent and OUTD will, prior to the Closing, mutually agree
(the " _Election Deadline_ ") will be deemed to be No Election Shares. In
order to be effective, an Election Form must be accompanied by a letter of
transmittal (which will specify that the delivery will be effected, and risk
of loss and title will pass, only upon proper delivery of the OUTD
Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the
Exchange Agent) in such form as Parent and OUTD may reasonably agree together
with the related OUTD Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof).

 

(c) Any election made pursuant to this Section 2.3 will have been properly
made only if the Exchange Agent will have actually received a properly
completed Election Form during the Election Period. Any Election Form may be
revoked or changed by the person submitting it, by written notice received by
the Exchange Agent during the Election Period. In the event an Election Form
is revoked during the Election Period, the shares of OUTD Common Stock
represented by such Election Form will be deemed to be No Election Shares,
except to the extent a subsequent election is properly made during the
Election Period. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and of the Election
Form, the Exchange Agent will have reasonable discretion to determine whether
any election, revocation or change has been properly or timely made and to
disregard immaterial defects in the Election Forms, and any good faith
decisions of the Exchange Agent regarding such matters will be binding and
conclusive. None of Parent or OUTD or the Exchange Agent will be under any
obligation to notify any Person of any defect in an Election Form. 

(d) Parent shall make available one or more Election Forms as may reasonably
be requested from time to time by all Persons who become holders (or
beneficial owners) of OUTD Common Stock between the record date for the OUTD
Stockholders Meeting and the close of business on the Business Day prior to
the Election Deadline, and the Company shall provide to the Exchange Agent
all information reasonably necessary for it to perform as specified herein.

Section 2.4 _Surrender and Payment_.

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent will appoint an exchange agent
reasonably acceptable to OUTD (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the purpose of
exchanging OUTD Certificates for OUTD Merger Consideration. As soon as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event more than two
Business Days following the Effective Time, Parent will send, or will cause
the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of record of No Election Shares as
of the Effective Time, whose shares of OUTD Common Stock were converted into
the right to receive the OUTD Merger Consideration, a letter of transmittal
(which will specify that the delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and
title will pass, only upon proper delivery of the OUTD Certificates (or
effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Exchange Agent) in such
form as Parent and OUTD may reasonably agree, including

 



9  instructions for use in effecting the surrender of OUTD Certificates (or
effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Exchange Agent in
exchange for the OUTD Merger Consideration. 

(b) At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent will cause to be deposited with
the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of the holders of shares of OUTD
Common Stock, shares of Parent Common Stock and an amount of cash sufficient
to be issued and paid in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.11
and pursuant to Section 2.1 and Section 2.2, payable upon due surrender of
the OUTD Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof)
pursuant to the provisions of this Article II. Following the Effective Time,
Parent will make available to the Exchange Agent, when and as needed, cash
sufficient to pay any dividends and other distributions pursuant to Section
2.4(g). All cash and book-entry shares representing shares of Parent Common
Stock deposited with the Exchange Agent are referred to in this Agreement
as the " _Exchange Fund_." The Exchange Agent will, pursuant to irrevocable
instructions, deliver the appropriate OUTD Merger Consideration out of the
Exchange Fund. The Exchange Fund will not be used for any other purpose. The
Exchange Agent will invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed
by Parent; _provided_ , that no such investment or losses thereon will affect
the OUTD Merger Consideration payable to holders of shares of OUTD Common
Stock entitled to receive such consideration or cash in lieu of fractional
interests and Parent will promptly cause to be provided additional funds to
the Exchange Agent for the benefit of holders of shares of OUTD Common Stock
entitled to receive such consideration in the amount of any such losses. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investments will be the property
of, and paid to, Parent.

(c) Each holder of shares of OUTD Common Stock that have been converted into
the right to receive the OUTD Merger Consideration, upon surrender to the
Exchange Agent of an OUTD Certificate (or effective affidavits of loss in
lieu thereof), together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, duly
executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such
other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, will be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor (i) the number of shares of Parent
Common Stock representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares of
Parent Common Stock, if any, that such holder has the right to receive
and/or (ii) a check in the amount, if any, that such holder has the right to
receive in cash, including cash payable in lieu of fractional shares payable
pursuant to Section 2.11 and any dividends and other distributions payable
pursuant to Section 2.4(g), pursuant to Section 2.1, Section 2.2 and this
Article II. The OUTD Merger Consideration will be paid as promptly as
practicable (by mail or, to the extent commercially practicable, made
available for collection by hand if so elected by the surrendering holder of
an OUTD Certificate) after receipt by the Exchange Agent of the OUTD
Certificate and letter of transmittal in accordance with the foregoing, and in
any event no later than three Business Days following the later to occur of
(i) the Effective Time, and (ii) the Exchange Agents receipt of the OUTD
Certificate and letter of transmittal in accordance with the foregoing. No
interest will be paid or accrued on any OUTD Merger Consideration, cash in
lieu of fractional shares or on any unpaid dividends and distributions payable
to holders of OUTD Certificates.

 



10 (d) If any cash payment is to be made to a Person other than the Person in
whose name the applicable surrendered OUTD Certificate is registered, it will
be a condition of such payment that the Person requesting such payment will
pay any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the making of
such cash payment to a Person other than the registered holder of the
surrendered OUTD Certificate or will establish to the satisfaction of the
Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable. If any portion
of the OUTD Merger Consideration is to be registered in the name of a Person
other than the Person in whose name the applicable surrendered OUTD
Certificate is registered, it will be a condition to the registration thereof
that the surrendered OUTD Certificate will be properly endorsed or otherwise
be in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such delivery
of the OUTD Merger Consideration will pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer
or other similar Taxes required as a result of such registration in the name
of a Person other than the registered holder of such OUTD Certificate or
establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been
paid or is not payable.

(e) After the Effective Time, there will be no further registration of
transfers of shares of OUTD Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time,
the holders of OUTD Certificates representing shares of OUTD Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will cease to have any
rights with respect to such shares of OUTD Common Stock except as otherwise
provided in this Agreement or by applicable Law. If, after the Effective
Time, OUTD Certificates are presented to the Exchange Agent or Parent, they
will be cancelled and exchanged for the consideration provided for, and in
accordance with the procedures set forth in this Article II. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the OUTD Surviving
Corporation is obligated to pay any dividends or make any other distributions
with a record date prior to the Effective Time which may have been declared or
made by OUTD on shares of OUTD Common Stock in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement prior to the date hereof and which remain unpaid at the
Effective Time.

(f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders of
shares of OUTD Common Stock one year after the Effective Time will be returned
to Parent, upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged his or her
shares of OUTD Common Stock for the OUTD Merger Consideration in accordance
with this Article II prior to that time will thereafter look only to Parent
for delivery of the OUTD Merger Consideration in respect of such holders
shares of OUTD Common Stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent,
IM, IM Merger Sub, OUTD Merger Sub, the OUTD Surviving Corporation or OUTD
will be liable to any holder of shares of OUTD Common Stock for any OUTD
Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned property Laws. Any OUTD Merger Consideration remaining unclaimed by
holders of shares of OUTD Common Stock immediately prior to such time as such
amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental
Authority will, to the extent permitted by applicable Laws, become the
property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

 

(g) No dividends or other distributions with respect to shares of Parent
Common Stock issued in the OUTD Merger will be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered OUTD Certificates until such OUTD Certificates are surrendered
as provided in this

 



11  Section 2.4. Following such surrender, subject to the effect of escheat, Tax
or other applicable Laws, there will be paid, without interest, to the record
holder of the shares of Parent Common Stock, if any, issued in exchange
therefor (i) at the time of such surrender, all dividends and other
distributions payable in respect of any such shares of Parent Common Stock
with a record date after the Effective Time and a payment date on or prior to
the date of such surrender and not previously paid and (ii) at the appropriate
payment date, the dividends or other distributions payable with respect to
such shares of Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective
Time but with a payment date subsequent to such surrender. For purposes of
dividends or other distributions with respect to shares of Parent Common
Stock, all shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the OUTD
Merger will be entitled to dividends pursuant to the immediately preceding
sentence as if issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time.

 

(h) Parent and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from any consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Person who
was a holder of OUTD Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time such
amounts as Parent or the Exchange Agent is required to deduct and withhold
with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any other
provision of federal, state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld (and paid to the applicable Governmental Authority) by
Parent or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such
consideration would otherwise have been paid.

(i) In the event any OUTD Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed OUTD Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the holder thereof, such OUTD Merger Consideration as may be required
pursuant to Section 2.1 and Section 2.2, cash for fractional shares pursuant
to Section 2.11 and any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section
2.4(g); _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may, in its discretion and as a
condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost,
stolen or destroyed OUTD Certificates to deliver an agreement of
indemnification in form reasonably satisfactory to Parent, or, if reasonably
required by Parent, a bond in such reasonable sum as Parent may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent or the Exchange
Agent in respect of OUTD Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen
or destroyed.

Section 2.5 _OUTD Equity Awards_.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the OUTD Board (or, if appropriate, any
committee administering the OUTD Incentive Plan) shall adopt such resolutions
or take such other actions as may be required to effect the following:

(i) adjust the terms of all options to purchase OUTD Common Stock (the "
_OUTD Stock Options_ ") outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
granted under any equity or equity-based compensation plan or arrangement of
OUTD (each, an " _OUTD Incentive Plan_ "), whether vested or unvested, as
necessary to provide that, at the Effective Time, each OUTD Stock Option
outstanding

 



12  immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be assumed and converted into
an option to acquire shares of Parent Common Stock, on the same terms and
conditions as were applicable under such OUTD Stock Option, including vesting
(taking into account any acceleration of vesting that may occur as a result of
the Transaction) (each, as so adjusted, an " _OUTD Assumed Stock Option_ "),
except that (A) each such OUTD Assumed Stock Option shall represent the right
to acquire that whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock (rounded down to
the next whole share) equal to the number of Shares of OUTD Common Stock
subject to the related OUTD Stock Option multiplied by the OUTD Exchange
Ratio and (B) the option price per share of Parent Common Stock under each
OUTD Assumed Stock Option shall be an amount equal to the option price per
share of OUTD Common Stock subject to the related OUTD Stock Option in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by the OUTD Exchange
Ratio (the option price per share, as so determined, being rounded up to the
next whole cent); and

 

(ii) provide that each equity award (other than an OUTD Stock Option)
entitling the holder thereof to acquire OUTD Common Stock pursuant to the
OUTD Incentive Plan (a " _OUTD Equity Award_ ") shall be converted into an
equity award entitling the holder thereof to receive shares of Parent Common
Stock (a " _OUTD Assumed Equity Award_ "), on the same terms and conditions
as were applicable to such OUTD Equity Award, including vesting (taking into
account any acceleration of vesting that may occur as a result of the
Transaction) except that each OUTD Assumed Equity Award shall represent
the right to acquire that whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock
(rounded down to the next whole share) equal to the number of shares of OUTD
Common Stock subject to an OUTD Equity Award multiplied by the OUTD Exchange
Ratio.

 

(b) Except to the extent required under the respective terms of the OUTD
Equity Awards, all restrictions or limitations on transfer and vesting with
respect to the OUTD Equity Awards awarded under the OUTD Incentive Plan, to
the extent that such restrictions or limitations shall not have already
lapsed, shall remain in full force and effect with respect to such OUTD Equity
Awards after giving effect to the Transaction and the assumption by Parent as
set forth above.

(c) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the OUTD Merger, the OUTD Incentive
Plan shall be assumed by Parent, with the result that all obligations of OUTD
under the OUTD Incentive Plan, including with respect to awards outstanding at
the Effective Time thereunder, shall be obligations of Parent following the
Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall take all necessary
actions for the assumption of the OUTD Incentive Plan, including the
reservation, issuance and listing of Parent Common Stock in a number at
least equal to the number of shares of Parent Common Stock that will be
subject to OUTD Assumed Equity Awards. As soon as practicable following the
Effective Time, but in no event later than two Business Days, Parent shall, in
accordance with applicable federal securities Laws, prepare and file with the
SEC a registration statement on Form S-8 (or another appropriate form selected
by Parent) registering a number of shares of Parent Common Stock determined in
accordance with the preceding sentence. Such registration statement shall be
kept effective (and the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses

 



13  required thereby shall be maintained) at least for so long as OUTD Assumed
Equity Awards remain outstanding.

Section 2.6 _OUTD Merger Sub Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, each share
of capital stock of OUTD Merger Sub held by Borrower immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be cancelled and extinguished and converted into one
validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock of the
OUTD Surviving Corporation.

Section 2.7 _Effect on IM Units_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the IM Merger and
without any action on the part of Parent, IM Merger Sub, IM or the holders of
any equity interests of IM:

(a) _Conversion of IM Units_.

 

(i) The Class A Common Units and Class E Common Units of IM issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than any Class A
Common Units or Class E Common Units of IM to be cancelled pursuant to Section
2.7(b), shall be automatically converted into the right to receive 23,854,227
shares of Parent Common Stock (in the aggregate, and together with any cash
in respect of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock payable in
accordance with Section 2.11, the " _IM Merger Consideration_ ") to be
allocated among the holders of Class A Common Units and Class E Common Units
of IM issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time in
accordance with each such holders pro rata percentage set forth on _Exhibit
I_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the parties acknowledge
and agree that IM and its Affiliates shall revise _Exhibit I_ , if necessary,
two Business Days prior to the Closing, to provide for the distribution of the
IM Merger Consideration in accordance with the IM LLC Agreement.

 

(ii) As a result of the IM Merger, at the Effective Time, each holder of Class
A Common Units and Class E Common Units of IM shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the right to receive the applicable IM Merger
Consideration payable in respect of the Class A Common Units or Class E Common
Units of IM, as applicable.

 

(b) _Cancellation of Certain Equity Interests of IM_. Any outstanding Class A
Common Units or Class E Common Units of IM held by any direct or indirect
Subsidiary of IM, Parent, OUTD, IM Merger Sub or any direct or indirect
Subsidiary of Parent, OUTD or IM Merger Sub, in each case as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time, automatically shall be cancelled and cease
to exist without any conversion thereof, and no consideration shall be paid
with respect thereto.

(c) Adjustments to IM Merger Consideration. The IM Merger Consideration shall
be adjusted to reflect fully the appropriate effect of any stock split,
reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of
securities convertible into Parent Common Stock, OUTD Common Stock or any
equity interests of

 



14  IM), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or other similar
change with respect to Parent Common Stock, OUTD Common Stock or any equity
interests of IM having a record date on or after the date hereof and prior to
the Effective Time.

Section 2.8 _Payment of IM Merger Consideration_. 

(a) At the Effective Time, Parent shall issue to each holder of IM Units that
have been converted into the right to receive the IM Merger Consideration the
number of shares of Parent Common Stock representing, in the aggregate, the
whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock, if any, that such holder has
the right to receive in accordance with each such holders pro rata
percentage set forth on _Exhibit I_ together with any fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock to be paid in accordance with Section 2.11. No interest
will be paid or accrued on any IM Merger Consideration payable to holders of
IM Units.

(b) After the Effective Time, there will be no further registration of
transfers of IM Units. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of IM
Units outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will cease to have
any rights with respect to such IM Units except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement or by applicable Law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, the IM Surviving LLC is obligated to pay any
dividends or make any other distributions with a record date prior to the
Effective Time which may have been declared or made by IM on IM Units in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement prior to the date hereof and
which remain unpaid at the Effective Time.

(c) Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Person who was a holder of IM Units
immediately prior to the Effective Time such amounts as Parent is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code
or any other provision of federal, state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld (and paid to the applicable Governmental
Authority) by Parent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such consideration
would otherwise have been paid.

Section 2.9 _IM Class E Common Units_. Prior to the Effective Time, IM shall
take all actions necessary for the distribution to be made of the IM Merger
Consideration to the holders of the Class E Common Units in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement, including without limitation, delivery to the
holders of the Class E Common Units of IM appropriate notices setting forth
such holders rights pursuant to any equity or equity-based compensation plan
or arrangement of IM and obtaining any required consents.

Section 2.10 _IM Merger Equity Interests_. Each equity interest of IM Merger
Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, at
the Effective Time, be cancelled and extinguished and converted into one
validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable equity interest of the IM
Surviving LLC.

Section 2.11 _No Fractional Shares_. No certificates or scrip
representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon
the conversion of OUTD

 



15  Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.1 or Section 2.2 or upon the conversion
of IM Units pursuant to Section 2.7, and such fractional share interests shall
not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a holder of Parent
Common Stock. All fractional shares to which a single record holder of OUTD
Common Stock, on the one hand, or IM Units, on the other hand, would be
otherwise entitled shall be aggregated and calculations shall be rounded to
three decimal places. In lieu of any such fractional shares, each holder of
OUTD Common Stock and/or IM Units who would otherwise be entitled to such
fractional shares shall be entitled to an amount in cash, without interest,
rounded down to the nearest cent, equal to the product of (A) the amount of
the fractional share interest in a share of Parent Common Stock to which such
holder is entitled and (B) an amount equal to the closing sale price of

26 Section 3.10 _Intellectual Property_.

 

(a) All Intellectual Property used or held for use in, or necessary to
conduct, the operation of the business of OUTD or any of its Subsidiaries
(the " _OUTD Intellectual Property_ ") is either owned by OUTD or one or more
of its Subsidiaries (the " _Owned OUTD Intellectual Property_ ") or is
licensed to OUTD or one or more of its Subsidiaries pursuant to a valid and
written license Contract applicable to the period of OUTDs use thereof (the "
_Licensed OUTD Intellectual Property_ ").

(b) Section 3.10(b) of the OUTD Disclosure Schedule sets forth a complete and
accurate list of all Owned OUTD Intellectual Property that is the subject of a
registration or pending application for registration and lists, in each case,
the owner, the jurisdiction and the application or registration number thereof
(collectively, " _OUTD Registered Intellectual Property_ "). OUTD or one of
its Subsidiaries is the sole, exclusive and record owner of all Owned OUTD
Intellectual Property free and clear of all Liens other than Permitted Liens.
All material registrations for Registered Intellectual Property are
subsisting, in full force and effect, and have not been cancelled, expired or
abandoned and all application, registration, renewal and maintenance fees in
relation thereto have been paid.

(c) Section 3.10(c)(1) of the OUTD Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and
complete list of all material Contracts (i) pursuant to which OUTD or any of
its Subsidiaries are currently using any Licensed OUTD Intellectual Property
(other than Time-Buy Agreements) or (ii) pursuant to which OUTD or any of its
Subsidiaries has granted to a third party any current right in or to any OUTD
Intellectual Property (collectively, the " _OUTD IP Licenses_ "). Prior to the
date hereof, IM either has been supplied with, or has been given access to, a
true and complete copy of each material written OUTD IP License, together with
all amendments, supplements, waivers or other changes thereto. Each OUTD IP
License is a legal, valid and binding obligation of OUTD or its Subsidiaries,
as applicable, to the knowledge of OUTD is in full force and effect and is
enforceable against OUTD or its Subsidiaries, as applicable, and, to the
knowledge of OUTD, the other parties thereto. None of OUTD and its
Subsidiaries is in material breach or violation of or default under any OUTD
IP License and no event has occurred that, with notice or lapse of time or
both, would constitute such a material breach, violation or default by OUTD
or any of its Subsidiaries or, to the knowledge of OUTD, the other parties
thereto. Except as set forth on Section 3.10(b)(2) of the OUTD Disclosure
Schedule, no licensor of Licensed OUTD Intellectual Property (x) has canceled
or otherwise terminated, threatened to cancel or otherwise terminate or, to
the knowledge of OUTD, intends to cancel or otherwise terminate, such license
or (y) has materially decreased or limited, threatened to materially decrease
or limit or, to the knowledge of OUTD, intends to materially decrease or
limit such license. Upon the Closing, OUTD and its applicable Subsidiaries
will continue to have the right to use all Licensed OUTD Intellectual Property
on identical terms and conditions as OUTD and its Subsidiaries enjoyed
immediately prior to the Closing.

(d) There is no pending or, to the knowledge of OUTD, threatened Action or
other adversarial proceeding before any court, agency, arbitral tribunal or
registration authority in any jurisdiction challenging the ownership,
validity, enforceability or registrability of any material Owned OUTD
Intellectual Property, and neither OUTD nor any

 



27  of its Subsidiaries has brought or threatened any claims, suits,
arbitrations or other adversarial proceedings against any third party alleging
misappropriation, infringement, dilution or violation of any material Owned
OUTD Intellectual Property.

(e) To the knowledge of OUTD, (i) the conduct of OUTDs and its Subsidiaries
businesses as currently conducted does not infringe upon any material
Intellectual Property rights owned or controlled by any third party, and (ii)
no third party is misappropriating, infringing, diluting or violating any
Owned OUTD Intellectual Property.

(f) The OUTD Intellectual Property is sufficient for OUTD to carry on its
business from and after the Closing Date in all material respects as
presently carried on by OUTD and its Subsidiaries, consistent with past
practice. The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
will not result in the loss or impairment of or payment of any additional
amounts with respect to, nor require the consent of any other Person in
respect of, OUTDs right to own, use, or hold for use any of the OUTD
Intellectual Property.

 

(g) OUTD and each of its Subsidiaries takes reasonable measures to protect the
confidentiality of material Trade Secrets used in the operation of its
respective business. Except as, individually or in the aggregate, would not
and would not reasonably be expected to be material to OUTD and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (i) no such Trade Secrets have been disclosed
or authorized to be disclosed to any third party other than pursuant to a
written non-disclosure agreement and (ii) no party to any non-disclosure
agreement relating to such Trade Secrets is in breach or default thereof.

 

(h) Except as, individually or in the aggregate, would not and would not
reasonably be expected to be material to OUTD and its Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole, each employee, independent contractor and consultant who has
developed material Intellectual Property on behalf of OUTD or any of its
Subsidiaries has done so either as an employee within the scope of his, her or
its employment or as an independent contractor pursuant to a written "work
made for hire" or assignment agreement that conveys to either OUTD or its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, any and all right, title and interest of such
employee, independent contractor or consultant in and to such Intellectual
Property.

(i) Except as, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to result in an OUTD Material Adverse Effect, neither
OUTD nor any of its Subsidiaries has experienced any defects in the material
Software used in their respective businesses as currently conducted that have
not been substantially resolved, including any error or omission in the
processing of any data. OUTD and its Subsidiaries have in place disaster
recovery and business continuity plans and procedures, substantially
consistent with industry practice for businesses of a type and size
comparable to OUTD and its Subsidiaries.

(j) OUTD and its Subsidiaries have a privacy policy (the " _Privacy Policy_
") regarding the collection and use of personally identifiable information ("
_Personal Information_ "), a true, correct and complete copy of which has been
provided to IM prior to the date hereof. OUTD and each of its Subsidiaries is
in material compliance with all

 



28  applicable Laws regarding the collection, use and protection of Personal
Information and with OUTDs and its Subsidiaries Privacy Policy. Except as,
individually or in the aggregate, would not and would not reasonably be
expected to result in a material liability to OUTD and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, OUTD and its Subsidiaries have taken reasonable measures to ensure
that all Personal Information gathered in the course of their respective
businesses is protected against loss and against unauthorized access, use,
disclosure or other misuse. Upon the Closing, OUTD or its Subsidiaries will
own all such Personal Information and continue to have the right to use
such Personal Information on identical terms and conditions as OUTD or its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, enjoyed immediately prior to the Closing.

correct and complete copy of each lease for OUTD Leased Property, together
with any amendments or modifications thereto (individually, a " _OUTD Real
Property Lease_ ") for each OUTD Leased Property has been made available to
IM. With respect to each OUTD Real Property Lease, (i) each lease is valid,
binding and in full force and effect and enforceable in accordance with its
terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium or other Laws relating to or affecting the rights and remedies of
creditors generally and subject to general principles of equity (regardless
of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at Law), (ii) neither OUTD
nor any of its Subsidiaries or, to the

 



29  knowledge of OUTD, any other party to such OUTD Real Property Lease is in

constitute a breach or default, or permit the termination, modification or
acceleration of rent thereunder, and (iii) neither OUTD nor any of its
Subsidiaries is currently subleasing, licensing or otherwise granting any

any termination of employment on or following the Effective Time) will (i)
entitle any current or former director, officer, employee or
independent contractor of OUTD or any OUTD Subsidiary to any material
compensation or benefit, (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or
trigger any payment or funding, of any material compensation or benefits or

amount or other entitlement that could be received as a result of the
Transaction (alone or in conjunction with any other event) by any
"disqualified individual" (as defined in Section 280G(c) of the Code) with

more of the voting securities of OUTD or (c) any Affiliate of OUTD or, to the
knowledge of OUTD, any Affiliate of any such officer, director or record or

accuracy of OUTDs representations and warranties with respect to OUTD and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in this Agreement and any of the Ancillary
Agreements to which it is a party, (i) no event has occurred which would

such Person will, as of such date, exceed (i) the value of all "liabilities of
such Person, including contingent and other liabilities," as of such date, as

governing determinations of the insolvency of debtors, and (ii) the amount
that will be required to pay the probable liabilities of such Person on its
existing debts (including contingent and other liabilities) as such
debts become absolute and mature, (b) such Person will not have, as of such

59 ARTICLE VI

 

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

Section 6.1 _No Solicitation_.

(a) Subject to Section 6.1(b), Section 6.1(c) and Section 6.1(d) during the
period from the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time
and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article VIII, OUTD
shall not, and shall not permit its Subsidiaries to, and shall not permit its
Representatives to, directly or indirectly: (i) initiate, knowingly encourage,
knowingly facilitate or solicit (including in each case by way of furnishing
non-public information of OUTD or any of its Subsidiaries to any Person) any
inquiries with respect to, or the making, submission, announcement or
implementation of, any proposal or offer (written or oral) that constitutes,
or would reasonably be expected to lead to, an Alternative Proposal, (ii)
initiate, knowingly encourage, participate in or solicit any discussions or
negotiations with any Person (whether such discussions or negotiations are
initiated by OUTD, any of its Representatives or a third party), other than
IM or any of its Representatives, regarding or in furtherance of such
inquiries or relating to an Alternative Proposal, (iii) provide any non-public
information, documentation or data of OUTD or any of its Subsidiaries to any
Person, other than IM or any of its Representatives, relating to an
Alternative Proposal, (iv) otherwise cooperate with any effort or attempt to
make, implement or accept any Alternative Proposal, (v) adopt or approve any
Alternative Proposal, or propose the approval or adoption of any Alternative
Proposal, or resolve or agree to take any such action or (vi) enter into any
letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle,
acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option agreement, joint venture
agreement, partnership agreement or other agreement constituting or related
to, or which is intended to or is reasonably likely to lead to any Alternative
Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement as set forth in
the provisions of Section 6.1(c)). OUTD shall immediately cease, and cause its
Subsidiaries and direct its Representatives to terminate, any cooperation with
or assistance or participation in any inquiries or proposals of any
Persons made prior to the date hereof, and any discussions or negotiations
with any Persons conducted theretofore by OUTD, its Subsidiaries or any of its
Representatives, in each case, with respect to any Alternative Proposal, and
request and instruct to be returned or destroyed all non-public information
provided by or on behalf of OUTD or any of its Subsidiaries to such Person
relating to an Alternative Proposal.

(b) From and after the date of this Agreement, OUTD shall advise IM orally and
in writing of (i) the receipt by OUTD or any of its Subsidiaries, or any of
its or their respective Representatives, of any _bona fide_ inquiries,
proposals or offers, requests for information or requests for discussions or
negotiations regarding any Alternative Proposal, specifying the material terms
and conditions thereof and the identity of the party making the Alternative
Proposal, and (ii) any material modifications to the financial or other
material terms and conditions of such Alternative Proposal, in each case as
promptly as practical (and in any event within 24 hours) of OUTDs
receipt thereof. OUTD shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to,
enter into any confidentiality agreement with any person subsequent to the
date of this Agreement which prohibits OUTD from providing such information to
IM 

 



60  and shall otherwise keep IM reasonably informed of the status of any
discussions or negotiations.

(c) If at any time following the date of this Agreement and prior to obtaining
the OUTD Stockholder Approval (i) OUTD has received a written Alternative
Proposal from a third party that the OUTD Board believes in good faith to be
_bona fide_ , (ii) such Alternative Proposal did not result from a breach of
this Section 6.1 and (iii) the OUTD Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that such
Alternative Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to result in
a Superior Proposal, then OUTD may (A) furnish information with respect to
OUTD and its Subsidiaries to the Person making such Alternative Proposal and
(B) engage and participate in discussions or negotiations with the Person
making such Alternative Proposal regarding such Alternative Proposal;
_provided_ , that OUTD (x) will not, and will not permit its Subsidiaries to,
and will not permit its Representatives to, disclose any non-public
information to such Person without first entering or having entered into an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with such Person and (y) will promptly
(and in any event within 24 hours) provide to IM any non-public information
concerning OUTD or its Subsidiaries provided or made available to such other
Person which was not previously made available to IM.

 

(d) (i) If a material event, fact, change, development or set of
circumstances, in each case, that relates to OUTD, IM or the transactions
contemplated hereby, but does not relate to any Alternative Proposal and which
first becomes known to the OUTD Board after the date hereof (or if known, the
magnitude or material consequences of which were not known or understood by
the OUTD Board as of the date hereof) and prior to obtaining the OUTD
Stockholder Approval (an " _Intervening Event_ ") or (ii) if OUTD receives an
Alternative Proposal which the OUTD Board concludes in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel and financial advisors, constitutes a
Superior Proposal after giving effect to all of the adjustments to the terms
of this Agreement which may be offered by IM in accordance with this Section
6.1(d), then, in each case, the OUTD Board may at any time prior to obtaining
the OUTD Stockholder Approval, if it determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, that not taking such action would be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the OUTD Board to the OUTD
stockholders under applicable Law (A) withdraw, modify or qualify, or propose
publicly to withdraw, modify or qualify, in a manner adverse to IM, the OUTD
Board Recommendation (a " _Board Recommendation Change_ ") or (B) only in the
case of clause (ii) of this Section 6.1(d), approve or recommend such Superior
Proposal and/or terminate this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement
with respect to such Superior Proposal pursuant to Section 8.1(e); _provided_
, _however_ , that OUTD shall not terminate this Agreement pursuant to the
foregoing clause (B), and any purported termination pursuant to the foregoing
clause (B) shall be void and of no force or effect, unless at or concurrently
with such termination OUTD pays the Termination Fee in full and otherwise
complies with the provisions of Section 8.3; and _provided_ , _further_ , that
the OUTD Board may not make a Board Recommendation Change pursuant to the
foregoing clause (A), approve or recommend any Superior Proposal or terminate
this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (B) (x) if, in the case of
clause (B), such Superior Proposal resulted from a breach by OUTD of this
Section 6.1 and (y) unless, in the case of clauses (A) and (B):

 



61 (i) the OUTD Board shall have first provided at least four (4) Business Days
prior written notice (a " _Notice_ ") to IM that it is prepared to take the
applicable action in response to an Intervening Event or a Superior Proposal,
as applicable, which notice shall (i) describe such Intervening Event
or Superior Proposal, as applicable, in reasonable detail, and (ii) in the
case of a Superior Proposal, be accompanied by the most current version of all
relevant written agreements or proposals relating to the transaction that
constitute such Superior Proposal (it being agreed that the Notice and any
amendment or update to such Notice and the determination to so deliver such
Notice, or update or amend public disclosures with respect thereto shall not
constitute a Board Recommendation Change for purposes of this Agreement); and

(ii) IM does not make, within such four-Business Day period, a binding,
written, irrevocable offer to modify the terms of this Agreement that would,
in the good faith judgment of the OUTD Board (after consultation with outside
legal counsel and financial advisors), cause the Alternative Proposal
previously constituting a Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a
Superior Proposal or that would obviate the need to make a Board
Recommendation Change in the event of an Intervening Event, as applicable, in
each case, taking into consideration any risk of non-consummation and all
legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of such proposal. OUTD agrees
that, during the four-Business Day period prior to its effecting a Board
Recommendation Change or taking another action permitted by clause (B), OUTD
and its Representatives shall negotiate in good faith with IM and its
Representatives regarding any revisions to the terms of the transactions
contemplated hereunder such that the Alternative Proposal in question no
longer constitutes a Superior Proposal or that would obviate the need to make
a Board Recommendation Change in the event of an Intervening Event. Each
successive modification to the price or any other material term of any
Alternative Proposal shall constitute a new Acquisition Proposal for purposes
of this Section 6.1(d) and shall require a new Notice under Section 6.1(d)(i),
if applicable; _provided_ , _that_ , the Notice period shall be shortened in
such case from four (4) Business Days to three (3) Business Days, and each
reference to four (4) Business Days or a four (4)-Business Day period in this
Section 6.1(d) shall be deemed to be three (3) Business Days or a three
(3)-Business Day period, as applicable.

(e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit OUTD or the OUTD Board
from (i) taking and disclosing to the OUTD stockholders a position
contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or
issuing a "stop, look and listen" disclosure or similar communication of the
type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act with respect to an
Alternative Proposal or (ii) making any disclosure to the stockholders of OUTD
(other than a Board Recommendation Change, which may be made only in
accordance with Section 6.1(d)) if OUTD determines in good faith, after
consultation with its legal counsel, that such disclosure is required under
applicable Law or required under the rules and regulations of any applicable
stock exchange (including The NASDAQ Stock Market); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that any disclosure of a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act other than a "stop, look and listen" or
similar communication of the type contemplated by

 



62  Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act or an express rejection of any
applicable Alternative Proposal together with an express reaffirmation of its
recommendation to its stockholders in favor of the Transaction and the OUTD
Merger shall be deemed to be a Board Recommendation Change.

(f) In the event that OUTD makes a Board Recommendation Change, it shall
promptly make a public announcement of such change and such announcement and
shall set forth the material reasons for such change.

Section 6.2 _Preparation of SEC Documents_. As promptly as practicable after
the execution of this Agreement, (a) Parent, IM and OUTD shall prepare and
file with the SEC the proxy statement/prospectus (as amended or supplemented
from time to time, the " _Proxy Statement/Prospectus_ ") to be sent to the
stockholders of OUTD relating to the meeting of OUTDs stockholders (the "
_OUTD Stockholders  Meeting_") to be held to consider the approval of the
OUTD Merger and (b) IM shall cause Parent to prepare and file with the SEC a
registration statement on Form S-4 or such other applicable form as OUTD and
IM may agree (as amended or supplemented from time to time, the "
_Registration Statement_ "), in which the Proxy Statement/Prospectus will be
included as a prospectus, in connection with the registration under the
Securities Act of the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the OUTD
Merger. Each party shall use its reasonable best efforts to have the
Registration Statement declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly
as practicable after such filing, and, prior to the effective date of the
Registration Statement, IM shall cause Parent to take all action reasonably
required (other than qualifying to do business in any jurisdiction in which it
is not now so qualified or filing a general consent to service of process) to
be taken under any applicable state securities Laws in connection with the
issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock in the Transaction. Each of Parent,
OUTD and IM shall furnish all information as may be reasonably requested by
the other in connection with any such action and the preparation, filing and
distribution of the Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement/Prospectus.
As promptly as practicable after the Registration Statement shall have become
effective, OUTD shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to its stockholders as of the record date
for the OUTD Stockholders Meeting. No filing of, or amendment or supplement
to, the Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus will be made
(in each case including documents incorporated by reference therein) without
providing OUTD, IM and Parent with a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment thereon. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information
relating to OUTD, IM or Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates,
directors or officers, should be discovered by OUTD, IM or Parent which should
be set forth in an amendment or supplement to either the Registration
Statement or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, so that either such document
would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party that
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and
an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be
promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by Law, disseminated
to the stockholders of OUTD. OUTD or Parent, as applicable, will advise the
other parties hereto promptly after it receives any oral or written request by
the SEC for amendment of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the
Registration Statement, as applicable, or comments thereon and

 



63  responses thereto or requests by the SEC for additional information and will
promptly provide the other with copies of any written communication between it
or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, any state
securities commission or their respective staffs, on the other hand, with
respect to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, the Registration Statement or the
Mergers. OUTD, IM and Parent shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts, after consultation with each other, to resolve all such requests or
comments with respect to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Registration
Statement, as applicable, as promptly as reasonably practicable after
receipt thereof. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of
OUTD, IM and Parent shall cooperate with each other in the preparation of each
of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the Registration Statement and each of
IM, Parent and OUTD shall furnish OUTD or Parent, as applicable, with all
information concerning it and its Affiliates as the providing party (after
consulting with counsel) may deem reasonably necessary or advisable in
connection with the preparation of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the
Registration Statement, as applicable. OUTD and Parent shall notify each other
promptly of the time when the Registration Statement has become effective, of
the issuance of any stop order or suspension of the qualification of the
Parent Common Stock issuable in connection with the Mergers for offering or
sale in any jurisdiction, or of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or
the staff of the SEC and of any request by the SEC or the staff of the
SEC for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the
Registration Statement or for additional information. OUTD and IM shall each
bear fifty percent (50%) of all costs, expenses and fees incurred or payable
to any other Person in connection with the preparation and filing with the
SEC of the Registration Statement and the fees, costs and expenses of the
financial printer and other Persons for the printing and mailing of the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus.

 

Section 6.3 _OUTD Board Recommendation_. Subject to Section 6.1(d), the OUTD
Board shall recommend that OUTDs stockholders vote in favor of approval of
the matters described in Section 3.3(c) (the " _OUTD Board Recommendation_ ")
and OUTD, acting through the OUTD Board, shall include in the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus such recommendation, and shall otherwise use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain OUTD Stockholder Approval.

Section 6.4 _OUTD Stockholders  Meeting_. As promptly as practicable after
the Proxy Statement/Prospectus is prepared and OUTD has mailed (or otherwise
made electronically available) the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to OUTDs
stockholders, OUTD shall take, in accordance with applicable Law and the OUTD
Organizational Documents, all action reasonably necessary to convene the OUTD
Stockholders Meeting to consider and vote upon the approval of the
Transaction, to cause such vote to be taken and to obtain the OUTD
Stockholder Approval. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, OUTD may, with the prior written consent of IM (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), postpone or adjourn the
OUTD Stockholders Meeting (i) to solicit additional proxies for the purpose
of obtaining the OUTD Stockholder Approval, (ii) for the absence of quorum,
(iii) to allow reasonable additional time for the filing and/or mailing of
any supplemental or amended disclosure which OUTD has determined after
consultation with outside legal counsel is necessary under applicable Law and
for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by
the stockholders of OUTD prior to the OUTD Stockholders Meeting or (iv) if
OUTD has delivered the Notice

 



64  contemplated by Section 6.1(d) and the time periods contemplated by Section
6.1(d) have not expired.

Section 6.5 _Access to Information; Confidentiality; Public Announcements_.

(a) Subject to the Confidentiality Agreement and subject to applicable Law,
during the period from the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the
Closing or the termination of this Agreement pursuant to its terms, each of
OUTD and IM shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, afford to the other
party and to the directors, officers, employees, consultants, accountants,
counsel, advisors and other agents and representatives of such other
party (collectively, " _Representatives_ "), reasonable access at reasonable
times during normal business hours on reasonable notice to their respective
properties, books, Contracts, commitments, personnel and records ( _provided_
that such access shall not unreasonably interfere with the business or
operations of such party) and, during such period, each of OUTD and IM shall,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to the other party
information concerning its business, properties and personnel, in each case,
as such other party may reasonably request; _provided_ , that nothing in this
Section 6.5(a) or Section 6.5(b) shall require a party to provide any access,
or to disclose any information, if permitting such access or disclosing such
information would reasonably be expected to (i) violate applicable Law, (ii)
violate any of its obligations with respect to confidentiality ( _provided_
that such party shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the required
consent of any third party to such access or disclosure in a manner that would
not violate such obligations) or (iii) result in the loss of attorney-client
or similar privilege ( _provided_ that such party shall use its reasonable
best efforts to allow for such access or disclosure in a manner that does not
result in a loss of attorney-client privilege). No review pursuant to this
Section 6.5 shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or
warranty contained herein, the covenants or agreements of the parties hereto
or the conditions to the obligations of the parties hereto under this
Agreement.

 

(b) Each of IM, OUTD and the Merger Subsidiaries shall hold, and shall cause
its respective officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors
and other representatives and Affiliates to hold, any non-public information
in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

(c) Except with respect to any Board Recommendation Change made in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement, and subject to Section 6.1(e), each of IM,
OUTD and the Merger Subsidiaries hereby agrees that it shall not, and shall
cause its Affiliates and representatives not to, issue or cause the
publication of any press release or other public statement or any written
communications to investors, employees and vendors with respect to
this Agreement or the Transaction without the prior written consent of the
other parties hereto (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed); _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein will
prohibit any party from issuing or causing publication of any such press
release or public announcement to the extent that such disclosure (i) is
required by applicable Law or the rules and regulations of any applicable
stock exchange (including The NASDAQ Stock Market), in which case the party
making such determination will use its reasonable best efforts to allow the
other parties hereto

 



65  reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in advance of its
issuance or (ii) contains only information that has already been included in a
prior public statement made in accordance with this Section 6.5(c) and such
party has provided the other parties hereto with advance notice of such press
release or public announcement.

Section 6.6 _Antitrust Filings; Reasonable Best Efforts_.

(a) Each of the parties to this Agreement agrees to use its reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be
done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties to this Agreement in
doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make
effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Transaction and to
cause the conditions set forth in Article VII to be satisfied as promptly as
practicable. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, as
promptly as practicable after the date hereof (to the extent not made prior to
the date hereof), IM shall (or shall cause its applicable Affiliates to) and
OUTD shall (i) make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form
pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the Transaction and all other
necessary filings, forms, declarations, notifications, registrations and
notices with other Governmental Authorities under Competition Laws
relating to the Transaction, (ii) use their reasonable best efforts to obtain
all other necessary actions, waivers, consents, licenses, OUTD Permits or IM
Permits, as applicable, authorizations, Orders and approvals from Governmental
Authorities and the making of all other necessary registrations and filings
(including filings with Governmental Authorities, if any), (iii) use their
reasonable best efforts to obtain all consents, approvals or waivers from
third parties that are necessary to consummate the Transaction, (iv) execute,
deliver and perform any such additional instruments reasonably necessary to
consummate the Transaction and to fully carry out the purposes of this
Agreement and (v) use their reasonable best efforts to provide all such
information concerning such party, its Subsidiaries, its Affiliates and its
Subsidiaries and Affiliates officers, directors, employees and partners as
may be reasonably requested in connection with any of the matters set forth
in this Section 6.6(a).

(b) Each party shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond at
the earliest practicable date to any requests for additional information,
including documentary materials, made by the Federal Trade Commission, the
United States Department of Justice or any other Governmental Authorities
relating to the Transaction, and act in good faith and reasonably cooperate
with the other parties in connection with any investigation of any
Governmental Authority relating to the Transaction. Each party shall use its
reasonable best efforts to furnish to each other all information required for
any filing, form, declaration, notification, registration and notice relating
to the Transaction. The parties will consult and cooperate with one another in
connection with any information or proposals submitted in connection with
proceedings under or relating to any Competition Law.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with efforts to obtain the
termination or expiration of any waiting period under any applicable
Competition Laws, (i) in no event shall "reasonable best efforts" of any party
include entering into a consent decree or other commitment containing such
partys agreement to hold separate or divest its or its Subsidiaries plants,
assets or businesses, or agreeing to any limitations on its or its
Subsidiaries conduct or actions, and in no event shall any party be required
to take any of

 



66  the foregoing actions and (ii) nothing herein shall require OUTD or IM to
take any action with respect to compliance with Competition Law or the
obtaining of any consent, clearance or the expiration of any applicable
waiting period under Competition Law which would bind such Person or its
Subsidiaries irrespective of whether the Closing occurs.

(d) OUTD and IM shall each bear fifty percent (50%) of all costs, expenses and
fees incurred or payable to any other Person in connection with complying with
Section 6.6(a)(i), including filing fees under the HSR Act and under any
other applicable antitrust or competition laws.

Section 6.7 _Fees and Expenses_. Except as set forth in Sections 6.2, 6.6(d),
6.18, 8.3 and 9.17 of this Agreement, all fees and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the Mergers shall be paid by the party
incurring such fees or expenses.

 

Section 6.8 _Listing of Parent_. Each of Parent, IM and OUTD shall use all of
its respective reasonable best efforts to cause the Parent Common Stock
issuable under Article II, and those shares of Parent Common Stock required to
be reserved for issuance in connection with the Transaction (including under
the OUTD Incentive Plan), to be authorized for listing on The NASDAQ Stock
Market (or, if such a listing is not capable of being obtained, then on NYSE
or the NYSE Amex), upon official notice of issuance.

Section 6.9 _Notification of Certain Matters_. OUTD shall give prompt notice
to IM, and IM shall give prompt notice to OUTD, of any change or event that
would have or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, an OUTD Material Adverse Effect, or an IM Material Adverse Effect,
respectively, or which would be reasonably likely to result in the failure of
any of the conditions to the obligations of the other party set forth in
Article VII to be satisfied. Notwithstanding the above, the delivery of any
notice pursuant to this Section 6.9 will not limit, expand or otherwise affect
the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties or
the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice or the
conditions to such partys obligation to consummate the applicable Merger.

Section 6.10 _Stockholder Litigation_. OUTD shall keep IM reasonably informed
with respect to the defense or settlement of any stockholder Action against it
and its directors relating to the Transaction. OUTD shall give IM the
opportunity to consult with it regarding the defense or settlement of any such
stockholder Action and shall not settle any such Action without the IMs prior
written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).

Section 6.11 _The Financing_.

 

(a) IM shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, use its reasonable
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, and OUTD shall provide
cooperation on a reasonable best efforts basis to the Borrower in connection
with, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper
or advisable to arrange and obtain the Debt Financing on the terms and
conditions described in the Debt Commitment Letters. Without limiting the
foregoing, IM shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, use its
reasonable

 



67  best efforts to (i) comply with its applicable obligations under the Debt
Commitment Letters, (ii) maintain the Debt Commitment Letters in effect, (iii)
enter into and to cause Parent and each of the Subsidiaries of IM or OUTD, as
the case may be, to enter into definitive agreements with respect to the Debt
Financing on the terms and conditions reflected in the Debt Commitment
Letters, (iv) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions applicable to it and
to Parent in such definitive agreements and to comply with its obligations
thereunder, (v) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions applicable to it
contained in the Debt Commitment Letters, (vi) consummate the Debt Financing
no later than the Closing and (vii) to take, and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause each of its Affiliates to take, all actions necessary to
maintain in effect, and enforce its rights under, the Debt Commitment Letters
(including any definitive agreements relating thereto). OUTD will use its
reasonable best efforts to enter into and to cause each of its Subsidiaries,
as the case may be, to enter into definitive agreements with respect to the
Debt Financing on the terms and conditions reflected in the Debt Commitment
Letters. If any party becomes aware that all or any portion of the Debt
Financing is not available to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, then that party shall promptly notify each of the other parties,
and IM shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best
efforts to obtain, and OUTD shall use reasonable best efforts to assist the
Borrower in obtaining, as promptly as practicable, alternative financing from
alternative financing sources on terms that are no less favorable in the
aggregate, to IM, OUTD and their respective Subsidiaries than those set forth
in the Debt Commitment Letters and in an amount that is adequate (taking into
account all other financial resources of IM, including cash on hand and
marketable securities of Parent, the Merger Subsidiaries, IM, OUTD and their
respective Subsidiaries on the Closing Date) to pay all fees and expenses
and required debt repayments associated with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and to make any other payments necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Alternative Financing_ ").
In such event, the term "Debt Financing" as used in this Agreement shall be
deemed to include any Alternative Financing, the term "Debt Commitment Letter"
as used in this Agreement shall be deemed to include any commitment letter
issued in connection with any Alternative Financing and any related fee
letters, and the term "Financing Documents" as used in this Agreement shall be
deemed to include any credit agreements and other loan documents, underwriting
or note purchase agreements, indentures, currency or interest hedging
agreements and other contracts in connection with any Alternative Financing,
in each case, copies of which (with, in the case of any fee letter, only the
fee amounts and certain other terms (none of which would adversely affect the
amount or availability of the Debt Financing) redacted) shall be promptly
provided to OUTD. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Debt Commitment Letter or
Financing Documents relating to any such Alternative Financing may expand
upon the conditions precedent or contingencies to the funding on the closing
date of the Debt Financing as set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters in
effect on the date hereof or which would reasonably be expected to
adversely affect the ability or the likelihood of the IM Parties to timely
consummate the Transaction or the Mergers. IM shall give OUTD prompt oral and
written notice (but in any event not later than 48 hours after the occurrence)
of any material breach by any party to the Debt Commitment Letters or of any
condition therein not likely to be satisfied, in each case, of which IM has
knowledge or any termination of any Debt Commitment Letter. IM shall keep OUTD
informed on a reasonably current basis of the status of the Borrowers
efforts to

 



68  consummate the Debt Financing. IM shall not permit the Borrower, without the
prior consent of OUTD, to amend or alter, or agree to amend or alter, any Debt
Commitment Letter in any manner that would reasonably be expected to (i)
reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing, (ii) impose new or
additional conditions precedent or contingencies to the funding on the Closing
Date of the Debt Financing as set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters in
effect on the date hereof or (iii) adversely affect the ability or the
likelihood of the IM Parties to timely consummate the Transaction or the
Mergers. IM shall promptly provide OUTD with copies of any such amendment
or alteration.

(b) Each party shall provide, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and
Representatives to provide, all cooperation in connection with the parties
efforts to obtain the Debt Financing or the Alternative Financing as may
reasonably be requested by any of the other parties or by the Lead Arranger,
including (i) providing financial and other information relating to it and
its Subsidiaries to each other party and the lenders and other financial
institutions and investors that are or may become parties to the Debt
Financing and to any underwriters, initial purchasers or placement agents in
connection with the Debt Financing (the " _Financing Parties_ ") that is
customary for such financing or reasonably necessary for the rating, marketing
and completion of the Debt Financing by the Financing Parties, including
information regarding the business, operations, financial projections and
prospects of such party and its Subsidiaries that is customary for such
financing or reasonably necessary for the completion of the Debt Financing by
the Financing Parties, (ii) participating and causing its senior management
to participate in a reasonable number of meetings (including customary one-on-
one meetings) with any Financing Parties and other presentations, road shows,
drafting sessions, due diligence sessions (including accounting due diligence
sessions) and sessions with the rating agencies as are reasonably necessary
for the rating, marketing and completion of the Debt Financing by the
Financing Parties, (iii) assisting in the preparation of (A) any customary
offering documents, bank information memoranda, Forms 8-K, registration
statements, prospectuses and similar documents (including all historical and
pro forma financial statements and information regarding such party and its
Subsidiaries that is required by Regulations S-K and S-X to be included or
incorporated by reference in a registration statement) for any of the Debt
Financing or offering of debt securities in connection therewith, and (B)
materials for rating agency presentations, (iv) cooperating with the
marketing efforts for any of the Debt Financing (including consenting to the
use of such partys and its Subsidiaries logos), (v) assisting in the
preparation of and executing and delivering (or using reasonable best efforts
to obtain from its advisors), and causing its Subsidiaries to execute and
deliver (or use reasonable best efforts to obtain from its advisors), (A)
credit agreements and other loan documents, underwriting or note purchase
agreements, indentures, currency or interest hedging agreements and other
contracts in connection with any of the Debt Financing (collectively, the "
_Financing Documents_ "), customary certificates (including a certificate of
the chief financial officer of Parent or any of its Affiliates with respect to
solvency matters), legal opinions or other documents and instruments relating
to guarantees and other matters ancillary to the Debt Financing as may be
reasonably requested by each other party in connection with any of the Debt
Financing and other documents required to be delivered under the Financing
Documents and (B) the amendment of any of such partys or its Subsidiaries
existing credit facilities, currency or interest hedging agreements, or other
similar agreements, in each case, on terms satisfactory to each other party
and that are

 



69  reasonably requested by each other party in connection with any Debt
Financing; _provided_ , that no obligation of any party or any of its
Subsidiaries under any such agreements or amendments shall be effective until
the Closing, (vi) using its reasonable best efforts, as appropriate, to have
its independent accountants provide their reasonable cooperation and
assistance, including providing customary comfort letters to the underwriters
in connection with the initial purchase of any securities in connection with
any Debt Financing and providing customary consents to inclusion of their
audit reports in registration statements of Parent, (vii)
providing authorization letters to the Financing Parties authorizing the
distribution of information to prospective lenders or investors and containing
a representation to the Financing Parties that the public side versions of
such documents, if any, do not include material nonpublic information about
such party or its Affiliates or securities, (viii) using its reasonable best
efforts to ensure that the Financing Parties benefit from the existing lending
relationships of such party and its Subsidiaries, (ix) cooperating reasonably
with the Financing Parties due diligence investigation of such party and its
Subsidiaries, including (A) due diligence performed by any Financing Parties
and their respective counsel in connection with any of the Debt Financing, to
the extent customary and reasonable and to the extent not unreasonably
interfering with its business and (B) a borrowing base audit with respect to
such partys accounts and inventory and an appraisal of the net orderly
liquidation value of such partys inventory, and (x) taking such actions and
providing such information and assistance as the Financing Parties may
reasonably request in connection with creating Liens upon or pledging
collateral to secure the Debt Financing or the Alternative Financing.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, until the Effective Time occurs, none of OUTD,
any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives shall, (A)
have any liability or any obligation to any Person under or in connection
with the Debt Financing, including under any credit agreement or any related
document or any other agreement or document related to the Debt Financing (or
Alternative Financing) or (B) be required to incur any other liability other
than with respect to out-of-pocket expenses (including attorneys fees) in
connection with the Debt Financing (or any Alternative Financing).

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
nothing contained in this Section 6.11 shall require, and in no event shall
the reasonable best efforts of IM be deemed or construed to require IM to (i)
pay any fees that are materially greater than those contemplated in the Debt
Commitment Letters (whether to secure waiver of any conditions contained
therein or otherwise), (ii) amend or waive any of the terms or conditions
hereof or (iii) except to the extent required by the Debt Commitment Letters,
use any cash or other assets on its balance sheet to pay any portion of
the OUTD Merger Consideration or the IM Merger Consideration. Each party
acknowledges and agrees that the obligations of each party with respect to the
Debt Financing are only as set forth in this Section 6.11, and no other
provision herein, including Section 6.6, shall be deemed to expand or
otherwise modify such obligations.

Section 6.12  _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_.

(a) Each of Parent and the Surviving Entities shall, and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Entities to, assume and perform the obligations with
respect to all rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities,
including advancement of expenses, for acts

 



70  or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time in favor of the
current or former directors, managers, members or officers of OUTD, IM and
their respective Subsidiaries that are existing, and any person who becomes a
director or officer prior to the Effective Time (each an " _Indemnified
Party")_ as provided in the OUTD Organizational Documents, IM Organizational
Documents, OUTD Subsidiary Organizational Documents or IM Subsidiary
Organizational Documents, as applicable, or any indemnification Contract
between such Indemnified Party, on the one hand, and OUTD, IM or their
respective Subsidiaries, as applicable, on the other hand (in each case, as
in effect on the date hereof), without further action, as of the Effective
Time and such obligations shall survive the Effective Time and shall continue
in full force and effect in accordance with their terms. For no less than six
(6) years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws (or similar organizational documents, as applicable)
of the Surviving Entities and their Subsidiaries to contain provisions no less
favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and
exculpation of present and former directors and officers of OUTD, IM and their
respective Subsidiaries than are presently set forth in the OUTD
Organizational Documents, IM Organizational Documents, OUTD Subsidiary
Organizational Documents or IM Subsidiary Organizational Documents, as
applicable.

(b) In the event that either Parent or any of the Surviving Entities or any
of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into
any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity
of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and other assets to any Person, then, and
in each such case, Parent shall cause proper provision to be made so that the
successors and assigns of Parent or the applicable Surviving Corporation, as
applicable, shall expressly assume the obligations set forth in this Section
6.12.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, OUTD and IM may obtain and fully pay for
"tail" insurance policies with a claims period of no more than six (6) years
from and after the Effective Time with respect to directors and officers
liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance with benefits and
levels of coverage no less favorable than OUTDs and IMs existing policies,
respectively, with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time (including with respect to acts and omissions occurring in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions or actions contemplated
hereby) and, if such policies have been obtained, Parent shall, and shall
cause the Surviving Entities, as applicable, to maintain such policies in
full force and effect after the Effective Time; provided, however, that in
satisfying its obligation under this Section 6.12(c), none of OUTD, IM or
Parent shall pay more than 225% of the annual premium paid as of the date of
this Agreement by OUTD or IM, as applicable, to obtain such coverage. It is
understood and agreed that in the event such coverage cannot be obtained for
such amount or less in the aggregate, OUTD, IM and Parent shall only
be obligated to provide the maximum coverage as may be obtained for such
aggregate amount. If, as of the Effective Time, either OUTD or IM shall not
have obtained the "tail" policies described in the previous sentence, for six
(6) years after the Effective Time, Parent shall maintain (directly or
indirectly through OUTDs or IMs existing insurance programs, as applicable)
in effect OUTDs and IMs current directors and officers liability insurance
with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time (including with respect to acts and omissions occurring in connection
with this Agreement or the transactions or actions contemplated hereby),
covering each Person 

 



71  currently covered by OUTDs and IMs directors and officers liability
insurance policy, as applicable, on terms with respect to such coverage and
amounts no less favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date
hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may substitute therefor policies
of Parent with another insurance company of comparable standing to OUTDs or
IMs current insurer, as applicable, and containing terms and conditions,
including with respect to coverage (including as coverage relates to
deductibles and exclusions) and amounts no less favorable to such directors
and officers; _provided_ , _further_ , that in satisfying its obligation
under this Section 6.12(c), none of OUTD, IM or Parent shall pay more than
225% per annum of the annual premiums paid as of the date of this Agreement by
OUTD or IM, as applicable, to obtain such coverage. It is understood and
agreed that in the event such coverage cannot be obtained for such amount or
less in the aggregate, OUTD, IM and Parent shall only be obligated to provide
the maximum coverage as may be obtained for such aggregate amount.

 

(d) The provisions of this Section 6.12 (i) are intended to be for the benefit
of, and will be enforceable from and after the Effective Time by, each
Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and his or her representatives and (ii)
are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have by Contract or
otherwise. The obligations under this Section 6.12 shall not be terminated,
amended or otherwise modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any
Indemnified Party (or any other person who is a beneficiary under a "tail"
policy referred to in Section 6.12(c) (and their heirs and representatives))
without the prior written consent of such person.

 

Section 6.13 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, each of OUTD
and IM shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause any dispositions of
equity securities of OUTD (including any OUTD Stock Options or OUTD Equity
Awards) or any acquisitions of equity securities of Parent resulting from the
Transaction by each individual, and each Person that may be deemed a
"director by deputization", who is subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to OUTD or who will become
subject to such reporting requirements with respect to Parent, to be exempt
under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

Section 6.14 _No Other Representations and Warranties_. 

(a) Except for the representations and warranties contained in Article IV or
the Ancillary Agreements, OUTD acknowledges and agrees that neither IM nor
any other Person on behalf of IM makes, nor has OUTD relied upon or otherwise
been induced by, any other express or implied representation or warranty with
respect to IM or with respect to any other information provided to or made
available to OUTD in connection with the Transaction. Subject to Section 4.4
and Section 6.2, neither IM nor any other Person will have or be subject to
any liability or indemnification obligation to OUTD or any other Person
resulting from the distribution to OUTD, or OUTDs use of, any such
information, including any information, documents, projections, forecasts or
other material made available to OUTD in certain data rooms or management
presentations in expectation of the Transaction, unless any such information
is expressly included in a representation or warranty contained in Article IV
or in an applicable section of the IM Disclosure Schedule.

 



72 (b) Except for the representations and warranties contained in Article III or
the Ancillary Agreements, IM acknowledges and agrees that neither OUTD nor
any other Person on behalf of OUTD makes, nor has IM relied upon or otherwise
been induced by, any other express or implied representation or warranty with
respect to OUTD or with respect to any other information provided to or made
available to IM in connection with the Transaction. Subject to Section 3.4 and
Section 6.2, neither OUTD nor any other Person will have or be subject to any
liability or obligation to IM or any other Person resulting from the
distribution to IM, or IMs use of, any such information, including any
information, documents, projections, forecasts or other material made
available to IM in certain data rooms or management presentations in
expectation of the Transaction, unless any such information is expressly
included in a representation or warranty contained in Article III or in an
applicable section of the OUTD Disclosure Schedule.

 

Section 6.15 _Performance by Parent and the Merger Subsidiaries_. IM shall
cause Parent and the Merger Subsidiaries to timely perform all of their
respective covenants, agreements and obligations under this Agreement and the
other agreements contemplated hereby.

Section 6.16 _Employee Matters_.

(a) For one year following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause each
employee of OUTD and its subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time,
who continues as an employee of Parent or an applicable subsidiary (including
OUTD and its subsidiaries) (such employees, with their eligible dependents, "
_OUTD Participants_ "), to be eligible to participate, in either, at Parents
sole discretion, (i) the OUTD Benefit Plans, excluding any incentive, equity
or bonus plans, on substantially the same terms as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, or (ii) substantially similar plans or
arrangements of Parent or its applicable subsidiary (" _Parent Plans_ "),
excluding any incentive, equity or bonus plans, or (c) a combination of
clauses (a) and (b) so that the OUTD Participants shall have benefits that are
substantially similar in the aggregate to benefits provided to similarly
situated employees of Parent under Parent Plans, excluding any incentive,
equity or bonus plans. To the extent Parent elects to have the OUTD
Participants participate in the Parent Plans following the Closing Date, (i)
each OUTD Participant will receive credit for purposes of eligibility to
participate and vesting under such for years of service with the Company (or
any predecessors) prior to the Closing Date, and (ii) Parent will use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause any and all pre-existing condition
limitations, eligibility waiting periods and evidence of insurability
requirements under any Parent Plans that are group health plans in which such
OUTD Participants will participate to be waived and will use commercially
reasonable efforts to provide credit for any co-payments and deductibles
prior to the Closing Date for purposes of satisfying any applicable
deductible, out-of-pocket or similar requirements under any such plans that
may apply after the Closing Date.

 

(b) From and after the Effective Time, (i) nothing in this Agreement shall
prohibit Parent or any of its Affiliates from amending, modifying or
terminating, any or all compensation or benefit plans, programs, policies,
practices, agreements and arrangements sponsored or maintained by Parent or
any of its Affiliates (including, for the avoidance of doubt, OUTD), including
each OUTD Benefit Plan, and (ii) nothing in this Agreement shall

 



73  require Parent or any of its Affiliates to continue any particular
compensation or benefit plan, program, policy, practice, agreement or
arrangement; _provided_ , _that_ notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall
not take any action that would result in OUTD Participants not receiving
substantially similar benefits as similarly situated employees of Parent and
its Subsidiaries. Nothing in this Agreement shall (i) be treated as an
amendment, modification or creation of any employee benefit plan, program,
policy, practice, agreement or arrangement, including of any OUTD Benefit
Plan, (ii) create any right or benefit in any Person other than the
signatories of this Agreement, (iii) guarantee employment of any employee for
any period of time after the Effective Time or preclude the ability of Parent
or any of its Affiliates to terminate the employment of any employee, or (iv)
create a binding employment agreement with any employee.

Section 6.17 _Tax Matters_. From and after the date of this Agreement
and until the Effective Time, each party shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Mergers to qualify, and shall not, without the prior
written consent of the parties to this Agreement, knowingly take any actions,
cause any actions to be taken or omit to take any action which such action or
omission could prevent the Mergers from qualifying, as an exchange described
in Section 351 of the Code. Following the Effective Time, and consistent with
any such consent, neither IM nor OUTD shall, nor shall they permit any of
their Affiliates to, take any action, cause any action to be taken or omit to
take any action which such action or omission could cause the Mergers to fail
to so qualify as an exchange described in Section 351 of the Code. The
parties shall report the Mergers as an exchange within the meaning of Section
351 of the Code, unless otherwise required pursuant to a "determination"
within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code.

Section 6.18 _FCC Approval_. Except as otherwise contemplated by this
Agreement, (i) the parties will cooperate to prepare such application(s) as
may be commercially reasonable and necessary for submission to the FCC (the "
_FCC Application_ ") in order to obtain the FCCs approval of the transfer of
control of the FCC Authorization (the " _FCC Approval_ ") and will promptly
file (no later than 15 Business Days following the date that this Agreement is
executed) such FCC Application with the FCC; (ii) each of the Parties will (A)
diligently take, or cooperate in the taking of, all necessary, desirable,
proper and reasonable best efforts, and provide any additional information,
reasonably required or requested by the FCC with respect to the FCC
Application; (B) keep the other informed of any material communications
(including any meeting, conference or telephonic call) and will provide the
other copies of all correspondence between it (or its advisors) and the FCC
with respect to the FCC Application; (C) permit the other to review any
material communication relating to the FCC Application to be given by it to
the FCC; (D) to notify as soon as reasonably practicable the other in the
event it becomes aware of any other facts, actions, communications
or occurrences that would reasonably be expected to affect FCC approval of
the FCC Application; (E) oppose any petitions to deny or other objections
filed with respect to the FCC Application and any requests for reconsideration
or judicial review of the FCC Approval; and (F) not take any action that
would reasonably be expected to materially delay, materially impede or prevent
receipt of the FCC Approval. The fees required by the FCC for the filing of
the FCC Application will be borne one half by OUTD and one half by IM.

 



74 Section 6.19 _Transaction Fee._ At the Effective Time, Parent shall make or
cause to be made a payment to InterMedia Advisors, LLC in an amount equal to
$2,500,000, by check or wire transfer of federal funds to an account

Days prior to the Closing Date.

held at the time of such termination (other than conditions that, by their
nature, are to be satisfied at the Closing (and which are, at the time of
termination of this Agreement, capable of being satisfied if the Closing were
to occur at such time)), (iii) OUTD has notified IM in writing that all

Any party terminating this Agreement pursuant to paragraphs (b)-(g) of this
Section 8.1 shall give written notice of such termination to the other parties
in accordance with this Agreement, which written notice shall specify the
provision or provisions hereunder pursuant to which such termination is being
effected.

Section 8.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this
Agreement as provided in Section 8.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become
void and there shall be no liability on the part of any of the parties, except
(a) as set forth in Section 6.5(b), Section 6.7, the last sentence of Section
6.11(b), Section 8.3, this Section 8.2 and Section 9.15, as well as the rest
of Article IX to the extent applicable to such surviving sections, each of
which shall survive termination of this Agreement and (b) that, except
as provided in Section 8.3(f), nothing herein shall relieve any party from
liability for any willful and material breach of any representation, warranty
or covenant of such party contained herein prior to the termination of this
Agreement;  _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the aggregate liability
(including pursuant to Section 9.17) of IM for any such willful and material
breach, together with the aggregate liability of IM and/or any of its
Affiliates under any other Transaction Documents, shall be limited to and
shall in no event exceed an aggregate amount equal to Twenty-Five Million
Dollars ($25,000,000) and (ii) the aggregate liability (including pursuant to
Section 9.17) of OUTD for any such willful and material breach shall be
limited to and shall in no event exceed an aggregate amount equal to Twenty-
Five Million Dollars ($25,000,000) (inclusive of the Termination Fee).
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event of
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(i) or Section 8.1(c),
if at or prior to the time of such termination OUTD would have been able to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(g) without waiving any
unsatisfied conditions in Section 7.1 or 7.3, then IMs liability following
termination of this Agreement shall be limited to the amount of the Reverse
Termination Fee and any liability set forth in clause (a) of the preceding
sentence (excluding the reference to Sections 8.2 and 8.3 and 6.7 (to the
extent the same references Section 8.3) contained therein); provided that, for
the avoidance of doubt, it is understood and agreed that for purposes of
this sentence the failure to close by IM pursuant to Section 1.3, in and of
itself, shall not be considered a failure to satisfy the condition in Section
7.3(b) or a willful and material breach of this Agreement if, in each case,
the Debt Financing was not available at such time. No termination of this
Agreement shall affect the obligations of the parties contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement, all of which obligations shall survive termination
of this Agreement in

 



80  accordance with their terms. For purposes of this Section 8.2, a "willful
and material breach" shall mean a material breach of this Agreement that is a
consequence of an act undertaken or a failure to act by the breaching party
with the knowledge that the taking of such act or a failure to take such act
would, or would be reasonably expected to, result in a material breach of this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall be
deemed to limit the rights of any party under Section 9.16 prior to the
termination of this Agreement.

Section 8.3 _Termination Fees_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth in this Agreement:

(a) OUTD shall pay a fee to IM in the amount of Six Million Five Hundred
Thousand Dollars ($6,500,000) (such amount, the " _Termination Fee_ "), if:

 

(i) OUTD terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(e);

 

(ii) IM terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(f); or

 

(iii) (A) OUTD or IM terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.1(b)(iii), (B) at the time of such termination (or, if applicable the OUTD
Stockholders Meeting) an Alternative Proposal shall have been proposed to
OUTD or the OUTD Board or publicly announced and (C) within 12 months
following the date of such termination, OUTD shall have entered into a
definitive agreement with respect to an Alternative Proposal (and such
transaction is subsequently consummated) or an Alternative Proposal shall have
been consummated; _provided_ , _however_ , that for purposes of clause (C) of
this Section 8.3(a)(iii), the references to "25%" in the definition of
Alternative Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "50%".

(b) IM shall pay a fee to OUTD in the amount of Nine Million Dollars
($9,000,000) (such amount, the " _Reverse Termination Fee_ "), if OUTD
terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(g).

(c) OUTD shall pay the Termination Fee by wire transfer of immediately
available funds (i) at or concurrently with the termination of this Agreement
as set forth in Section 6.1(d) in the case of Section 8.3(a)(i), (ii) within
two (2) Business Days following the termination of this Agreement in the case
of Section 8.3(a)(ii) and (iii) within two Business Days of the event giving
rise to the payment of the Termination Fee in the case of Section 8.3(a)(iii).
IM shall pay the Reverse Termination Fee by wire transfer of
immediately available funds (A) within two (2) Business Days following a
termination of this Agreement by OUTD in connection with which the Reverse
Termination Fee is payable and (B) at or concurrently with a termination of
this Agreement by IM in connection with which the Reverse Termination Fee is
payable. For the avoidance of doubt, any payment to be made by any party under
this Section 8.3 shall be payable only once to such other party with respect
to this Section 8.3 and not in duplication even though such payment may be
payable under one or more provisions hereof.

 



81 (d) The parties acknowledge and agree that the agreements contained in this
Section 8.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the parties would not enter
into this Agreement. If a party fails to promptly pay the amount due by it
pursuant to this Section 8.3, interest shall accrue on such amount at the
prime lending rate prevailing at such time as published in the _Wall Street
Journal_ from the date such payment was required to be paid pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement until the date of payment. If, in order to obtain
such payment, a party commences a suit that results in judgment for such party
for such amount, the defaulting party shall pay the party which obtained such
judgment its reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees and expenses) incurred in connection with such suit. Each of the parties
further acknowledges that the payment of the Termination Fee by OUTD or the
Reverse Termination Fee by IM specified in this Section 8.3 is not a penalty,
but in each case is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will
compensate IM or OUTD, respectively, in the circumstances in which such fees
or expenses are payable for the efforts and resources expended and the
opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on
this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate
with precision.

 

(e) The parties further acknowledge and agree that (i) in no event shall any
party, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates seek (and such
party shall cause its controlled Affiliates not to seek) any monetary damages
or any other recovery, judgment, or damages of any kind in excess of the caps
set forth in Section 8.2 of this Agreement and (ii) in no event shall any
former, current or future direct or indirect equity holders, controlling
Persons, representatives, stockholders, directors, officers, employees,
agents, Affiliates, members, managers, general or limited partners or
assignees of OUTD or IM (collectively, " _Non-Recourse Parties_ ") have any
other liability relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Transaction
Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, and no party
hereto, its Subsidiaries or any of their Affiliates shall seek (and such
party shall cause its controlled Affiliates not to seek) any monetary damages
or any other recovery, judgment, or damages of any kind against any of the
Non-Recourse Parties, and such party, its Subsidiaries and their Affiliates
shall be precluded from any remedy against any of the Non-Recourse Parties at
law or in equity or otherwise.

(f) In the event of a termination of this Agreement pursuant to (x) Section
8.1(g) or (y) Section 8.1(b) or Section 8.1(c) at a time when the second
sentence of Section 8.2 is applicable, then, in each case, upon payment by IM
of the Reverse Termination Fee, except for the amounts, if any, provided in
Sections 6.2, 6.6(d), 6.18, 8.3(d) and 9.17, no Person shall have any rights
or claims against any Non-Recourse Party under this Agreement or any
Ancillary Agreement or in connection with any of the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby, or in respect of any oral representations made or alleged
to be made in connection herewith or therewith, whether at law or equity,
contract, tort or otherwise, and no Non-Recourse Party shall have any further
liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement, any
Ancillary Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby
or in respect of any oral representations made or alleged to be made in
connection herewith or therewith.

and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter of this

confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies
hereunder. Without limiting the foregoing, the representations and warranties
in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties hereto and
are for the sole benefit of the parties hereto. In some instances, the
representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an

 



98  allocation among the parties hereto of risks associated with particular
matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto.
Consequently, Persons other than the parties hereto may not rely upon the
representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any
other date.

 

Section 9.8 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and any claim, controversy or
dispute arising under or related thereto, the relationship of the parties,
and/or the interpretation and enforcement of the rights and duties of the
parties, whether arising in Law or in equity, in contract, tort or otherwise,
shall be governed by, and construed and interpreted in accordance with, the
Laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to its rules regarding conflicts
of Law to the extent that the application of the Laws of another jurisdiction
would be required thereby.

 

Section 9.9 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or
in part, by operation of Law or otherwise by either of the parties hereto
without the prior written consent of the other party. Any assignment in
violation of the preceding sentence shall be void. Subject to the preceding
two sentences, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of,
and be enforceable by, the parties and their respective successors and
assigns.

Section 9.10 _Consent to Jurisdiction_. Each of the parties hereto hereby
irrevocably agrees that any legal action or proceeding with respect to this
Agreement or the Transaction, or for recognition and enforcement of any
judgment in respect of this Agreement or the Transaction and obligations
arising hereunder brought by any other party hereto or its successors or
assigns, shall be brought and determined exclusively in the Delaware Court of
Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware
(or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a
particular matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware).
Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably submits with regard to any such
Action for itself and in respect of its property, generally and
unconditionally, to the personal jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and
agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or the
Transaction in any court other than the aforesaid courts. Each of the parties
hereto hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion,
as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or proceeding with
respect to this Agreement or the Transaction, (a) any claim that it is not
personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts for any
reason other than the failure to serve in accordance with this Section 9.10,
(b) any claim that it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of
any such court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether
through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of
execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise) and (c) to the
fullest extent permitted by the applicable Law, any claim that (i) the Action
in such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of
such Action is improper or (iii) this Agreement or the Transaction or the
subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts. This Section
9.10 is subject to Section 9.15.

 

Section 9.11 _Effect of Disclosure_. The disclosure of any matter in OUTD
Disclosure Schedule or the IM Disclosure Schedule shall expressly not be
deemed to

 



99  constitute an admission by OUTD or IM, respectively, or to otherwise imply,
that any such matter is material for the purpose of this Agreement.

 

Section 9.12 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is held to be invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of
Law or public policy by a court of competent jurisdiction, all other
conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full
force and effect, insofar as the foregoing can be accomplished
without materially affecting the economic benefits anticipated by the parties
to this Agreement. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable Law in an acceptable manner to the end that the Transaction is
fulfilled to the extent possible. 

Section 9.13 _Waiver and Amendment; Remedies Cumulative_. Subject to
applicable Law, (a) any provision of this Agreement (other than Section
7.1(a)) or any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of any of
the parties or compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained
in this Agreement may be waived or (b) the time for the performance of any of
the obligations or other acts of the parties here may be extended at any time
prior to Closing. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such extension
or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed
on behalf of the party against whom waiver is sought; _provided_ , that any
extension or waiver given in compliance with this Section 9.13 or failure to
insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or
condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any
subsequent or other failure. Subject to applicable Law, any of the provisions
of this Agreement (other than Section 7.1(a) and the first sentence of this
Section 9.13) may be amended at any time, whether before or after the receipt
of the OUTD Stockholder Approval, by the mutual written agreement of IM and
OUTD; _provided_ , _however_ , that after the OUTD Stockholder Approval has
been obtained, no such amendment shall be made which by law requires further
stockholder approval without such approval. No failure or delay on the part of
any party hereto in the exercise of any right hereunder shall impair such
right or be construed to be a waiver of, or acquiescence in, any breach of
any representation, warranty or agreement herein, nor shall any single or
partial exercise of any such right preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or of any other right. This Section 9.13 is subject to Section 9.15.

Section 9.14 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION OR COUNTERCLAIM
(WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTION OR THE ACTIONS OF IM, OUTD OR ANY OF THE
MERGER SUBSIDIARIES IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND
ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT.

Section 9.15 _Certain Matters Related to the Debt Financing_. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, including the provisions of
Section 9.10, the parties hereto (i) agree that any Action of any kind or
description, whether 

 



100   in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, involving
the Lead Arranger or any Person who signs a joinder to the Debt Commitment
Letters or any other Contract to provide a portion of the Debt Financing or
is otherwise contemplated to provide any portion of the Debt Financing (the "
_Lenders_ ") or any agent with respect to the Debt Financing (the " _Agents_
") or any Affiliate of the Lead Arranger, Lenders or Agents, or any of the
respective current, former or future officers, directors, employees, agents,
representatives, stockholders, limited partners, managers, members or partners
of any of the foregoing in their capacity as such (collectively, the "
_Lender Parties_ ") arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the
Transaction, the Debt Financing, the Debt Commitment Letters, the related fee
letter, any of the transactions contemplated thereby or the performance of
services thereunder shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of a state
or federal court sitting in the City of New York, New York (and the parties
hereto will not bring or permit any of their Affiliates to bring or
support any other Person in bringing any such Action in any other court),
(ii) knowingly, intentionally and voluntarily waive any right to trial by jury
in respect of any such Action, (iii) agree that any such Action shall be
governed by the Laws of the State of New York (without giving effect to any
conflicts of law principles that would result in the application of the laws
of another state), (iv) agree that no Lender Party will have any liability to
OUTD or any of its Affiliates relating to or arising out of this Agreement,
the Transaction, the Debt Financing, the Debt Commitment Letters, the related
fee letter, any of the transactions contemplated thereby or the performances
of the services thereunder and (v) agree the Lender Parties are express third
party beneficiaries of Section 8.2, Section 9.7 and 9.15 (and such sections
and provisions shall not be amended in respect of such Lender Parties without
the prior written consent of the Lead Arranger and the Agents).

Section 9.16 _Specific Performance_.

 

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur and that the parties
would not have any adequate remedy at Law in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached by any party. It is accordingly
agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches and/or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any federal court
located in the State of Delaware or in Delaware state court, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled to at Law or in
equity; _provided_ , _however_ , that, without limiting the foregoing, OUTD
shall not be entitled to seek specific performance to cause IM to consummate
the Closing in accordance with Section 1.3 unless each of the following
conditions are satisfied: (i) all of the conditions set forth in Section 7.1
and Section 7.2 have been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their
terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to such conditions
being capable of being satisfied), (ii) the Debt Financing has been funded or
will be funded at the Closing and (iii) OUTD has confirmed to IM in writing
that if specific performance is granted and the Debt Financing is funded, and
IM otherwise complies with its obligations hereunder, then OUTD is ready,
willing and able to effect the Closing.

(b) Notwithstanding the parties rights to specific performance or injunctive
relief pursuant to this Section 9.16(a) and subject to the limitation
contained in the last sentence of this Section 9.16(b), each party may pursue
any other remedy available to it

 



101   at Law or in equity, including monetary damages; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that it is understood and agreed that claims for monetary damages following
termination of this Agreement shall be subject to the limitations contained
in Section 8.2. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
prior to the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, no
party hereto shall be permitted to make any claim or commence any Action
seeking monetary damages in excess of the limitation set forth in Section 8.2
against any other party hereto in connection with or arising out of this
Agreement or the Transactions.

 

Section 9.17 _Other_. In the event of a dispute between any of the parties
hereto with respect to obligations under this Agreement, the prevailing party
in any action or proceeding in connection therewith shall be entitled to
recover from such other party its costs and expenses incurred in connection
with such action or proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable
legal fees and associated costs.
