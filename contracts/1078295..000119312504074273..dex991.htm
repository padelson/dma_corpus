the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub, except for Article I thereof,
which shall read "The name of the corporation is "Marimba, Inc.," and (ii) the
bylaws of Merger Sub in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time will
be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.



Section 2.05 _Directors and Officers_. From and after the Effective Time, the

ARTICLE III

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES



Section 3.01  _Merger Consideration; Conversion and Cancellation of
Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the Parent Companies, the Company or the holders of any
of their securities:



(a) Subject to the other provisions of this Article III, each share
of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (excluding any Company Common Stock described in Section
3.01(b) or Dissenting Shares) will be automatically converted into the right
to receive $8.25 in cash, without interest (" _Merger_ _Consideration_ ").
All shares of Company Common Stock will, upon conversion thereof into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration at the Effective Time, cease to be
outstanding and will be automatically cancelled and retired. The holders of
certificates previously evidencing Company Common Stock will cease to have any
rights with respect to such Company Common Stock except as otherwise provided
herein or by Law.



 

Agreement and Plan of Merger

-2- (b) Each share of Company Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company and
each share of Company Common Stock, if any, owned by the Parent or any direct
or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Parent or of the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time will be cancelled and extinguished
without conversion thereof.



(c) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger
Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be
converted into one share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.



Section 3.02 _Surrender and Payment_.



(a) _Exchange Fund_. Promptly following the Effective Time, the Parent will
deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Disbursing Agent, for the benefit
of the former holders of Company Common Stock and for payment of the Merger
Consideration in accordance with this Article III, cash in an amount equal to
the product of the Merger Consideration and the number of shares of Company
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(exclusive of any such shares to be cancelled pursuant to Section 3.01(b))
(such amounts being referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Disbursing
Agent shall invest the Exchange Fund as directed by the Parent. Any interest
and other income resulting from such investment shall become a part of the
Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable under Section
3.01(a) shall be promptly paid to the Parent.



(b) _Letter of Transmittal_. Promptly following the Effective Time, the
Parent will cause the Disbursing Agent to mail to each record holder of
Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time a letter of
transmittal and other appropriate materials for use in surrendering to the
Disbursing Agent certificates that prior to the Effective Time evidenced
shares of Company Common Stock. Such letter of transmittal will specify that
delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificates
formerly evidencing Company Common Stock will pass, only upon delivery of such
certificates to the Disbursing Agent and shall be in such form and have such
other provisions as the Parent may reasonably specify.



(c) _Payment Procedures_. The Disbursing Agent will pay to each former holder
of Company Common Stock, upon surrender to the Disbursing Agent for
cancellation of one or more certificates that theretofore evidenced shares of
Company Common Stock together with a duly executed letter of transmittal, the
Merger Consideration payable in respect of such certificate or certificates,
after giving effect to any required withholding taxes. No interest will be
paid or accrued on the cash payable upon the surrender of such certificate or
certificates. If payment is to be made to a Person other than the Person in
whose name the surrendered certificate or certificates are registered, it will
be a condition of payment that the surrendered certificate or certificates
will be properly endorsed, with signatures guaranteed, or otherwise in proper
form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment will pay any
transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other
than the registered holder of the surrendered certificate or certificates or
such Person will establish to the satisfaction of the  



 

Agreement and Plan of Merger

-3-  Parent that such Taxes have been paid or are not applicable. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this Article III, each certificate that prior
to the Effective Time evidenced shares of Company Common Stock (other than
certificates evidencing shares described in Section 3.01(b) or Dissenting
Shares) will be deemed at all times after the Effective Time to represent only
the right to receive upon surrender thereof the applicable Merger
Consideration.



(d)  _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any certificate that prior
to the Effective Time evidenced shares of Company Common Stock shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such certificates to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such
reasonable amount as the Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it with respect to such certificate, the Disbursing Agent
will pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, the
Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company Common
Stock formerly represented thereby.



(e) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the aggregate
Merger Consideration that remains unpaid by the Exchange Agent to the former
holders of Company Common Stock six months after the Effective Time will be
delivered to the Parent, upon demand, and any former holders of Company Common
Stock who have not theretofore complied with this Article III will thereafter
look only to the Parent for payment of any Merger Consideration to which they
are entitled.



(f) _No Liability_. Neither the Disbursing Agent nor any party hereto will be
liable to any former holder of Company Common Stock for any
Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.



(g) _Withholding of Tax_. The Parent and the Surviving Corporation will be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any former holder of Company
Common Stock such amounts as the Parent (or any Affiliate thereof) is required
to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the
Code or state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld by the Parent or any Affiliate thereof, such withheld amounts will be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the former
holder of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made.



(h) _Stock Transfer Books_. At the close of business on the date of the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company will be closed and
there will be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common
Stock thereafter on the books and records of the Company. If, after the
Effective Time, certificates which prior to the Effective Time evidenced
shares of Company Common Stock (other than certificates evidencing shares
described in Section 3.01(b)) are presented to the Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Disbursing Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled
and exchanged as provided in Article III.



Section 3.03 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are held by any record
holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in
writing and who has demanded appraisal  



 

Agreement and Plan of Merger

-4-  rights in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_
") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
but shall become the right to receive such consideration as may be determined
to be due in respect of such Dissenting Shares pursuant to the DGCL;
_provided, however,_ that any holder of Dissenting Shares who shall have
failed to perfect or shall have withdrawn or lost his rights to appraisal of
such Dissenting Shares, in each case under the DGCL, shall forfeit the right
to appraisal of such Dissenting Shares, and such Dissenting Shares shall be
deemed to have been converted into the right to receive, as of the Effective
Time, the Merger Consideration without interest. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Section 3.03, if the Merger is rescinded or
abandoned, then the right of any holder of Dissenting Shares to be paid the
fair value of such stockholders Dissenting Shares shall cease. The Surviving
Corporation shall comply with all of its obligations under the DGCL with
respect to holders of Dissenting Shares. The Company shall give the Parent
(i) prompt written notice of any demands for appraisal, any withdrawals of
such demands received by the Company and any other related instruments served
pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company, and (ii) the opportunity
to direct and participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
demands for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the
prior written consent of the Parent, make any payment with respect to any
demands for appraisal or negotiate, offer to settle or settle any such
demands.



Section 3.04 _Adjustments_. If during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock shall occur, including by reason of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock dividend, stock split or
combination, exchange or readjustment of the shares of Company Common Stock,
or any stock dividend thereon with a record date during such period, the
Merger Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant to this
Agreement, as the case may be, shall be appropriately adjusted.

Vote_.



(a) The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to execute and

approval of this Agreement and the Merger by the Required Company Vote, to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of
this Agreement by the Company and consummation by the Company of the
transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and validly authorized by all
necessary corporate action on the part of the Company and no other corporate
proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to authorize
this Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby (other
than, with respect to the Merger, the approval of this Agreement and the
Merger by the Required Company Vote). This Agreement has been duly executed
and delivered by the Company and (assuming due authorization, execution and
delivery hereof by the other parties hereto) constitutes a legal, valid and

bankruptcy, insolvency or other laws affecting creditors rights generally or
by legal principles of general applicability governing the availability of
equitable remedies.

shares of Company Common Stock approve this Agreement and the Merger. The
affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the issued and
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock to approve this Agreement and the
Merger (the " _Required Company Vote_ ") is the only vote of holders of
Company Common Stock or other securities (equity or otherwise) of the Company
necessary to consummate the Merger.



 

Section 4.05 _Approvals_. The execution and delivery of this Agreement does
not, and consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not,

other approval of or from, or to make any filing with or notification to, any
Governmental Authority, except for the applicable requirements, if any, of
the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, state securities or "blue sky" Laws,

Governmental Authorities and the filing and recordation of the Certificate of
Merger as required by the DGCL.



 

Agreement and Plan of Merger

-7- Section 4.06 _No Violation_. Assuming that the Authorizations, filings and
notifications described in Section 4.05 have been obtained or made, the
execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement does not and
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not (a)
conflict with, result in any violation or breach of, or cause a default (or
an event that with notice, lapse of time or otherwise would become a default)
under, (i) any Law, Regulation or Order applicable to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, (ii) the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of
the Company or (iii) the organizational documents of the Companys
Subsidiaries or (b) conflict with, result in any violation or breach of, or
cause a default (or an event that with notice, lapse of time or otherwise
would become a default) under, or give to others any right of termination,
cancellation, amendment or acceleration of, or require a payment under, or
result in the loss of any benefit under or in the creation of a Lien on any of
the properties or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant

members, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that failure of
the Board of Directors of the Company to take such action would be a breach
of its fiduciary obligations to the Companys stockholders under applicable
Law; or



 

(iv) prior to obtaining the Required Company Vote, recommend such Acquisition
Proposal to its stockholders or, in connection with an Acquisition Proposal,
withhold, withdraw, amend or modify its recommendation in favor of this
Agreement and the Merger (any such actions being referred to as " _Change of
Recommendation_ ") but only at a time that is after the fifth Business Day
following the later of (1) the Parents receipt of written notice that the
Companys Board of Directors has made the determination required by clauses
(x) and (y) below and is prepared to effect a Change of Recommendation
and the manner it intends to do so and (2) the date the Parent is provided a
copy of (and an accurate description of all material terms not covered
thereby) such Acquisition Proposal, if prior to taking any such action (x) the
Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith by affirmative
vote of a majority of all of its members, after consultation with a nationally
recognized investment banking firm (including, without limitation, Broadview)
that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal (taking into account
any adjustment to the terms and conditions of the Merger proposed by the
Parent in response to such Acquisition Proposal) and (y) the Board of
Directors of the Company determines in good faith by affirmative vote of
a majority of all of its members, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel, that the failure of the Board of Directors of the Company to take
such action would be a breach of its fiduciary obligations to the Companys
stockholders under applicable Law. Nothing in this Section 6.03 will permit
the Company to terminate this Agreement except as specifically provided in
Article IX hereof or effect any other obligation of the Company under this
Agreement.



(c) From and after the date of this Agreement, the Company shall as
promptly as possible after receipt (and in any event within 24 hours) notify

constituting or which could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition
Proposal or any request for information relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries contemplating, relating to or which could reasonably be expected

Person and the material terms and conditions of any proposal, inquiry, offer
or request, and the Company will as soon as possible provide such other
details of the Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, offer or request as the Parent
may reasonably request. The Company will keep the Parent fully informed on a

Agreement and Plan of Merger

-28-  proposed to be made to the terms, of any such inquiry, proposal, offer or
request. If the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or its or their
representatives receives a request for information from a Person who has made
an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal and the Company is
permitted, as contemplated under Section 6.03(b), to provide such Person with
information, the Company will provide to the Parent a copy of the
confidentiality agreement with such Person promptly upon its execution and
provide to the Parent a list of, and copies of, the information provided to
such Person concurrently with delivery to such Person and immediately provide
the Parent with access to all information to which such Person was provided
access.



(d) The Company will immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing
activities, discussions or negotiations by it and the other Persons referred
to in Section 6.03(a) with any Person other than the Parent conducted
heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. The Company also agrees,
if it has not already done so, to promptly request each Person, if any, that
has heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement within the 12 months
prior to the date hereof in connection with any Acquisition Proposal to return
or destroy all confidential information heretofore furnished to such Person by
or on behalf of it or its Subsidiaries and take commercially reasonable
actions necessary to enforce the provisions of any continuing confidentiality,
standstill or similar agreement. The Company will take such action as is
necessary to inform promptly the Persons referred to in Section 6.03(a) of
the provisions of this Section 6.03 and will be responsible for any breach of
this Section 6.03 by such Persons.



Section 6.04 _Access and Information_. The parties acknowledge that the
Company and the Parent have previously executed a Confidentiality
Agreement, dated as of May 8, 2002 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "),
which Confidentiality Agreement will continue in full force and effect in
accordance with its terms. The Company will, and will cause its Subsidiaries
to, (i) afford to the Parent and its officers, directors, employees,
accountants, consultants, legal counsel, agents and other representatives
(collectively, the " _Representatives_ ") full access, at reasonable times
upon reasonable prior notice, to the officers, employees, agents, properties,
offices and other facilities of the Company and its Subsidiaries and to their
books, records, contracts and documents and (ii) furnish promptly to the
Parent and its Representatives such information concerning the Companys and
its Subsidiaries business, properties, contracts, records and personnel
(including financial, operating and other data and information) as may be
reasonably requested, from time to time, by or on behalf of the Parent;
_provided, however,_ that the Company shall not be required to permit any
inspection, or to disclose any information, that in the reasonable judgment of
the Company would (i) result in the disclosure of any material trade secrets
of third Persons, (ii) violate any obligation of the Company to any third
Person with respect to confidentiality, (iii) jeopardize protections afforded
to the Company under the attorney-client privilege or the attorney work
product doctrine, or (iv) materially interfere with the conduct of the
Companys business. No information or knowledge obtained by Parent in any
investigation pursuant to this Section 6.04 shall affect or be deemed to
modify any representation or warranty of the Company contained herein or the
conditions to the obligations of the Parent Companies to consummate the
Merger.

Agreement and Plan of Merger

-31-  transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company and the Parent will
request early termination of the waiting period with respect to the Merger
under the HSR Act. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, nothing
in this Agreement will be deemed to require the Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries to agree to, or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
agree to, any divestiture (including, without limitation, through a licensing
arrangement) of any business, assets or property, or the imposition of any
limitation on the ability of any of them to conduct their business or to own
or exercise control of such business assets and properties.



(b) The Company will give prompt notice to the Parent of (i) any notice or
other communication from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person

and (iv) if there has been a material change in the current or future
business, financial condition or results of operations of the Company, or any
event or condition that might reasonably be expected to cause or result in any
of its representations or warranties contained herein to be untrue or
inaccurate in any material respect or to delay or impede the ability of the
Company to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or to
fulfill its obligations set forth herein. The Parent will give prompt notice
to the Company of (i) any notice or other communication from any Person
alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection
with the Merger, (ii) any notice or other communication from any Governmental
Authority in connection with the Merger and (iii) any event or condition that

or warranties contained herein to be untrue or inaccurate in any
material respect or to delay or impede the ability of the Parent to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or to fulfill its
obligations set forth herein. The delivery of any notice pursuant to this
Section 7.03(b) will not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available
hereunder of the parties hereto or the representations or warranties of the
parties hereto or the conditions to the obligations of the parties hereto
hereunder.



(c) The Company shall consult with the Parent prior to making its
financial results for any period publicly available after the date of this
Agreement and prior to filing any SEC Reports after the date of this
Agreement.



(d) The Company will give (or will cause its Subsidiaries to give) any notices
to third Persons, and use, and cause its Subsidiaries to use, its reasonable
best efforts to obtain any consents from third Persons (A) necessary, proper
or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
to satisfy any of the conditions set forth in Article VIII, (B) otherwise
required under any contracts, licenses, leases or other agreements in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or
(C) required to prevent a Material Adverse Effect from occurring prior to or
after the Effective Time or a material adverse effect on the Parent from

contrary, nothing in this Agreement will be deemed to permit the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, without the prior written consent of the Parent, to
agree to the payment of any money to any third Person (except regular filing
fees with Governmental Authorities) to obtain any such third Persons consent

Agreement and Plan of Merger

-32- (e) If the Company shall fail to obtain any consent from a third Person
described in Section 7.03(d), the Company will use its reasonable best
efforts, and will take any such actions reasonably requested by the Parent, to
limit the adverse effect upon the Company and the Parent, their respective
Subsidiaries, and their respective businesses resulting, or that could
reasonably be expected to result after the Effective Time, from the failure to
obtain such consent.



(f) The Company shall not settle or offer to settle any action, suit,
investigation or proceeding against the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or
any of their respective directors or officers by any stockholder of the
Company arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions

Parent. The Company shall not cooperate with any Person that may seek to

by this Agreement, and the Company shall cooperate with the Parent in
resisting any such effort to restrain, enjoin, prohibit, or otherwise oppose
such transactions.



Section 7.04 _State Takeover Statutes_. If any state takeover statute or
state Law that purports to limit or restrict business combinations or the
ability to acquire or vote shares is or may become applicable to the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company and its
Board of Directors will grant such approvals and take such other actions as
are necessary so that such transactions may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate
or minimize the effects of such statute or Law on this Agreement and such
transactions.



Section 7.05 _[Reserved]_.



Section 7.06 _Assumption of Obligations to Issue Stock and Obligations of
Employee Benefit Plans; Employees_.



(a) Automatically and without any consent or action on the part of the
holder thereof, each Company Stock Option that is outstanding and unexercised
immediately prior to the Effective Time will at the Effective Time cease to
represent a right to acquire shares of Company Common Stock and will be
assumed by the Parent and converted into an option to purchase that number of
shares of the Parent Common Stock equal to (decreased to the nearest whole
share): (i) the product of (1) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such option immediately prior to the Effective Time and (2) the
Merger Consideration divided by (ii) the Parent Common Stock Price. Each such
option will have an exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock equal to
(rounded up to the nearest whole cent): (i) the exercise price per share of
Company Common Stock under such option immediately prior to the Effective Time
multiplied by (ii) a fraction the numerator of which is equal to the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such option immediately prior to
the Effective Time and the denominator of which is equal to the number of
shares of the Parent Common Stock subject to such option immediately after the
Effective Time as calculated in accordance with the immediately preceding
sentence. After the Effective Time, except as provided above in this  



 

Agreement and Plan of Merger

-33-  Section 7.06(a), each such option will be exercisable upon and subject to
the same terms and conditions as were applicable under the related Company
Stock Option prior to the date hereof. In the case of any Company Stock
Option to which Section 421 of the Code applies by reason of the
qualifications under Section 422 of the Code, the exercise price, the number
of shares purchasable pursuant to such option and the terms and conditions of
exercise of such option will be determined in a manner that complies with
Section 424(a) of the Code. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, the
offering and contribution periods under the Company Stock Purchase Plans
shall terminate, the Company Common Stock shall be purchased as provided
pursuant to the terms of the Company Stock Purchase Plans and the Company
Stock Purchase Plans shall be terminated.



(b) On or prior to the Effective Time, the Company and the Parent will
take or cause to be taken all such actions as may be necessary or desirable
to authorize the transactions contemplated by paragraph (a) of this Section
7.06.



(c) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but in no
event later than fifteen (15) business days after the Effective Time),
the Parent will execute and deliver to each holder of a Company Stock Option
a document evidencing the Parents assumption of the Companys obligations
under the Company Stock Options, as adjusted pursuant to Section 7.06(a). From
and after the Effective Time, the Parent will take all corporate actions
necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of Parent
Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of the assumed Company Stock Options.



(d) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time (and in any
event within fifteen (15) business days after the Effective Time), the Parent
will file one or more Registration Statements on Form S-8 (or any successor or
other appropriate form) with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock
subject to the assumed Company Stock Options or otherwise issuable under
other Company Stock Plans and will take all actions reasonably necessary to
maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement or registration
statements (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses
contained therein) for so long as such options remain outstanding and to
comply with applicable state securities and "blue sky" Laws.



(e) Except as provided herein or as otherwise agreed to by the parties, each
of the Company Stock Plans providing for the issuance or grant of Company
Stock Options or Company Common Stock will be assumed as of the Effective Time
by the Parent with such amendments thereto as may be required to reflect the
Merger and the terms and conditions of this Agreement. 



(f) The Parent shall take all reasonable actions necessary or appropriate to
permit the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries (" _Company
Employees_ ") to continue to participate from and after the Closing Date in
the Current Company Benefit Plans maintained by the Company and
its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing Date other than the Company
Stock Purchase Plans. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parent may permit or
cause any such Current Company Benefit Plan to be terminated, discontinued or
merged into the comparable Parent Benefit Plan on or after the Closing Date,
provided that the Parent shall take all actions reasonably necessary or
appropriate to permit the Company Employees participating in such Current
Company Benefit Plan to immediately thereafter participate in the comparable
 



 

Agreement and Plan of Merger

-34-  Current Parent Benefit Plan maintained by the Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries for their similarly situated employees. If the Current Company
Benefit Plan that is terminated or discontinued by the Parent is a group
health plan, then the Parent shall permit each Company Employee participating
in such plan to be covered under a Current Parent Benefit Plan that (i)
provides medical and dental benefits to each such Company Employee effective
immediately upon the cessation of coverage of such individuals under such plan
and/or (ii) waives any pre-existing condition restrictions to the extent
necessary to provide immediate coverage and to the extent such restrictions
were not applicable under such plan of the Company. The Parent and the Current
Parent Benefit Plans shall recognize each Company Employees years of service
and level of seniority with the Company and its Subsidiaries for purposes of
terms of employment and eligibility, vesting and, with respect to vacation,
disability and severance benefits only, benefit determination, under the
Current Parent Benefit Plans. Parent shall cause the Company to honor, all
existing severance and acceleration arrangements under existing agreements
with the Companys officers and directors disclosed on Section 7.06(f) of the
Companys Disclosure Letter and shall cause the Company to pay to any employee
of the Company that is terminated by the Parent or the Company or any of
their Subsidiaries after the Effective Time and that is not subject to such
agreements an amount of severance pay that is consistent with the Parents
practice for similarly situated employees after giving credit for such
employees years of service to the Company.



(g) Nothing contained herein will be construed as requiring Parent to continue
any specific Benefit Plan, or to continue the employment of any specific
person.



Section 7.07 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_.



(a) From the Effective Time until the sixth anniversary thereof,
the Surviving Corporation shall fulfill and honor in all respects the
obligations of the Company to its present and former directors and officers
under any indemnification agreements and any provisions of the Companys
certificate of incorporation and bylaws as in effect on the date hereof. The
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation will contain
provisions with respect to exculpation and indemnification that are at least
as favorable to the Companys present and former directors and officers as
those contained in the Companys certificate of incorporation and bylaws as in
effect on the date hereof which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified in a manner adverse to Persons who were, immediately prior
to the Effective Time, directors or officers of the Company until after the
sixth anniversary of the Effective Time unless such modification is required
by Law.



(b) The Parent will use its reasonable best efforts to cause to be maintained
in effect from the Effective Time until the second anniversary thereof
policies of directors and officers liability insurance covering those
Persons who are currently covered by the Companys directors and officers
liability insurance policies providing substantially the same coverage and
limits and containing terms and conditions that are not materially less
advantageous taken as a whole with respect to claims arising from facts or
events that occurred before the Effective Time as under current policies
maintained by the Company; _provided, however,_ that in no event will the
Parent be required to expend annually more than 200 percent of the last annual
premium paid by the Company prior to the date hereof for such insurance
(the amount of which is set forth in Section 7.07 of the Companys Disclosure
Letter), but in such event shall purchase as much coverage as reasonably
practicable for such amount.



 

Agreement and Plan of Merger

-35- (c) The provisions of this Section 7.07 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and will be enforceable by, each Person entitled to indemnification hereunder
and the heirs and representatives of such Person.



Section 7.08 _Merger Sub_. Prior to the Effective Time, Merger Sub will not
conduct any business or make any investments other than as
specifically contemplated by this Agreement and will not have any assets
(other than a de minimis amount of cash paid to Merger Sub for the valid
issuance of its stock to the Parent).



Section 7.09 _Resignations_. On or prior to the Closing Date, the Company will
deliver to the Parent evidence satisfactory to the Parent of the resignations
of the directors of the Company, and to the extent requested by the Parent, of
any of its Subsidiaries, such resignations to be effective as of the Effective
Time.



Section 7.10 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company shall take all steps as may be required to cause
(i) the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii)
any acquisitions of Parent Common Stock resulting from the operation of
Section 7.06 of this Agreement by each individual who will be immediately
following the Effective Time subject to the reporting requirements of Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Parent, and (iii) any
dispositions of the Company Common Stock resulting from the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who will
be immediately prior to the Effective Time subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
the Company, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act in
accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in that certain No-Action
Letter, dated January 12, 1999, issued by the Commission to Skadden, Arps,
Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP. 



Section 7.11 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release concerning the
Merger will be a joint press release. Thereafter, so long as this Agreement is
in effect, neither the Company nor the Parent, nor any of their respective
Affiliates, shall issue or cause the publication of any press release
or other announcement with respect to the Merger or this Agreement without
the prior written consent of each of the other parties to this Agreement,
except as such party determines may be required by law or by any listing
agreement with or listing rules of a national securities exchange or the
Nasdaq National Market, in which case, the party proposing to issue such press
release or make such public announcement shall use its reasonable best efforts
to consult in good faith with the other party before issuing such press
release or making such public announcements.
