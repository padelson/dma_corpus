**_AGREEMENT  AND PLAN OF MERGER_**

 

 

THIS  AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " **Agreement** "), dated as of 
July 19, 2007, is made and entered into by and between WesBanco, Inc., a
West  Virginia corporation (" **Buyer** "), WesBanco Bank, Inc., a West 
Virginia banking corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Buyer (" **WB 
Sub** "), Oak Hill Financial, Inc., an Ohio corporation  (" **Seller** "),
and Oak Hill Banks, an Ohio state-chartered bank  and a wholly owned
subsidiary of Seller (" **Seller Sub** "). Buyer  and Seller are sometimes
hereinafter collectively referred to as the " **Constituent Corporations**."

 

 

W  I T N E  S S E T H:

 

 

WHEREAS,  the Boards of Directors of Seller, Seller Sub, Buyer and WB Sub
have each  determined that it is in the best interests of their respective
corporations  and  shareholders for Buyer to acquire Seller pursuant to a
merger of Seller with  and  into Buyer (the " **Merger** ") upon the terms
and subject to the  conditions set forth in this Agreement; and

 

 

WHEREAS,  the Boards of Directors of Seller, Seller Sub, Buyer and WB Sub
have each  approved this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated  hereby; and

 

 

WHEREAS,  as a result of the Merger, in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement,  Seller will cease to have a separate corporate existence and the
shareholders  of  Seller will receive from Buyer in exchange for each share
of common stock,  without par value, of Seller (individually " **Seller
Share** " and  collectively " **Seller Shares** "), (a) $38.00 in cash, or
(b) 1.256  shares of common stock, $2.0833 par value per share, of Buyer
(individually  " **Buyer Share** " and collectively " **Buyer  Shares** "),
as may be adjusted as provided herein, all as determined in  accordance with
the terms of this Agreement; and

 

 

WHEREAS,  as a condition to the willingness of Buyer to enter into this
Agreement, the  directors of Seller who will be continuing directors of Buyer
and Evan E. Davis,  a director emeritus of Seller (the **" Voting Agreement 
Shareholders"**), have each entered into a Voting Agreement, dated as of  the
date hereof, with Buyer (each a **" Voting Agreement"**),  pursuant to which
each Voting Agreement Shareholder has agreed, among other  things, to vote
such Voting Agreement Shareholder's Seller Shares in favor of  the approval
of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, upon  the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth in the Voting Agreement;  and

 

 

WHEREAS,  after the Merger, the parties intend that Seller Sub shall continue
as an  Ohio-chartered financial institution for so long as Buyer deems
appropriate  in  light of current business conditions but nothing herein
shall prevent Buyer  from  making changes to the charter of Seller Sub,
merging or dissolving Seller Sub,  or undertaking any similar type of
corporate reorganization in the future in  light of then-current business
conditions; and

 

 

WHEREAS,  for Federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger
contemplated  by  this Agreement qualify as a "reorganization" under the
provisions of Section  368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the " **Code** ") and that this Agreement

 

 

**8**

 

 

 

is  intended to be and is adopted as a "plan of reorganization" for purposes
of the  Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder; and

 

 

WHEREAS,  Seller has previously provided to Buyer a schedule disclosing
additional  information about Seller (the " **Seller Disclosure Schedule**
"),  and Buyer has previously provided to Seller a schedule disclosing
additional  information about Buyer (the " **Buyer Disclosure Schedule**
");  and

 

 

WHEREAS,  the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and
agreements  in  connection with the Merger and also to prescribe certain
conditions to the  Merger.

 

 

NOW,  THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the respective
representations,  warranties, covenants, agreements and conditions
hereinafter set forth, the  parties, intending to be legally bound hereby,
agree as follows:

---|--- 
    

 



 

        

    |

    |  

Each  Seller Stock Option (as defined below) which is outstanding and 
unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, upon the  election
of the holder thereof, be terminated immediately prior to  the  Effective
Time and each holder thereof shall be entitled to receive,  in  lieu of each
Seller Share that would otherwise have been issuable  upon  exercise
thereof, an amount in cash equal to the excess, if any,  of $38.00  over the
exercise price of such Seller Stock Option. Such  amount shall be subject to
any required tax withholding. Cash  amounts paid pursuant to this Section
2.02(a)(i) shall be excluded  from  determining the Total Cash Amount.

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

        

    |  

(ii)

    |  

Each  Seller Stock Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective 
Time  that is not terminated pursuant to Section 2.02(a)(i) above shall 
be  amended and converted into an option (an " **Adjusted  Option** ") to
purchase a number of Buyer Shares (rounded to the  nearest whole share) equal
to (A) the number of Seller Shares subject  to  such Seller Stock Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time  multiplied by (B) the Exchange
Ratio; and the per share exercise  price for  the Buyer Shares issuable upon
the exercise of such Adjusted Option  shall  be equal to (Y) the exercise
price per share of the Seller Shares  at which  such Seller Stock Option was
exercisable immediately prior to the  Effective Time divided by (Z) the
Exchange Ratio (rounded to the  nearest  whole cent); provided, however,
that in the case of any Seller Stock  Option to which Section 421 of the Code
applies by reason of its  qualification under Section 422 of the Code, the
conversion formula  shall  be adjusted, if necessary, to comply with Section
424(a) of the  Code. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Adjusted
Options  shall be subject to the same terms and conditions as provided in 
the  Seller Stock Option Plans.

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

        

    |  

(b)

    |  

The  adjustments provided herein with respect to any Seller Stock Options 
that  are "incentive stock options" as defined in Section 422 of the Code
shall  be and are intended to be effected in a manner which is consistent 
with  Sections 422 and 424(a) of the Code and all regulations promulgated 
thereunder. The adjustments provided herein with respect to all  other Seller
Stock Options shall be and are intended to be effected  in a  manner which
is consistent with Section 409A of the Code and all  regulations promulgated
thereunder, including Treasury Regulation  Section  1, 409A - 1(b)(5)(v) and
in order to prevent any penalty pursuant to  Section 409A of the Code.

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

        

    |  

(c)

    |  

At  the Effective Time, Buyer shall assume the Seller Stock Option Plans, 
with  the result that all obligations of Seller under the Seller Stock 
Option  Plans (as that term is defined in Section 3.01(b)) with respect to 
the  Adjusted Options shall be obligations of Buyer following the Effective 
Time.

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

**12**

 

 

        

    |  

(d)

    |  

On  or prior to the date that is twenty (20) days after the Effective 
Time,  Buyer shall prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement 
on Form  S-8 (or another appropriate form) registering a number of shares 
of Buyer  Shares equal to at least the number of shares subject to the
Adjusted  Options. Such registration statement shall be kept effective  (and
the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses required  thereby 
shall be maintained) as long as any Adjusted Options may remain  outstanding.

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

        

    |  

(e)

    |  

Except  as otherwise specifically provided by this Section 2.02 and except 
to the  extent required under the respective terms of Seller Stock Options 
as in  effect on the date of this Agreement, all restrictions or
limitations  on  transfer with respect to Seller Stock Options awarded under
Seller  Stock  Option Plans or any other plan, program or arrangement of
Seller  or any of  its subsidiaries, to the extent that such restrictions or
limitations  shall not have already lapsed, and all other terms thereof,
shall  remain  in full force and effect with respect to such options after
giving  effect  to the Merger and the assumption by Buyer as set forth
above; provided,  however, that so long as compliant with Section 409A of the
Code  the  options held by those individuals listed on Seller Disclosure
Schedule  2.02(e) shall not lapse prematurely, notwithstanding anything to 
the  contrary in the terms of the Seller Stock Option Plans or the
individual  option agreements, as a result of the termination of the
service  of those  individuals as directors of Seller after the Merger, and
after the  Merger  the terms of the Seller Stock Option Plans shall be
deemed to have  been so  modified. Notwithstanding this Section 2.02(e),
Seller shall  cause all Seller Stock Options to fully vest at the Effective
Time  to the  extent not previously vested.

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

        

    |  

(f)

    |  

In  addition to any method of exercise permitted under the applicable 
Seller  Stock Option, a holder of an Adjusted Option may exercise such
Adjusted  Option in whole or in part in accordance with its terms by
delivering  a  properly executed notice of exercise to Buyer, together with
the  consideration therefor and the federal withholding tax information, 
if  any, required in accordance with the related Seller Stock Option  Plan.

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

**2.03.** **_Election  and Exchange and Payment Procedures_**

 

 

        

    |  

(a)

    |  

_Election  Procedure_. An election form and other appropriate and  customary
transmittal materials (which shall specify that delivery  shall  be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificates theretofore 
representing the Seller Shares shall pass, only upon proper delivery  of 
such certificates to the Exchange Agent (as defined below)) in such  form 
as Buyer and Seller shall mutually agree (the " **Election  Form** ") shall
be mailed at least 30 calendar days prior to the  anticipated Effective Time
or on such other date as Seller and Buyer  shall  mutually agree (the "
**Mailing Date** ") to each holder of  record of Seller Shares as of the
close of business on the fifth  Nasdaq  trading day prior to the Mailing
Date (the " **Election Form Record  Date** ").

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

**13**

 



 

        

    |  

(b)

    |  

_Election_. Each  Election Form shall permit the holder (or the beneficial
owner through  appropriate and customary documentation and instructions) to
specify  (i)  the number of such holder's Seller Shares with respect to
which such  holder elects to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration ("
**Stock  Election Shares** "), (ii) the number of such holder's Seller
Shares  with respect to which such holder elects to receive the Per Share 
Cash  Consideration (" **Cash Election Shares** "), or (iii) the  number of
such holder's Seller Shares with respect to which such holder  makes no
election (" **No Election Shares** "). All  Seller Shares with respect to
which the Exchange Agent has not received  an  effective, properly completed
Election Form on or before 5:00  p.m., three business days prior to the
Closing Date (or such  other time and date as Buyer and Seller may mutually
agree) (the  " **Election Deadline** ") shall also be deemed to be No 
Election Shares.

    
---|---|--- 
    

 



 

        

    |  

(c)

    |  

_Exchange  Agent; Election Forms_. Buyer will designate Computershare 
Investor Services, LLC or such other entity as reasonably shall be  approved
by Seller in writing to act as agent (the " **Exchange  Agent** ") for
purposes of conducting the election procedure and  the  exchange and payment
procedures as described in this Section  2.03. Buyer shall make available one
or more Election Forms as  may reasonably be requested from time to time by
all persons who  become  holders (or beneficial owners) of Seller Shares
between the Election  Form  Record Date and the close of business on the
business day prior to  the  Election Deadline, and Seller shall provide to
the Exchange Agent  all  information reasonably necessary for it to perform
as specified  herein.

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

        

    |  

(d)

    |  

_Proper  Election._ Any such election shall have been properly made  only if
the Exchange Agent shall have actually received a properly  completed
Election Form by the Election Deadline. An Election  Form shall be deemed
properly completed only if accompanied by one  or more  certificates (or
customary affidavits and, if required by Buyer,  indemnification regarding
the loss or destruction of such certificates  or  the guaranteed delivery of
such certificates) (provided that such  certificates are in fact delivered to
the Exchange Agent by the time  required in such guarantee of delivery; and
provided further, that  failure  to deliver Seller Shares covered by such
guarantee of delivery within  the  time set forth on such guarantee shall be
deemed to invalidate any  otherwise properly made election, unless otherwise
determined by  Buyer, in  its sole discretion) representing all Seller
Shares covered by such  Election Form, together with duly executed
transmittal materials  included  in the Election Form. For Seller Shares
held in book entry  form, Buyer shall establish procedures for delivery of
such shares,  which  procedures shall be reasonably acceptable to the
Seller. Any  Election Form may be revoked or changed by the person
submitting  such  Election Form at or prior to the Election Deadline. If
an  Election Form is revoked prior to the Election Deadline and a new 
Election  Form is not submitted prior to the Election Deadline, the Seller 
Shares  represented by such Election Form shall become No Election Shares 
and  Buyer shall cause the certificates representing such Seller Shares  to
be  returned without charge to the person submitting the Election Form 
upon  written request to that effect from the holder who submitted the 
Election  Form. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and of the Election 
Form, the  Exchange Agent shall have reasonable discretion to determine
whether  any  election, revocation or change has been properly or timely
made and  to  disregard immaterial defects in the Election Forms, and any
good  faith  decisions of the Exchange Agent regarding such matters shall be
binding  and conclusive. Neither Buyer nor the Exchange Agent shall be 
under any obligation to notify any person of any defect in the Election 
Form. In the event of the termination of this Agreement before  the Effective
Time, all Election Forms shall be null, void and of  no force  or effect and
all certificates shall be returned to holders of Seller  shares.

_Pro  Rata Allocation_. As soon as practicable, but in any event  no later
than ten (10) business days after the Election Deadline,  Buyer  shall cause
the Exchange Agent to effect the allocation among the  holders  of Seller
Shares of rights to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration  or  the Per
Share Cash Consideration in the Merger in accordance with  the  Election
Forms as follows:

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

        

    |  

(1)

    |  

_Cash  Election Amount More Than Total Cash Amount._ If the  aggregate cash
amount that would be paid upon the conversion in the  Merger  of the Cash
Election Shares (the " **Cash Election Amount** ")  is greater than the Total
Cash Amount,  then:

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

        

    |  

(A)

    |  

all  Stock Election Shares and No Election Shares shall be converted into 
the  right to receive the Per Share Stock  Consideration,

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

        

    |  

(B)

    |  

the  Exchange Agent shall then select from among the Cash Election Shares, 
by a  pro rata selection process, a sufficient number of shares (" **Stock 
Designated Shares** ") such that the aggregate cash amount that will  be paid
in the Merger (excluding, however, any cash paid in lieu  of  fractional
shares pursuant to 2.03(j) hereof, any cash paid to dissenting  shareholders
pursuant to Section 2.04 hereof and any cash paid in  respect  of options to
purchase Seller Shares under Section 2.02 or any other  provision of this
Agreement) equals as closely as practicable the  Total  Cash Amount, and all
Stock Designated Shares shall be converted into  the  right to receive the
Per Share Stock Consideration;  and

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

**15**

 

 

        

    |  

(C)

    |  

the  Cash Election Shares that are not Stock Designated Shares will be 
converted into the right to receive the Per Share Cash  Consideration.

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

        

    |  

(2)

    |  

_Cash  Election Amount Less Than Total Cash Amount._ If the Cash  Election
Amount is less than the Total Cash Amount,  then:

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

        

    |  

(A)

    |  

all  Cash Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive  the
Per  Share Cash Consideration;

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

        

    |  

(B)

    |  

the  Exchange Agent shall then select first from among the No Election 
Shares  and then (if necessary) from among the Stock Election Shares, by  a
pro  rata selection process (excluding, to the extent possible, Seller 
Shares  acquired through the exercise of any incentive stock option at any 
time  within twelve months prior to the Effective Time, which shares are 
identified in Section 2.01(e)(2)(B) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule),  a 
sufficient number of shares (" **Cash Designated Shares** ")  such that the
aggregate cash amount that will be paid in the Merger  (excluding, however,
without limitation, any cash paid in respect  of  options to purchase Seller
Shares under Section 2.02 or any other  provision of this Agreement) equals
as closely as practicable the  Total  Cash Amount, and all Cash Designated
Shares shall be converted into  the  right to receive the Per Share Cash
Consideration;  and

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

        

    |  

(C)

    |  

the  Stock Election Shares and the No Election Shares that are not Cash 
Designated Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the  Per 
Share Stock Consideration.

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

        

    |  

(3)

    |  

_Cash  Election Amount Equal to Total Cash Amount._ If the Cash  Election
Amount is equal or nearly equal (as determined by the Exchange  Agent) to the
Total Cash Amount, then subparagraphs (1) and (2) above  shall not apply, all
Cash Election Shares shall be converted into  the  right to receive the Per
Share Cash Consideration and all Stock Election  Shares and No Election
Shares shall be converted into the right to  receive  the Per Share Stock
Consideration.

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

The  pro  rata selection process to be used by the Exchange Agent shall
consist of such  equitable pro ration processes as shall be mutually
agreeable to Buyer and  Seller. For purposes of this Agreement, "
**business  day** " means Monday through Friday of each week, except any
legal holiday  recognized as such by the U.S. Government or any day on which
banking  institutions in the State of Ohio or the State of West Virginia are
authorized  or obligated to close.

_Deposit  with Exchange Agent; Exchange Fund_. At or prior to the  Effective
Time, Buyer shall provide to the Exchange Agent the number  of  Buyer Shares
issuable pursuant to Sections 2.01(a) and 2.03, the  Total  Cash Amount, the
cash in respect of fractional Buyer Shares payable  pursuant to Section
2.03(j), and the amount of all other cash payable  in  the Merger, if any,
all of which shall be held by the Exchange Agent  in  trust for the holders
of Seller Shares (collectively, the  " **Exchange Fund** "). The Exchange
Agent shall not  be entitled to vote or exercise any rights of ownership with
respect  to  the Buyer Shares held by it from time to time hereunder, except
that  it  shall receive and hold in trust for the recipients of the Buyer
Shares  until distributed thereto pursuant to the provisions of this
Agreement  any  dividends or other distributions paid or distributed with
respect  to such  Buyer Shares for the account of the persons entitled 
thereto. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose  other than as
set forth in this paragraph. The Exchange Agent  shall invest cash in the
Exchange Fund, as directed by Buyer, on  a daily  basis; provided, however,
that all such investments shall be in (1)  obligations of, or guaranteed by,
the United States of America, (2)  commercial paper obligations receiving the
highest rating from either  Moody's Investors Services, Inc. or Standard and
Poor's Corporation, or  (3) certificates of deposit of commercial banks (not
including any  Subsidiary or affiliate of Buyer) with capital exceeding
$1.0  billion. All interest and other income resulting from such 
investments shall be paid to Buyer.

(g)

    |  

_Surrender  of Seller Certificates_. As promptly as practicable after  the
Effective Time, Buyer shall send or cause to be sent to each  former  holder
of record of Seller Shares who has not previously properly  surrendered all
such Seller Shares with an Election Form and transmittal  materials (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and  risk  of loss and title
to the certificates theretofore representing the  Seller  Shares shall pass
only upon proper delivery of such certificates  to the  Exchange Agent).
Each holder of an outstanding certificate or certificates  which prior to the
Effective Time represented Seller Shares  (" **Seller Certificate** "), who
surrenders such Seller  Certificate to the Exchange Agent shall, upon
acceptance thereof  by the  Exchange Agent, be entitled to receive (a) the
Merger Consideration,  (b)  if such holder's Seller Shares have been
converted into Buyer Shares, any  cash in lieu of fractional shares which the
Seller Shares represented  by  the Seller Certificate have been converted
pursuant to Sections 2.01  and  Section 2.03(j) hereof, (c) any other
dividend or distribution with  a  record date after the Effective Time
theretofore paid with respect  to  Buyer Shares issuable in the Merger in
accordance with this Section  2.03(g) and (d) any dividend or distribution
with respect to Seller's  Shares with a record date prior to the Effective
Time that had not  been  paid at the Effective Time in accordance with
Section 2.03(i), in  each  case without interest. The Exchange Agent shall
accept such  Seller Certificate upon compliance with such reasonable terms
and  conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose to affect an orderly 
exchange  thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices and shall as 
promptly  as practicable issue the certificates representing Buyer Shares
and/or  cash in accordance with this Agreement. Each Seller Certificate 
that is not surrendered to the Exchange Agent in accordance with  the 
procedures provided for herein shall, except as otherwise herein  provided, 
be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only  the right 
to receive upon such surrender the (a) the Merger Consideration,  (b) if 
such holder's Seller Shares have been converted into Buyer Shares, any  cash
in lieu of fractional shares which the Seller Shares represented  by  the
Seller Certificate have been converted pursuant to Section 2.01  and 
Section 2.03(j) hereof, (c) any other dividend or distribution with  a 
record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect  to 
Buyer Shares issuable in the merger in accordance with this Section  2.03(g)
and (d) any dividend or distribution with respect to Seller's  Shares with a
record date prior to the Effective Time that had  not been paid at the
Effective Time in accordance with Section 2.03(i),  in  each case without
interest. No dividends or other distributions with  a  record date after the
Effective Time with respect to Buyer Shares  shall be  paid to the holder of
any unsurrendered Seller Certificate until  the  holder thereof shall
surrender such Seller Certificate in accordance  with  this Section 2.03(g).
After the surrender of a Seller Certificate  in  accordance with this
Section 2.03(g), the record holder thereof shall  be  entitled to receive
any such dividends or other distributions, without  any  interest thereon,
which theretofore had become payable with respect  to  Buyer Shares
represented by such Seller Certificates. After the  Effective Time, there
shall be no further transfer on the records  of  Seller of a Seller
Certificate representing Seller Shares and, if  any such  Seller Certificate
is presented to Seller for transfer, it shall  be  canceled against delivery
of the Merger Consideration as provided  in  Article Two.

then  the  Exchange Agent, in the absence of actual notice to it that any
Seller Shares  theretofore represented by any such Seller Certificate have
been acquired by  a  bona fide purchaser, shall deliver to such person (a)
the Merger Consideration,  (b) if such holder's Seller Shares have been

_No  Further Ownership Rights in Seller Shares_. All cash and  Buyer Shares
issued upon conversion of Seller Shares in accordance  with  the terms
hereof (including any cash paid pursuant to Section 2.03(g)  or  2.03(j))
shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction  of all  rights
pertaining to such Seller Shares, _subject, however_ , to the  Surviving
Corporation's obligation to pay any dividends or make any other 
distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time which  may 
have been declared or made by Seller on such Seller Shares in accordance 
with the terms of this Agreement prior to the Effective Time and  which 
remain unpaid at the Effective  Time.

    |  

(i)

    |  

No  certificates or scrip representing fractional Buyer Shares shall  be
issued  upon the surrender for exchange of Seller Certificates evidencing 
Seller  Shares, and such fractional Buyer Share interests will not entitle 
the  owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a shareholder of the
Surviving  Corporation.

Each  holder of Seller Shares who would otherwise be entitled to receive

of  cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (a) the fractional 
Buyer  Share interest to which such holder (after taking into account all 
Seller  Shares held at the Effective Time by such holder) would otherwise 
be  entitled by (b) $38.00.

to the Exchange Agent by Buyer pursuant to Section 2.03(f)  which  remains
undistributed to the shareholders of Seller for 12 months  after  the
Effective Time may be delivered to the Surviving Corporation,  upon  Buyer's
demand, and any shareholders of Seller who have not theretofore  complied
with this Article Two shall thereafter look only to the  Surviving 
Corporation for payment of the Per Share Stock Consideration, the  Per

or the Exchange Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect  to 
the making of such payment under the Code, or any other provision  of 
domestic or foreign (whether national, federal, state, provincial,  local

as having been paid to the holder of the Seller  Certificates in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was  made  by Buyer, the Surviving

**2.04. _Seller  Shareholders ' Dissenters' Rights_**

 

 

Anything  contained in this Agreement or elsewhere to the contrary
notwithstanding, if  any  holder of an outstanding Seller Share who is
entitled to demand and properly  demands payment of the " **fair cash value**
" of such Seller Share  in accordance with Section 1701.85 of the OGCL (a "
**Seller Dissenting  Share** "), then such Seller Dissenting Share shall not
be converted into  the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and
instead:

 

 

        

    |  

(a)

    |  

Each  such Seller Dissenting Share shall nevertheless be deemed to be 
extinguished at the Effective Time as provided elsewhere in this  Agreement;

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

        

    |  

(b)

    |  

Each  holder perfecting such dissenters' rights shall thereafter have only
such  rights (and shall have such obligations) as are provided in Section 
1701.85 of the OGCL, and the Surviving Corporation shall not be required  to
deliver any cash payments to such person in substitution for each  such 
Seller Dissenting Share in accordance with this Agreement; _provided, 
however_ , that if any such person shall have failed to perfect or  shall
withdraw or lose such holder's rights under Section 1701.85 of the  OGCL,
each such holder's Seller Dissenting Share shall thereupon be deemed  to have
been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to  receive  the Per
Share Stock Consideration or the Per Share Cash Consideration,  as  shall
have been designated on the Election Form submitted by such  holder  prior
to the Election Deadline, or if no such designation shall have  been  made,
the Per Share Cash Consideration, without any interest thereon,  pursuant to
Section 2.01 and subject to Section  2.03.

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

No  holder of a Seller Dissenting Share  shall be entitled to submit a
letter of transmittal, and any letter of  transmittal submitted by a holder
of a Seller Dissenting Share shall be invalid,  unless and until the demand
for the payment of the fair cash value made in  respect of such Seller
Dissenting Share shall have been or is deemed to have  been withdrawn.

 

 

**2.05. _Anti-Dilution  Provisions_**

 

 

In  the  event that, subsequent to the date of this Agreement but prior to
the Effective  Time, the outstanding Buyer Shares are increased, decreased,
changed into or  exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or
securities (or Buyer  establishes a record date for effecting any such change
to the outstanding  Buyer  Shares) as a result of a reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification,  stock dividend, stock split, reverse
stock split or other like changes in  Buyer's capitalization, an appropriate
and proportionate adjustment shall be  made to the Merger Consideration.
Nothing contained herein shall be  deemed to permit any action which may be
proscribed by this  Agreement.

    |  

Seller  and the Seller Subsidiaries have filed all reports, registration 
statements, proxy statements and information statements required  to be 
filed by Seller or any of the Seller Subsidiaries subsequent to December  31,
2003 under the Securities Act (as defined in Section 5.05(a)),  or  under
Sections 13(a), 13(c), 14 and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange  Act  of
1934, as amended (the " **Exchange Act** ") with the SEC  (together with all
information incorporated therein by reference,  the  " **Seller SEC
Documents** "), except for any reports,  registration statements, proxy
statements or information statements  the  failure to file which would not
have a material adverse effect upon  Seller. All such filings, at the time of
filing, complied in  all material respects as to form and included all
exhibits required  to be  filed under the applicable rules of the SEC
applicable to such Seller  SEC  Documents. None of such documents, as
subsequently supplemented  or amended prior to the date hereof, when filed,
contained any untrue  statement of a material fact or omitted to state a
material fact  required  to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements  therein,  in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not  misleading.

    |  

The  records, systems, controls, data and information of Seller and the 
Seller  Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under 
means  (including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process,
whether  computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and
direct  control of Seller or the Seller Subsidiaries or accountants
(including  all  means of access thereto and therefrom), except for any non-
exclusive  ownership and non-direct control that would not reasonably be
expected  to  have a material adverse effect on Seller. Seller (x) has
implemented  and  maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
in Rule  13a-15(e)  under the Exchange Act) to ensure that material
information relating  to  Seller, including its consolidated Subsidiaries,
is made known to  the  chief executive officer and the chief financial
officer of Seller  by  others within those entities, and (y) has disclosed,
based on its  most  recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to Seller's
outside auditors  and the audit committee of the Seller Board (i) any
significant  deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation
of  internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) 
of  the Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to adversely affect 
Seller's  ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information,  and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management  or  other employees who have a significant role in Seller's
internal controls  over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f)
under the  Exchange  Act). These disclosures were made in writing by
management to Seller's  auditors and audit committee and a copy has
previously been made  available  to Buyer. As of the date hereof, there is
no reason to believe that  Seller's outside auditors and its chief executive
officer and chief  financial officer will not be able to give the
certifications and  attestations required pursuant to the rules and
regulations adopted  pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002 (the  **" Sarbanes-Oxley Act"**), without qualification, when next 
due.

any of  the Seller Subsidiaries has received or otherwise had or obtained 
actual  knowledge of any material complaint, allegation, assertion or
claim,  whether written or oral, regarding the accounting or auditing
practices,  procedures, methodologies or methods of Seller or any of the
Seller  Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting controls,
including  any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that
Seller  or any  of the Seller Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable
accounting  or  auditing practices, and (ii) no attorney representing Seller
or any  of the  Seller Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by Seller or
any of  the  Seller Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a material
violation  of  securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar
violation by  Seller  or any of its officers, directors, employees or agents
to the Seller  Board  or any committee thereof or to any director or officer
of  Seller.

opinion with respect to the financial statements included in the  Seller 
SEC Documents is, and has been throughout the periods covered thereby 
"independent" within the meaning of Rule 2-01 of Regulation  S-X. Grant
Thornton LLP has not resigned or been dismissed as  an independent public
accountant of the Seller as a result of or  in  connection with any
disagreement with the Seller on a matter of accounting  principles or
practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing  scope  or procedure.

and except as arising hereunder, Seller  and the  Seller Subsidiaries have
no liabilities or obligations (whether accrued,  absolute, contingent or
otherwise) at March 31, 2007 (the " **Seller  Balance Sheet Date** "), other
than liabilities and obligations that  individually or in the aggregate would
not reasonably be expected  have a  material adverse effect on Seller.

not been any material adverse change  in the business, operations, assets or
financial condition of Seller  and  the Seller Subsidiaries taken as a
whole, and, to the actual knowledge  of  Seller, no fact or condition exists
which Seller believes will cause  such  a material adverse change in the
future; and (b) Seller has not taken  or permitted any of the actions
described in Section 5.01(b) of this  Agreement (except as set forth on

_Loan  Documentation_. To Seller's knowledge the documentation  (" **Loan
Documentation** ") governing or relating to the  material loan and credit-
related assets (" **Loan Assets** ")  included in the loan portfolio of
Seller Sub is legally sufficient  for the  purposes intended thereby and
creates enforceable rights of Seller  Sub in  accordance in all material
respects with the terms of such Loan  Documentation, subject to applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency,  reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent convey­ance
and other similar  laws relating to or affecting the enforcement of
creditors' rights  generally, by general equitable principles (regardless of
whether  enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) 
and by  an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, except for such 
insufficiencies as would not have a material adverse effect on  Seller.
Except as set forth in the Seller Filed SEC Documents  or in Section 3.01(j)
of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, no debtor  under  any of the Loan
Documentation has asserted as of the date hereof  any claim  or defense with
respect to the subject matter thereof, which claim  or  defense, if
determined adversely to Seller, would have a material  adverse  effect on
Seller. All loans and extensions of credit that have  been made by Seller Sub
comply in all material respects with applicable  regulatory limitations and
procedures except for such failures to  comply  as would not have a material
adverse effect on  Seller.

including, without limitation, portions of outstanding lines of credit,  loan
commitments and loan guaranties (collectively,  **" Loans"**), on Seller's or

with Seller's lending  standards in the ordinary course of business; is
evidenced by appropriate  and sufficient documentation; to the extent
secured, has been secured  by  valid liens and security interests which have
been perfected; and  constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of
the obligor  named  therein, enforceable in accordance with its terms,
subject to bankruptcy,  insolvency, fraudulent conveyance and other laws of
general applicability  relating to or affecting creditor's rights and to
general equity  principles. Seller has previously made available to Buyer

complied in all material  respects with applicable requirements of law and
rules and regulations  in  effect at the time such documents and reports
were filed and contained  in  all material respects the information required
to be stated therein,  except for such documents and records the failure to

untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state  a  material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order  to make  the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which  they  were made, not
misleading, other than such reports and documents  which the  failure to

Schedule, neither the Internal Revenue  Service (the " **IRS** ") nor any
other taxing agency or  authority, domestic or foreign, has asserted, is now
asserting or,  to the  actual knowledge of Seller, is threatening to assert
against Seller  or any  of the Seller Subsidiaries any deficiency or claim

Disclosure Schedule,  neither  Seller nor any Seller Subsidiary is a party
to any agreement, contract,  arrangement or plan that has resulted, or could
result, individually  or in  the aggregate, in the payment of "excess
parachute payments" within the  meaning of Section 280G of the Code. Except
as set forth in  Section 3.01(m) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, neither
Seller  nor any  of the Seller Subsidiaries has ever been a member of an
affiliated  group  of corporations, within the meaning of Section 1504 of
the Code,  other  than an affiliated group of which Seller is or was the

Section  3.01(t)(i) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule contains a complete 
and  accurate list of all bonus, incentive, deferred compensation, pension 
(including, without limitation, Seller Pension Plans defined below), 
retirement, profit-sharing, thrift, savings, employee stock ownership,  stock

(including, without limitation, "welfare plans" within the meaning  of
Section 3(1) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of  1974, as 
amended (" **ERISA** ")), fringe benefit plans, employment,  change in
control, retention or severance agreements, consulting  agreements or
arrangements and all similar practices, policies and  arrangements maintained
or contributed to (currently or within the  last  six years) by (A) Seller
or any of the Seller Subsidiaries and in  which  any employee or former
employee (the " **Seller Employees** "),  consultant or former consultant
(the __ " **Seller  Consultants** "), officer or former officer (the "
**Seller  Officers** "), or director or former director (the " **Seller 
Directors** ") of Seller or any of the Seller Subsidiaries  participates or
to which any such Seller Employees, Seller Consultants,  Seller Officers or
Seller Directors either participate or are parties  or  (B) any Seller ERISA
Affiliate (as defined below) (collectively,  the  " **Compensation** **and**
**Benefit** **Plans** "). However,  Compensation and Benefit Plans does not
include plans, funds, programs,  policies, practices or procedures that are
maintained or funded (A)  by  Seller Employees, Seller Consultants, Seller
Officers or Seller Directors  for their own benefit or for the benefit of
their employees, such  as  individual retirement arrangements or plans
described in Code §401(a)  benefiting (or intended to benefit) themselves or
persons who are  not  Seller Employees or (B) by persons or entities who are
not ERISA  Affiliates (as defined below). **** Neither Seller nor  any of
the Seller Subsidiaries has any commitment to create any additional 
Compensation and Benefit Plan or to modify or change any existing 
Compensation and Benefit Plan, except to the extent required by law  and as 
otherwise contemplated by Sections 6.02 and 7.01 **** of  this Agreement.

    |  

(ii)

    |  

Except  in a manner that would not have a material adverse effect, each 
Compensation and Benefit Plan has been operated and administered  in 
accordance with its terms and with applicable law, including, but  not 
limited to, ERISA, the Code, the Securities Act (as defined in Section 
5.05(a)) the Exchange Act (as defined in Section 3.01(g)), the Age 
Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (the **" Age Discrimination  in
Employment Act"**), or any regulations or rules promulgated  thereunder, and
all filings, disclosures and notices required by  ERISA,  the Code, the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the Age Discrimination  in  Employment Act
and any other applicable law have been timely  made. Each Compensation and
Benefit Plan which is an "employee  pension benefit plan" within the meaning
of Section 3(2) of ERISA (a  " **Seller** **Pension** **Plan** ")  and which
is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the  Code has received a
favorable determination letter from the IRS and  Seller  is not aware of any
circumstances likely to result in revocation  of any  such favorable
determination letter. There is no material  pending or, to the actual
knowledge of Seller, threatened legal action,  suit or claim relating to the
Compensation and Benefit Plans other  than  routine claims for benefits
thereunder. Neither Seller nor any  of the Seller Subsidiaries has engaged in
a transaction, or omitted  to  take any action, with respect to any
Compensation and Benefit Plan  that  would reasonably be expected to subject
Seller or any of the Seller  Subsidiaries to a tax or penalty imposed by
either Section 4975 of  the  Code or Section 502 of ERISA, assuming for
purposes of Section 4975  of the Code that the taxable period of any such
transaction expired  as of  the date hereof.

(iii)

    |  

No  liability (other than for payment of premiums to the Pension Benefit 
Guaranty Corporation (" **PBGC** ") which have been made or  will be made on
a timely basis) under Title IV of ERISA has been or  is expected to be
incurred by Seller or any of the Seller Subsidiaries  with respect to any
ongoing, frozen or terminated "single-employer plan,"  within the meaning of
Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA, currently or  formerly maintained by any of
them, or any single-employer plan of  any  entity (a " **Seller** **ERISA**
**Affiliate  Plan** ") which is considered one employer with Seller under
Section  4001(a)(14) of ERISA or Section 414(b), (c) or (m) of the Code  (a
" **Seller** **ERISA  Affiliate** "). During the six years prior to the 
Effective Time, none of Seller, the Seller Subsidiaries nor any Seller  ERISA
Affiliate has contributed, or has been obligated to contribute,  to a 
multiemployer plan under Subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA (as defined  in 
ERISA Sections 3(37)(A) and 4001(a)(3)). No notice of a  "reportable event",
within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA, for  which the 30-day reporting
requirement has not been waived, has been  required to be filed for any
Compensation and Benefit Plan or by  any  Seller ERISA Affiliate Plan within
the 12-month period ending on  the date  hereof, and no such notice will be
required to be filed as a result  of the  transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The PBGC has not  instituted proceedings to terminate any Seller
Pension Plan or Seller  ERISA Affiliate Plan and, to Seller's actual
knowledge, no condition  exists that presents a material risk that such
proceedings will be  instituted. There is no pending investigation or
enforcement  action by the PBGC, the Department of Labor (" **DOL** "), the 
IRS or any other Governmental Authority with respect to any Compensation  and
Benefit Plan and, to Seller's actual knowledge, no such investigation  or
action is threatened or anticipated. Under each Seller  Pension Plan and
Seller ERISA Affiliate Plan, as of the date of the  most  recent actuarial
valuation performed prior to the date of this Agreement,  the actuarially
determined present value of all "benefit liabilities",  within the meaning of
Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA (as determined on  the basis of the actuarial
assumptions contained in such actuarial  valuation of such Seller Pension
Plan or Seller ERISA Affiliate Plan),  did  not exceed the then current
value of the assets of such Seller Pension  Plan or Seller ERISA Affiliate
Plan and since such date there has  been  neither an adverse change in the
financial condition of such Seller  Pension Plan or Seller ERISA Affiliate
Plan nor any amendment or  other  change to such Seller Pension Plan or
Seller ERISA Affiliate Plan  that  would increase the amount of benefits
thereunder which reasonably  could be  expected to change such result and
that individually or in the aggregate  would have a material adverse effect
on  Seller.

and  Benefit Plan or Seller ERISA Affiliate Plan or any employee benefit 
arrangements under any collective bargaining agreement to which Seller  or 
any of the Seller Subsidiaries is a party have been timely made or  have 
been reflected on the Seller Financial Statements. Neither any  Seller
Pension Plan nor any Seller ERISA Affiliate Plan has an  "accumulated funding
deficiency" (whether or not waived) within the  meaning of Section 412 of the
Code or Section 302 of ERISA and  all required payments to the PBGC with
respect to each Seller Pension  Plan  or Seller ERISA Affiliate Plan have
been made on or before their  due  dates. None of Seller, the Seller
Subsidiaries nor any Seller  ERISA Affiliate (x) has provided, or would
reasonably be expected  to be  required to provide, security to any Seller
Pension Plan or to any  Seller  ERISA Affiliate Plan pursuant to Section
401(a)(29) of the Code, and  (y) has taken any action, or omitted to take any
action, that has  resulted, or would reasonably be expected to result, in the
imposition  of  a lien under Section 412(n) of the Code or pursuant to ERISA
that  individually or in the aggregate would have a material adverse effect 
on  Seller.

obligations  to  provide retiree health and life insurance or other retiree
death  benefits  under any Compensation and Benefit Plan, other than
benefits mandated  by  Section 4980B of the Code or those derived from a
Seller's Pension  Plan.

of existing: (A) Seller Compensation and Benefit Plan  documents and
amendments thereto; (B) trust instruments and insurance  contracts; (C) most
recent actuarial report and financial statement;  (D) most recent summary
plan description; (E) forms filed with  the PBGC within the past year (other

3.01(t)(viii)  of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, the consummation of the
transactions  contemplated by this Agreement would not, directly or
indirectly  (including, without limitation, as a result of any termination
of  employment prior to or following the Effective Time), reasonably  be 
expected to (A) entitle any Employee, Consultant or Director to any  payment
(including severance pay or similar compensation) or any  increase  in
compensation, (B) result in the vesting or acceleration of any  benefits
under any Compensation and Benefit Plan of Seller, or  (C) result in any
material increase in benefits payable under any  Compensation and Benefit
Plan of  Seller.

of any termination  of employment prior to or following the Effective Time),
none of  Seller,  Buyer or the Surviving Corporation, or any of their
respective  Subsidiaries will be obligated to make a payment that would be 
characterized as an "excess parachute payment" to an individual who is a 
"disqualified individual" (as such terms are defined in Section 280G of  the
Code) of Seller on a consolidated basis, without regard to whether  such
payment is reasonable compensation for personal services performed  or  to
be performed in the future.

    |  

As  of April 30, 2007, the authorized capital stock of Buyer consisted  of 
50,000,000 common shares, $2.0833 par value per share, of which 20,899,540 
common shares were issued and outstanding and 2,855,939 common shares  were 
held in treasury by Buyer, and 1,000,000 preferred shares, no par  value 
per share, of which no shares were issued or outstanding. The  outstanding
Buyer Shares have been duly authorized and are validly  issued,  fully paid
and non-assessable, and were not issued in violation of  the  preemptive
rights of any person. All Buyer Shares to be issued  hereunder will be issued
in compliance with all applicable federal  and  state securities laws. As of
June 30, 2007, 1,000,000 Buyer  Shares were reserved for issuance upon the
exercise of outstanding  stock  options granted under Buyer's stock option
plans (the " **Buyer Stock  Option Plans** ") and 264,369 Buyer Shares were

to  issue, deliver or sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or sold,  any 
Buyer Shares. There are no bonds, debentures, notes or other  indebtedness of
Buyer, and no securities or other instruments or  obligations of Buyer the
value of which is in any way based upon  or  derived from any capital or
voting stock of Buyer, having the right  to  vote (or convertible into, or
exchangeable for, securities having  the  right to vote) on any matters on
which stockholders of Buyer may  vote.  Buyer has issued "trust preferred
securities" through the formation of  five separate trusts in pooled trust
preferred programs namely, Capital  Trust II, Capital Statutory Trust III,
Capital Trust IV, Capital  Trust V  and Capital Trust IV through which it
issued Junior Subordinated  Deferrable Interest Debentures (the **" Junior
Subordinated  Debt**"). The Junior Subordinated Debt (i) is not  convertible
into Buyer Shares, (ii) carries no voting rights with  respect  to any Buyer
Shares, and (iii) contains no dividend limitation provisions  upon Buyer
Shares except in the event of default in the payments  due  therein. Except
as set forth above, as of the date of this  Agreement, there are no material
Contracts of any kind to which Buyer  is a  party or by which Buyer is bound
obligating Buyer to issue, deliver  or  sell, or cause to be issued,
delivered or sold, additional shares  of  capital stock of, or other equity
or voting interests in, or securities  convertible into, or exchangeable or
exercisable for, shares of capital  stock of, or other equity or voting
interests in, Buyer or obligating  Buyer to issue, grant, extend or enter
into any such security, option,  warrant, call, right or Contract. As of the
date of this  Agreement, there are no outstanding material contractual
obligations  of  Buyer to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares
of capital  stock of, or other equity or voting interests in,  Buyer.

Buyer  Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under 
means  (including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process,
whether  computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and
direct  control of Buyer or the Buyer Subsidiaries or accountants
(including  all  means of access thereto and therefrom), except for any non-
exclusive  ownership and non-direct control that would not reasonably be
expected  to  have a material adverse effect on Buyer. Buyer (x) has
implemented  and  maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
in Rule  13a-15(e)  under the Exchange Act) to ensure that material
information relating  to  Buyer, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, is
made known to  the chief  executive officer and the chief financial officer
of Buyer by others  within those entities, and (y) has disclosed, based on
its most recent  evaluation prior to the date hereof, to Buyer's outside
auditors and the  audit committee of Buyer's Board of Directors (i) any
significant  deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation
of  internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) 
of  the Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to adversely affect 
Buyer's  ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information,  and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management  or  other employees who have a significant role in Buyer's
internal controls  over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f)
under the  Exchange  Act). These disclosures were made in writing by
management to Buyer's  auditors and audit committee and a copy has previously
been made  available  to Seller. As of the date hereof, there is no reason
to believe that  Buyer's outside auditors and its chief executive officer and
chief  financial officer will not be able to give the certifications and 
attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted  pursuant
to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without qualification,  when next
due.

Buyer  Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting controls,
including  any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that
Buyer  or any  of the Buyer Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable

of the  Buyer  Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a material violation

Each  Loan on Buyer's or WB Sub's books and records, was made and has been 
serviced in accordance with Buyer's lending standards in the ordinary  course
of business; is evidenced by appropriate and sufficient  documentation; to

obligation of the obligor named therein, enforceable  in  accordance with
its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent  conveyance and
other laws of general applicability relating to or  affecting creditor's
rights and to general equity principles. Buyer has  previously made available
to Seller complete and correct copies of  its and  WB Sub's lending
policies. The deposit and loan agreements of Buyer and  WB  Sub comply in
material respects with all applicable laws, rules and  regulations. The
allowance for loan losses reflected in the Buyer  SEC  Documents and
financial statements filed therewith, as of their respective  dates, is
adequate under GAAP and all regulatory requirements applicable  to Buyer or
WB Sub.

Buyer Subsidiaries in an arms-length manner made on substantially  the same 
terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing  at the 
time for comparable transactions with other persons and do not involve  more
than normal risk of collectibility or present other unfavorable  features.

_Reports  and Records_. Buyer and the Buyer Subsidiaries have filed  all
reports and maintained all records required to be filed or maintained  by
them under the rules and regulations of the Federal Reserve, the  FDIC  and
the West Virginia Division of Banking, except for such reports  and  records
the failure to file or maintain would not have a material  adverse  effect
on Buyer. All such documents and reports complied in all  material respects
with applicable requirements of law and rules and  regulations in effect at
the time such documents and reports were  filed  and contained in all
material respects the information required to  be  stated therein, except
for such documents and records the failure  to file  or contain such
information would not reasonably be expected to have  a  material adverse
effect on Buyer. None of such documents or  reports, when filed, contained
any untrue statement of a material  fact or  omitted to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or  necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the  circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading, other than  such  reports and documents which the
failure to file in such fashion would  not  reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on  Buyer. There is no material unresolved violation,
criticism or  exception by any governmental entity with respect to any report
or  letter  relating to any examinations of Buyer or any of the Buyer 
Subsidiaries.

Schedule,  Buyer  and the Buyer Subsidiaries have timely filed all Tax
Returns with  respect  to all material Taxes required to be filed with the
appropriate tax  authority through the date of this Agreement. Such Tax
Returns  are and will be true, correct and complete in all material 
respects. Buyer and the Buyer Subsidiaries have paid and  discharged all
Taxes shown as due on such Tax Returns, other than  such  Taxes that are
adequately reserved as shown on the Buyer Financial  Statements or have
arisen in the ordinary course of business since  the  Buyer Balance Sheet
Date. Except as set forth in Section  4.01(p) of the Buyer Disclosure
Schedule, neither the IRS nor any  other  taxing agency or authority,
domestic or foreign, has asserted, is  now  asserting or, to the actual
knowledge of Buyer, is threatening to  assert  against Buyer or any Buyer
Subsidiary any deficiency or claim for  additional Taxes. There are no
unexpired waivers by Buyer or  any Buyer Subsidiary of any statute of
limitations with respect to  Taxes. The accruals and reserves for Taxes
reflected in the  Buyer Financial Statements are adequate in all material
respects  for the  periods covered. Buyer and the Buyer Subsidiaries have
withheld  or collected and paid over to the appropriate Governmental
Authorities  or  are properly holding for such payment all Taxes required by
law to  be  withheld or collected, except for such failures to withhold or
collect  as  would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
effect  on  Buyer. There are no liens for Taxes upon the assets of Buyer
or  any Buyer Subsidiary, other than liens for current Taxes not yet  due
and  payable and liens that individually or in the aggregate would not 
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on  Buyer. Neither
Buyer nor any Buyer Subsidiary has agreed to  make, or is required to make,
any adjustment under Section 481(a)  of the  Code. Except as set forth in
the Buyer SEC Documents or in  Section 4.01(p) of the Buyer Disclosure
Schedule, neither Buyer nor  any  Buyer Subsidiary is a party to any
agreement, contract, arrangement  or  plan that has resulted, or could
result, individually or in the aggregate,  in the payment of "excess
parachute payments" within the meaning of  Section 280G of the Code. Neither
Buyer nor any Buyer  Subsidiary has ever been a member of an affiliated group
of corporations,  within the meaning of Section 1504 of the Code, other than
an affiliated  group of which Buyer is or was the common buyer corporation.
No  Tax is required to be withheld pursuant to Section 1445 of the Code  as
a  result of the transactions contemplated by this  Agreement.

before any governmental agency or instrumentality or in  any  arbitration
proceeding (i) against Buyer or any Buyer Subsidiary  which, if adversely
determined against Buyer or any Buyer  Subsidiary, could have a material
adverse effect on Buyer; or  (ii) against or by Buyer or any Buyer Subsidiary

subject to any order, judgment, decree, agreement, memorandum of 
understanding or similar arrangement with, or a commitment letter  or 
similar submission to, or extraordinary supervisory letter from,  any 
Regulatory Authorities that individually or in the aggregate could 
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on  Buyer. Neither
Buyer nor any Buyer Subsidiary has been advised  by any Regulatory Authority
that such Regulatory Authority is  contemplating issuing or requesting (or is
considering the appropriateness  of issuing or requesting) any such order,
judgment, decree, agreement,  memorandum of understanding, commitment letter,
supervisory letter  or  similar submission that individually or in the
aggregate could reasonably  be expected to have a material adverse effect
on  Buyer.

    |  

Section  4.01(s)(i) of the Buyer Disclosure Schedule contains a complete
and  accurate list of all bonus, incentive, deferred compensation, pension 
(including, without limitation, Buyer Pension Plans defined below), 
retirement, profit-sharing, thrift, savings, employee stock ownership,  stock
bonus, stock purchase, restricted stock, stock option, severance,  welfare
(including, without limitation, "welfare plans" within the meaning  of
Section 3(1) of ERISA, fringe benefit plans, employment, change  in 
control, retention or severance agreements, consulting agreements  or 
arrangements and all similar practices, policies and arrangements  maintained
or contributed to (currently or within the last two years)  by  (A) Buyer or
any Buyer Subsidiary and in which any employee or former  employee (the "
**Buyer Employees** "), consultant or former  consultant (the __ " **Buyer
Consultants** "),  officer or former officer (the " **Buyer Officers** "),
or  director or former director (the " **Buyer Directors** ") of  Buyer or
any subsidiary of Buyer participates or to which any such  Buyer  Employees,
Buyer Consultants, Buyer Officers or Buyer Directors either  participate or
are parties or (B) any Buyer ERISA Affiliate (as  defined below)
(collectively, the " **Buyer Compensation and Benefit  Plans** "). Neither
Buyer nor any subsidiary of Buyer has  any commitment to create any
additional Buyer Compensation and Benefit  Plan or to modify or change any
existing Buyer Compensation and Benefit  Plan, except to the extent required
by law and as otherwise contemplated  by Sections 6.02 and 7.01 **** of
this  Agreement.

    |  

(ii)

    |  

Except  in a manner that would not reasonably be expected to have a
material  adverse effect, each Buyer Compensation and Benefit Plan has been 
operated  and administered in accordance with its terms and with applicable 
law,  including, but not limited to, ERISA, the Code, the Securities Act 
(as  defined in Section 5.05(a)), the Exchange Act (as defined in Section 
3.01(g)), the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, or any regulations  or 
rules promulgated thereunder, and all filings, disclosures and notices 
required by ERISA, the Code, the Securities Act, the Exchange Act,  the Age 
Discrimination in Employment Act and any other applicable law have  been 
timely made. Each Buyer Compensation and Benefit Plan which is an  "employee
pension benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(2) of  ERISA (a "
**Buyer** **Pension Plan** ") and which  is intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code has  received a favorable determination letter
(including a determination  that  the related trust under such Buyer
Compensation and Benefit Plan  is exempt  from tax under Section 501(a) of
the Code) from the IRS and Buyer  is not  aware of any circumstances likely
to result in revocation of any  such  favorable determination letter. There
is no material pending  or, to the actual knowledge of Buyer, threatened
legal action, suit  or  claim relating to the Buyer Compensation and Benefit
Plans other  than  routine claims for benefits thereunder. Neither Buyer
nor  any subsidiary of Buyer has engaged in a transaction, or  omitted to
take any action, with respect to any Buyer Compensation  and  Benefit Plan
that would reasonably be expected to subject Buyer or  any  subsidiary of
Buyer to a tax or penalty imposed by either Section  4975 of  the Code or
Section 502 of ERISA, assuming for purposes of Section  4975 of the Code that
the taxable period of any such transaction  expired  as of the date hereof.

    |  

(iii)

    |  

No  liability (other than for payment of premiums to the PBGC which have 
been  made or will be made on a timely basis) under Title IV of ERISA has 
been or is expected to be incurred by Buyer or any subsidiary of  Buyer 
with respect to any ongoing, frozen or terminated "single-employer plan," 
within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA, currently or  formerly
maintained by any of them, or any single-employer plan of  any  entity (a "
**Buyer** **ERISA Affiliate Plan** ")  which is considered one employer with
Buyer under Section 4001(a)(14)  of  ERISA or Section 414(b), (c) or (m) of
the Code (a  " **Buyer** **ERISA Affiliate** "). None  of Buyer, any
subsidiary of Buyer or any Buyer ERISA Affiliate has  contributed, or has
been obligated to contribute, to a multi-employer  plan  under Subtitle E of
Title IV of ERISA (as defined in ERISA Sections  3(37)(A) and 4001(a)(3)) at
any time since September 26,  1980. No notice of a "reportable event", within
the meaning of  Section 4043 of ERISA, for which the 30-day reporting
requirement has  not been waived, has been required to be filed for any Buyer
Compensation  and Benefit Plan or by any Buyer ERISA Affiliate Plan within
the  12-month  period ending on the date hereof, and no such notice will be
required  to  be filed as a result of the transactions contemplated by
this  Agreement. The PBGC has not instituted proceedings to terminate  any
Buyer Pension Plan or Buyer ERISA Affiliate Plan and, to Buyer's  actual
knowledge, no condition exists that presents a material risk  that  such
proceedings will be instituted. There is no pending  investigation or
enforcement action by the PBGC, the DOL, the IRS  or any  other Governmental
Authority with respect to any Buyer Compensation  and  Benefit Plan. Except
as disclosed in Section 4.01(s)(iii) of  the Buyer Disclosure Schedule, under
each Buyer Pension Plan and  Buyer  ERISA Affiliate Plan, as of the date of
the most recent actuarial  valuation performed prior to the date of this
Agreement, the actuarially  determined present value of all "benefit
liabilities", within the meaning  of Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA (as
determined on the basis of the  actuarial assumptions contained in such
actuarial valuation of such  Buyer  Pension Plan or Buyer ERISA Affiliate
Plan), did not exceed the then  current value of the assets of such Buyer
Pension Plan or Buyer ERISA  Affiliate Plan and since such date there has
been neither an adverse  change in the financial condition of such Buyer
Pension Plan or Buyer  ERISA Affiliate Plan nor any amendment or other change
to such Buyer  Pension Plan or Buyer ERISA Affiliate Plan that would increase
the  amount  of benefits thereunder which reasonably could be expected to
change  such  result and that individually or in the aggregate would have a
material  adverse effect on Buyer.

(iv)

    |  

All  contributions required to be made under the terms of any Buyer 
Compensation and Benefit Plan or Buyer ERISA Affiliate Plan or any  employee
benefit arrangements under any collective bargaining agreement  to  which
Buyer or any subsidiary of Buyer is a party have been timely  made or  have
been reflected on the Buyer Financial Statements. Neither  any Buyer Pension
Plan nor any Buyer ERISA Affiliate Plan has an  "accumulated funding
deficiency" (whether or not waived) within the  meaning of Section 412 of the
Code or Section 302 of ERISA and  all required payments to the PBGC with
respect to each Buyer Pension  Plan  and each Buyer ERISA Affiliate Plan
have been made on or before  their due dates. None of Buyer, the any
subsidiary of Buyer nor  any Buyer ERISA Affiliate (x) has provided, or would
reasonably be  expected to be required to provide, security to any Buyer
Pension  Plan or  to any Buyer ERISA Affiliate Plan pursuant to Section
401(a)(29) of  the Code, and (y) has taken any action, or omitted to take any
action,  that has resulted, or would reasonably be expected to result, in 
the  imposition of a lien under Section 412(n) of the Code or pursuant  to
ERISA  that individually or in the aggregate would have a material adverse 
effect  on Buyer.

**5.02. _Notification_**

 

 

Between  the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, Seller promptly
shall notify  Buyer in writing if Seller becomes aware of any fact or
condition that  (a) causes or constitutes a breach in any material respect of
any of  Seller's representations and warranties or (b) would (except as
expressly  contemplated by this Agreement) cause or constitute a breach in
any material  respect of any such representation or warranty had such
representation or  warranty been made as of the time of occurrence or
discovery of such fact or  condition. Should any such fact or condition
require any change in  the Seller Disclosure Schedule, Seller will promptly
deliver to Buyer a  supplement to the Seller Disclosure Schedule specifying
such change  (" **Updated Seller Disclosure Schedule** "); _provided, 
however_ , that the disclosure of such change in the Updated Seller 
Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed to constitute a cure of any breach 
of  any representation or warranty made pursuant to this Agreement unless
consented  to in writing by Buyer. During the same period, Seller will
promptly  notify Buyer of (i) the occurrence of any breach in any material
respect of  any  of Seller's covenants contained in this Agreement, (ii) the
occurrence of any  event that may make the satisfaction of the conditions in
this Agreement  impossible or unlikely in any material respect or (iii) the
occurrence of any  event that is reasonably likely, individually or taken
with all other facts,  events or circumstances known to Seller, to result in
a material adverse effect  with respect to Seller.

 

 

**5.03. _No  Solicitation_**

 

 

(a) Seller  shall not and shall cause the Seller Subsidiaries and the
respective officers,  directors, employees, investment bankers, financial
advisors, attorneys,  accountants, consultants, affiliates and other agents
of Seller and the Seller  Subsidiaries (collectively, the " **Seller
Representatives** ") not  to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit,
induce or knowingly  encourage, or take any action to facilitate the making
of, any inquiry, offer  or  proposal which constitutes, or could reasonably
be expected to lead to, an  Acquisition Proposal; (ii) participate in any
discussions or negotiations  regarding any Acquisition Proposal or furnish,
or otherwise afford access,  to  any person (other than Buyer) any
information or data with respect to Seller  or  any of the Seller
Subsidiaries or otherwise relating to an Acquisition Proposal;  (iii) release
any person from, waive any provisions of, or fail to enforce  any 
confidentiality agreement or standstill agreement to which Seller is a
party;  (iv) enter into any agreement, agreement in principle or letter of
intent with  respect to any Acquisition Proposal or approve or resolve to
approve any  Acquisition Proposal or any agreement, agreement in principle or
letter of  intent relating to an Acquisition Proposal; or (v) take any action
(A) other  than as contemplated by this Agreement in connection with the
Merger, to render  the Rights issued pursuant to the terms of the Seller
Rights Agreement  inapplicable to an Acquisition Proposal or the transactions
contemplated  thereby, to exempt or exclude any person from the definition of
an Acquiring  Person (as defined in the Seller Rights Agreement) under the
terms of the Seller  Rights Agreement or to redeem the Rights or allow the
Rights to expire prior  to  their expiration date, or (B) to render the
provisions of any Takeover Laws  inapplicable to any person (other than Buyer
or the Buyer Subsidiaries) or  group  in connection with any Acquisition
Proposal. Any violation of the foregoing  restrictions by any of the Seller
Representatives, whether or not such Seller 

 

 

**70**

 

 

Representative  is so authorized and whether or not such Seller
Representative is purporting  to  act on behalf of Seller or otherwise,
shall be deemed to be a breach of this  Agreement by Seller. Seller and the
Seller Subsidiaries shall, and shall cause  each of the Seller
Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be  terminated any and all
existing discussions, negotiations, and communications  with any persons with
respect to any existing or potential Acquisition  Proposal.

 



 

For  purposes of this Agreement,  **" Acquisition Proposal"** shall mean any
inquiry, offer or  proposal (other than an inquiry, offer or proposal from
Buyer), whether or  not  in writing, contemplating, relating to, or that
could reasonably be expected  to  lead to, an Acquisition Transaction. For
purposes of this Agreement,  **" Acquisition Transaction"** shall mean (A)
any transaction or  series of transactions involving any merger,
consolidation, recapitalization,  share exchange, liquidation, dissolution or
similar transaction involving Seller  or any of the Seller Subsidiaries; (B)
any transaction pursuant to which any  third party or group acquires or would
acquire (whether through sale, lease  or  other disposition), directly or
indirectly, any assets of Seller or  any of the Seller Subsidiaries
representing, in the aggregate, twenty percent  (20%) or more of the assets
of Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries on a  consolidated basis; (C) any
issuance, sale or other disposition of (including  by  way of merger,
consolidation, share exchange or any similar transaction)  securities (or
options, rights or warrants to purchase or securities convertible  into, such
securities) representing twenty percent (20%) or more of the votes  attached
to the outstanding securities of Seller or any of the Seller  Subsidiaries;
(D) any tender offer or exchange offer that, if consummated,  would  result
in any third party or group beneficially owning twenty percent (20%)  or 
more of any class of equity securities of Seller or any of the Seller 
Subsidiaries; or (E) any transaction which is similar in form, substance or 
purpose to any of the foregoing transactions, or any combination of the 
foregoing.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding  Section 5.03(a), Seller may take any of the actions
described in clause (ii)  of  Section 5.03(a) if, but only if, (i) Seller
has received a bona fide unsolicited  written Acquisition Proposal that did
not result from a breach of this Section  5.03; (ii) the Seller's Board of
Directors (the **" Seller Board"**)  determines in good faith, after
consultation with and having considered the  advice of its outside legal
counsel, it is required to take such actions to  avoid violating its
fiduciary duties to Seller's shareholders under applicable  law; (iii) Seller
has provided Buyer with at least two (2) business days prior  notice of such
determination; and (iv) prior to furnishing or affording access  to any
information or data with respect to Seller or any of the Seller  Subsidiaries
or otherwise relating to an Acquisition Proposal, Seller receives  from such
person a confidentiality agreement with terms no less favorable to  Seller
than those contained in the confidentiality agreement between Seller  and 
Buyer. Seller shall promptly provide to Buyer any non-public information 
regarding Seller or the Seller Subsidiaries provided to any other person
which  was not previously provided to Buyer, such additional information to
be provided  no later than the date of provision of such information to such
other  party.

 



 

For  purposes of this Agreement,  **" Superior Proposal"** shall mean any
bona fide written proposal  (on its most recently amended or modified terms,
if amended or modified) made  by  a third party to enter into an Acquisition
Transaction on terms that the Seller  Board determines in its good faith
judgment, after consultation with and having  considered the advice of
outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of  nationally recognized
reputation (i) would, if consummated, result in the  acquisition of all, but
not less than all, of the issued and outstanding shares  of Seller common
stock or all, or substantially all, of the assets of Seller  and  the Seller

 

 

**71**

 

 

Subsidiaries  on a consolidated basis; (ii) would result in a transaction
that (A) involves  consideration to the holders of the Seller Shares that is
more favorable, from  a  financial point of view, than the consideration to
be paid to Seller's  shareholders pursuant to this Agreement, considering,
among other things, the  nature of the consideration being offered and any
material regulatory approvals  or other risks associated with the timing of
the proposed transaction beyond  or  in addition to those specifically
contemplated hereby, and which proposal is  not  conditioned upon obtaining
additional financing and (B) is, in light of the  other terms of such
proposal, more favorable to Seller's shareholders than the  Merger and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and (iii) is  reasonably likely
to be completed on the terms proposed, in each case taking  into account all
legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the  proposal.

 



 

(c) Seller  shall promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours)
notify Buyer  in  writing if any proposals or offers are received by, any
information is requested  from, or any negotiations or discussions are sought
to be initiated or continued  with, Seller or the Seller Representatives, in
each case in connection with  any  Acquisition Proposal, and such notice
shall indicate the name of the person  initiating such discussions or
negotiations or making such proposal, offer  or  information request and the
material terms and conditions of any proposals  or  offers (and, in the case
of written materials relating to such proposal, offer,  information request,
negotiations or discussion, providing copies of such  materials (including
e-mails or other electronic communications) unless (i)  such  materials
constitute confidential information of the party making such offer  or 
proposal under an effective confidentiality agreement, (ii) disclosure of
such  materials jeopardizes the attorney-client privilege or (iii) disclosure
of  such  materials contravenes any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment
or decree.  Seller agrees that it shall keep Buyer informed, on a current
basis, of the  status and terms of any such proposal, offer, information
request, negotiations  or discussions (including any amendments or
modifications to such proposal,  offer or request).

 



 

(d) Neither  the Seller Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw,
qualify or  modify, or propose to withdraw, qualify or modify, in a manner
adverse to Buyer  in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including  the Merger), the Seller Board Recommendation (as
defined in Section 7.06(f)),  or  make any statement, filing or release, in
connection with the Seller Meeting  or  otherwise, inconsistent with the
Seller Board Recommendation (it being  understood that taking a neutral
position or no position with respect to an  Acquisition Proposal shall be
considered an adverse modification of the Seller  Board Recommendation); (ii)
approve or recommend, or propose to approve or  recommend, any Acquisition
Proposal; or (iii) enter into (or cause Seller or  any  of the Seller
Subsidiaries to enter into) any letter of intent, agreement in  principle,
acquisition agreement or other agreement (A) related to any  Acquisition
Transaction or (B) requiring Seller to abandon, terminate or fail  to 
consummate the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this 
Agreement.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding  Section 5.03(d), prior to the date of the Seller
Meeting, the Seller Board  may  approve or recommend to the shareholders of
Seller a Superior Proposal and  withdraw, qualify or modify the Seller Board
Recommendation in connection  therewith (a **" Seller Subsequent
Determination"**) after the fifth  business day following Buyer's receipt of
a notice (the **" Notice of  Superior Proposal"**) from Seller advising Buyer
that the Seller Board  has decided that a bona fide unsolicited written
Acquisition Proposal that  it  received (that did not result from a breach
of this Section 5.03) constitutes  a  Superior Proposal (it being understood

 

 

 

**72**

 

 

that  Seller shall be required to deliver a new Notice of Superior Proposal
in respect  of any revised Superior Proposal from such third party or its
affiliates that  Seller proposes to accept) if, but only if, (i) the Seller
Board has reasonably  determined in good faith, after consultation with and
having considered the  advice of outside legal counsel and a financial
advisor of nationally recognized  reputation, that it is required to take
such actions to avoid violating its  fiduciary duties to Seller's
shareholders under applicable law, (ii) during the  three (3) business day
period after receipt of the Notice of Superior Proposal  by Buyer, Seller and
the Seller Board shall have cooperated and negotiated  in  good faith with
Buyer to make such adjustments, modifications or amendments  to  the terms
and conditions of this Agreement as would enable Seller to proceed  with the
Seller Board Recommendation without a Seller Subsequent Determination; 
provided, however, that Buyer and Seller shall not have any obligation to 
propose any adjustments, modifications or amendments to the terms and
conditions  of this Agreement and (iii) at the end of such five (5) business
day period,  after taking into account any such adjusted, modified or amended
terms as may  have been proposed by Buyer since its receipt of such Notice of
Superior  Proposal, the Seller Board has again in good faith made the
determination (A)  in  clause (i) of this Section 5.03(e) and (B) that such
Acquisition Proposal  constitutes a Superior Proposal. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the changing,  qualifying or modifying of the Seller Board
Recommendation or the making of  a  Seller Subsequent Determination by the
Seller Board shall not change the  approval of the Seller Board for purposes
of causing any Takeover Laws to be  inapplicable to this Agreement and the
Voting Agreements and the transactions  contemplated hereby and thereby,
including the Merger.

 



 

(f) Nothing  contained in this Section 5.03 shall prohibit Seller or the
Seller Board from  complying with Seller's obligations required under Rules
14d-9 and 14e-2(a)  promulgated under the Exchange Act; provided, however,
that any such disclosure  relating to an Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed
a change in the Seller  Board  Recommendation unless the Seller Board
reaffirms the Seller Board Recommendation  in such disclosure.

 



 

**5.04. _Delivery  of Information_**

 

 

Seller  shall furnish to Buyer promptly after such documents are  available:
(a) all reports, proxy statements or other  communications by Seller to its
shareholders generally; and (b) all press  releases relating to any

Statement/Prospectus (as defined in Section 7.06(a)), Seller shall  deliver 
to Buyer a schedule of all persons who Seller reasonably believes  are, or 
are likely to be, as of the date of the Seller Meeting, deemed to  be 
"affiliates" of Seller (the " **Rule 145 Affiliates** ") within  the meaning
of Rule 145 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended  (the  "
**Securities Act** "). Thereafter and until the  Effective Time, Seller shall
identify to Buyer each additional person  whom  Seller reasonably believes
to have thereafter become a Rule 145  Affiliate.

    |  

(b)

    |  

Seller  shall use its best efforts to cause each person who is identified 
as a  Rule 145 Affiliate pursuant to Section 5.05(a) above (who has not 
executed  and delivered the same concurrently with the execution of this
Agreement)  to execute and deliver to Buyer on or before the date of
mailing  of the  Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, a written agreement,
substantially  in  the form of _Exhibit A_ attached  hereto.

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

**73**

 

 

**5.06. _Takeover  Laws_**

 

 

Seller  shall take all necessary steps to (a) exempt (or cause the continued
exemption  of) this Agreement and the Merger from the requirements of any
Takeover Laws  applicable to it, and (b) assist in any challenge by Buyer to
the validity,  or applicability to the Merger, of any Takeover Law.

 

 

**5.07. _No  Control_**

 

 

Nothing  contained in this Agreement shall give Buyer, directly or
indirectly, the right  to control or direct the operations of Seller or any
Seller Subsidiary prior  to  the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time
each of Seller and  Buyer shall exercise, consistent with the terms of this
Agreement, complete  control and supervision over its and its subsidiaries
respective  operations.

 

 

**5.08. _Exchange  Listing_**

 

 

Seller  shall take all necessary actions, and Buyer shall provide reasonable

Prior  to  the Effective Time, the Seller shall approve in accordance with
the procedures  set forth in Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act
and the Skadden,  Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP SEC No-Action Letter
(January 12, 1999) any  disposition of equity securities of the Seller
(including derivative securities)  resulting from the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement by each officer  and director of the Seller
who is subject to Section 16 of the Exchange  Act.

 

 

**5.10. _Disposition  of Certain Loans_**

 

 

Prior  to  the Effective Time, Seller shall use its commercially
reasonable  efforts to enter into contracts for the sale of the Loans 
identified on Schedule 5.10 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule conditioned on 
the  consummation of the Merger in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement,  which  Loans have been selected by Buyer and Seller for
potential disposition, on  terms  reasonably satisfactory to Buyer and
Seller, provided however that nothing  herein shall require any such sale
prior to the consummation of the Merger  if  Seller determines any such sale
to be contrary to safe and sound banking  practice. Buyer shall indemnify the
Seller and the Seller  Subsidiaries for any fees, expenses and charges
incurred by Seller in connection  therewith if the Merger is not consummated
in accordance with the terms of  this  Agreement.

**6.01. _Access  to Information_**

 

 

Buyer  shall furnish to Seller promptly after such documents are  available:
(i) all reports, proxy statements or other  communications by Buyer to its
shareholders generally; and (ii) all press  releases relating to any
transactions.

 

 

**6.02. _Opportunity  of Employment;_ _Employee Benefits_**

 

 

        

    |  

(a)

    |  

Buyer  agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to continue the 
employment of at least a majority of the Seller Employees after the  Merger.
Employees of Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries (other  than employees who
are otherwise parties to employment, severance  or  change in control
agreements) (i) who are not offered the opportunity  to  continue as
employees following the Effective Time or (ii) who are  terminated without
cause within one year after the Effective Time,  shall  be entitled to
receive (A) the severance compensation set forth in  Section 6.02(a) of the
Buyer Disclosure Schedule, (B) outplacement  consultation services of a type
and nature to be agreed upon by Seller  and  Buyer prior to the Effective
Time and with a cost of up to $1,000  for each  employee of Seller or any
Seller Subsidiary, (C) accrued benefits,  including vacation pay, through the
date of separation, and (D) any  rights  to continuation of medical coverage
to the extent such rights are  required  under applicable federal or state
law and subject to the employee's  compliance with all applicable
requirements for such continuation  coverage, including payment of all
premiums or other expenses related  to  such coverage. Nothing in this
section or elsewhere in this  Agreement shall be deemed to be a contract of
employment or be construed  to give said employees any rights other than as
employees at will  under  Ohio law and said employees shall not be deemed to
be third-party  beneficiaries of this provision. From and after the
Effective  Time, the Employees of Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries who
remain  employees of Buyer or its Subsidiaries after the Effective Time
(including  employees who are parties to employment or change in control
agreements)  (" **Continuing Employees** ") shall be provided with employee 
benefits that are substantially similar to employee benefits provided  to 
other employees under the Buyer Compensation and Benefit Plans (excluding 
for this purpose any equity-based incentive plans). Each  Continuing Employee
shall be credited with years of service with  Seller,  the appropriate
Seller Subsidiary and, to the extent credit would  have  been given by
Seller or the appropriate Seller Subsidiary for years  of  service with a
predecessor (including any business organization acquired  by Seller or any
Seller Subsidiary), years of service with a predecessor  of Seller or a
Seller Subsidiary, for purposes of eligibility and  vesting  (but not for
benefit accrual purposes) in the employee benefit plans  of  Buyer, and
provided further that the Continuing Employees shall retain  the  vacation
accrual earned under the Seller vacation policy as of the  Effective Time so
that they shall receive under the Buyer vacation  policy  a vacation benefit
no less than what they had earned under the Seller  vacation policy as of the
Effective Time, though any future accrual  of  benefit shall be in
accordance with the Buyer vacation policy subject  to  the carryover
minimum. In addition, Continuing Employees who  become eligible to
participate in a Buyer Compensation and Benefit  Plan  following the
Effective Time (i) shall receive full credit under  such  plans for any
deductibles, co-payment and out-of-pocket expenses  incurred  by the
employees and their dependents under the applicable Seller  Compensation and
Benefit Plan during the portion of the applicable  plan  year prior to such
participation, and (ii) shall not be subject to  any  exclusion or penalty
for pre-existing conditions that were covered  under  the Seller
Compensation and Benefit Plans immediately prior to the  Effective Time, or
to any waiting period relating to such  coverage. For purposes of
clarification, and not by way of  limitation, all Continuing Employees shall
commence participation  in  Buyer's Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the "
**Employee Stock  Ownership Plan** ") **** as of the Effective Time,  but
such Continuing Employees shall not be eligible to participate  in the 
Buyer's Defined Benefit Pension Plan (the " **Defined Benefit Pension  Plan**
"), participation in which will be frozen effective July  31,  2007. The
foregoing covenants shall survive the Merger, and  Buyer shall before the
Effective Time adopt resolutions that amend  its  tax-qualified retirement
plans to the extent necessary to provide  for the  Seller or Seller
Subsidiary service credits referenced  herein.

(b)

    |  

After  the consummation of the Merger, the Surviving Corporation shall
cause  Seller Sub to (i) pay on the Effective Date or up to one year
thereafter,  the change in control payments contemplated by the employment
agreement  in  effect as of the date hereof between the Seller and or Seller
Sub  and Mr.  Ralph E. Coffman Jr. and by the Oak Hill Financial, Inc. Key
Executive  Change Control Plan for certain executive officers covered by
Plan  without  regard to any conditions on payment set forth in such
documents;  and (ii)  the Surviving Corporation also shall cause Seller Sub
to enter into  employment contracts as of the Effective Date for one year
using  a form of  the employment agreement substantially similar to the
Agreement attached  to the Buyer Disclosure Schedule as Exhibit 6.02(b), with
the individuals  and rates set forth in Section 6.02(b) of the Buyer
Disclosure  Schedule.

(c)

    |  

Notwithstanding  the foregoing, following the Effective Time the Buyer shall
merge  the  Seller's 401(k) plan with and into the Buyer's existing 401(k)
plan (or  any successor to such plan) and the Continuing Employees shall be 
entitled  to accrue benefits under such merged 401(k) plan in accordance
with  the  terms of that plan from and after the Effective Time, subject
to  any  protected benefits accrued with respect to participants in the
Seller's  401(k) plan as of the Effective Time. Subject to the payment 
provisions thereof, the Seller shall take all actions necessary to  terminate
its Non-Employee Directors' Deferred Compensation Plan as of the  Effective
Time and no further benefits shall accrue to any individuals  under such Plan
following the Effective  Time.

    |  

(d)

    |  

As  of the Effective Time, Buyer shall succeed Seller as sponsor and 
administrator of Seller's Compensation and Benefit Plans and shall take  such
action as necessary to effectuate such changes. Subject to  Section 6.02(a),
Buyer may terminate, merge or amend any Seller  Compensation and Benefit Plan
or may cease contributions to any Plan  to  the extent permitted by
applicable law; provided, however, that Buyer  will  provide any benefits to
which Seller Employee or spouses, former  spouses  or other qualifying
beneficiaries of any Seller Employee may be entitled  by reason of qualifying
events occurring prior to, on or after the  Effective Time by virtue of any
provisions of any employee welfare  benefit  plan or group insurance
contract or any laws, statutes or regulations  requiring any continuation of
benefit coverage upon the happening  of  certain events, such as the
termination of employment or change in  beneficiary or dependent status,
including, without limitation, such  requirements under the Consolidated
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation  Act of  1985, as amended ("COBRA"), from and
after the Effective Time through the  remaining legally- required period of 
coverage.

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

**6.03. _Exchange  Listing_**

 

 

Buyer  shall file a listing application with Nasdaq for the Buyer Shares to
be issued  to the former holders of Seller Shares in the Merger at the time
prescribed  by  applicable Nasdaq rules and regulations, and shall use all
commercially  reasonable efforts to cause the Buyer Shares to be issued in
connection with  the  Merger to be approved for listing on Nasdaq, subject
to official notice of  issuance, prior to the Closing Date. In addition,
Buyer will use its  best efforts to maintain its listing on Nasdaq.

 

 

**6.04. _Notification_**

 

 

Between  the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, Buyer promptly
shall notify  Seller in writing if Buyer becomes aware of any fact or
condition that  (i) causes or constitutes a breach in any material respect of
any of  Buyer's or WB Sub's representations and warranties or (ii) would
(except as  expressly contemplated by this Agreement) cause or constitute a
breach in any  material respect of any such representation or warranty had
such representation  or warranty been made as of the time of occurrence or
discovery of such fact  or  condition. Should any such fact or condition
require any change in  the Buyer Disclosure Schedule, Buyer promptly shall
deliver to Seller a  supplement to the Buyer Disclosure Schedule specifying
such change  (" **Updated Buyer Disclosure Schedule** "); _provided, 
however_ , that the disclosure of such change in the Updated Buyer
Disclosure  Schedule shall not be deemed to constitute a cure of any breach
of any  representation or warranty made pursuant to this Agreement unless
consented  to  in writing by Seller. During the same period, Buyer promptly
shall  notify Seller of (i) the occurrence of any breach in any material
respect  of any of Buyer's or WB Sub's covenants contained in this
Agreement,  (ii) the occurrence of any event that may make the satisfaction
of the  conditions in this Agreement impossible or unlikely in any material 

 

 

 

**77**

 

 

respect  or (iii) the occurrence of any event that is reasonably likely, 
individually or taken with all other facts, events or circumstances known to 
Buyer, to result in a material adverse effect with respect to  Buyer.

 

 

**6.05 _._ _Takeover  Laws_**

 

 

Buyer  shall take all necessary steps to (a) exempt (or cause the continued 
exemption of) this Agreement and the Merger from the requirements of any 
Takeover Law and from any provisions under its Articles of Incorporation and 
Bylaws, as applicable, by action of the Board of Directors of Buyer or

    |  

(d)

    |  

By  Seller, if its Board of Directors so determines, by providing written 
notice to Buyer:

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

        

    |  

(i)

    |

    |  

this  Agreement may be terminated any time prior to Closing by the Seller 
Board  at any time during the five-day period ending two days before the

---|---|--- 
    

 

 

        

    |  

(1)

    |  

the  Average Closing Price (as defined below) shall be less than the
product  of  0.80 and the Starting Price (as defined below);  and

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

        

    |  

(2)

    |  

(a)  the number obtained by dividing the Average Closing Price by the

Price (as defined below) on the Walkaway Determination  Date (as  defined
below) by the Index Price on the Starting Date (as defined  below)  and
subtracting 0.15 from such  quotient;

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

subject  to the following. If Seller elects to exercise its termination
right  pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, it shall give prompt
written  notice to Buyer; provided that such notice of election to terminate
may be  withdrawn by Seller at any time within the aforementioned five-day 
period. During the five-day period commencing with its receipt of  such
notice, Buyer shall have the option of increasing the Exchange Ratio in  a 
manner such that the conditions set forth in clauses (1) and (2) above shall 
be  deemed not to exist (the " **Buyer** **Top-up  Notice** "). For purposes
hereof, the condition set forth in  clause (1) above shall be deemed not to
exist if the Exchange Ratio and/or  the  Per Share Cash Consideration is
increased so that the Per Share Consideration  (as defined below) after such
increase is not less than the Per Share  Consideration that would have been
in effect if the condition set forth in  clause (1) above did not exist. For
purposes hereof, the condition set forth  in  clause (2) above shall be
deemed not to exist if the Exchange Ratio is increased  so that the Per Share

 

 

 

 

**92**

 

 

 

Consideration  after such increase is not less than the Per Share
Consideration that would  have  been in effect if the condition set forth in
clause (2) above did not  exist. If Buyer makes this election, within such
five-day period, it  shall give prompt written notice to Seller of such
election and the revised  Exchange Ratio, whereupon no termination shall have
occurred pursuant to this  Section 11.01(d)(iv) and this Agreement shall
remain in effect in accordance  with its terms (except as the Exchange Ratio
shall have been so modified),  and  any references in this Agreement to
"Exchange Ratio" shall thereafter be deemed  to refer to the Exchange Ratio
after giving effect to any adjustment made  pursuant to this Section
11.01(d)(iv). For purposes of this Section  11.01(d)(iv), the following terms
shall have the following  meanings:

 

 

        

    |  

" **Average  Closing Price "** means the average of the last reported sale
prices  per share of the Buyer Shares as reported on the Nasdaq (as
reported  in  The Wall Street Journal or, if not reported therein, in
another mutually  agreed upon authoritative source) for the 20 consecutive
trading  days  ending seven calendar days before the Effective  Time.

    |  

" **Per  Share Consideration** " shall mean the Exchange Ratio multiplied

---|--- 
    

 

 

        

    |  

" **Starting  Price** " shall mean last reported sale prices per share of
Buyer  Common Stock as reported on the Nasdaq (as reported in The Wall
Street  Journal or, if not reported therein, in another mutually agreed
upon  authoritative source) on the Starting  Date.

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

        

    |  

" **Starting  Date** " shall mean the last full trading day prior to the 
announcement by press release of the Merger or, if such announcement  occurs
after the close of trading on any trading day, such trading  day.

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

If  Buyer declares or effects a stock  dividend, reclassification,
recapitalization, split-up, combination,  non-acquisitive exchange of shares
or similar transaction between the 

 

 

 

**93**

 

 

 

Starting  Date and the Walkaway Determination Date (or establishes a record
date in  respect thereof), the prices for the common stock of Buyer shall

(ii) that nothing contained herein shall relieve any  party hereto from
liability for breach of its representations, warranties,  covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement and (iii) as  provided in paragraphs
(b)-(f)  below.

    
---|---|---

Seller  shall promptly pay to Buyer a termination fee of $6.0 million (the 
" **Termination Fee** ") if this Agreement is terminated by (i)  Buyer
pursuant to Section 11.01(c)(iii) or (ii) Seller pursuant to  Section 
11.01(d)(iii) and prior to the date that is 12 months after the date  of 
such termination, Seller consummates an Acquisition Transaction or  enters 
into any definitive agreement with respect to an Acquisition  Transaction.

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

        

    |  

(c)

    |  

In  the event that this Agreement is terminated by Buyer or Seller pursuant

equal to  the  Termination Fee.

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

        

    |  

(d)

    |  

In  the event that this Agreement is terminated by Buyer pursuant to 
Sections  11.01(c)(i) or (ii) and (A) an Acquisition Proposal with respect 
to the  Seller shall have been publicly announced, disclosed or otherwise 
communicated to the Seller Board prior to any breach by the Seller  of any 
representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement giving rise  to such 
termination by Buyer or during the cure period therefor provided  in 
Sections 11.01(c)(i) or (ii) and (B) within twelve (12) months of  such 
termination, the Seller shall have entered into a definitive agreement  with
respect to, or the Seller shall have consummated, an Acquisition 
Transaction, then the Seller shall pay to Buyer an amount equal to  the 
Termination Fee.

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

**94**

 

 

 

        

    |  

(e)

    |  

Any  payment of the Termination Fee required to be made pursuant to this 
Section 11.02 shall be made not more than two (2) business days after  the 
date of the event giving rise to the obligation to make such payment,  unless
the Termination Fee is payable as a result of the termination  of  this
Agreement by the Seller pursuant to Section 11.01(d)(iii), in  which  case,
the Termination Fee shall be payable concurrently with such  termination. All
payments under this Section 11.02 shall be made  by wire  transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated  by Buyer.  No payment
of the Termination Fee under this Section 11.02 shall  limit in  any respect
any rights or remedies available to Buyer relating to  any  breach or
failure of the Seller to perform any representation, warranty,  covenant or
agreement set forth in this Agreement resulting, directly  or  indirectly,
in the right to receive the Termination Fee under this  Section  11.02.

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

 

        

    |  

(f)

    |  

Buyer  and Seller acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 
11.02  are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement  and that, without these agreements, Buyer would not enter into
this  Agreement. Accordingly, if Seller fails promptly to pay any amount 
due  pursuant to this Section 11.02 and, in order to obtain such payment, 
Buyer  commences a suit which results in a judgment against Seller for the 
amount  set forth in this Section 11.02, Seller shall pay to Buyer its
costs  and  expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) in
connection  with such suit, together with interest on the amount of the
Termination  Fee at The Wall Street Journal prime rate in effect on the date
such  payment was required to be made.

Attn:  Chief Executive Officer

 



 



 

Gentlemen:

 

 

I  have  been advised that, as of the date hereof, I may be deemed to be an
"affiliate" of Oak Hill Financial, Inc., an Ohio corporation ("Oak Hill"), as
the term "affiliate" is (i) defined for purposes of paragraphs (c) and (d) of
Rule 145 of  the Rules and Regulations (the "Rules and Regulations") of the
Securities and  Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities
Act of 1933, as  amended (the "Securities Act"), and/or (ii) used in and for
purposes of  Accounting Series Releases 130 and 135, as amended, of the 
Commission. Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of  Merger, dated
as of July 19, 2007 (the "Merger Agreement"), by and between Oak  Hill, Oak
Hill Banks, an Ohio state-chartered bank and a wholly-owned subsidiary  of
Oak Hill, WesBanco, Inc., a West Virginia corporation ("Buyer"), and
WesBanco  Bank, Inc., a West Virginia banking corporation and a wholly-owned
subsidiary  of  Buyer ("Buyer Sub"), Oak Hill will be merged (the "Merger")
with and into Buyer  and the name of the surviving corporation will be
WesBanco, Inc., a West  Virginia corporation (the "Surviving Corporation").

 

 

As  used  herein, "Oak Hill Common Shares" means the shares of common stock,
without par  value, of Oak Hill, and "Buyer Shares" means the shares of the
Buyer's common  stock, $2.0833 par value per share.

 

 

I  represent, warrant and covenant to Buyer that if I receive any Buyer
Shares  as a  result of the Merger:

 

 

A. I  shall not make any sale, transfer or other disposition of any Buyer
Shares  (including any securities which may be paid as a dividend or
otherwise  distributed thereon or received pursuant to the exercise of stock
options)  acquired by me in the Merger in violation of the Securities Act or
the rules  and  regulations promulgated thereunder.

 

 

B. I  have carefully read this letter and the Agreement and discussed their 
requirements and other applicable limitations upon my ability to sell,
transfer  or otherwise dispose of Buyer Shares (including any securities
which may be  paid  as a dividend or otherwise distributed thereon or
received pursuant to the  exercise of stock options) to the extent I felt
necessary, with my legal counsel  or legal counsel for Oak Hill.

 

 

C. I  have been advised that the issuance of Buyer Shares to me pursuant to
the Merger  has been or will be registered with the Commission under the
Securities Act  on a  Registration Statement on Form S-4. However, I have
also been advised  that, because at the time the Merger will be submitted for
a vote of the  shareholders of Oak Hill, I may be deemed to be an affiliate
of Oak Hill, the  distribution by me of any Buyer Shares acquired by me in
the Merger will not  be  registered under the Securities Act and that I may
not sell, transfer or  otherwise dispose of any Buyer Shares (including any
securities which may be  paid as a dividend or otherwise distributed thereon
or received pursuant to  the  exercise of stock options) acquired by me in
the Merger unless (i) such sale,  transfer or other disposition has been
registered under the Securities Act,  (ii)  such sale, transfer or other
disposition is made in conformity with the volume  and other limitations of
Rule 145 promulgated by the Commission under the  Securities Act, or (iii) in
the opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to  the  Surviving Corporation,
such sale, transfer or other disposition is otherwise  exempt from
registration under the Securities Act.

 

 

D. I  understand that Buyer is under no obligation to register under the
Securities  Act the sale, transfer or other disposition by me or on my behalf
of any Buyer  Shares acquired by me in the Merger or to take any other action
necessary in  order to make an exemption from such registration available.

 

 

E. I  also understand that stop transfer instructions will be given to
Buyer's  transfer agent with respect to Buyer Shares (including any
securities which  may  be paid as a dividend or otherwise distributed
thereon or received pursuant  to  the exercise of stock options) and that
there will be placed on the certificates  for the Buyer Shares acquired by me
in the Merger, or any substitutions  therefor, a legend stating in substance:

 

 

"THE  SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE WERE ISSUED IN A TRANSACTION TO
WHICH  RULE 145 PROMULGATED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED,
APPLIES,  AND  MAY ONLY BE SOLD, TRANSFERRED OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF IN
COMPLIANCE WITH THE  REQUIREMENTS OF RULE 145 OR PURSUANT TO A REGISTRATION
STATEMENT UNDER SAID  ACT  OR AN EXEMPTION FROM SUCH REGISTRATION."

 



 

F. I  also understand that unless the transfer by me of my Buyer Shares has
been  registered under the Securities Act or is a sale made in conformity
with the  provisions of Rule 145, the Surviving Corporation reserves the
right to put  the following legend on the certificates issued to my
transferee:

 

 

"THE  SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER
THE  SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, AND WERE ACQUIRED FROM A PERSON WHO
RECEIVED  SUCH SHARES IN A TRANSACTION TO WHICH RULE 145 PROMULGATED UNDER
SAID ACT  APPLIES. THE SHARES HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED BY THE HOLDER NOT WITH A
VIEW TO, OR  FOR  RESALE IN CONNECTION WITH, ANY DISTRIBUTION THEREOF WITHIN
THE MEANING OF THE  SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, AND MAY NOT BE SOLD,
TRANSFERRED OR  OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF EXCEPT IN ACCORDANCE WITH AN EXEMPTION
FROM THE  REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF SAID ACT."

 

 

It  is  understood and agreed that the legends set forth in paragraphs E and
F  above shall be removed by delivery of substitute certificates without
such  legends if the undersigned shall have delivered to the Surviving
Corporation  a  copy of a letter from the staff of the Commission, or an
opinion of legal  counsel in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
the Surviving  Corporation, to the effect that such legends are not required
for purposes  of  the 1933 Act.

 

 

If  the  undersigned desires to sell or otherwise transfer Buyer Shares
acquired in  the  Merger in reliance on Rule 145, then upon delivery by the
undersigned of  customary representation letters to Surviving Corporation's
legal counsel and  such legal counsel's conclusion that the proposed transfer
or sale complies with  the provisions of Rule 145, Surviving Corporation, at
its sole cost, shall  cause  such legal counsel to provide such opinions as
may be necessary to Surviving  Corporation's transfer agent so that the
undersigned may complete the proposed  transfer or sale. Surviving
Corporation shall cause its legal counsel  to review such Rule 145 opinion
request in a reasonably prompt  fashion.

 

 

Very  truly yours,
