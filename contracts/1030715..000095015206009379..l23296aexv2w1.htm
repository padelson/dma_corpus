Subsidiary, for the purpose, among other things, of consummating the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (the &#147;Debt Financing&#148;). The Debt Financing Commitment has not been amended or

equity capital in an amount not less than 24% of the total consolidated capitalization of Borrower

the documents and instruments referred to herein that are to be delivered at the Closing)
constitutes the entire agreement among the parties to this Agreement and supersedes any prior
understandings, agreements or representations by or among the parties hereto, or any of them,
written or oral, with respect to the subject matter hereof; provided that the Confidentiality
Agreement shall remain in effect in accordance with its terms.

which the Indemnified Parties shall be third party beneficiaries), this Agreement is not intended,
and shall not be deemed, to confer any rights or remedies upon any person other than the parties
hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns, to create any agreement of employment
with any person or to otherwise create any third-party beneficiary hereto.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9.5 <U>Assignment</U>. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or delegated, in whole or in part, by operation of
law or otherwise by any of the parties hereto without the prior written consent of the other
parties, and any such assignment without such prior written consent shall be null and void, except
that the Buyer may assign, in its sole discretion, all or any of its rights, interests and
obligations under this Agreement to any Affiliate of Buyer with the consent of the Company, but no
such assignment shall relieve the Buyer of any of its obligations under this Agreement. Subject to
the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be
enforceable by, the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9.6 <U>Severability</U>. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid or
unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the validity or enforceability
of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the validity or enforceability of the offending
term or provision in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a
court of
competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof is invalid or unenforceable,
the parties hereto agree that the court making such determination shall have the power to limit the
term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable
term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to
expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement
shall be enforceable as so modified. In the event such court does not exercise the power granted
to it in the prior sentence, the parties hereto agree to replace such invalid or unenforceable term
or provision with a valid and enforceable term or provision that will achieve, to the extent
possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such invalid or unenforceable term.

considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when counterparts have been signed
by each of the parties hereto and delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all
parties need not sign the same counterpart. This Agreement may be executed and delivered by
facsimile transmission.
