 (b) _Cancellation of Buyer-Owned Stock_.

 (b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable (and in any event within five Business Days) after the Effective Time, the Buyer shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (each, a "Certificate") (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration payable with respect thereto. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be paid promptly in exchange therefor cash in an amount equal to the Merger Consideration that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article II, and the Certificate so surrendered shall immediately be cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the Merger Consideration may be paid to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each Certificate (other than Certificates representing Dissenting Shares) shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time 

    ##### 

  

    

to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger
Consideration as contemplated by this Section 2.2. 

   

 (c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. All Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates evidencing shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock, and from and after the Effective Time there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article II. 

   

 (d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for 365 days after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Buyer, upon demand, and any holder of Company Common Stock who has not previously complied with this Section 2.2 shall be entitled to receive only from the Buyer payment of its claim for Merger Consideration. 

   

 (e) _No Liability_. To the extent permitted by applicable law, none of the Buyer, the Transitory Subsidiary, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. 

   

 (f) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Buyer and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration and any other amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any person such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or any other applicable state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation or the Buyer, as the case may be, such withheld amounts (i) shall be remitted by the Buyer or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, to the applicable Governmental Entity (as defined below), and (ii) shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation or the Buyer, as the case may be. 

   

 (g) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement. 

   

 2.3 _Company Stock Plans_. 

  

 (a) The Company shall take all action reasonably necessary so that, at the Effective Time, each option to purchase Company Common Stock ("Company Stock Options") under any stock option plans or other equity-related plans of the Company (the "Company Stock 

    ##### 

  

    

Plans"), each Company Stock Option outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (whether or not vested) shall be canceled and terminated and
shall represent the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the Option
Consideration (as defined below) for each share of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Stock Option. In furtherance of the foregoing, prior
to the Effective Time, the Company shall enter into an agreement (an "Option
Termination Agreement"), in a form reasonably satisfactory to the buyer, with
each holder of an outstanding Company Stock Option providing for the
termination of such Company Stock Option on the terms described in this
Section 2.3. 

   

 (b) Subject to the execution and delivery to the Company of an Option Termination Agreement, each holder of a Company Stock Option (whether or not vested) shall receive from the Buyer, in respect and in consideration of each Company Stock Option canceled and terminated pursuant to such agreement, immediately following the Effective Time, an amount (net of applicable taxes) equal to the product of (i) the amount, if any, by which (A) the Merger Consideration per share of Company Common Stock exceeds (B) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option, multiplied by (ii) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option, without any interest thereon (the "Option Consideration"). 

   

 (c) As soon as practicable following the execution of this Agreement, the Company shall mail to each person who is a holder of Company Stock Options a letter describing the treatment of and/or payment for such Company Stock Options pursuant to this Section 2.3 and providing an Option Termination Agreement and instructions for use in executing and returning such Option Termination Agreement and obtaining payment for such Company Stock Options. The Buyer shall at all times from and after the Effective Time maintain sufficient liquid funds to satisfy its obligations to holders of Company Stock Options pursuant to this Section 2.3. If requested by the Buyer not less than five Business Days prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall coordinate with the Buyer and the Paying Agent to have the Option Consideration paid through the Companys payroll system. 

   

 2.4 _Dissenting Shares_. 

  

 (a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary and in accordance with Section 1906 of the PBCL, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock , the holders of which have timely filed written notices of an intention to demand payment of fair value for their shares ("Dissenting Shares") pursuant to Subchapter D of the PBCL and have not effectively withdrawn or lost their dissenters rights under the PBCL, shall not be converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration, and the holders thereof shall be entitled only to such rights as are granted by Section 1906 (c) and the applicable provisions of Subchapter D of the PBCL. 

   

 (b) If any such holder of Company Common Stock shall have failed to perfect or effectively shall have withdrawn or lost such right, the Dissenting Shares held by such holder shall be converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.1 of this Agreement, upon surrender by such holder of Certificates formerly representing such holders shares of Company Common Stock and a properly completed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent in accordance with Section 2.2(b) of this Agreement. 

     ##### 

 

   

 (c) The Company will give the Buyer (i) prompt notice of any written demands for payment of fair value for any Dissenting Shares and any other instruments received by the Company relating to dissenters rights, (ii) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for payment of fair value for any Dissenting Shares under the PBCL, and (iii) the right to approve any settlement of any such demand.

All patents and registrations for trademarks, service marks or copyrights owned by the Company are properly granted or registered, as the case may be, under applicable law, except where the failure to be so registered, individually or in the aggregate, is not reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

debts as they become due and shall own property having a fair saleable value
greater than the amounts required to pay their respective debts (including a
reasonable estimate of the amount of all contingent liabilities).
Immediately after giving effect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the closing of any financing to be obtained by the Buyer or any
of its Affiliates in order to effect the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, the Buyer and the Surviving Corporation shall have adequate
capital to carry on their respective businesses. No transfer of property is
being made and no obligation is being incurred in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the closing of any financing
to be obtained by the Buyer or any of its Affiliates in order to effect the

any other government officials, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy
Statement. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause all
documents that it is responsible for filing with the SEC or other
regulatory authorities under this Section 6.2 to comply in all material
respects with all applicable requirements of law and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder. Whenever any event occurs that is
required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement,
the Buyer or the Company, as the case may be, shall promptly inform the other
of such occurrence and cooperate in filing with the SEC or its staff or any
other government officials, and/or mailing to shareholders of the Company,
such amendment or supplement. 

  

 6.3 _Access to Information_. During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall (and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to) afford to the Buyers officers, employees, accountants, counsel and other representatives, reasonable access, upon reasonable notice, during normal business hours and in a manner that does not disrupt or interfere with business operations, to such of its properties, books, contracts, commitments, personnel and records as the Buyer shall reasonably request, and, during such period, the Company shall (and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to the Buyer (a) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed or received by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal or state securities laws and (b) all other information concerning its business, properties, assets and personnel as the Buyer may reasonably request. In addition, during the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall also provide the Buyers officers and employees reasonable access to the Companys customers and suppliers, provided that such access shall at all times be granted only if such access is scheduled in advance with the Company and only with the direct supervision or participation of one of the Companys officers, employees or representatives. The Buyer will hold any such information that is nonpublic in confidence in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement. 

  

 6.4 _Shareholders Meeting_. The Company, acting through the Company Board, shall take all actions in accordance with applicable law, its Articles of Incorporation and By-laws to promptly and duly call, give notice of, convene and hold as promptly as practicable the Company Meeting for the purpose of considering and voting upon the Company Voting Proposal. Subject to Section 6.1, (a) the Company Board shall recommend approval of the Company Voting Proposal by the shareholders of the Company and include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement and (b) the Company Board shall not withhold, withdraw or modify, or publicly propose or resolve to withhold, withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to the Buyer, the recommendation of the Company Board that the Companys shareholders vote in favor of the Company Voting Proposal. Subject to Section 6.1, the Company shall take all action that is both reasonable and lawful to solicit from its shareholders proxies in favor of the Company Voting Proposal and shall take all other action reasonably necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent of the shareholders of the Company required by the PBCL to obtain such approvals. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company, may adjourn or postpone the Company Meeting to the extent necessary to ensure that any required supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to the Companys shareholders or, 

   ##### 

  

    

if as of the time for which the Company Meeting is originally scheduled (as
set forth in the Proxy Statement) there are insufficient shares of Company
Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a
quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Company Meeting. 

  

 6.5 _Legal Conditions to the Merger; HSR Act_. 

  

 (a) Subject to the terms hereof, including Section 6.1 and Section 6.5(b) and (c), the Company and the Buyer shall each use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable, (ii) as promptly as practicable, obtain from any Governmental Entity or any other third party any consents, licenses, permits, waivers, approvals, authorizations, or orders required to be obtained or made by the Company or the Buyer or any of their Subsidiaries in connection with the authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) as promptly as practicable, make all necessary filings, and thereafter make any other required submissions, with respect to this Agreement and the Merger required under (A) the Exchange Act, and any other applicable federal or state securities laws, (B) the HSR Act and any related governmental request thereunder, and (C) any other applicable law, and (iv) execute or deliver any additional instruments necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this Agreement. The Company and the Buyer shall cooperate with each other in connection with the making of all such filings, including providing copies of all such documents to the non-filing party and its advisors prior to filing and, if requested, accepting reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested in connection therewith. The Company and the Buyer shall each use its commercially reasonable efforts to furnish to each other all information required for any application or other filing to be made pursuant to the rules and regulations of any applicable law (including all information required to be included in the Proxy Statement) in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the Buyer and the Company agree that nothing contained in this Section 6.5(a) shall modify or affect their respective rights and responsibilities under Section 6.5(b). 

   

 (b) Each of the Buyer and the Company (i) represents that it shall as promptly as practicable and in any event within ten (10) Business Days of the date hereof, make the filings required of such party or any Subsidiary under the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) agrees to use its best efforts to negotiate with the United States Federal Trade Commission, the United States Department of Justice and/or any other Governmental Entity in respect of such filings to prevent the issuance of any requests for additional information, documents or other materials under the HSR Act; provided, that, (x) if such a request is about to be issued notwithstanding the parties efforts, the parties shall discuss the withdrawal and refiling of the filings to avoid the issuance of such a request and to enable the parties to continue to attempt to resolve the issues raised by any Governmental Entity in connection with the filings without the need to respond to any such request, and each of the parties shall have the option of withdrawal and refiling, and that, (y) if any such requests are nonetheless issued, to seek modification of same and/or comply at the earliest practicable date with respect thereto, as modified; and (iii) shall act in good faith and reasonably cooperate with the other party in connection with any such filing and in connection with resolving any   ##### 

  

  

  

investigation or other inquiry of any such agency or other Governmental
Entity under any Antitrust Laws with respect to any such filing or any such
transaction. To the extent not prohibited by Law, each party to this
Agreement shall use reasonable best efforts to furnish to each other all
information required for any application or other filing to be made pursuant
to any Law in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Each of the Company and the Buyer shall give the other
reasonable prior notice of any communication with, and any proposed
understanding, undertaking or agreement with, any Governmental Entity
regarding any such filings or any such transaction. Neither the Company nor
any Subsidiary, on the one hand, and neither the Buyer nor the Transitional
Subsidiary, on the other hand, shall independently participate in any
meeting, or engage in any substantive conversation, with any Governmental
Entity in respect of any such filings, investigation or other inquiry without
giving the Buyer or the Company, as the case may be, prior notice of the
meeting and discussing with the Buyer or the Company, as the case may be, the
advisability of the Buyers or the Companys representatives, as the case may
be, participating in such meeting or conversation. 

   

 (c) Each of the Buyer and the Company shall use best efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to the transaction contemplated by this Agreement, under the HSR Act, the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and any other Laws or Orders that are designed to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade (collectively, "Antitrust Laws"). In connection therewith, if any action is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by this Agreement as inconsistent with or violative of any Antitrust Law, each of the Buyer and the Company shall cooperate and use best efforts to contest and resist such action, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any order whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents, delays or restricts consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including by pursuing all available avenues of administrative and judicial appeal and all available legislative action, unless the Buyer and the Company determine that litigation is not in their mutual best interests. Each of the Buyer and the Company shall use best efforts to take such action as may be required to cause the expiration of the notice periods under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as possible after the execution of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section shall be deemed to require the Company to take any action, or commit to take any action, or agree to any condition or restriction, in connection with obtaining the foregoing consents, approvals and authorizations of Governmental Authorities and having theretofore used best efforts hereunder to avoid having to take, or to otherwise mitigate, any such action, make any such commitment or agree to any such condition or restriction that would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. In the event that pursuant to any Antitrust Laws, a Governmental Entity requires that either the Buyer or the Company divest any of its business operations or assets, the parties agree that the Buyer will effect such required divestiture in order to permit the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to proceed on the terms set forth herein, so long as the proceeds of any such divestiture or divestitures are not distributed by the Company prior to the Closing. 

   

 (d) Each of the Company and the Buyer shall give (or shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to give) any notices to third parties, and use, and cause their respective Subsidiaries to use, commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any third party consents required in connection with the Merger that are (i) necessary to consummate the transactions   ##### 

  

  

  

contemplated hereby, (ii) disclosed or required to be disclosed in the
Company Disclosure Schedule or the Buyer Disclosure Schedule, as the case may
be, or (iii) required to prevent the occurrence of an event that is reasonably
likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or a Buyer Material Adverse
Effect prior to or after the Effective Time. 

   

 6.6 _Public Disclosure_. Except as may be required by law or stock market regulations, (a) the press release announcing the execution of this Agreement shall be issued only in such form as shall be mutually agreed upon by the Company and the Buyer and (b) the Buyer and the Company shall each use commercially reasonable efforts to consult with the other party before issuing any other press release or otherwise making any public statement with respect to the Merger or this Agreement. 

  

 6.7 _Indemnification: Directors  and Officers Insurance_. 

  

 (a) Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation to indemnify and hold harmless each person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the "Indemnified Parties"), against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including attorneys fees and disbursements (collectively, "Costs"), incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to the fact that the Indemnified Party is or was an officer or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time through and including the sixth anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time occurs, and any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation arising out of, interrelated with, or based on facts or allegations that are the same or interrelated with any that form the basis of any claim, action, suit or proceeding asserted or claimed prior to such anniversary, to the fullest extent provided under the PBCL or the Companys current Articles of Incorporation, By-laws or agreements with those persons. Each Indemnified Party will be entitled, subject to applicable law, to advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation from each of the Buyer and the Surviving Corporation within ten (10) Business Days of receipt by the Buyer or the Surviving Corporation from the Indemnified Party of a request therefor. 

   

 (b) The Articles of Incorporation and By-laws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain, and Buyer shall cause the Articles of Incorporation and By-laws of the Surviving Corporation to so contain, provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of present and former directors and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries than are presently set forth in the Articles of Incorporations and By-laws of the Company. 

   

 (c) The parties acknowledge that prior to the Closing Date the Company shall purchase an excess Differential in Coverage ("DIC Policy") directors and officers insurance policy having a term of six years and shall purchase a "tail" or "run off" policy covering both the Companys current directors and officers liability insurance policy and the DIC Policy and having a six year term; provided that the aggregate cost of the DIC Policy and the "tail" or "run off" policy shall not exceed $350,000. The Surviving Corporation shall maintain, and Buyer   ##### 

  

  

  

shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain, at no expense to the
beneficiaries, in effect for six (6) years from the Effective Time the
current policies of the directors and officers liability
insurance maintained by the Company (including the DIC Policy and such "tail"
or "run off" policy) with respect to matters existing or occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement). 

   

 (d) The Buyer shall pay all expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, that may be incurred by the persons referred to in this Section 6.7 in connection with their enforcement of their rights provided in this Section 6.7. 

   

 (e) The provisions of this Section 6.7 are intended to be in addition to the rights otherwise available to the current officers and directors of the Company by law, charter, statute, by-law or agreement, and shall operate for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties, their heirs and their representatives. 

   

 (f) In the event the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors assigns consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, then proper provision shall be made so that the surviving corporation or entity in such transaction shall succeed to the obligations set forth in this Section 6.7. 

   

 6.8 _Notification of Certain Matters_. During the Pre-Closing Period, the Buyer shall give prompt notice to the Company, and the Company shall give prompt notice to the Buyer, of (a) the occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event, which occurrence or failure to occur is reasonably likely to cause any representation or warranty of such party contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, in each case at any time from and after the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, or (b) any material failure of the Buyer and the Transitory Subsidiary or the Company, as the case may be, or of any officer, director, employee or agent thereof, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the above, the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section will not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice or the conditions to such partys obligation to consummate the Merger. 

  

 6.9 _Shareholder Litigation_. Each of the Company and the Buyer shall keep the other reasonably informed of any shareholder litigation or claim pending against the Company or the Buyer, as applicable, and its directors or officers, relating to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, further, that all obligations of the Company and the Buyer in this Section 6.9 shall be subject to the ability of such party under applicable laws to preserve attorney-client communication and privilege. 

  

 6.10 _Service Credit_. Following the Effective Time, the Buyer will give each employee of the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company (a "Company Employee") full credit for prior service with the Company or its Subsidiaries for purposes of (a) eligibility and vesting under any Buyer Employee Plans (as defined below), (b) determination of benefits levels under any Buyer Employee Plan or policy relating to vacation or severance and (c) determination of "retiree" status under any Buyer Employee Plan, in each case for which the Company Employee is 

   ##### 

  

    

otherwise eligible and in which the Company Employee is offered
participation, but except where such crediting would result in a duplication
of benefits. In addition, the Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to waive, or cause to be waived, any limitations on benefits relating to pre-
existing conditions to the same extent such limitations are waived under any
comparable plan of the Company and recognize for purposes of annual
deductible and out-of-pocket limits under its medical and dental
plans, deductible and out-of-pocket expenses paid by Company Employees in the
calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs. For purposes of this
Agreement, the term "Buyer Employee Plan" means any "employee pension benefit

plan" (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA), and any other written or oral
plan, agreement or arrangement, including insurance coverage, severance

or any of its Subsidiaries is a party.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Company shall not be required to take any action pursuant to this Section 6.12, including any action that would (i) have or reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on the Company or its Subsidiaries or the shareholders of the Company (except to the extent that such action can be rescinded without any adverse effect on the Company or its Subsidiaries or the shareholders), or (ii) (a) conflict with or violate the Companys Articles of Incorporation or By-laws or any law or (b) result in the contravention of, or that would reasonably be expected to result in a violation or breach of, or a default under, any Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party.

 (i) by the Company or the Buyer pursuant to Section 8.1(b) as a result of the failure to satisfy the conditions set forth in Section 7.2(a) or (b); or 

  

 (ii) by the Buyer pursuant to Section 8.1(e) or Section 8.1(f). 

  

 The expenses payable pursuant to this Section 8.3(b) shall be paid by wire transfer of same-day funds within ten (10) Business Days after demand therefor following the occurrence of the termination event giving rise to the payment obligation described in this Section 8.3(b). 

  

 (c) The Buyer shall pay the Company up to $1,500,000 as reimbursement for expenses of the Company actually incurred relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement prior to termination (including reasonable fees and expenses of the Companys counsel, accountants and financial advisors, but excluding any discretionary fees paid to such financial advisors), in the event of the termination of this Agreement by the Company or the Buyer pursuant to (i) Section 8.1(b) as a result of the failure to satisfy the conditions set forth in Section 7.3(a) or (b) or (ii) Section 8.1(g). The expenses payable pursuant to this Section 8.3(c) shall be paid by wire transfer of same-day funds within ten (10) Business Days after demand therefor following the occurrence of the termination event giving rise to the payment obligation described in this Section 8.3(c). 

   

 (d) In the event any amounts due under this Section 8.3 are not paid when due, such payments shall bear interest at a rate equal to the prime rate announced from time to time by _The Wall Street Journal_ plus 2% per annum, and in addition to being obligated to pay such applicable amounts and interest thereon, the party owing the amount shall pay or reimburse the other partys costs and expenses (including, but not limited to, reasonable legal fees and expenses) solely to the extent incurred in connection with any action, including, but not limited to, the filing of any lawsuit or other legal action to collect payment of such amounts and any interest thereon. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (e) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 8.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the parties would not enter into this Agreement. Payment of the fees and expenses described in this Section 8.3 shall not be in lieu of damages incurred in the event of a breach of this Agreement described in clause (a) of Section 8.2 but shall otherwise constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of the parties in connection with any termination of this Agreement. 

   

 8.4 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, at any time before or after approval of the matters presented in connection with the Merger by the shareholders of any party, but, after any such approval, no amendment shall be made that by law requires further approval by such shareholders without such further approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto. 

  

 8.5 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party. Such extension or waiver shall not be deemed to apply to any time for performance, inaccuracy in any representation or warranty, or noncompliance with any agreement or condition, as the case may be, other than that which is specified in the extension or waiver. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.

   ##### 

  

  

 9.3 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Schedules and Exhibits hereto and the documents and instruments referred to herein that are to be delivered at the Closing) constitutes the entire agreement among the parties to this Agreement and supersedes any prior understandings, agreements or representations by or among the parties hereto, or any of them, written or oral, with respect to the subject matter hereof; provided that the Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in effect in accordance with its terms. 

  

 9.4 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as provided in Section 6.7 (with respect to which the Indemnified Parties shall be third party beneficiaries), this Agreement is not intended, and shall not be deemed, to confer any rights or remedies upon any person other than the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns, to create any agreement of employment with any person or to otherwise create any third-party beneficiary hereto. 

  

 9.5 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or delegated, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties, and any such assignment without such prior written consent shall be null and void, except that the Buyer may assign, in its sole discretion, all or any of its rights, interests and obligations under this Agreement to any Affiliate of Buyer with the consent of the Company, but no such assignment shall relieve the Buyer of any of its obligations under this Agreement. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. 

  

 9.6 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof is invalid or unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that the court making such determination shall have the power to limit the term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified. In the event such court does not exercise the power granted to it in the prior sentence, the parties hereto agree to replace such invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a valid and enforceable term or provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such invalid or unenforceable term. 

  

 9.7 _Counterparts and Signature_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which together shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties hereto and delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all parties need not sign the same counterpart. This Agreement may be executed and delivered by facsimile transmission. 

  

 9.8 _Interpretation_. When reference is made in this Agreement to an Article or a Section, such reference shall be to an Article or Section of this Agreement, unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents, table of defined terms and headings contained in this 

   ##### 

  

    

Agreement are for convenience of reference only and shall not affect in any
way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. The language used in
this Agreement shall be deemed to be the language chosen by the parties
hereto to express their mutual intent, and no rule of strict construction
shall be applied against any party. Whenever the context may require, any
pronouns used in this Agreement shall include the corresponding masculine,
feminine or neuter forms, and the singular form of nouns and pronouns shall
include the plural, and vice versa. Any reference to any federal, state,
local or foreign statute or law shall be deemed also to refer to all rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the context requires
otherwise. The terms "material," "materially" or "materiality" as used in
this Agreement with an initial lower case "m" are agreed to have
their respective customary and ordinary meanings, without regard to the
meanings ascribed to Company Material Adverse Effect in Section 3.1 or Buyer
Material Adverse Effect in Section 4.1. Whenever the words "include,"
"includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed
to be followed by the words "without limitation." No summary of this
Agreement prepared by any party shall affect the meaning or interpretation of
this Agreement. 

  

 9.9 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, except that the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania shall apply to the Merger. 

  

 9.10 _Remedies_. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. 

  

 9.11 _Submission to Jurisdiction_. Each of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally (i) agrees to be subject to, and hereby consents and submits to, the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Southern District Court of New York located in the borough of Manhattan in the City of New York, or if such court does not have jurisdiction, the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County, for the purposes of any suit, action or other proceeding arising out of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii), to the extent such party is not otherwise subject to service of process in the State of New York, appoints The Corporation Trust Company, as such Partys agent in the State of New York, for acceptance of legal process and (iii) agrees that service made on any such agent set forth in (ii) above shall have the same legal force and effect as if served upon such Party personally within such state. 

  

 9.12 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE BUYER, THE TRANSITORY SUBSIDIARY AND THE COMPANY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO 

   ##### 

  

    

THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE ACTIONS OF THE
BUYER, THE TRANSITORY SUBSIDIARY OR THE COMPANY IN THE NEGOTIATION,
ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT. 

  

 9.13 _Disclosure Schedules_. The Company Disclosure Schedule and the Buyer Disclosure Schedule shall each be arranged in Sections corresponding to the numbered Sections contained in Article III, in the case of the Company Disclosure Schedule, or Article IV, in the case of the Buyer Disclosure Schedule, and the disclosure in any Section shall qualify (a) the corresponding Section in Article III or Article IV, as the case may be, and (b) the other Sections in Article III or Article IV, as the case may be, to the extent that it is reasonably apparent from a reading of such disclosure that it also qualifies or applies to such other Sections. The inclusion of any information in the Company Disclosure Schedule or the Buyer Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed to be an admission or acknowledgment, in and of itself, that such information is required by the terms hereof to be disclosed, is material, has resulted in or would result in a Company Material Adverse Effect or a Buyer Material Adverse Effect, or is outside the Ordinary Course of Business.

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants and agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereby agree, severally and not jointly, as follows: 

   ##### 

  

  

 Section 1\. _Voting of Shares_. 

  

 (a) Each Shareholder covenants and agrees that during the term of this Agreement, at the Company Meeting or any other meeting of the Shareholders of the Company, however called, including any adjournment or postponement thereof, or in connection with any written consent of the Shareholders of the Company, each Shareholder shall, in each case to the fullest extent that such Shareholders Shares are entitled to vote thereon or consent thereto: 

  

 (i) appear at each such meeting or otherwise cause the Shareholders Shares to be counted as present thereat for purposes of calculating a quorum; and 

   

 (ii) vote (or cause to be voted), in person or by proxy, or deliver (or cause to be delivered) a written consent covering, all of the Shareholders Shares (i) in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement; and (ii) against any Acquisition Proposal or any other action, agreement or transaction that is intended, or could reasonably be expected, to materially impede, interfere with, delay, postpone, discourage or materially and adversely affect the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or this Agreement or the performance by the Shareholder of its obligations under this Agreement, including: (A) any extraordinary corporate transaction, such as a merger, consolidation or other business combination involving the Company or its Subsidiaries (other than the Merger); (B) a sale, lease or transfer of a material amount of assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or a reorganization, recapitalization or liquidation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; (C) an election of new members to the board of directors of the Company, other than nominees to the board of directors of the Company in office on the date of this Agreement; (D) any material change in the present capitalization or dividend policy of the Company or any amendment or other change to the Companys certificate of incorporation or bylaws, except if approved by the Buyer; or (E) any other material change in the Companys corporate structure or business. 

   

 (b) Each Shareholder hereby irrevocably grants to, and appoints, the Buyer, and any individual designated in writing by the Buyer, and each of them individually, as his or her proxy and attorney-in-fact (with full power of substitution), for and in his or her name, place and stead, to vote such Shareholders Shares at any meeting of the shareholders of the Company called with respect to any of the matters specified in, and in accordance and consistent with, this Section 1. Each Shareholder understands and acknowledges that the Buyer is entering into the Merger Agreement in reliance upon each Shareholders execution and delivery of this Agreement. Each Shareholder hereby affirms that the irrevocable proxy set forth in this Section 1(b) is given in connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, and that such irrevocable proxy is given to secure the performance of the duties of such Shareholder under this Agreement. Except as otherwise provided for herein, each Shareholder hereby affirms that the irrevocable proxy is coupled with an interest and is irrevocable, and each Shareholder will take such further action or execute such other instruments as may be necessary to effectuate the intent of this proxy and hereby revokes any proxy previously granted by the Shareholder with respect to the Shareholders Shares. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, the irrevocable proxy granted hereunder shall automatically terminate upon the termination of this Agreement. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (c) Except as set forth in Section 1(a), no Shareholder shall be restricted from voting in favor of, against or abstaining with respect to any matter presented to the shareholders of the Company. In addition, nothing in this Agreement shall give the Buyer or any of its designees the right to vote any Shares in connection with the election of directors. 

  

 Section 2\. _No Inconsistent Agreements_. Each Shareholder hereby covenants and agrees that, except for this Agreement, the Shareholder (a) has not entered into, and shall not enter into at any time while this Agreement remains in effect, any voting agreement or voting trust with respect to the Shareholders Shares and (b) has not granted, and shall not grant at any time while this Agreement remains in effect, a proxy, consent or power of attorney with respect to the Shareholders Shares. 

  

 Section 3\. _Transfer of Shares_. Each Shareholder covenants and agrees that while this Agreement is in effect, such Shareholder will not (a) sell, assign, transfer, pledge, encumber or otherwise dispose of any of the Shares, (b) deposit any of the Shares into a voting trust or enter into a voting agreement or arrangement with respect to the Shares or grant any proxy or power of attorney with respect thereto that is inconsistent with this Agreement or (c) enter into any contract, option or other arrangement or undertaking with respect to the direct or indirect sale, assignment, transfer or other disposition of any Shares; provided that the foregoing shall not prevent (i) the transfer of Shares upon the death of a Shareholder pursuant to the terms of any trust or will of the Shareholder or by the laws of intestate succession, but only if, and any such transfer shall be void unless, the transferee executes and delivers to the Buyer an agreement to be bound by the terms of this Agreement to the same extent as the Shareholder or (ii) the conversion of the Shares into the right to receive Merger Consideration pursuant to the Merger in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement. 

  

 Section 4\. _Indemnification Obligations of the Majority Shareholder_. 

  

 (a) The Majority Shareholder hereby covenants and agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements (collectively, " _Costs_ ") incurred or suffered by the Buyer or the Company directly or proximately resulting from (i) a breach of any of the representations and warranties of the Company contained in Article III of the Merger Agreement, notwithstanding the termination of representations and warranties at the Effective Time pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement and (ii) any litigation, the subject matter of which is welding rod fumes and which arises out of the operation of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time. At the Closing, the Majority Shareholder, the Buyer and the Escrow Agent shall execute the Escrow Agreement, pursuant to which, on the Effective Date, the Buyer shall deposit with the Escrow Agent, on behalf of the Majority Shareholder, Twelve Million and Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($12,500,000) of the aggregate Merger Consideration payable to the Majority Shareholder pursuant to Section 2.1(d) of the Merger Agreement (the " _Escrow Amount_ "), to be held in escrow pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement for the purpose of securing the indemnification obligations of the Majority Shareholder set forth in this Section 4 of this Agreement. The Majority Shareholder and Buyer hereby agree that the Escrow 

   ##### 

  

    

Agreement and recourse to the Escrow Amount shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy available to the Buyer in respect of any claim by the Buyer under this
Section 4 of this Agreement. 

  

 (b) Notwithstanding anything else contained in this Agreement, (i) the Buyer shall not make a claim under this Section 4 of the Agreement unless and until the amount of all such claims by the Buyer exceeds Seven Hundred and Fifty Thousand Dollars ($750,000.00), in which case the Buyer shall be entitled to make a demand for the whole amount of such claims and all such subsequent claims, (ii) the Majority Shareholder shall have no liability for, and in no event shall the Majority Shareholder be required to indemnify the Buyer against, any Costs incurred or suffered by the Buyer directly or proximately resulting from any stockholder litigation arising from or relating to the Merger, and (iii) in no event shall the liability of the Majority Shareholder under this Section 4 exceed the Escrow Amount. 

  

 (c) The Buyer shall give written notification to the Majority Shareholder of the commencement of any suit or proceeding by a person or entity other than the Buyer, which the Buyer reasonably believes may give rise to a claim for indemnification hereunder (a " _Third Party Action_ "). Such notification shall be given within 20 days after receipt by the Buyer of notice of such Third Party Action, and shall describe in reasonable detail the facts constituting the basis for such Third Party Action and the amount of the claimed damages. Within 20 days after delivery of such notification, the Majority Shareholder may, upon written notice thereof to the Buyer, assume control of the defense of such Third Party Action with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Buyer. If the Majority Shareholder does not so assume control of the defense of a Third Party Action, the Buyer shall control such defense. The non-controlling party may participate in such defense at its own expense. The party controlling such defense shall keep the non-controlling party advised of the status of such Third Party Action and the defense thereof and shall consider in good faith recommendations made by the non-controlling party with respect thereto. The non-controlling party shall furnish the controlling party with such information as it may have with respect to such Third Party Action (including copies of any summons, complaint or other pleading which may have been served on such party and any written claim, demand, invoice, billing or other document evidencing or asserting the same) and shall otherwise cooperate with and assist the controlling party in the defense of such Third Party Action. The Majority Shareholder shall not agree to any settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any Third Party Action without the prior written consent of the Buyer, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; provided that the consent of the Buyer shall not be required if the Majority Shareholder agrees in writing to pay any amounts payable pursuant to such settlement or judgment and such settlement or judgment includes a complete release of the Buyer from further liability and has no other adverse effect on the Buyer. The Buyer shall not agree to any settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any such Third Party Action without the prior written consent of the Majority Shareholder, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. 

  

 (d) In order to seek indemnification under this Section 4, the Buyer shall deliver a written notification (a " _Claim Notice_ ") to the Majority Shareholder, which notification shall contain a description of the Costs incurred by the Buyer or the Company, a statement that the Buyer is entitled to indemnification under this Section 4 for such Costs and a reasonable explanation of the basis thereof and a demand for payment in the amount of such Costs (the 

   ##### 

  

 

" _Claimed Amount_ "). The Buyer shall have the right to aggregate or
accumulate de minimis Claimed Amounts for the purpose of providing a Claim
Notice to the Majority Shareholder. 

   

 (e) Within 20 days after delivery of a Claim Notice, the Majority Shareholder shall deliver to the Buyer a response to such Claim Notice in writing (a " _Response_ "), in which the Majority Shareholder shall: (i) agree that the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive all of the Claimed Amount (in which case, within three days following the delivery of the Response, the Buyer and the Majority Shareholder shall deliver to the Escrow Agent, a written notice executed by both parties instructing the Escrow Agent to disburse the Claimed Amount to the Buyer), (ii) agree that the Buyer is entitled to receive part, but not all, of the Claimed Amount (the " _Agreed Amount_ ") (in which case, within three days following the delivery of the Response, the Buyer and the Majority Shareholder shall deliver to the Escrow Agent, a written notice executed by both parties instructing the Escrow Agent to disburse the Agreed Amount to the Buyer) or (iii) dispute that the Buyer is entitled to receive any of the Claimed Amount. 

  

 (f) During the 30-day period following the delivery of a Response that reflects a dispute, the Buyer and the Majority Shareholder shall use good faith efforts to resolve the dispute. If the dispute is not resolved within such 30-day period, the Buyer and the Majority Shareholder shall discuss in good faith the submission of the dispute to binding arbitration. The provisions of this Section 4(f) shall not obligate the Buyer and the Majority Shareholder to submit to arbitration or any other alternative dispute resolution procedure with respect to any dispute, and in the absence of an agreement by the Buyer and the Majority Shareholder to arbitrate a dispute, such dispute shall be resolved in a state or federal court sitting in New York, New York. Promptly following the resolution of the dispute (whether by mutual agreement, arbitration, judicial decision or otherwise), the Buyer and the Majority Shareholder shall deliver to the Escrow Agent, a written notice executed by both parties instructing the Escrow Agent as to what (if any) portion of the Escrow Amount shall be disbursed to the Buyer and/or the Majority Shareholder (which notice shall be consistent with the terms of the resolution of the dispute). 

  

 (g) The obligations of the Majority Shareholder under this Section 4 shall terminate on the third anniversary of the Effective Time, except with respect to claims made against the Escrow Amount prior to such date. 

  

 Section 5\. _Leases_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Master Lease Agreement between Valley National Gases, Inc. and West Rental Inc., dated as of May 1, 2001, and the leases identified on _Schedule II_ hereto shall be amended on mutually agreeable terms to provide that in the event of any renewal for an additional five-year period (as provided in the respective lease agreements), the rents during such five-year renewal term shall be equal to the fair market value rent on the date of the commencement of the renewal term. In addition, such leases shall be further amended to provide that upon the expiration of the five-year renewal term, the Company shall have the option to renew such lease for an additional term of five years. The Majority Shareholder agrees to use his best efforts to effect the foregoing amendments, and agrees that his obligation to do so may be enforced by the Company. 

  

 Section 6\. _Representations and Warranties of the Shareholders_. Each Shareholder on his or her own behalf hereby severally represents and warrants to the Buyer with respect to such Shareholder and such Shareholders ownership of the Shares as follows: 

   #####
