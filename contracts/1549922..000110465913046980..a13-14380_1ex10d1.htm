Companys assets based on the relative fair market values of the Companys
assets in a manner consistent with Section 1060 of the Code and Treasury
Regulations thereunder. SMP Holdings shall deliver the Allocation Schedule to
Summit MLP as soon as practicable after the Closing Date for Summit MLPs
review and reasonable comments. Within 30 days after receiving such Allocation
Schedule, Summit MLP shall notify SMP Holdings in writing if Summit MLP has
any objections to the allocations on the Allocation Schedule and shall specify
the basis for any such objections. If Summit MLP does not notify SMP Holdings
of any objection to the Allocation Schedule, then it shall be deemed agreed to
by SMP Holdings and Summit MLP and the Allocation Schedule shall be final and
binding. If Summit MLP objects to any allocations on the Allocation Schedule,
then SMP Holdings and Summit MLP shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any
disagreement regarding the Allocation Schedule as soon as practicable (taking
into account the due date of any Tax Returns on which the allocation set forth
in the Allocation Schedule is required to be reflected) and shall memorialize
the agreed allocation in a final Allocation Schedule, which shall be final and
binding. The final Allocation Schedule shall be revised to take into account
subsequent adjustments to the Consideration, including any Working Capital
Adjustment and any indemnification payments (any of which shall be treated for
Tax purposes as adjustments to the Consideration), in accordance with the
provisions of Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
thereunder.

 



      
 

 



 

(g) Summit MLP and SMP Holdings shall report, act and file Tax Returns for Tax
purposes in all respects consistent with the Allocation Schedule. None of
Summit MLP, SMP Holdings, the Company or their respective Affiliates shall
take any position for Tax purposes (whether in audits, Tax Returns or
otherwise) that is inconsistent with the Allocation Schedule unless required
to do so by applicable Law. If any Taxing Authority disputes the allocation
set forth in the Allocation Schedule, the party receiving notice of the
dispute shall promptly notify the other parties hereto of such dispute and the
parties hereto shall cooperate in good faith in responding to such dispute in
order to preserve the effectiveness of the allocation set forth in the
Allocation Schedule.

 



 

(h) Summit MLP shall promptly notify SMP Holdings in writing upon receipt by
Summit MLP, the Company or any of its Affiliates, of notice of any pending or
threatened Tax Claim for which SMP Holdings might have liability pursuant to
this Agreement (" ** _Indemnified Tax Claim_** "); _provided, however_ , that
the failure to so notify shall not relieve SMP Holdings of any liability
hereunder except to the extent SMP Holdings is actually prejudiced thereby.
SMP Holdings shall have the right to represent the Companys interests in any
such Indemnified Tax Claim that relates to a Pre-Closing Period, and SMP
Holdings shall have the right to employ counsel of their choice, and to
control such proceeding or examination at SMP Holdings cost; _provided,
however_ , that SMP Holdings shall keep Summit MLP reasonably informed of the
progress of any such audit or other proceeding and shall not settle any such
Indemnified Tax Claim without the prior written consent of Summit MLP, which
consent may not be unreasonably withheld. In the case of an Indemnified Tax
Claim relating to a Straddle Period, Summit MLP shall have the right to
control such Indemnified Tax Claim and to employ counsel of its choice;
_provided, however_ , that SMP Holdings shall be entitled to participate in
the defense of any such Indemnified Tax Claim with counsel of their choosing.
None of Summit MLP, any of its Affiliates or the Company may settle an
Indemnified Tax Claim without the prior written consent of SMP Holdings, which
consent may not be unreasonably withheld.

 



 

(i) Summit MLP and SMP Holdings intend and expect that the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will be treated, for purposes of federal Income
Tax and for purposes of certain state Income Tax Laws that incorporate or
follow federal Income Tax principles, as a contribution of the Assets of the
Company to Summit MLP in exchange for the Common Unit Consideration, the
General Partner Unit Consideration, the assumption of any liabilities of the
Company, and the Closing Payment, in accordance with Section 721 of the Code,
and the Closing Payment (and any other consideration that for Tax purposes
would not be permitted to be received on a Tax deferred basis under Section
721 of the Code) will be treated as a reimbursement of SMP Holdings or its
Affiliates preformation expenditures with respect to the Assets of the
Company within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.707-4(d) to the
maximum extent applicable.

 



 

(j) To the extent permitted by applicable Law, Summit MLP and SMP Holdings
agree to report each indemnification payment made in respect of a Loss as an
adjustment to the Consideration for federal income Tax purposes.

 



 

6.3 **_Public Announcements_**. The Parties will maintain the confidentiality
of this Agreement and its terms except that any Party may disclose this
Agreement or any of its terms to

 



      
 

 



 

any of the following if advised of the confidentiality obligations of such

Party or any Affiliate of such Party and (b) any potential lender to such

the transactions contemplated hereby and shall not make or issue, or cause to
be made or issued, any such publication or press release prior to such
consultation and without the prior written consent of the other Party (which
consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) except to the extent,
but only to such extent, that, in the opinion of the Party issuing such
publication or press release, such announcement or statement may be required
by Law, any listing agreement with any securities exchange or any securities
exchange regulation, in which case the Party proposing to issue such
publication or press release shall use its reasonable efforts to consult in
good faith with the other Party before issuing any such publication or press
release and shall reasonably cooperate with the other Party in good faith with
respect to the timing, manner and content of disclosure.

 



 

6.4 **_Termination of Agreements with SMP Holdings and Non-Company
Affiliates_**. As of the date hereof, the Company has entered into a
termination and release with SMP Holdings or any Non-Company Affiliate with
whom the Company has an agreement or to whom the Company owes any obligation,
other than the agreements listed on _Schedule 6.4_.

 



 

6.5 **_Recordation of Easements_**. The Company agrees that if any easements
listed on _Schedule 3.9(c)_ are not filed of record with the appropriate
Governmental Authority (including the applicable real property records with
respect to any such easements) as of the date hereof, the Company shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to file or record (as applicable), or
cause to be filed or recorded, such easements following the date hereof.

 



 

6.6 **_Further Assurances_**. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, at any time or from time to time after the Closing, at any Partys
request and without further consideration, the other Party shall (and in the
case of Summit MLP, Summit MLP shall and shall cause the Company to) execute
and deliver to such Party such other instruments of sale, transfer,
conveyance, assignment and confirmation, provide such materials and
information and take such other actions as such Party may reasonably request
in order to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

6.7 **_Indemnification Under the Original Acquisition Agreement_**. To the
extent that SMP Holdings or its Affiliate is owed indemnification or other
payment under the Original Acquisition Agreement with respect to breaches of
representations and warranties associated with the Business or any assets,
liabilities or obligations comprising part of the Business, SMP Holdings will
use commercially reasonable efforts to pursue such indemnification and/or
other payment from the Original Sellers in good faith, and (to the extent SMP
Holdings owes an indemnification payment to Summit MLP, the Company or their
Affiliates under _Article VII_ and has not already made such payment to
Summit MLP, the Company or their Affiliates under _Article VII_) will pay
over any such amounts received to Summit MLP.

this _Article VII_ shall survive Closing until February 14, 2014, except that
the survival period shall be extended to the first anniversary of the Closing

caused by an action taken by Meadowlark, the Company or SMP Holdings during
the period from and after February 15, 2013 through the Closing Date, after
which applicable date and time no Claims for indemnification may be asserted,
regardless of when such right arose; _provided_ that the representations and

7.2 **_Indemnification of Summit MLP and the Company by SMP Holdings_**.
Subject to the limitations on recourse and recovery set forth in this _Article
VII_, from and after the Closing, SMP Holdings will indemnify, defend and hold
harmless Summit MLP and the Company and their respective Affiliates from and
against any and all Losses imposed upon or incurred after the Closing in

Warranty Breach_** ");

 



 

(b) the inaccuracy or breach of any representation or warranty made by SMP
Holdings in _Article IV_ (each such inaccuracy or breach, a " ** _SMP
Holdings Warranty Breach_** ");

 



 

(c) any nonfulfillment or breach by SMP Holdings or the Company of any
covenant or agreement made by SMP Holdings or the Company under this
Agreement; and

 



 

(d) any and all SMP Holdings Taxes;

 



 

 _provided_ that for purposes of determining Losses under subsections (a) and

Holdings Warranty Breach has occurred, any qualification or exception
contained therein relating to materiality (including Material Adverse Effect)
shall be disregarded.

 



 

7.3 **_Indemnification of SMP Holdings by Summit MLP_**. Subject to the
limitations on recourse and recovery set forth in this _Article VII_, from
and after the Closing, Summit MLP shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless

 _provided_ that for purposes of determining Losses under subsection (a) above
and determining whether or not any Summit MLP Warranty Breach has occurred,
any qualification or exception contained therein relating to materiality

7.4 **_Limitations_**.

 



 

(a) Except for a Warranty Breach with respect to a Fundamental Representation
or _Section 3.14_, _3.18_ , _4.5_ or _5.9_ , if any Claim for indemnification
by Summit MLP, the Company or SMP Holdings relating to any Warranty Breach
that is subject to indemnification under _Sections 7.2(a)_, _7.2(b)_ or
_7.3(a)_ results in aggregate Losses that do not exceed $50,000 then such
Losses shall not be deemed to be Losses under this Agreement and shall not be
eligible for indemnification under this _Article VII_.

 



 

(b) Except for a Warranty Breach with respect to a Fundamental Representation
or _Section 3.14_, _3.18_ , _4.5_ or _5.9_ , Summit MLP, the Company and SMP
Holdings shall be entitled to be indemnified pursuant to _Sections 7.2(a)_,
_7.2(b)_ or _7.3(a)_ for Losses incurred for any Warranty Breach (excluding
any item or Loss below the threshold listed in _Section 7.4(a))_ only if and
to the extent that the aggregate amount of all such Losses exceeds $2,500,000,
subject to the other limitations on recovery and recourse set forth in this
Agreement.

 



 

(c) Except for a Warranty Breach with respect to a Fundamental Representation
or _Section 3.14_, _3.18_ or _4.5_ , SMP Holdings liability under _Sections
7.2(a)_ and _7.2(b)_ will be limited, in the aggregate, to $37,500,000. Under
no circumstance will SMP Holdings liability for any Losses under _Section
7.2_, including Losses with respect to a Fundamental Representation or
_Section 3.14_, _3.18_ or _4.5_ , exceed the value of the proceeds received
by SMP Holdings in the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(d) No indemnifying Person shall be liable for any Losses that are subject to
indemnification under _Sections 7.2_ or _7.3_ unless a written demand for
indemnification under this Agreement is delivered by the indemnified Person to
the indemnifying Person with respect thereto prior to 5:00 P.M. on the final
date pursuant to _Section 7.1_, to assert a Claim for indemnification on the
basis asserted in such written demand. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any
Claim for indemnification under this Agreement that is brought prior to such
time will survive until such matter is resolved.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
under no circumstances shall any Party be entitled to double recovery under
this Agreement, and

 



      
 

 



 

to the extent a Party is compensated for a matter through the Working Capital
Adjustment, any net Tax benefit actually realized or third party recovery or
insurance recovery actually received, such Party shall not have a separate
right to indemnification for such matter.

 



 

7.5 **_Claims Procedures_**.

 



 

(a) Promptly after receipt by any indemnified Person of notice of the
commencement or assertion of any Claim or Proceeding by a third party or
circumstances which, with the lapse of time, such indemnified Person believes
is likely to give rise to a Claim or Proceeding by a third party or of facts
causing any indemnified Person to believe it has a Claim for breach hereunder
(an " ** _Asserted Liability_** "), such indemnified Person shall give prompt
written notice thereof (the " ** _Claims Notice_** ") to the relevant
indemnifying Person, _provided_ that in any event, such indemnified Person
shall give the Claims Notice to the indemnifying Person no later than 30 days
after becoming aware of such Asserted Liability. So long as the Claims Notice
is given within the applicable survival period set forth in _Section 7.1_,
the failure to so notify the indemnifying Person shall not relieve the
indemnifying Person of its obligations or liability hereunder, except to the
extent such failure shall have actually prejudiced the indemnifying Person.
The Claims Notice shall describe the Asserted Liability in reasonable detail,
and shall indicate the amount (estimated, if necessary) of the Loss that has
been or may be suffered. The indemnified Person and the indemnifying Person
agree to keep each other reasonably appraised of any additional information
concerning any Asserted Liability.

 



 

(b) As to an Asserted Liability arising from a third party action, the
indemnifying Person shall be, subject to the limitations set forth in this
_Section 7.5_, entitled to assume control of and appoint lead counsel for
such defense only for so long as it conducts such defense with reasonable
diligence. The indemnifying Person shall keep the indemnified Persons advised
of the status of such third party action and the defense thereof on a
reasonably current basis and shall consider in good faith the recommendations
made by the indemnified Persons with respect thereto. If the indemnifying
Person assumes the control of the defense of any third party action in
accordance with the provisions of this _Section 7.5_, the indemnified Person
shall be entitled to participate in the defense of any such third party action
and to employ, at its expense, separate counsel of its choice for such
purpose, it being understood, however, that the indemnifying Person shall
continue to control such defense; _provided_ that notwithstanding the
foregoing, the indemnifying Person shall pay the reasonable costs and expenses
of such defense (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) of the
indemnified Persons if (x) the indemnified Persons outside counsel shall have
reasonably concluded and advised in writing (with a copy to the indemnifying
Person) that there are defenses available to such indemnified Person that are
different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying Person, or
(y) the indemnified Persons outside counsel shall have advised in writing
(with a copy to the indemnifying Person) the indemnified Person that there is
a conflict of interest that would make it inappropriate under applicable
standards of professional conduct to have common counsel for the indemnifying
Person and the indemnified Person. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the
indemnifying Person shall obtain the prior written consent of the indemnified
Person before entering into any settlement, compromise, admission or
acknowledgement of the validity of such Asserted Liability if the settlement
requires an admission of guilt or wrongdoing on the party of the indemnified
Person, subjects the indemnified Person to criminal liability or does not
unconditionally release the indemnified Person from all liabilities and
obligations with respect to

 



      
 

 



 

such Asserted Liability or the settlement imposes injunctive or other
equitable relief against, or any continuing obligation or payment requirement
on, the indemnified Person and (ii) the indemnified Person shall be entitled
to participate, at its own cost and expense, in the defense of such Asserted
Liability and to employ separate counsel of its choice for such purpose.

 



 

(c) Each Party shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution of any Asserted
Liability arising from a third party action and shall furnish or cause to be
furnished such records, information and testimony (subject to any applicable
confidentiality agreement), and attend such conferences, discovery
proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals as may be reasonably requested in
connection therewith.

 



 

7.6 **_Waiver of Other Representations_**.

 



 

(a) NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT TO THE CONTRARY, IT IS THE
EXPLICIT INTENT OF EACH PARTY, AND THE PARTIES HEREBY AGREE, THAT NEITHER SMP

PARTICULAR PURPOSE WITH RESPECT TO THE COMPANY INTERESTS, THE ASSETS OF THE
COMPANY OR THE COMPANY, OR ANY PART THEREOF, EXCEPT THOSE REPRESENTATIONS AND
WARRANTIES EXPRESSLY CONTAINED IN _Article III_ AND _Article IV_.

 



 

(b) EXCEPT THOSE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES EXPRESSLY CONTAINED IN
_Article III_ AND _Article IV_, SMP HOLDINGS INTERESTS IN THE COMPANY ARE
BEING TRANSFERRED THROUGH THE SALE OF THE COMPANY INTERESTS "AS IS, WHERE IS,
WITH ALL FAULTS," AND SMP HOLDINGS AND ITS AFFILIATES AND THEIR RESPECTIVE
REPRESENTATIVES EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY
KIND OR NATURE, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO THE CONDITION, VALUE OR QUALITY OF
THE COMPANY AND ITS ASSETS OR THE PROSPECTS (FINANCIAL OR OTHERWISE), RISKS
AND OTHER INCIDENTS OF THE COMPANY AND ITS ASSETS.

 



 

7.7 **_Waiver of Remedies_**.

 



 

(a) Other than for instances of actual fraud, the Parties hereby agree that
from and after Closing no Party shall have any liability, and neither Party
nor any of their respective Affiliates shall make any Claim, for any Loss or
any other matter, under, relating to or arising out of this Agreement
(including breach of representation, warranty, covenant or agreement) or any
other Contract or other matter delivered pursuant hereto, or the transactions
contemplated hereby, whether based on contract, tort, strict liability, other
Laws or otherwise, except for a claim for indemnification pursuant to _Article
VII_.

 



 

(b) NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT TO THE CONTRARY, EXCEPT IN THE
CASE OF ACTUAL FRAUD, NO PARTY NOR ANY OF

 



      
 

 



 

ITS AFFILIATES SHALL BE LIABLE FOR THE FOLLOWING (" ** _Non-Reimbursable
Damages_** "): SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR
INDIRECT DAMAGES (INCLUDING ANY DAMAGES ON ACCOUNT OF LOST PROFITS OR
OPPORTUNITIES, OR LOST OR DELAYED BUSINESS BASED ON VALUATION METHODOLOGIES
ASCRIBING A DECREASE IN VALUE TO THE COMPANY, ON THE BASIS OF A MULTIPLE OF A
REDUCTION IN A MULTIPLE-BASED OR YIELD-BASED MEASURE OF FINANCIAL
PERFORMANCE), WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, OTHER LAW OR
OTHERWISE AND WHETHER OR NOT ARISING FROM THE OTHER PARTYS OR ANY OF ITS
AFFILIATES SOLE, JOINT OR CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER
FAULT, EXCEPT ONLY IN THOSE PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE THE CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES ARE REASONABLY FORESEEABLE (SUCH AS THE TERMINATION OF A CONTRACT OR A
DELAY OR INTERRUPTION IN REVENUES OR OPERATIONS RESULTING THEREFROM), IN WHICH
CASE THE BREACHING PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE FOR THE NET PRESENT VALUE OF ANY SUCH
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING LOST PROFITS) THAT ARE THE REASONABLY
FORESEEABLE RESULT OF A BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT BY SUCH PARTY, SUBJECT TO THE
OTHER LIMITATIONS AND REQUIREMENTS SET FORTH HEREIN, INCLUDING _SECTION
7.11_; _PROVIDED, HOWEVER,_ ANY AMOUNTS PAYABLE TO THIRD PARTIES PURSUANT TO A
CLAIM BY A THIRD PARTY SHALL NOT BE DEEMED NON-REIMBURSABLE DAMAGES.

 



 

7.8 **_Access to Information_**. After the Closing Date, the Company, SMP
Holdings and Summit MLP shall grant each other (or their respective
designees), and Summit MLP shall cause the Company to grant to SMP Holdings
(or its designee), access at all reasonable times to all of the books,
records, documents, instruments, accounts, correspondence, writings, evidences
of title and other papers and electronic files relating to the Business of the
Company in SMP Holdings or SMP Holdings Affiliates possession or the
possession of the Company (the " ** _Records_** "), and shall afford such
party the right (at such partys expense) to take extracts therefrom and to
make copies thereof, to the extent reasonably necessary to implement the
provisions of, or to investigate or defend any Claims among the Parties and/or
their Affiliates arising under, this Agreement. Summit MLP shall maintain, and
shall cause the Company to maintain, such Records until the seventh
anniversary of the Closing Date (or for such longer period of time as SMP
Holdings shall advise Summit MLP is necessary in order to have the Records
available with respect to Tax matters), or if any of the Records pertain to
any Claim or Dispute pending on the seventh anniversary of the Closing Date,
Summit MLP shall maintain any of the Records designated by SMP Holdings or its
Representatives until such Claim or Dispute is finally resolved and the time
for all appeals has been exhausted.

 



 

7.9 **_Dispute Resolution and Arbitration_**.

 



 

(a) In the event of any dispute, controversy or Claim among the Parties, or
any of them, arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the breach or
invalidity thereof (collectively, a " ** _Dispute_** "), the Parties shall
attempt in the first instance to resolve such Dispute through friendly
consultations between senior management of the Parties. The Parties agree to
attempt to resolve all Disputes arising hereunder promptly, equitably and in a
good faith manner. The Parties further agree to provide each other with
reasonable access during normal business

 



      
 

 



 

hours to any and all non-privileged records, information and data pertaining
to such Dispute, upon reasonable advance notice.

 



 

(b) If such consultations do not result in a resolution of the Dispute within
30 Business Days after written notice by a Party to the other Parties
describing the Dispute and requesting friendly consultation, then the Dispute
may be submitted by any Party to binding arbitration pursuant to the terms of
_Section 7.10_, irrespective of the magnitude thereof, the amount in dispute
or whether such Dispute would otherwise be considered justifiable or ripe for
resolution by any court or arbitral tribunal, by giving written notice thereof
to the other Parties; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall a Party
have the right to submit the Dispute to arbitration if the institution of
legal or equitable proceedings based on such Dispute would be barred by any
applicable statute of limitations or _Section 7.1_.

 



 

(c) Any Dispute shall be settled exclusively and finally by binding
arbitration in accordance with the provisions of _Section 7.10_.

 



 

7.10 **_Arbitration Procedures_**.

 



 

(a) Any Party electing to arbitrate a Dispute shall designate its nomination
for an arbitrator in its notice to the other Party electing to submit the
Dispute to arbitration. Each Party receiving such notice shall, within ten
Business Days thereafter, by return written notice to all Parties, state
whether it will accept such nomination, or decline to accept it and designate
its nomination for an arbitrator. One arbitrator shall control the proceedings
if such nomination of an arbitrator is accepted by all Parties or if the
receiving Party fails to nominate an arbitrator within the required ten
Business Day period. If the receiving Party timely nominates an arbitrator,
the arbitral tribunal shall consist of three arbitrators, with one arbitrator
being selected by SMP Holdings and one arbitrator being selected by Summit
MLP, within five Business Days after the expiration of the ten Business Day
period reference above, and the two selected arbitrators choosing a third
arbitrator, which third arbitrator must be a Person with the requisite
knowledge and experience to make a fair and informed determination with
respect to the matter in dispute, which Person shall not be an Affiliate of
any Party, nor an employee, director, officer, shareholder, owner, partner,
agent or a contractor of any Party or of any Affiliate of any Party, either
presently or at any time during the previous two years. In the event the
arbitrators fail to appoint the third arbitrator within 30 days after they
have accepted their appointment, the third arbitrator (meeting the
qualifications specified in the preceding sentence) shall be appointed by the
Houston office of the American Arbitration Association within ten Business
Days after the expiration of such 30 day period. The arbitration shall be
conducted in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American
Arbitration Association, as supplemented to the extent necessary to determine
any procedural appeal questions by the Federal Arbitration Act (Title 9 of the
United Stated Code). If there is an inconsistency between _Section 7.10_ and
the Commercial Arbitration Rules or the Federal Arbitration Act, the
provisions of this _Section 7.10_ shall prevail.

 



 

(b) Within ten Business Days after the selection of the arbitrator(s), each
Party shall submit to the arbitrator(s) such Partys proposal for resolution
of the Dispute, which such proposal shall not conflict with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, together with the supporting data, if any, that
was used to determine such proposal. Within 30 days after the

 



      
 

 



 

proposals are submitted, the arbitrator(s) shall hold a hearing during which
the Parties may present evidence in support of their respective proposals. The
arbitrator(s) (by majority rule if there are three arbitrators) will determine
the outcome of the Dispute. The cost of the arbitration shall be split between
the Parties equally and each Party shall pay for one-half of the costs.

 



 

(c) The place of arbitration shall be Houston, Texas, unless in any particular
case the Parties agree upon a different venue.

 



 

(d) The arbitrator(s) shall have no right or authority to grant or award Non-
Reimbursable Damages.

 



 

(e) Any decision of the arbitrator(s) pursuant to this _Section 7.10_ shall
be final and binding upon the Parties and shall be reached within 90 days
after proposals for resolution of the Dispute have been submitted. The Parties
agree that the arbitral award may be enforced against the Parties to the
arbitration proceeding or their Assets wherever they may be found and that a
judgment upon the arbitral award may be entered in any court having competent
jurisdiction thereof. The Parties expressly submit to the jurisdiction of any
such court. The Parties hereby waive, to the extent permitted by Law, any
rights to appeal or to review of such award by any court or tribunal.

 



 

(f) When any Dispute occurs and is the subject of consultations or
arbitration, the Parties shall continue to make payments of undisputed amounts
in accordance with this Agreement, and the Parties shall otherwise continue to
exercise their rights and fulfill their respective obligations under this
Agreement.

 



 

7.11 **_Determination of Amount of Damages; Mitigation_**. The Losses giving
rise to any indemnification obligation hereunder shall be limited to the
Losses suffered by the indemnified Person and shall be reduced by any
insurance proceeds or other payment or monetary recoupment received or that
are realized or retained (including the amount of any Tax benefits, net of any
Tax detriments, actually realized or retained) by the indemnified Person as a
result of the events giving rise to the claim for indemnification. Any
indemnified Person that becomes aware of Losses for which it intends to seek
indemnification hereunder shall use commercially reasonable efforts to collect
any amounts to which it may be entitled under insurance policies or from third
parties (pursuant to indemnification agreements or otherwise) and shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate such Losses; _provided_ that the
indemnified Person shall promptly notify either (a) SMP Holdings if such
indemnified Person is Summit MLP or (b) Summit MLP if such indemnified Person
is SMP Holdings, in each case, of any efforts to mitigate. If any net Tax
benefit, third party recovery or insurance recovery is realized after having
previously received Indemnity Claim proceeds hereunder, such Party shall
promptly tender to the respective Party an amount equal to such Tax benefit,
third party recovery or insurance recovery.

on any Business Day or during any non-Business Day at the place of receipt.

 



 

8.2 **_Entire Agreement_**. This Agreement supersedes all prior discussions
and agreements between the Parties and/or their respective Affiliates with
respect to the subject matter hereof and contains the sole and entire
agreement between the Parties and their respective Affiliates hereto with
respect to the subject matter hereof.

 



 

8.3 **_Expenses_**. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement,
whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, each
Party shall pay all costs and expenses it has incurred or will incur in
anticipation of, relating to and in connection with the negotiation and
execution of this Agreement and consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby.

 



 

8.4 **_Disclosure_**. The Company and SMP Holdings may, at their option,
include in the Schedules items that are not material, and any such inclusion,
or any references to dollar amounts, shall not be deemed to be an
acknowledgment or representation that such items are material, to establish
any standard of materiality or to define further the meaning of such terms for
purposes of this Agreement. Information disclosed in any Schedule shall
constitute a disclosure for all purposes under this Agreement notwithstanding
any reference to a specific section, and all such information shall be deemed
to qualify the entire Agreement and not just such section.

 



 

8.5 **_Waiver_**. Any term or condition of this Agreement may be waived at any
time by the Party that is entitled to the benefit thereof, but no such waiver
shall be effective unless set forth in a written instrument duly executed by
or on behalf of the Party waiving such term or condition. No waiver by either
Party of any term or condition of this Agreement, in any one or more
instances, shall be deemed to be or construed as a waiver of the same or any
other term or condition of this Agreement on any future occasion.

 



 

8.6 **_Amendment_**. This Agreement may be amended, supplemented or modified
only by a written instrument duly executed by or on behalf of Summit MLP and
SMP Holdings; provided, however, that Summit MLP shall not execute any such
amendment, supplement or modification without the consent or approval of the
Conflicts Committee.

 



 

8.7 **_No Third Party Beneficiary_**. The terms and provisions of this
Agreement are intended solely for the benefit of the Parties and their
respective successors or permitted assigns, and it is not the intention of the
Parties to confer third party beneficiary rights upon any other Person.

 



 

8.8 **_Assignment; Binding Effect_**. Any Party may assign its rights and
obligations hereunder to an Affiliate but such assignment shall not release
such Party from its obligations hereunder. Except as provided in the preceding
sentence, neither this Agreement nor any right,

 



      
 

 



 

interest or obligation hereunder may be assigned by any Party without the
prior written consent of the other Party, and any attempt to do so will be
void, except for assignments and transfers by operation of Law. Subject to
this _Section 8.8_, this Agreement is binding upon, inures to the benefit of
and is enforceable by the Parties and their respective successors and
permitted assigns.

 



 

8.9 **_Invalid Provisions_**. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be
illegal, invalid or unenforceable under any present or future Law, and if the
rights or obligations of any Party under this Agreement will not be materially
and adversely affected thereby, such provision shall be fully severable, this
Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if such illegal, invalid or
unenforceable provision had never comprised a part hereof, the remaining
provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall
not be affected by the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision or by its
severance herefrom and in lieu of such illegal, invalid or unenforceable
provision, there shall be added automatically as a part of this Agreement a
legal, valid and enforceable provision as similar in terms to such illegal,
invalid or unenforceable provision as may be possible.

 



 

8.10 **_Counterparts; Facsimile_**. This Agreement may be executed in any
number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of
which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. Any facsimile or
PDF copies hereof or signature hereon shall, for all purposes, be deemed
originals.

 



 

8.11 **_Governing Law; Enforcement, Jury Trial Waiver_**. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL
BE GOVERNED, CONSTRUED AND ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE
OF NEW YORK, WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO ANY CONFLICT OR CHOICE OF LAW PROVISION
THAT WOULD RESULT IN THE IMPOSITION OF ANOTHER JURISDICTIONS LAW. THE LAWS OF
THE STATE OF NEW YORK SHALL GOVERN ANY DISPUTE, CONTROVERSY, REMEDY OR CLAIM
BETWEEN THE PARTIES ARISING OUT OF, RELATING TO, OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH
THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING THE EXISTENCE, VALIDITY, PERFORMANCE, OR BREACH
THEREOF. WITH RESPECT TO ANY PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, INCLUDING THE ENFORCEMENT
OF THE AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE IN _SECTIONS 7.9_ AND _7.10_ AND ANY
ARBITRATION AWARD, BUT WITHOUT PREJUDICE TO THE TERMS OF _SECTIONS 7.9_ AND
_7.10_ , EACH PARTY HEREBY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY
RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY.
