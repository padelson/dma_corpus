(b) Cano shall cause the Post-Signing Financial Statements delivered in
accordance with _Section 5.02(a)_ to fairly present, to Canos Knowledge, in
all material respects, in conformity with GAAP applied on a consistent basis
(except as may be indicated in the notes thereto), the consolidated financial

Section 5.03 _Assumption and Rejection of Executory Contracts and Leases_.

 



 

(a) _Schedule 5.03(a)_ sets forth a complete set of the most recent "Schedule
G  Executory Contracts and Unexpired Leases" of the Debtors (as such
schedules may from time to time be amended or supplemented with written notice
to Buyer, the " **365 Schedule**"). Cano will amend or supplement the 365
Schedule from time to time promptly, and to provide Buyer written notice
thereof, upon its determination that any Debtor is party to a 365 Contract
that is not then set forth on the 365 Schedule. At least fifteen (15) days
prior to the date of mailing of notice in accordance with the Bid Procedures
Order (the " **365 Notice Date**") to all parties to 365 Contracts to be
assumed, Cano will deliver to Buyer a copy of the 365 Schedule together with
Canos good faith estimate of the Cure Costs that would be payable by any
Debtor in connection with the assumption of each 365 Contract and, to the
extent practicable, a good faith estimate of the rejection damages that would
be payable by any Debtor in connection with the rejection of each 365 Contract
(the actual amount of such rejection damages as finally determined, "
**Rejection Amount** "). If Cano has not previously provided or made available
to Buyer a copy of any such 365 Contract, including any amendments, waivers or
other modifications thereof, Cano shall upon Buyers request (i) provide a
copy of such 365 Contract to Buyer if Cano has a copy of such 365 Contract
readily available in its files or (ii) use its commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain a copy of such 365 Contract if Cano does not have a

 



      
 

 



 

copy of such 365 Contract readily available in its files and, upon obtaining a
copy, provide a copy of such 365 Contract to Buyer.

 



 

(b) No later than three (3) days prior to the 365 Notice Date, Buyer shall
provide Cano with a list of the 365 Contracts listed on the 365 Schedule
received from Cano that Buyer desires to be assumed by the Debtor party
thereto (collectively, and as further modified by the Buyer pursuant to the
provisions of this _Section 5.03(b)_, the " **Desired 365 Contracts** "). As
promptly as practicable following the designation by Buyer of any 365 Contract
as a Desired 365 Contract, the Debtors shall commence appropriate proceedings
before the Bankruptcy Court and otherwise take all necessary actions in order
to determine the Cure Costs with respect to such Desired 365 Contract and to
effect the assumption of such Desired 365 Contract by the applicable Debtor in
accordance with the Bankruptcy Code, effective as of the Closing. Furthermore,
Cano shall take all necessary actions in order to effect the rejection or
assignment to the Liquidating Trust by the applicable Debtor of each 365
Contract that is not a Desired 365 Contract at or prior to the Closing.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to the Confirmation Hearing,
Buyer may identify (i) any 365 Contract that has not been rejected as a
Desired 365 Contract and upon receipt of any such notice Debtors shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to effect the assumption of such 365 Contract
by the applicable Debtor in accordance with the Bankruptcy Code and, if
Debtors are successful in effecting such assumption as of Closing, such 365
Contract shall become a Desired 365 Contract and (ii) any Desired 365 Contract
that has not been assumed as one that Buyer no longer desires to have assumed
and such 365 Contract shall be deemed not to be a Desired 365 Contract.

 



 

(c) At, prior to or as soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing, Cano
shall pay, or cause its Subsidiaries to pay, or cause the Liquidating Trust to
pay all Cure Costs with respect to the Desired 365 Contracts, and the Debtors
shall provide adequate assurance of future performance of all of the Desired
365 Contracts so that all Desired 365 Contracts can be assumed by the Debtors
at or prior to the Closing in accordance with the provisions of Section 365 of
the Bankruptcy Code and this Agreement (provided that Buyer shall cooperate
with Debtors in providing such adequate assurance of future performance of all
of the Desired 365 Contracts and Buyer acknowledges that such cooperation may
require Buyer to provide information regarding Buyer and its Subsidiaries, as
well as a commitment of performance by Buyer and/or its Subsidiaries with
respect to the Desired 365 Contracts from and after the Closing to demonstrate
adequate assurance of the performance of the Desired 365 Contracts, and the
Debtors obligation to provide such adequate assurances is subject to the
cooperation and providing of such information and commitment by Buyer). Except
as set forth in this _Section 5.03(c)_ and in _Section 5.03(f)_, neither
Buyer nor any of its Subsidiaries (including the Reorganized Debtors) shall
have any liability or obligation to any Person for any default under or Cure
Costs related to any 365 Contract of any Debtor existing at or prior to the
Closing.

 



 

(d) Cano will provide to Buyer a copy of any motion, application or other
court document filed with, and any proposed orders submitted to, the
Bankruptcy Court seeking authorization to assume or reject any 365 Contract,
enter into, amend or waive any provision of any 365 Contract, other than as
permitted under _Section 5.01,_ in advance of filing (with a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on same) all of which must be, prior to
filing, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer in all material
respects.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) Each 365 Contract that is assumed by any Debtor in accordance with this
Agreement shall vest in and be fully enforceable by the applicable Reorganized
Debtor in accordance with its terms as of the applicable assumption date.

 



 

(f) If any 365 Contract listed on _Schedule 5.03(a)_, other than the 365
Contracts listed on _Schedule 5.03(f)_ (the " **Initial Rejected Contracts**
"), is (i) not designated by Buyer as a Desired 365 Contract in accordance
with _Section 5.03(b)_ or (ii) designated as a Desired 365 Contract and
subsequently deemed not to be a Desired 365 Contract as permitted under
_Section 5.03(b)(ii)_ (all such 365 Contracts described in clauses (i) and
(ii), collectively, the " **No Longer Desired 365 Contracts**"), and the
aggregate actual amount to be paid by the Debtors (or the Liquidating Trust)
pursuant to the Plan in respect of the Rejection Amounts related to all No
Longer Desired 365 Contracts exceeds the aggregate Cure Costs that would be
payable if such No Longer Desired 365 Contracts would be assumed by the
applicable Debtors, then the Purchase Price payable by Buyer pursuant to
_Section 2.01_ shall be increased by the amount that such Rejection Amounts
exceed such Cure Costs.

 



 

Section 5.04 _Well Elections_. If any Debtor is provided notice of any
proposed drilling, reworking, recompletion, sidetracking, deepening or similar
activity with respect to any well (other than a Trust Asset), then (i) if the
expenditures with respect to such activity are identified on _Schedule 5.01_,
Debtors shall elect to participate in such activity and (ii) if expenditures
with respect to such activity are not identified on _Schedule 5.01_, the
Debtors shall provide notice of such proposal, together with relevant seismic
and other data relating to such proposal that is in Debtors possession, to
Buyer promptly after Debtors receipt of notice of such proposal. Buyer shall
respond to any such notice provided to Buyer promptly after Buyers receipt of
such notice. If Buyer instructs Debtors in writing to participate in such
activity sufficiently in advance of the deadline to make an election to
participate, Debtors shall elect to participate in such activity and the
expenditures paid by Debtors with respect to such activity prior to Closing
shall be deemed consented to by Buyer for purposes of _Section 5.01(b)(iv)_,
and the Purchase Price shall by adjusted pursuant to _Section 2.01(b)_ ;
provided that if Buyer instructs Debtors in writing not to participate in such
activity, or fails to timely instruct Debtors in writing to participate in
such activity, Debtors may, at Debtors option, elect to participate in such
activity, but the expenditures paid by Debtors with respect to such activity
shall not be reimbursed pursuant to _Section 2.01(b)_.

 



 

Section 5.05 _Access to Information_. From the date hereof until the Closing
and subject to Applicable Law and the confidentiality agreement dated August
9, 2011, between Cano and Buyer (the " **Confidentiality Agreement** "), Cano
shall (a) give to Buyer and its Representatives reasonable access for the
purpose of conducting due diligence during normal business hours to the
offices, properties, books and records of Cano and its Subsidiaries (subject
to the terms, conditions and restrictions of agreements related to such
offices and properties and, with respect to Oil and Gas Interests with Third
Parties acting as the operator, the consent of the operator); provided that
such access shall be upon reasonable advance notice and under reasonable
circumstances, (b) furnish to Buyer and its Representatives such financial and
operating data and other information available as of the date hereof or that
becomes available at any time prior to the Closing Date as Buyer may
reasonably request in connection with the Transactions and (c) instruct its
Representatives to cooperate with Buyer in its due diligence; _provided_ that
in no

 



      
 

 



 

event shall Cano or any of its Subsidiaries be obligated to provide or permit
(i) any information the disclosure of which would (I) cause the loss of any
legal privilege available to any Person relating to such information or would
cause Cano or its Subsidiaries to breach a confidentiality obligation to which
it is bound or (II) result in a violation of Applicable Law, (ii) copies of
bids, letters of intent, expressions of interest or other proposals received
from other Persons prior to the Bid Deadline in connection with the
Transactions or information and analyses relating to such communications,
except to the extent required in the Bid Procedures Order or (iii) access for
any invasive environmental testing of any property and Buyer shall not be
entitled to conduct any invasive environmental testing at, on or under any
property of Cano. After the Closing, Buyer, Reorganized Cano, and the
Reorganized Subsidiaries will allow the Liquidating Trustee and its
Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours to the books
and records of Reorganized Cano and Reorganized Subsidiaries as it relates
solely to pre-Closing financial information germane to the Chapter 11 cases
and the payment of claims and related matters or performance of obligations
assumed by Buyer, Reorganized Cano, and Reorganized Subsidiaries under this
Stock Purchase Agreement; provided that such access shall expire six months
after the Closing Date, but may be extended upon mutual agreement of the
Parties. Any access provided pursuant to this Section shall be conducted in
such manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the business
of Cano and, after the Closing, Reorganized Cano, Reorganized Subsidiaries,
and the Buyer.

 



 

 **ARTICLE VI 
COVENANTS OF BUYER**

 



 

Section 6.01 _Health Coverage_. The following provisions shall govern Health
Coverage of present or former Cano employees.

 



 

(a) _Active Participant_. From and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall take
such action as may be necessary so that, on and after the Closing Date,
eligible employees (and/or their eligible spouses and dependent children) of
Cano or its Subsidiaries who after the Closing Date are employed by Buyer or
an Affiliate of Buyer (" **Transferred Employees** ") are provided health care
coverage either, as Buyer may determine in its discretion from time to time,
(i) pursuant to terms and conditions of the health care arrangement as in
effect and maintained by Cano immediately prior to the Closing Date (to the
extent Buyer decides to maintain such arrangement following the Closing), or
(ii) pursuant to a health care plan or program sponsored by Buyer on
substantially the same basis as employees of Buyer and its Subsidiaries having
similar responsibilities and positions.

 



 

(b) _COBRA Benefits_. From and after the Closing Date and with respect to any
former employee of Cano or its Subsidiaries (and/or his or her spouse and
dependent children) who was an eligible COBRA beneficiary and experienced a
"qualifying event" (as defined in COBRA) and has elected COBRA coverage or is
in the election period prior to the Closing Date, Buyer shall at its election
(i) provide coverage under a group health plan sponsored by Buyer in
compliance with COBRA or (ii) provide coverage under Canos existing health
plan or another subsequent Cano health plan for as long as Cano is required to
offer COBRA eligible benefits to any "qualified beneficiary" and for a period
of time no less than the period prescribed by or limited by COBRA. Buyer shall
be responsible after the Closing Date for the notices, extension of
continuation coverage and other compliance with

 



      
 

 



 

COBRA as to any of the persons described in the preceding sentence. Seller
shall assume the responsibility for providing to all employees on a timely
basis, all necessary notices, documentation, and requests required prior to
the Closing Date.

 



 

(c) _Benefit Considerations_. The eligibility of any Transferred Employee to
participate in any health care plan or program of Buyer or its Subsidiaries
shall not be subject to any exclusions for any pre-existing conditions if such
individual met the participation requirements of similar benefit plans and
programs of Cano and its Subsidiaries. Amounts paid before the Closing by
Transferred Employees under any health plans of Cano and its Subsidiaries
shall, after the Closing, be taken into account in applying deductible and
out-of-pocket limits applicable under the health plans of Buyer and its
Subsidiaries provided as of the Closing to the same extent as if such amounts
had been paid under such health plans to Buyer and/or its Subsidiaries.

 



 

Section 6.02 _Tax Refunds_.

 



 

(a) Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to claim and prosecute, or
to cause the Reorganized Debtors to claim and prosecute, all properly
allowable Tax Refunds of the Debtors for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods and the

accordance with _Section 6.02(b)_). All such Tax Refunds shall be for the
account of the Liquidating Trust and shall be promptly paid, after deduction
for all reasonable and directly applicable costs and expenses incurred in
obtaining said Tax Refunds by Buyer, to the Liquidating Trust when received by
Buyer or any Reorganized Debtor. As to all other Tax Refunds, the funds shall
be for the account of Buyer or any Reorganized Debtor and not the Liquidating
Trust.

(i) in the case of Tax Refunds attributable to Taxes that are either (A) based
upon or related to income or receipts, or (B) imposed in connection with any
production, sale or other transfer or assignment of property (real or
personal, tangible or intangible), deemed equal to the amount that would be
allowed as a Tax Refund if the Tax period of the Debtors ended with (and
included) the Closing Date; provided that exemptions, allowances or deductions
that are calculated on an annual basis (including depreciation and
amortization deductions) shall be allocated between the period ending on and
including the Closing Date and the period beginning after the Closing Date in
proportion to the number of days in each period; and

 



 

(ii) in the case of Tax Refunds attributable to Taxes that are imposed on a
periodic basis with respect to the assets or capital of the Debtors, deemed
equal to the amount that would be allowed as a Tax Refund for the entire

Section 6.03 _Tax Returns_.

 



 

(a) Buyer shall refrain, and shall cause each Reorganized Debtor to refrain,
from making or being deemed to make, any election, including any election
under Section 338 of the Code, that could cause the Debtors to realize
additional income with respect to any Pre-Closing Period or the pre-Closing
portion of the Straddle Period. Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared
all Tax Returns of the Debtors required to be filed after the Closing Date for
the Straddle Period and all Pre-Closing Tax Periods, including the Tax Period
ending as of the day on the Closing Date pursuant to Treasury Regulation
Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii) if the Reorganized Debtors become members of
Buyers consolidated group as a result of Buyers purchase of the New Cano
shares; _provided, however_ , that if the Closing occurs before the filing of
the Debtors Federal income Tax Return for the taxable year ended June 30,
2011, then the Liquidating Trust shall be responsible for filing such Tax
Return (with the reasonable cooperation of Buyer) but at Buyers expense. In
the event Reorganized Debtors become members of Buyers consolidated group,
the Parties agree that the transactions of the Debtors or the Reorganized
Debtors that occur on the Closing Date that are outside the ordinary course of
business of the Debtors or the Reorganized Debtors will be treated for all
federal and state tax purposes as occurring at the beginning of the day
following the Closing Date. Each such Tax Return shall be prepared on a basis
consistent with past practice except to the extent otherwise required by
Applicable Law. Not later than thirty (30) days prior to the due date for
filing any such Tax Return, Buyer shall deliver a copy of such Tax Return,
together with all supporting documentation and workpapers, to the Liquidating
Trust for its review and approval. Buyer will cause such Tax Return (as
revised to incorporate the Liquidating Trusts comments) to be timely filed
and will provide a copy to the Liquidating Trust.

 



 

(b) Buyer shall not amend any Tax Returns of the Debtors that are attributable
to Pre-Closing Tax Periods or Straddle Tax Periods without the prior written
consent of the Liquidating Trust.

 



 

Section 6.04 _Financing_. Within 45 days of the date hereof, Buyer shall
deliver to Cano a complete and correct copy of an executed commitment letter
from FandM Bank and Trust Co. and other qualified banking institutions, in a
form reasonably acceptable to Cano, in its sole discretion, which shall not
unreasonably be withheld (the " **Financing Commitment** "), with respect to a
debt financing in an amount sufficient to enable Buyer to perform its
obligation to pay the Purchase Price, as adjusted pursuant to _Section 2.01_,
at the Closing (the " **Financing** ").

an expedited resolution of any such appeal, petition or motion.

shall be Buyers sole remedy in connection with this Agreement, the
Transactions and the termination hereof and thereof, and Buyer shall be
precluded from any other remedy against the Debtors, at law or in equity or
otherwise, and Buyer shall not seek to obtain any recovery, judgment, or
damages of any kind, including direct, consequential, indirect, or punitive
damages, against the Debtors or any of their respective Representatives,
shareholders or Affiliates in connection with this Agreement or the
Transactions or the termination hereof or thereof and the Debtors and their
respective Representatives, shareholders and Affiliates shall be fully
released and discharged from any

 



      
 

 



 

liability or obligation under or resulting from this Agreement and the
Transactions or the termination hereof and thereof.

 



 

(d) Buyer represent to Debtors that this _Section 9.03_ is a condition
precedent to Buyers execution of this Agreement and is necessary to ensure
that Buyer will continue to pursue the proposed acquisition of the Reorganized

hereunder, (i) constitutes an actual and necessary cost and expense of
preserving the Debtors estates, within the meaning of Section 503(b) of the
Bankruptcy Code, (ii) is of substantial benefit to the Debtors estates, (iii)
is reasonable and appropriate, including in light of the size and nature of

offers, and (iv) was negotiated by the Parties at arms-length and in good
faith.

and in any certificate or other writing delivered pursuant hereto shall
terminate upon and not survive the Closing and there shall be no liability
thereafter in respect thereof. Each of the covenants of the Parties hereto
contained in this Agreement shall terminate upon the Closing except to the

Section 10.03 _Amendments and Waivers_.

 



 

(a) Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived prior to Closing
if, but only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed, in the
case of an amendment, by each Party to this Agreement, or in the case of a
waiver, by the Party against whom the waiver is to be effective.

 



 

(b) No failure or delay by any Party in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies
herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or
remedies provided by law.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 10.04 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all
costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement shall be paid by
the Party incurring such cost or expense.

 



 

Section 10.05 _Successors and Assigns_. The provisions of this Agreement shall
be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties hereto and their
respective successors and assigns; provided that no Party may assign, delegate
or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement,
in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, without the prior
written consent of each other Party hereto, except that Buyer may assign,
delegate or otherwise transfer its rights and obligations under this
Agreement, in whole or from time to time in part, to one or more of its
Subsidiaries; provided that no such transfer or assignment will release Buyer
of its obligations hereunder or enlarge, alter or change any obligation of any
Debtor to Buyer.

 



 

Section 10.06 _Governing Law_. THE AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND
CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF TEXAS, WITHOUT REGARD TO
PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW.

 



 

Section 10.07 _Jurisdiction_. Each party hereto agrees that it shall bring any
action or proceeding in respect of any claim arising out of or related to this
Agreement or the transactions contained in or contemplated by this Agreement
and the Ancillary Agreements, exclusively in (a) the Bankruptcy Court so long
as the Bankruptcy Cases remain open and (b) after the close of the Bankruptcy
Cases or in the event that the Bankruptcy Court determines that it does not
have jurisdiction, the United States District Court for the Northern District
of Texas or any Texas State court sitting in Dallas (together with the
Bankruptcy Court, the " **Chosen Courts** "), and solely in connection with
claims arising under this Agreement or any other Transaction Document or the
Transactions (i) irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
Chosen Courts, (ii) waives any objection to laying venue in any such action or
proceeding in the Chosen Courts, (iii) waives any objection that the Chosen
Courts are an inconvenient forum or do not have jurisdiction over any party
hereto and (iv) agrees that service of process upon such party in any such
action or proceeding shall be effective if notice is given in accordance with
_Section 10.01_. Cano irrevocably designates Delaware Registry, Ltd., 3511
Silverside Road, Suite 105, Wilmington, Delaware as its agent and attorney-in-
fact for the acceptance of service of process and making an appearance on its
behalf in any such claim or proceeding and for the taking of all such acts as
may be necessary or appropriate in order to confer jurisdiction over it before
the Chosen Courts, and Cano stipulates that such consent and appointment is
irrevocable and coupled with an interest. Buyer irrevocably designates Richard
J. Nichols, PO Box 4470, Tulsa, Oklahoma 74159 as its agent and attorney-in-
fact for the acceptance of service of process and making an appearance on its
behalf in any such claim or proceeding and for the taking of all such acts as
may be necessary or appropriate in order to confer jurisdiction over it before
the Chosen Courts, and Buyer stipulates that such consent and appointment is
irrevocable and coupled with an interest.

 



 

Section 10.08 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY.

 



       
 

 



 

Section 10.09 _Counterparts; Effectiveness; Third Party Beneficiaries_. This
Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be
an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were
upon the same instrument. This Agreement shall become effective when each
party hereto shall have received a counterpart hereof signed by all of the
other parties hereto. Until and unless each party has received a counterpart
hereof signed by the other party hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect
and no party shall have any right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue
of any other oral or written agreement or other communication). No provision
of this Agreement is intended to confer any rights, benefits, remedies,
obligations or liabilities hereunder upon any Person other than the parties
hereto and their respective successors and assigns.

 



 

Section 10.10 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the Confidentiality
Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the other Transaction Documents constitute
the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter
hereof and thereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both
oral and written, between the parties with respect to the subject matter
hereof and thereof.

 



 

Section 10.11 _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
contained in this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions,
covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and
effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated; and in lieu
of each such invalid, void or unenforceable provision there shall be added
automatically as part of this Agreement a provision as similar in terms to
such invalid, void or unenforceable provision as may be valid, binding and
enforceable.

 



 

Section 10.12 _Specific Performance_. The Parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that the Parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened
breaches of this Agreement (without posting any bond or other undertaking) or
to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof in
any federal court located in the Northern District of Texas or any Texas State
court sitting in Dallas, in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity.

 



 

Section 10.13 _Certain Acknowledgements and Limitations_.

 



 

(a) Buyer confirms, acknowledges and agrees that it has had access to and has
inspected the books, records and assets of Debtors to the extent that it
wished to do so prior to the execution of this Agreement and that Buyer is
relying upon its own investigations and inspections of the books, records and
assets of Debtors prior to the execution of this Agreement in entering into
this Agreement and proceeding with the Transactions on the terms as set forth
herein. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that any description of the Debtors,
their businesses, operations and assets (including the Oil and Gas Interests)
in this Agreement, the Disclosure Schedules or any other Transaction Document
is for the sole purpose of identification only and no representation, warranty
or condition is or will be given by Debtors in respect of the accuracy of any
description, except as expressly set forth in _Article III_ herein. Buyer has
reviewed and has had access to all documents, records and information which it
has desired to review prior to the execution of this Agreement, and has had
the opportunity to ask questions,

 



      
 

 



 

and has received sufficient answers, in connection with its decision to enter
into this Agreement, and to consummate the Transactions. In deciding to enter
into this Agreement, and to consummate the Transactions, other than the
express representations and warranties of Cano set forth in _Article III_ ,
Buyer has relied solely upon its own knowledge, investigation, judgment and
analysis and not on any disclosure or representation made by, or any duty to
disclose on the part of, Debtors or Debtors Representatives.

 



 

(b) Any and all duties and obligations which any Party may have to any other
Party with respect to or in connection with this Agreement, the other
Transaction Documents or the Transactions are limited to those specifically
set forth in this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents. Neither the
duties nor obligations of any Party, nor the rights of any Party, shall be
expanded beyond the terms of this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents on the basis of any legal or equitable principle or on any other
basis whatsoever. Neither any equitable or legal principle nor any implied
obligation of good faith or fair dealing nor any other matter requires any
Party to incur, suffer or perform any act, condition or obligation contrary to
the terms of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, whether or
not existing and whether foreseeable or unforeseeable. Each of the Parties
acknowledges that it would be unfair, and that it does not intend, to increase
any of the obligations of the other Party on the basis of any implied
obligation or otherwise.

 



 

(c) **EACH OF BUYER AND THE DEBTORS AGREE THAT, (A) EXCEPT FOR THE
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES MADE BY CANO THAT ARE EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN
_ARTICLE III_ OF THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER DEBTORS NOR ANY OF THEIR AFFILIATES
OR REPRESENTATIVES HAVE MADE AND SHALL NOT BE DEEMED TO HAVE MADE TO BUYER OR
TO ANY OF ITS REPRESENTATIVES ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, AND
(B) EXCEPT FOR THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES MADE BY BUYER THAT ARE
EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN _ARTICLE IV_ AND _SECTION 9.03(D)_ OF THIS AGREEMENT,
NEITHER BUYER NOR ANY OF THEIR AFFILIATES OR REPRESENTATIVES HAVE MADE AND
SHALL NOT BE DEEMED TO HAVE MADE TO DEBTORS OR TO ANY OF ITS REPRESENTATIVES
ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. NO PERSON HAS BEEN AUTHORIZED BY
DEBTORS TO MAKE ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY RELATING TO DEBTORS OR THEIR
BUSINESS OR OPERATIONS OR THE ASSETS, OR OTHERWISE IN CONNECTION WITH THE
TRANSACTIONS AND, IF MADE, SUCH REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY MAY NOT BE RELIED
UPON. NO PERSON HAS BEEN AUTHORIZED BY BUYER TO MAKE ANY REPRESENTATION OR
WARRANTY RELATING TO BUYER OR ITS BUSINESSES OR OPERATIONS, OR OTHERWISE IN
CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTIONS AND, IF MADE, SUCH REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY
MAY NOT BE RELIED UPON. BUYER FURTHER AGREES THAT NO DEBTORS SHALL HAVE OR BE
SUBJECT TO ANY LIABILITY TO BUYER OR ANY OTHER PERSON OR ENTITY RESULTING FROM
THE DISTRIBUTION TO BUYER, OR THEIR RESPECTIVE USE, OF ANY SUCH INFORMATION.**
**BUYER FURTHER AGREES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT NO DEBTOR SHALL HAVE OR BE
SUBJECT TO ANY LIABILITY TO BUYER OR ANY OTHER PERSON OR ENTITY RESULTING
FROM**

 



      
 

 



 

 **THE DISTRIBUTION TO BUYER, OR THEIR RESPECTIVE USE, OF ANY SUCH
INFORMATION.**

 



 

(d) **UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL ANY PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT BE LIABLE FOR
ANY SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, REMOTE, SPECULATIVE, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR LIABILITIES ARISING OUT OF ANY ACTUAL, ALLEGED OR
INTENTIONAL BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING LOSS OF REVENUE OR INCOME,
DAMAGES BASED ON ANY MULTIPLIER OF PROFITS OR OTHER VALUATION METRIC, COST OF
CAPITAL, DIMINUTION OF VALUE OR LOSS OF BUSINESS REPUTATION OR OPPORTUNITY,
AND NO CLAIM SHALL BE MADE OR AWARDED AGAINST ANY PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT
THEREFOR.**

 



 

Section 10.14 _Disclosure Schedules_. All references to Schedules in _Article
III_ of this Agreement refer to Schedules contained in the Disclosure
Schedule. The information in the Disclosure Schedule constitutes exceptions,
qualifications and/or supplements to particular representations or warranties
of Cano as set forth in this Agreement. The Disclosure Schedule shall not be
construed as indicating that any disclosed information is required to be
disclosed, and no disclosure shall be construed as an admission that such
information is material to, outside the ordinary course of business of, or
required to be disclosed by, Cano or constitutes a Material Adverse Effect.
Capitalized terms used in the Disclosure Schedule that are not defined therein
and are defined in this Agreement shall have the meanings given to them in
this Agreement. The captions contained in the Disclosure Schedule are for the
convenience of reference only, and shall not be deemed to modify or influence
the interpretation of the information contained in the Disclosure Schedules or
this Agreement. The statements in each Schedule of the Disclosure Schedule
qualify and relate to the corresponding provisions in the Sections of this
Agreement to which they expressly refer and to each other provision in this
Agreement to which the applicability of a statement or disclosure in a
particular Schedule of the Disclosure Schedule is reasonably apparent on its
face.

the last paragraph of _Section 9.01_ or (B) _Section 9.01(e)(v)_ or (ii) the
conditions to the obligations of Buyer to consummate the Closing set forth in

but Buyer shall have failed to perform their obligations under _Section 2.01_
or _Section 2.02_ for more than two (2) Business Days after notice thereof by
Cano, then the Escrow Amount shall be delivered to Cano (subject to deduction
for any amounts payable by Cano or Buyer, as applicable, to the Escrow Agent
under the Escrow Agreement); _provided_ that such distribution of the Escrow
Amount to Cano shall in no event be deemed a deposit, advance or other
prepayment of any future amount that Buyer may become obligated to pay to Cano
for any reason; or

 



 

(b) if the Closing shall occur or if this Agreement is terminated prior to
Closing for any reason other than as stated in _Section 11.02(a)_ , the Escrow

Agreement, Buyer **** and Cano shall promptly execute and deliver to the
Escrow Agent joint written instructions setting forth the amounts to be paid

**Joint Direction** "). Each of Buyer and Cano agree to confer as promptly as
practicable and to use its reasonable best efforts to reach agreement as to
the calculation of and entitlement to such amounts. In furtherance and not in
limitation of the foregoing:

 



 

(a) Buyer **** and Cano agree jointly to instruct the Escrow Agent in writing
within two (2) Business Days after any termination of this Agreement or prior
to Closing to distribute the Escrow Amount in accordance with _Section
11.02(a)_ or _Section 11.02(b)_ , as applicable; and

 



 

(b) if Cano or Buyer shall fail to execute and deliver a Joint Direction,
either Cano or Buyer, as applicable, shall be entitled to receive
distributions from the Escrow Amount from the Escrow Agent promptly upon
delivery to the Escrow Agent of a written instruction, order or judgment
(setting forth the amounts to be paid to such Party pursuant to _Section
11.02_ ) issued or entered by (A) the Bankruptcy Court, if the Bankruptcy
Cases are open or the Bankruptcy Court then has jurisdiction to enter such
instruction, order or judgment or (B) if the Bankruptcy Cases have been closed
or the Bankruptcy Court no longer has such jurisdiction, a court of competent
jurisdiction.

operations and projections of future operations, as well as a summary and

In accordance with Bankruptcy Code § 1123(a)(l), Administrative Claims and
Priority Tax Claims have not been classified and thus are excluded from the
Classes of Claims and Interests set forth in Article III and Article IV
hereof. These unclassified Claims are treated as follows:

 



 

 **Section 2.01** ** ****Treatment of Administrative Claims**

 



 

Except as otherwise provided for in this Plan, and subject to the requirements
of Section 2.02 of this Plan, each Holder of an Allowed Administrative Claim
shall, in full satisfaction, release, settlement, and discharge of such
Allowed Administrative Claim: (a) to the extent such claim is due and owing on
the Effective Date, be paid in full, in Cash, on the Effective Date; (b) to
the extent such claim is not due and owing on the Effective Date, be paid in
full, in Cash, (i) in accordance with the terms of any agreement among the
Liquidating Trustee, the Pre-Petition Agents and such Holder, or (ii) when
such claim becomes due and payable under applicable non-bankruptcy law, or
(iii) in the ordinary course of business; or (c) receive such other treatment

Petition Agents. Cash payments of Allowed Administrative Claims shall be paid
from the Claims Reserve, or if the Claims Reserve is insufficient to pay all

 **Section 2.02** ** ****Bar Dates for Certain Claims**

 



 

(a) _Administrative Claims; Substantial Contribution Claims._ The Confirmation
Order will establish a Bar Date for Filing of all Administrative Claims,
including substantial contribution claims (but not including Professional Fee
Claims, claims for the expenses of the members of the Committee and
Administrative Claims in section (b) or (c) below), which date will be thirty
(30) days after the Confirmation Date (the " _Administrative Claims Bar Date_
"). Holders of asserted Administrative Claims, other than Professional Fee
Claims, claims for U.S. Trustee fees under 28 U.S.C. §1930, administrative tax
claims and administrative ordinary case liabilities described in section (b)
below, must submit proofs of Administrative Claim on or

A notice prepared by the Debtors will set forth such date and constitute
notice of this Administrative Claims Bar Date. The Reorganized Debtors and the
Pre-Petition Agents shall have thirty days (30) days (or such longer period as
may be allowed by order of the Bankruptcy Court) following the Administrative
Claims Bar Date to review and object to such Administrative Claims before a
hearing for determination of allowance of such Administrative Claims.

 



 

(b) _Administrative Ordinary Course Liabilities._ Holders of Administrative
Claims that are based on liabilities incurred and paid by any Debtor in the
ordinary course of the applicable Debtors business (other than Claims of
governmental units for taxes and for interest and/or penalties related to such
taxes) on and after the Petition Date shall not be required to File any
request for payment of such Administrative Claims. For the avoidance of doubt,
Holders of Administrative Claims pursuant to Bankruptcy Code § 503(b)(9) shall
be required to File a proof of Administrative Claim on or before the
Administrative Claims Bar Date.

 



 

(c) _Administrative Tax Claims._ All requests for payment of Administrative
Claims by a governmental unit for taxes (and for interest and/or penalties
related to such taxes) for any tax year or period, all or any portion of which
occurs or falls within the period from and including the Petition Date through
and including the Effective Date, and for which no bar date has otherwise been
previously established, must be Filed and served on the Reorganized Debtors,
the Pre-Petition Agents, and any other party specifically requesting a copy in
writing on or before the later of (a) thirty (30) days following the
Confirmation Date; and (b) one hundred and twenty (120) days following the
Filing of the tax return for such taxes for such tax year or period with the
applicable governmental unit. Any Holder of any such Claim that is required to
File a request for payment of such taxes and does not File and properly serve
such a claim by the applicable Bar Date shall be forever barred from asserting
any such claim against the Debtors, the Reorganized Debtors, the Liquidating
Trust or their property, regardless of whether any such Claim is deemed to
arise on or before the Effective Date. Any interested party desiring to object
to an Administrative Claim for taxes must File and serve its objection on
counsel to the Debtors and the relevant taxing authority no later than ninety
(90) days after the taxing authority Files and serves its application.

 



 

(d) _Professional Fee Claims._ All final requests for compensation or
reimbursement of professional fees pursuant to Bankruptcy Code §§ 327, 328,
330, 331, 363, 503(b) or 1103 for services rendered to or on behalf of the
applicable Debtors or the Committee (if one has been appointed) before the
Confirmation Date (other than substantial contribution claims under Bankruptcy
Code § 503(b)(4)) must be Filed and served on the Reorganized Debtors, the
Pre-Petition Agents, and their respective counsel no later than thirty days
(30) after the Confirmation Date, unless otherwise ordered by the Bankruptcy
Court. Objections to applications of such Professionals or other entities for
compensation or reimbursement of expenses must be Filed and served on the
Debtors, Pre-Petition Agents, and their counsel and the requesting
Professional or other entity no later than thirty (30) days (or such longer
period as may be allowed by order of the Bankruptcy Court) after the date on
which the applicable application for compensation or reimbursement was served.

 



      
 

 



 

 **Section 2.03** ** ****Payment of Statutory Fees**

 



 

On or before the Effective Date (or as soon as reasonably practicable after
such fees become due), the Debtors shall have paid in full, in Cash (including
by check or wire transfer), in U.S. dollars, all fees payable pursuant to
section 1930 of title 28 of the United States Code, in the amount determined
by the Bankruptcy Court at the Confirmation Hearing.

 



 

 **Section 2.04** ** ****Treatment of Priority Tax Claims**

 



 

Each Holder of an Allowed Priority Tax Claim shall, in full satisfaction,
release, and discharge thereof, receive (i) such treatment as to which such
Holder may agree with the Liquidating Trustee, and the Pre-Petition Agents or
(ii) at the sole option of the Liquidating Trustee, (a) payment in full, in
Cash, of such Allowed Priority Tax Claim on the Effective Date; or (b)
treatment in accordance with Bankruptcy Code §§ 1129(a)(9)(C) or
1129(a)(9)(D), as the case may be, with the Liquidating Trustees selection of
(a) or (b) being subject to the prior written approval of Pre-Petition Agents.
Cash payments of Allowed Priority Tax Claims shall be paid from the Claims
Reserve, or if the Claims Reserve is insufficient to pay all Allowed Priority
Tax Claims, any shortfall shall be paid from the Gift Reserve or from the
Avoidance Actions Proceeds Reserve.

 



 

 **ARTICLE III**

 



 

 **CLASSIFICATION AND TREATMENT

The categories of Claims and Interests set forth herein classify Claims and
Interests for all purposes, including for purposes of voting, confirmation,
and distribution pursuant to this Plan and Bankruptcy Code §§ 1122 and
1123(a)(l). A Claim or Interest shall be deemed classified in a particular
Class only to the extent that it qualifies within the description of such
Class, and shall be deemed classified in other Classes to the extent that any
portion of such Claim or Interest qualifies within the description of such
other Classes. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Plan, a Claim
or Interest shall be deemed classified in a Class only to the extent that such
Claim or Interest has not been paid, released, or otherwise settled before the
Effective Date.

 



 

All Claims (except for Administrative Claims and Priority Tax Claims, which
are not classified pursuant to Bankruptcy Code § 1123(a)(l)) are classified in
Section 3.03 and Section 4.01 through Section 4.09 in this Plan.

 



 

 **Section 3.02** ** ****Voting; Presumptions**

 



 

(a) Acceptance by Impaired Classes. Each Impaired Class of Claims that will
(or may) receive or retain property or any interest in property under this
Plan shall be entitled to vote to accept or reject this Plan. An Impaired
Class of Claims shall have accepted this Plan if (i) the Holders (other than
any Holder designated under Bankruptcy Code § 1126(e)) of at least two-thirds
in amount of the Allowed Claims actually voting in such Class have voted to
accept this

 



      
 

 



 

Plan and (ii) the Holders (other than any Holder designated under Bankruptcy
Code § 1126(e)) of more than one-half in number of the Allowed Claims actually
voting in such Class have voted to accept this Plan. An Impaired Class of
Interests shall have accepted this Plan if the Holders (other than any Holder
designated under Bankruptcy Code § 1126(e)) of at least two-thirds in amount
of the Allowed Interests actually voting in such Class have voted to accept
this Plan.

 



 

(b) Voting Presumptions. Claims and Interests in Unimpaired Classes are
conclusively deemed to have accepted this Plan pursuant to Bankruptcy Code §
1126(f) and, therefore, are not entitled to vote to accept or reject this
Plan. Claims and Interests in Classes that do not entitle the Holders thereof
to receive or retain any property under this Plan are conclusively deemed to
have rejected this Plan pursuant to Bankruptcy Code § 1126(g) and, therefore,
are not entitled to vote to accept or reject this Plan.

 



 

 **Section 3.03** ** ****Identification of Claims and Interests**

 



 

The following tables designate the Classes of Claims against, and Interests
in, the Debtors and specify which of those Classes and Interest are (a)
Impaired or Unimpaired by this Plan; (b) entitled to vote to accept or reject
this Plan in accordance with Bankruptcy Code § 1126; and (c) deemed to accept
or reject this Plan.

 **ARTICLE IV**

 



 

 **TREATMENT OF CLAIMS AND INTERESTS**

 



 

 **Section 4.01** ** ****Priority Non-Tax Claims**

 



 

 _Classification_ : Classes A1, B1, C1, D1, E1, F1, G1, H1, and I1 consist of
the Allowed Priority Non-Tax Claims against the respective Debtors.

 



 

 _Treatment_ : Except to the extent that a Holder of an Allowed Claim in
Classes A1, B1, C1, D1, E1, F1, G1, H1, and I1 has agreed in writing with the
Debtors (or the Liquidating Trustee) and the Pre-Petition Agents to a
different treatment (in which event such other writing will govern), each
Holder of an Allowed Claim in Classes A1, B1, C1, D1, E1, F1, G1, H1, and I1
shall receive, on account of, and in full and complete settlement, release and
discharge of and in exchange for, such Claim, at the election of the
Liquidating Trustee, (i) Cash equal to the amount of such Allowed Claims in
Classes A1, B1, C1, D1, E1, F1, G1, H1, and I1 in accordance with Bankruptcy
Code § 1129(a)(9), on the later of (a) the Effective Date (or as soon as
reasonably practicable thereafter) and (b) the date such Claim in Classes A1,
B1, C1, D1, E1, F1, G1, H1, and I1 becomes an Allowed Claim in Classes A1, B1,
C1, D1, E1, F1, G1, H1, and I1 (or as soon as reasonably practicable
thereafter); or (ii) such other treatment agreed to by the Debtors,
Liquidating Trustee, and the Pre-Petition Agents required to render such
Allowed

 



      
 

 



 

Claims in Classes A1, B1, C1, D1, E1, F1, G1, H1, and I1 Unimpaired pursuant
to Bankruptcy Code § 1124. Cash payments of Allowed Claims in Classes A1, B1,
C1, D1, E1, F1, G1, H1, and I1 shall be paid from the Claims Reserve, or if
the Claims Reserve is insufficient to pay all Allowed Priority Non-Tax Claims,
any shortfall shall be paid from the Gift Reserve or from the Avoidance
Actions Proceeds Reserve.

 



 

 _Voting_ : Claims in Classes A1, B1, C1, D1, E1, F1, G1, H1, and I1 are
Unimpaired. Each Holder of an Allowed Claim in Classes A1, B1, C1, D1, E1, F1,
G1, H1, and I1 shall be conclusively deemed to have accepted this Plan
pursuant to Bankruptcy Code § 1126(f), and, therefore, shall not be entitled
to vote to accept or reject this Plan.

 



 

 **Section 4.02** ** ****Senior Secured Claims**

 



 

 _Classification_ : Classes A2, B2, C2, D2, F2, G2, H2, and I2 consist of the
Senior Secured Claims against the Debtors.

 



 

 _Allowance_ : The Senior Secured Claims against the Debtors are hereby
Allowed as Secured Claims in Classes A2, B2, C2, D2, F2, G2, H2, and I2 in the
amount of $ , which amount is comprised of the Union
Senior Secured Claim in the amount of $ and the
Natixis Hedge Claim in the amount of $ , each of
which are also hereby Allowed as a Secured Claim in such Classes and in such
amounts.

 



 

 _Treatment_ : In full satisfaction of the Allowed Senior Secured Claims, the
Pre-Petition Senior Secured Agent shall receive:

 



 

(i) on the Effective Date and as part of the Closing, from the Purchaser, all
of the PSA Sale Proceeds, except for any portion of such proceeds transferred
by the Purchaser to the Liquidating Trust to fund the (a) Claims Reserve as
described in Section 6.02(a) of this Plan, (b) Liquidating Trust Expense
Reserve as described in Section 6.02(b) of this Plan; and (c) Gift Reserve as
described in Section 6.02(d) of this Plan;

 



 

(ii) on the Effective Date, from the Debtors, contemporaneously with the
payment from the Purchaser in clause (i) above, all Available Cash, if any,
except for (a) the amounts transferred to the Liquidating Trust to fund the
Claims Reserve and the Liquidating Trust Expense Reserve pursuant to Section
6.02 of this Plan; and (b) any amounts that constitute Retained Funds;

 



 

(iii) as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Date, the Net
Proceeds of the sale, collection or other monetization of all or each a
portion of the Other Assets, except for Avoidance Actions which shall be
liquidated for the benefit of the Holders of Allowed Plan Carve Out Claims and
Allowed General Unsecured Claims until satisfaction in full of such Allowed
Claims, at which time any remaining funds in the Gift Reserve or the Avoidance
Actions Proceeds Reserve shall be transferred to the Pre-Petition Secured
Agent or UBE, as applicable;

 



 

(iv) as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Date, any remaining
funds in the Claims Reserve after the payment of the Allowed Plan Carve Out
Claims;

 



 

(v) as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Date, the proceeds
of the sale, collection or other monetization of the Closing Accounts
Receivable in accordance with the Purchase and Sale Agreement;

 



      
 

 



 

(vi) any remaining funds in the Liquidating Trust Expense Reserve on the date
the Liquidating Trust is terminated;

 



 

(vii) as soon as reasonably practicable after receipt by the Liquidating
Trustee, all amounts in the Undeliverable Distribution Reserve that have been
forfeited by Holders of Claims in accordance with Section 9.02(b) of this
Plan; and

 



 

(viii) as soon as reasonably practicable after receipt by the Liquidating
Trustee, all remaining amounts from the Environmental Escrow Funds.

 



 

The Pre-Petition Senior Secured Agent shall disburse the funds received
pursuant to this Section 4.02 in accordance with the Senior Credit Agreement.

 



 

In the event sufficient PSA Sale Proceeds exist to pay the Allowed Claim of
the Senior Secured Lenders in full, the Senior Secured Lenders shall be
entitled to amend their claim as necessary to allow recovery of all other
amounts to which the Senior Secured Lenders would be entitled under the Senior
Lien Documents which might not otherwise be set forth in their Allowed Claim,
such as interest and legal fees. In the event that the Allowed Senior Secured
Claim Distribution Amounts are greater than the Allowed Senior Secured Claims
and the Senior Secured Claims are paid in full, then the Liquidating Trust
shall distribute the excess amount to UBE on account of the UBE Junior Secured
Claim.

 



 

To the extent that the amounts received by the Pre-Petition Senior Secured
Agent as provided herein are less than the amount of the Allowed Senior
Secured Claims, the shortfall shall be a " _Senior Secured Deficiency Claim_ "
and shall be treated as an Allowed General Unsecured Claim in Classes A5, B5,
C5, D5, F5, G5, H5, and I5 against the Debtors; provided, however, if (i) the
Committee supports, and does not object to, Confirmation of this Plan, (ii)
all nine Classes of General Unsecured Claims in this Plan vote to accept this
Plan by the requisite statutory majority provided in Bankruptcy Code §
1126(c); and (iii) the validity, extent, or priority of the Senior Secured
Lenders Liens are not challenged by the Committee, a Creditor, or any other
party-in-interest, then the Senior Secured Deficiency Claim is waived and
shall not become a General Unsecured Claim in any Class under this Plan. In
the event that the Allowed Senior Secured Claim Distribution Amounts are
greater than the Allowed Senior Secured Claims and the Senior Secured Claims
are paid in full, then the Liquidating Trust shall distribute the excess
amount to UBE on account of the UBE Junior Secured Claim.

 



 

 _Voting_ : Classes A2, B2, C2, D2, F2, G2, H2, and I2 are Impaired. Each
Holder of an Allowed Claim in Classes A2, B2, C2, D2, E2, F2, G2, H2, and I2
shall be entitled to vote to accept or reject this Plan.

 



 

 **Section 4.03** ** ****UBE Junior Secured Claim**

 



 

 _Classification_ : Classes A3, B3, C3, D3, F3, G3, H3 and I3 consist of the
UBE Junior Secured Claim against the Debtors.

 



 

 _Allowance_ : The UBE Junior Secured Claim against the Debtors is hereby
Allowed as a Secured Claim in Classes A3, B3, C3, D3, F3, G3, H3 and I3 in the
amount of $ .

 



      
 

 



 

 _Treatment_ : In the event that the Senior Secured Claim Distribution Amounts
are greater than the Allowed Senior Secured Claims and the Allowed Senior
Secured Claims are paid in full, then the Liquidating Trust shall as soon as
reasonably practicable distribute the excess amount to UBE on account of the
Allowed UBE Junior Secured Claim.

 



 

In the event sufficient PSA Sale Proceeds exist to pay the Allowed Claim of
the Junior Secured Lenders in full, the Junior Secured Lenders shall be
entitled to amend their claim as necessary to allow recovery of all other
amounts to which the Junior Secured Lenders would be entitled under the Junior
Lien Documents which might not otherwise be set forth in their Allowed Claim,
such as interest and legal fees.

 



 

To the extent that the amounts received by UBE as provided herein are less
than the amount of the Allowed UBE Junior Secured Claim, then the unpaid
portion of the Allowed UBE Junior Secured Claim (the " _UBE Junior Secured
Deficiency Claim_ ") shall be treated as an Allowed General Unsecured Claim in
Classes A5, B5, C5, D5, F5, G5, H5 and I5 against the Debtors; provided,
however, if (i) the Committee supports, and does not object to, Confirmation
of this Plan, (ii) all nine Classes of General Unsecured Claims in this Plan
vote to accept this Plan by the requisite statutory majority provided in
Bankruptcy Code § 1126(c); and (iii) the validity, extent, or priority of the
Junior Secured Lenders Liens are not challenged by the Committee, a Creditor,
or any other party-in-interest, then the UBE Junior Secured Deficiency Claim
is waived and shall not become a General Unsecured Claim in any Class under
this Plan.

 



 

 _Voting_ : Claims in Classes A3, B3, C3, D3, F3, G3, H3 and I3 are Impaired.
Each Holder of an Allowed Claim in Classes A3, B3, C3, D3, E3, F3, G3, H3 and
I3 shall be entitled to vote to accept or reject this Plan.

 



 

 **Section 4.04** ** ****Miscellaneous Secured Claims**

 



 

 _Classification_ : Classes A4, B4, C4, D4, E2, F4, G4, H4 and I4 consist of

 **ARTICLE VI**

 



 

 **MEANS FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS PLAN 
AND POST EFFECTIVE DATE GOVERNANCE**

 



 

 **Section 6.01** ** ****Sale of the Acquired Property**

 



 

This Plan contemplates the sale of the Acquired Property to a third party. To
effect this, the Debtors Filed the Bid Procedures and Sale Motion which seeks,
inter alia, to approve the Stalking Horse SPA and to establish the Auction. On
March [ ], 2012, the Bankruptcy Court entered the Bid Procedures Order, which
established [ ] as the deadline for Potential
Bidders to submit bids for the Acquired Property, and established [
], 2012 as the date for the Auction. In connection with the Auction, the
Debtors have identified the Stalking Horse as a potential purchaser for the
Equity Interests. If no timely Qualifying Bid (as defined in the Bid
Procedures) (other than the Stalking Horse bid) is received by the Bid
Deadline (as defined in the Bid Procedures), the Debtors shall not hold an
Auction and instead shall request at the Sale Hearing that the Bankruptcy
Court approve the Stalking Horse SPA as the Purchase and Sale Agreement and
declare the Stalking Horse to be the Successful Bidder/Bid. If additional
Qualified Bidders are identified, at the conclusion of the Auction, the
Debtors, with the consent of the Pre-Petition Agents, will seek Bankruptcy
Court approval to sell the Acquired Property pursuant to the Purchase and Sale
Agreement to the Successful Bidder, Free and Clear. The Sale Order and/or the
Confirmation Order shall contain specific authority for the Debtors to comply
with the Purchase and Sale Agreement as set forth above.

 



 

 **Section 6.02** ** ****Application of PSA Sale Proceeds**

 



 

(a) **_Claims Reserve Funding._** ** **Contemporaneously with the Closing, the
Effective Date and the delivery of the PSA Sale Proceeds to the Pre-Petition
Senior Secured Agent described below, the Debtors will transfer from their
Available Cash (other than Retained Funds) an amount sufficient to fund the
Claims Reserve for the benefit of the Holders of Allowed Plan

 



      
 

 



 

Carve Out Claims (and, to the extent of any surplus from such reserve after
the payment of such Allowed Claims, for the benefit of the Holders of Senior
Secured Claims and the UBE Junior Secured Claim) to the Liquidating Trust. If
the amount of the Debtors Available Cash at the time of the Closing is
insufficient to fund the Claims Reserve in full, then the Purchaser shall
transfer a portion of the PSA Sale Proceeds (in an amount equal to such
insufficiency) to the Liquidating Trust (rather than being transferred to the
Pre-Petition Senior Secured Agent as described below) to complete the funding
of the Claims Reserve.

 



 

(b) **_Liquidating Trust Funding_** **.** If there is additional Available
Cash after the Claims Reserve is funded, then the Debtors will transfer an
amount sufficient to fund the Liquidating Trust Expense Reserve in full from
their Available Cash (other than Retained Funds) to the Liquidating Trust. If
the amount of the Debtors Available Cash after funding the Claims Reserve is
less than the Liquidating Trust Expense Reserve, the Purchaser shall transfer
a portion of the PSA Sale Proceeds equal to the shortfall to the Liquidating
Trust (rather than being transferred to the Pre-Petition Senior Secured Agent
as described below) to fund the Liquidating Trust Expense Reserve.

 



 

(c) **_Payment of Senior Secured Claims and UBE Junior Secured Claim_** **.
**Contemporaneously with and as part of the Closing and the Effective Date,
the Purchaser shall transfer to the Pre-Petition Senior Secured Agent all of
the PSA Sale Proceeds (including the release of any deposit paid pursuant to
the Purchase and Sale Agreement or Bid Procedures) and any subsequent
adjustments or payments received from the Purchaser pursuant to the Purchase
and Sale Agreement or the Sale Order, less (i) the Gifted Amount; (ii) any
portion of the PSA Sale Proceeds transferred by the Purchaser to the
Liquidating Trust to fund the Claims Reserve for a shortfall in the Debtors
Available Cash described above; and (iii) any portion of the PSA Sale Proceeds
transferred by the Purchaser to the Liquidating Trust to fund the Liquidating
Trust Expense Reserve for a shortfall in the Debtors Available Cash described
above. In the event that the Allowed Senior Secured Claims are paid in full,
excess amounts of the PSA Sale Proceeds shall be transferred to UBE on account
of the UBE Junior Secured Claim.

 



 

(d) **_Gift Reserve Funding_** **.** The Purchaser, on behalf of the Pre-
Petition Secured Lenders, shall transfer and/or gift a portion of the PSA Sale
Proceeds equal to the Gifted Amount to the Liquidating Trust to fund the Gift
Reserve for the benefit of the Holders of Allowed General Unsecured Claims in
Classes A6, B6, D6, E3, F6, G6, H6, and I6.

 



 

 **Section 6.03** ** ****Available Cash.**

 



 

After the Claims Reserve and Liquidating Trust Expense Reserve are funded, any
remaining Available Cash (other than Retained Funds) shall be transferred to
the Pre-Petition Senior Secured Agent or UBE, as applicable, for the benefit
of the Senior Secured Claims and the UBE Junior Secured Claim, as applicable.

 



 

 **Section 6.04** ** ****Other Assets**

 



 

Any Other Assets (excluding Avoidance Actions), shall revest or vest in the
appropriate Reorganized Debtor and shall be transferred to the Liquidating
Trust for the benefit of the Holders of Senior Secured Claims and the UBE
Junior Secured Claim. Except as otherwise provided in the Purchase and Sale
Agreement, any assets received by the Liquidating Trust after

 



      
 

 



 

the Effective Date of the Plan (other than the proceeds of Avoidance Actions)
shall also be Other Assets and transferred to the Liquidating Trust for the
benefit of the Holders of Senior Secured Claims and the UBE Junior Secured
Claim.

 



 

 **Section 6.05** ** ****Avoidance Actions**

 



 

All Avoidance Actions are transferred to the Liquidating Trust for the benefit
of the Holders of Allowed General Unsecured Claims in Classes A6, B6, C6, D6,
E3, F6, G6, H6, and I6.

 



 

 **Section 6.06** ** ****Purchase and Sale Agreement and Related Documents**

 



 

(a) **_General_** **. **On the Effective Date, the transactions contemplated
by the Purchase and Sale Agreement and any documents in connection therewith
shall be consummated, and the Acquired Property shall be sold and transferred
to the Purchaser in accordance with the terms of the Purchase and Sale
Agreement and this Plan in exchange for the consideration set forth in the
Purchase and Sale Agreement.

 



 

(b) **_Amendment_** **. **To the extent that material amendments are needed to
the Purchase and Sale Agreement, the Debtors shall File the Purchase and Sale
Agreement as so amended (and any related documents) on or before the Plan
Supplement Filing Date. After the Confirmation Date, the Debtors may modify
the Purchase and Sale Agreement or any other documents in accordance with the
terms of the Purchase and Sale Agreement in furtherance of the transactions
contemplated thereby without the need for further notice or court approval.

 



 

 **Section 6.07** ** ****Deemed Consolidation of Debtors for Plan Purposes
Only.**

 



 

Subject to the occurrence of the Effective Date, the Debtors shall be deemed
consolidated under the Joint Plan of Reorganization solely for the limited
purposes of distribution under the Plan. Each and every Claim filed or to be
filed against any of the Debtors shall be deemed filed against the deemed
consolidated Debtors and shall be deemed one Claim against all Debtors and (a)
all Claims of each Debtor against any other Debtor will be eliminated and
released; (b) any obligation of any Debtor and all guarantees thereof executed
by one or more of the Debtors shall be deemed to be one obligation of all of
the consolidated Debtors; (c) any Claims filed or to be filed in connection
with any such obligation and such guarantees shall be deemed one Claim against
the consolidated Debtors; (d) all duplicative Claims (identical in amount and
subject matter) filed against one or more of the Debtors will be automatically
expunged so that only one Claim survives against the consolidated Debtors; and
(e) the consolidated Debtors will be deemed, for purposes of determining the
availability of the right of set-off under section 553 of the Bankruptcy Code,
to be one entity, so that, subject to other provisions of section 553 of the
Bankruptcy Code, the debts due to a particular Debtor may be offset against
the Claims against such Debtor or Debtors.

 



 

Such deemed consolidation, however, shall not (other than for purposes related
to funding distributions under the this Plan and as set forth above in this
Section) affect: (a) the legal and organizational structure of the Reorganized
Debtors; (b) pre- and post-Petition Date guaranties, liens, and security
interests that are required to be maintained (i) in connection with executory
contracts or unexpired leases that were entered into during the Chapter 11
Cases or

 



      
 

 



 

that have been or will be assumed; (ii) pursuant to this Plan; or (iii) in
connection with any financing entered into, or New Interests issued, by the

(without the necessity of further action); (b) to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable law, the rights, powers, and duties of the Governors of each
Debtor (that is not a Debtor whose Interests have been sold to the Purchaser
pursuant to the Sale Order and/or the Confirmation Order (or a Subsidiary of
such a Debtor)) that has a Governor shall vest in the Liquidating Trustee and
the Liquidating Trustee or its designee shall be the presiding officer and the
sole Governor of each such Reorganized Debtor; and (c) to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, the Governors of each Debtor whose Interests have
been sold to the Purchaser pursuant to the Sale Order and/or the Confirmation
Order (or a Subsidiary of such a Debtor) shall be selected by the Purchaser.
The Liquidating Trustee shall make all determinations with respect to
employment of any other directors, officers, managers and employees of each
such Debtor described in clause (b) on and after the Effective Date.

from which property is being transferred and assigned. This Plan shall be
conclusively deemed to be adequate notice that such Lien, Claim, encumbrance,
or other interest is being extinguished and no notice other than by this Plan,
shall be given before the presentation of such orders or assignments. Any
person having a Lien, Claim, encumbrance or other interest against any Vested

assignment and vesting of such Vested Assets Free and Clear to the Reorganized

in this Plan; _provided_ , _however_ , except as otherwise set forth in this
Plan, nothing herein shall be deemed to be a release of any Lien, Claim,
encumbrance or other interest in or against property that is not a Vested
Asset.

 



 

 **Section 6.13** ** ****Cancellation of Interests,**

 



 

On the Effective Date, all Interests in the Debtors (including those Interests
held in Treasury by any of the Debtors) shall be terminated and extinguished
and the certificates that previously evidenced ownership of those interests

evidence no rights or interests in any of the Debtors. Upon cancellation of
the Interests in Cano, neither Cano, the Reorganized Debtors, nor the
Liquidating Trustee shall file periodic or other reports with the Securities
and Exchange Commission; _provided_ , _however_ , that Cano shall continue to

issued equity interest in the Reorganized Cano.

 



 

 **Section 6.15** ** ****Exemption from Registration**

(including the Securities Act), state or local law, rule or regulation
pursuant to Bankruptcy Code § 1145 or other applicable law requiring
registration before the offering, issuance, distribution or sale of

qualify for an exemption under Bankruptcy Code § 1145, the New Interests shall
be issued in a manner, which qualifies for any other available exemption from
registration, whether as a private placement under Rule 506 of the Securities
Act, Section 4(2) of the Securities Act, and/or the safe harbor provisions
promulgated thereunder.

otherwise applicable principle of law or equity, without limitation, any
principles of judicial estoppel, res judicata, collateral estoppel, issue
preclusion, or any similar doctrine, the failure to list, disclose, describe,

defenses, or counterclaims that a Debtor has, or may have, as of the Effective
Date. The Liquidating Trust may, subject to this Plan and the Liquidating
Trust Agreement, commence, prosecute, defend against, settle, and realize upon

 **ARTICLE VII**

 



 

 **LIQUIDATING TRUST AND LIQUIDATING TRUSTEE**

 



 

 **Section 7.01** ** ****The Creation of the Liquidating Trust**

 



 

The Liquidating Trust, duly organized under the laws of Texas, is created for
the purpose of liquidating the Liquidating Trust Assets in accordance with
Treasury Regulation Section 301.7701-4(d) and shall be governed by the
Liquidating Trust Agreement. The Liquidating Trust Agreement shall conform to
the terms of this Plan, and to the extent that the Liquidating Trust Agreement
is inconsistent with this Plan, the terms of this Plan shall govern. The
Liquidating Trustee will file all federal income tax returns for the
Liquidating Trust as a grantor trust pursuant to Section 671 of the Internal
Revenue Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder.

 



 

 **Section 7.02** ** ****Funding of Res of Trust**

 



 

On the Effective Date, all of the Liquidating Trust Assets shall be
transferred and assigned to the Liquidating Trust, and the Liquidating Trust
shall be in possession of, and have

 



      
 

 



 

title to, all the Liquidating Trust Assets. The conveyances of all Liquidating
Trust Assets shall be accomplished pursuant to this Plan, the Sale Order
and/or the Confirmation Order. The Debtors shall convey, transfer, assign and
deliver the Liquidating Trust Assets Free and Clear, except that the Liens of
the Senior Secured Lenders and UBE shall attach to the PSA Sale Proceeds,
other than any portion of such proceeds transferred by the Purchaser to the
Liquidating Trust for shortfalls as described in Section 6.02 of the Plan or
for the Gifted Amount. The Liquidating Trustee may present such orders to the
Bankruptcy Court as may be necessary to require third parties to accept and
acknowledge such conveyance to the Liquidating Trust. Such orders may be
presented without further notice other than as has been given in this Plan.

 



 

For all federal income tax purposes, all Persons (including, without
limitation, the Debtors and the Liquidating Trustee and the beneficiaries of
the Liquidating Trust) will treat the transfer and assignment of the
Liquidating Trust Assets to the Liquidating Trust for the benefit of the
beneficiaries of the Liquidating Trust as (a) a transfer of the Liquidating
Trust Assets directly to the beneficiaries of the Liquidating Trust followed
by (b) the transfer by the beneficiaries of the Liquidating Trust to the
Liquidating Trust of the Liquidating Trust Assets. The Liquidating Trust will
be treated as a grantor trust for federal tax purposes and, to the extent
permitted under applicable law, for state and local income tax purposes. The
beneficiaries of the Liquidating Trust will be treated as the grantors and
owners of their Pro Rata portion of the Liquidating Trust Assets for federal
income tax purposes.

 



 

 **Section 7.03** ** ****The Liquidating Trustee**

 



 

The Liquidating Trustee shall be appointed by mutual consent of the Debtors
and the Pre-Petition Agents. The Liquidating Trustee shall retain and have all
the rights, powers and duties necessary to carry out his or her
responsibilities under this Plan and the Liquidating Trust Agreement, and as
otherwise provided in the Sale Order and/or the Confirmation Order. However,
the Liquidating Trustee shall not be obligated to review, investigate,
evaluate, analyze, or object to Fee Applications or Professional Fee Claims
relating to services rendered and expenses incurred before the Effective Date.
The Liquidating Trustee shall be the exclusive trustee of the Liquidating
Trust Assets for the purposes of 31 U.S.C. § 3713(b) and 26 U.S.C. §
6012(b)(3), as well as the representative of the Estates appointed pursuant to
Bankruptcy Code § 1123(b)(3)(B). Subject to the Bankruptcy Courts approval
and appointment of the selection of the Liquidating Trustee at the
Confirmation Hearing, a Person to be designated by the Debtors and the Pre-
Petition Agent in the Plan Supplement shall initially serve as the Liquidating
Trustee. Matters relating to the appointment, removal and resignation of the
Liquidating Trustee and the appointment of any successor Liquidating Trustee
shall be set forth in the Liquidating Trust Agreement. The Liquidating Trustee
shall be required to perform his or her duties as set forth in this Plan and
the Liquidating Trust Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 7.04** ** ****Retention of Professionals.**

 



 

The Liquidating Trustee shall have the right to retain the services of
attorneys, accountants, and other professionals that, in the discretion of the
Liquidating Trustee, are necessary to assist the Liquidating Trustee in the
performance of his or her duties. The reasonable fees and expenses of such
professionals shall be paid by the Liquidating Trust upon the monthly
submission of statements to the Liquidating Trustee. The payment of the
reasonable

 



      
 

 



 

fees and expenses of the Liquidating Trustees retained professionals shall be
made in the ordinary course of business and shall not be subject to the
approval of the Bankruptcy Court except as otherwise provided in this Plan.
Professionals of, among others, the Debtors and the Committee (if any), shall
be eligible for retention by the Liquidating Trustee on a special counsel
basis, and former employees of the Debtors shall be eligible for retention by
the Liquidating Trust and Liquidating Trustee.

 



 

The reasonable fees and expenses incurred in connection with services
performed by the Liquidating Trust relating to the administration and/or
liquidation of General Unsecured Claims and/or Avoidance Actions shall be paid
by the Liquidating Trust solely from the Liquidating Trust Expense Reserve and
amounts otherwise distributable to Holders of Allowed General Unsecured
Claims. Before each payment of the Liquidating Trustees fees, fees and
expenses of the Liquidating Trustees retained professionals and other costs,
expenses and liabilities of the Liquidating Trust, the Liquidating Trustee
shall provide written notice thereof to the Pre-Petition Agents in such detail
and with such support as the Pre-Petition Agents may reasonably request. If
the Pre-Petition Agents do not object to the payment of such amounts within
five (5) Business Days after receipt of such notice, the Liquidating Trustee
may make such payments. If any Pre-Petition Agent objects and the objecting
Pre-Petition Agent(s) and the Liquidating Trustee cannot agree on the
appropriate amount of such payment, then the Liquidating Trustee may not make
such payment unless he or she obtains an order from the Bankruptcy Court
approving such payment.

 



 

 **Section 7.05** ** ****Compensation of the Liquidating Trustee**

 



 

The Liquidating Trustees compensation, on a post-Effective Date basis, shall
be disclosed in the Plan Supplement. The payment of the fees of the
Liquidating Trustee and any professionals retained by the Liquidating Trustee
shall be made by the Liquidating Trust in accordance with the provisions of
this Plan and the Liquidating Trust Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 7.06** ** ****Liquidating Trust Expenses**

 



 

All costs, expenses and obligations incurred by the Liquidating Trustee in
administering this Plan and the Liquidating Trust, or in any manner connected,
incidental or related thereto shall come from amounts distributable to the
appropriate beneficiaries for whose benefit such expenses or obligations were
incurred. For example, reasonable costs incurred in resolving Avoidance
Actions and General Unsecured Claims shall be paid first from the Liquidating
Trust Expense Reserve and then from amounts otherwise distributable to Holders
of Allowed General Unsecured Claims, and expenses incurred in monetizing Other
Assets shall be paid first from the Liquidating Trust Expense Reserve and then
from funds otherwise distributable to the Senior Secured Lenders.

 



 

 **Section 7.07** ** ****Liability; Indemnification**

 



 

The Liquidating Trustee shall not be liable for any act or omission taken or
omitted to be taken in his or her capacity as the Liquidating Trustee, other
than acts or omissions resulting from such Persons willful misconduct, gross
negligence or fraud. The Liquidating Trustee may, in connection with the
performance of his or her functions, and in his or her sole absolute
discretion, consult with attorneys, accountants and agents, and shall not be
liable for any act

 



       
 

 



 

taken, omitted to be taken, or suffered to be done in accordance with advice
or opinions rendered by such professionals. Notwithstanding such authority,
the Liquidating Trustee shall be under no obligation to consult with
attorneys, accountants or his or her agents, and his or her determination to
not do so should not result in imposition of liability on the Liquidating
Trustee unless such determination is based on willful misconduct, gross
negligence or fraud. The Liquidating Trust shall indemnify and hold harmless
the Liquidating Trustee and his or her agents, representatives, professionals,
and employees from and against and in respect to any and all liabilities,
losses, damages, claims, costs and expenses, including, but not limited to
attorneys fees and costs arising out of or due to their actions or omissions,
or consequences of such actions or omissions, with respect to the Liquidating
Trust or the implementation or administration of this Plan; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no such indemnification will be made to such Persons for such
actions or omissions as a result of willful misconduct, gross negligence or
fraud.

 



 

 **Section 7.08** ** ****Termination**

 



 

(a) The duties, responsibilities and powers of the Liquidating Trustee shall
terminate after all Liquidating Trust Assets have been fully resolved,
abandoned or liquidated and the Liquidating Trust Assets have been distributed
in accordance with this Plan and the Liquidating Trust Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , except in the circumstances set forth below, the Liquidating Trust
shall terminate no later than three years after the Effective Date. If
warranted by the facts and circumstances provided for in this Plan, and
subject to the approval of the Bankruptcy Court upon a finding that an
extension is necessary for the purpose of the Liquidating Trust, the term of
the Liquidating Trust may be extended, one or more times (not to exceed a
total of four extensions, unless the Liquidating Trustee receives a favorable
ruling from the Internal Revenue Service that any further extension would not
adversely affect the status of the Liquidating Trust as a grantor trust for
federal income tax purposes) for a finite period, not to exceed six months,
based on the particular circumstances at issue. Each such extension must be
approved by the Bankruptcy Court within two months prior to the beginning of
the extended term with notice thereof to all of the unpaid beneficiaries of
the Liquidating Trust. Upon the occurrence of the termination of the
Liquidating Trust, the Liquidating Trustee shall File with the Bankruptcy
Court, a report thereof, seeking discharge of the Liquidating Trustee.

 



 

 **Section 7.09** ** ****Liquidating Trustee Authority**

 



 

(a) **Compromise of Claims.** The Liquidating Trust shall have full authority
to compromise Claims or settle interests without supervision by the Bankruptcy
Court and free of any restrictions of the Bankruptcy Code or Bankruptcy Rules,
other than those restrictions expressly imposed by this Plan, the Confirmation
Order, and the Liquidating Trust Agreement, including but not limited to the
restrictions set forth in Section 11.01 of this Plan. As to any Claims that
may arise or exist after the Effective Date relating to or arising out of the
Purchase and Sale Agreement, the Liquidating Trustee shall not compromise or
resolve any such Claims without the express written consent of the Pre-
Petition Agents and the Supporting Lenders (as defined in the Plan Support
Agreement).

 



 

(b) **_Payment of Professional Fees_** **.** Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, and except as otherwise set forth in this Plan, the
Liquidating Trust may, without application to or approval by the Bankruptcy
Court, pay fees that it incurs after the Effective Date for

 



      
 

 



 

professional fees and expenses. Before settling or compromising any Plan Carve
Out Claims or interests related thereto, the Liquidating Trustee shall provide
written notice to the Pre-Petition Agents of the terms and conditions of the
proposed settlement or compromise.

 



 

(c) **_Request for Expedited Tax Review_** **.** The Liquidating Trustee shall
have the right to request an expedited determination under Bankruptcy Code §
505(b) with respect to tax returns filed, or to be filed, for any and all
taxable periods ending after the Petition Date through the Effective Date.

 



 

(d) **_Access and Preservation of Records_** **.** The Liquidating Trustee
shall be granted access to, among other things, the offices, books, and
records relating to the Debtors or any of their businesses or operations that
are in possession of the Purchaser and the Purchaser shall preserve records,
all to the extent and on the terms of the Stalking Horse SPA

 



 

 **ARTICLE VIII**

 



 

 **PROVISIONS GOVERNING DISTRIBUTIONS GENERALLY**

 



 

 **Section 8.01** ** ****Timing and Delivery of Distributions**

 



 

The Liquidating Trust Agreement shall govern distributions from the
Liquidating Trust and shall include the terms of the other sections of this
Article VIII and other relevant provisions of this Plan.

 



 

 **Section 8.02** ** ****Method of Cash Distributions**

 



 

Any Cash payment to be made pursuant to this Plan may be made by Cash, draft,
check, wire transfer, or as otherwise required or provided in any relevant
agreement or applicable law at the option of and in the sole discretion of the
Liquidating Trustee, except for Cash payments made to the Pre-Petition Senior
Secured Agent or UBE, which shall be made by wire transfer or such other
method as shall be specified by such Persons.

 



 

 **Section 8.03** ** ****Failure to Negotiate Checks**

 



 

Checks issued in respect of distributions under this Plan shall be null and
void if not negotiated within sixty (60) days after the date of issuance. The
Liquidating Trustee shall hold any amounts returned in respect of such non-
negotiated checks. The Holder of an Allowed Claim with respect to which such
check originally was issued shall make requests for reissuance for any such
check directly to the Liquidating Trustee. All amounts represented by any
voided check will be held until the later of one (1) year after (x) the
Effective Date or (y) the date that a particular Claim is Allowed by Final
Order, and all requests for reissuance by the Holder of the Allowed Claim in
respect of a voided check are required to be made before such date.
Thereafter, all such amounts shall be deemed to be Unclaimed Property, and all
Claims in respect of void checks and the underlying distributions shall be
forever barred, estopped and enjoined from assertion in any manner against the
Liquidating Trustee.

 



      
 

 



 

 **Section 8.04** ** ****Fractional Dollars**

 



 

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, Cash distributions of
fractions of dollars will not be made; rather, whenever any payment of a
fraction of a dollar would be called for, the actual payment made shall
reflect a rounding of such fraction to the nearest whole dollar (up or down),
with half dollars being rounded down. To the extent that Cash remains
undistributed as a result of the rounding of such fraction to the nearest
whole cent, such Cash shall be treated as Unclaimed Property pursuant to
Section 8.03 of this Plan.

 



 

 **Section 8.05** ** ****Compliance with Tax Requirements**

 



 

With respect to any Person from whom a tax identification number, certified
tax identification number or other tax information required by law has not
been received by the Liquidating Trustee within thirty (30) days from the date
of such request (the " _Initial Request_ "), the Liquidating Trustee may, at
its option, withhold the amount required to such Person and decline to make
such distribution until the information is received. Failure of any Person to
provide the information requested within six months of the Initial Request
shall result in the forfeit of the affected distribution and the treatment of
said distribution as Unclaimed Property.

 



 

 **Section 8.06** ** ****De Minimis Distributions**

 



 

No Cash payment of less than twenty-five ($25.00) dollars shall be made to the
Holder of any Claim on account of its Allowed Claim.

 



 

 **Section 8.07** ** ****Setoffs**

 



 

Except for any Claim that is Allowed in an amount set forth in this Plan
(including the Union Senior Secured Claim, the Natixis Hedge Claim, and the
UBE Junior Secured Claim), the Debtors or the Liquidating Trustee may, but
shall not be required to, set off against any Claims and the payments or
distributions to be made pursuant to this Plan in respect of such Claims, any
and all debts, liabilities and claims of every type and nature whatsoever that
the Estate or a Debtor may have against the Holder of any Claim, but neither
the failure to do so nor the Allowance of any such Claims, whether pursuant to
this Plan or otherwise, shall constitute a waiver or release by any Debtor of
any such claims the Debtor may have against such Holder of any Claim, and all
such claims shall be reserved for and retained by the Liquidating Trustee.

 



 

 **Section 8.08** ** ****Distribution Record Date**

 



 

As of the close of business on the fifth (5th) Business Day following the
Effective Date (the " _Distribution Record Date_ "), all transfer ledgers,
transfer books, registers and any other records maintained by the designated
transfer agents with respect to ownership of any Claims will be closed and,
for purposes of this Plan, there shall be no further changes in the record
holders of such Claims. The Liquidating Trustee shall have no obligation to
recognize the transfer of any Claims occurring after the Distribution Record
Date, and will be entitled for all purposes to recognize and deal only with
the Holder of any Claim as of the close of business on the Distribution Record
Date, as reflected on such ledgers, books, registers or records.

 



      
 

 



 

 **ARTICLE IX**

 



 

 **RESERVES ADMINISTERED BY THE LIQUIDATING TRUST**

 



 

 **Section 9.01** ** ****Establishment of Reserve Accounts, Other Assets and
Beneficiaries**

 



 

The Liquidating Trustee shall establish each of the Distribution Reserve
Accounts (which, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Plan, may be effected by either establishing a segregated account or
establishing book entry accounts, in the sole discretion of the Liquidating
Trustee).

 



 

 **Section 9.02** ** ****Undeliverable Distribution Reserve**

 



 

(a) **_Deposits_**. If a distribution to any holder of an Allowed Claim is
returned to the Liquidating Trustee as undeliverable or is otherwise
unclaimed, such distribution shall be deposited in a segregated, interest-
bearing account, designated as an "Undeliverable Distribution Reserve," for
the benefit of such holder until such time as such distribution becomes
deliverable, is claimed or is deemed to have been forfeited in accordance with
Section 8.03, Section 8.05, and Section 9.02(b) of this Plan.

 



 

(b) **_Forfeiture_**. Any holder of an Allowed Claim that does not assert a
claim pursuant to this Plan for an undeliverable or unclaimed distribution
within one year after the first distribution is made to such holder shall be
deemed to have forfeited its claim for such undeliverable or unclaimed
distribution and shall be forever barred and enjoined from asserting any such
claim for the undeliverable or unclaimed distribution against any Debtor, any
Reorganized Debtor, any Estate, the Liquidating Trustee, the Liquidating
Trust, or their respective properties or assets. In such cases, any Cash or
other property held by the Liquidating Trust in the Undeliverable Distribution
Reserve for distribution on account of such claims for undeliverable or
unclaimed distributions, including the interest that has accrued on such
undeliverable or unclaimed distribution while in the Undeliverable
Distribution Reserve, shall become Unclaimed Property, notwithstanding any
federal or state escheat laws to the contrary and shall be available for
immediate distribution by the Liquidating Trust according to Section 4.02 of
this Plan.

 



 

(c) **_Disclaimer_**. The Liquidating Trustee and his or her respective agents
and attorneys are under no duty to take any action to either (i) attempt to
locate any Claim Holder, or (ii) obtain an executed Internal Revenue Service
Form W-9 or other form required by law from any Claim holder

 



 

 **Section 9.03** ** ****Claims Reserve**

 



 

Contemporaneously with the Closing and on the Effective Date, the Debtors, and

Reserve as described in Section 6.02 of this Plan.

 



      
 

 



 

 **Section 9.04** ** ****Gift Reserve**

 



 

Contemporaneously with and as part of the Closing and on the Effective Date,
as provided in Section 6.02 the Purchaser shall transfer the Gifted Amount to
the Liquidating Trust for benefit of first, the Holders of Allowed Plan Carve
Out Claims to the extent the Claims Reserve is insufficient to satisfy such
Claims; and second, the Holders of Allowed General Unsecured Claims in Classes
A6, B6, C6, D6, E3, F6, G6, H6, and I6. Upon satisfaction in full of all
Allowed General Unsecured Claims, any remaining amounts in the Gift Reserve
shall be transferred to the Pre-Petition Secured Agent or UBE, as applicable

 



 

 **Section 9.05** ** ****Liquidating Trust Expense Reserve**

 



 

Contemporaneously with the Closing and on the Effective Date, the Debtors, and
in the event of a shortfall in Available Cash as described in Section 6.02 of
the Plan, the Purchaser, shall transfer $100,000.00 of the PSA Sale Proceeds
to establish the Liquidating Trust Expense Reserve, which shall be used by the
Liquidating Trustee to satisfy the reasonable fees and expenses of the
Liquidating Trust, the Liquidating Trustee, and any professionals retained by
the Liquidating Trustee. In the event the reasonable fees and expenses of the
Liquidating Trust exceed $100,000.00, then all such excess fees and expenses
incurred by the Liquidating Trustee in administering this Plan and the
Liquidating Trust, or in any manner connected, incidental or related thereto
shall come from amounts distributable to the appropriate beneficiaries for
whose benefit such expenses or obligations were incurred. In the event the
fees and expenses of the Liquidating Trust are less than $100,000, then any
remaining funds in the Liquidating Trust Expense Reserve shall be distributed
in accordance with Section 4.02(vi) of this Plan.

 



 

All costs and expenses associated with the administration and winding up of
the Liquidating Trust, including the storage of records and documents, shall
be paid only from the funds held the Liquidating Trust Expense Reserve and
shall not be charged against any other Liquidating Trust Assets. In no event
shall the Liquidating Trustee be required or permitted to use his or her
personal funds or assets to satisfy obligations of the Liquidating Trust.

 



 

 **Section 9.06** ** ****Avoidance Actions Proceeds Reserve**.

 



 

All the Avoidance Actions Proceeds shall also be deposited in the Avoidance
Action Proceeds Reserve for the benefit of first, the Holders of Allowed Plan
Carve Out Claims to the extent the Claims Reserve is insufficient to satisfy
such Claims; and second, the Holders of General Unsecured Claims in Classes
A6, B6, C6, D6, E3, F6, G6, H6, and I6. Upon satisfaction in full of all
Allowed General Unsecured Claims, all Avoidance Actions Proceeds shall be for

 **Section 10.01** ** ****Assumption/Rejection**

 



 

On the Effective Date, and to the extent permitted by applicable law, all of

exception to the proposed Cure Costs shall, in accordance with the Bid
Procedures Order, File a detailed statement setting forth its reason and the
Bankruptcy Court shall determine the proper amount of the Cure Costs at the
Combined Hearing. The fixing of the Cure Costs shall constitute the Debtors
right to assign the Desired 365 Contract lease to the Purchaser under
Bankruptcy Code §§ 365(c) and (f).

 



 

 **Section 10.03** ** ****Assumed Executory Contracts and Unexpired Leases**

 



 

Each Desired 365 Contract will include (a) all amendments, modifications,
supplements, restatements, or other agreements made directly or indirectly by
any agreement, instrument, or other document that in any manner affect such
executory contract or unexpired lease; and (b) with respect to any executory
contract or unexpired lease that relates to the use, ability to acquire, or
occupancy of real property, all executory contracts or unexpired leases and
other rights appurtenant to the property, including all easements, licenses,
permits, rights, privileges, immunities, options, rights of first refusal,
powers, uses, usufructs, reciprocal easement agreements, vaults, tunnel or

are the subject of a motion to reject Filed on or before the Confirmation
Date.

 



 

Amendments, modifications, supplements, and restatements to executory
contracts and unexpired leases that have been executed by the Debtors during
their Chapter 11 Cases shall not be deemed to alter the pre-petition nature of
the executory contract or unexpired lease, or the validity, priority, or
amount of any Claims that may arise in connection therewith.

 



 

 **Section 10.04** ** ****Insurance Policies**

 



 

All insurance policies pursuant to which the Debtors have any obligations in
effect as of the date of the Confirmation Hearing shall be deemed and treated

Liquidating Trust.

 



 

 **Section 10.05** ** ****Pass-through**

 



 

Except as otherwise provided in this Plan, any rights or arrangements
necessary or useful to the administration of the Liquidating Trust but not
otherwise addressed as a Claim or Interest, and other executory contracts not
assumable under Bankruptcy Code § 365(c), shall, in the absence of any other
treatment under this Plan, the Purchase and Sale Agreement, the Sale Order
and/or the Confirmation Order, be passed through the Chapter 11 Cases for the

 **Section 10.06** ** ****Claims Based on Rejection of Executory Contracts

Unless otherwise provided by a Bankruptcy Court order, any Proofs of Claim
asserting Claims arising from the rejection of the Debtors executory
contracts and unexpired leases pursuant to this Plan or otherwise must be
Filed no later than thirty (30) days after the later of the Effective Date or
the date a Final Order is entered granting the rejection. Any Proofs of Claim
arising from the rejection of the Debtors executory contracts or unexpired
leases that are not timely Filed shall be disallowed automatically, forever
barred from assertion, and shall not be enforceable against any Debtor or the
Liquidating Trust without the need for any objection by any Person or further
notice to or action, order, or approval of the Bankruptcy Court, and any Claim
arising out of the rejection of the executory contract or unexpired lease
shall be deemed fully satisfied, released, and discharged, notwithstanding
anything in the Bankruptcy Schedules or a Proof of Claim to the contrary. All
Allowed Claims arising from the rejection of the Debtors executory contracts
and unexpired leases shall be classified as General Unsecured Claims for the
particular Debtor in question and shall be treated in accordance with the
particular provisions of this Plan for such Debtor; _provided_ _however_ , if
the Holder of an Allowed Claim for rejection damages has an unavoidable
security interest in any Collateral to secure obligations under such rejected
executory contract or unexpired lease, the Allowed Claim for rejection damages
shall be treated as an Other Secured Claim to the extent of the value of such
Holders interest in the Collateral, with the deficiency, if any, treated as a
General Unsecured Claim.

 



 

 **Section 10.07** ** ****Reservation of Rights**

 



 

Nothing contained in this Plan shall constitute an admission by the Debtors
that any such Desired 365 Contract is in fact an executory contract or
unexpired lease or that any Debtor has any liability thereunder. If there is a
dispute regarding whether a contract or lease is or was executory or unexpired
at the time of assumption or rejection, the Debtors, the Liquidating Trustee,
or the Reorganized Debtors, as applicable, shall have thirty (30) days
following entry of a Final Order resolving such dispute to alter and to
provide appropriate treatment of such contract or lease.

 



 

 **Section 10.08** ** ****Nonoccurrence of Effective Date**

 



 

In the event that the Effective Date does not occur, the Bankruptcy Court
shall retain jurisdiction with respect to any request by the Debtors to extend
the deadline for assuming or rejecting unexpired leases pursuant to Bankruptcy
Code § 365(d)(4).

 



 

 **ARTICLE XI**

 



 

 **PROCEDURES FOR RESOLVING DISPUTED, 
CONTINGENT, AND UNLIQUIDATED CLAIMS**

 



 

 **Section 11.01** ** ****Expunging of Certain**

 



 

All Claims marked or otherwise Scheduled as contingent, unliquidated or
disputed on the Bankruptcy Schedules and for which no Proof of Claim has been
timely filed, shall be deemed Disallowed Claims and such Claims shall be
expunged as of the Effective Date without the

 



      
 

 



 

necessity of filing a claim objection and without further notice to, or
action, order or approval of the Bankruptcy Court.

 



 

 **Section 11.02** ** ****Objections to Claims**

 



 

(a) **_Authority_**. The Debtors, the Reorganized Debtors, or the Liquidating
Trustee (as applicable) and the Pre-Petition Agents shall have the exclusive
authority to File objections to the Plan Carve Out Claims, and to withdraw any
objections to such Claims that they File. The Debtors, the Reorganized Debtors
or the Liquidating Trustee (as applicable) shall have the exclusive authority
to settle, compromise, or litigate to judgment any objections to Disputed Plan
Carve Out Claims, (i) if they have the prior written consent of Pre-Petition
Agents, (ii) if they have given detailed written notice of the proposed
settlement, compromise or litigation to the Pre-Petition Agents and the Pre-
Petition Agents have not objected thereto within five (5) Business Days after
receipt of such notice, or (iii) upon the order of the Bankruptcy Court after
the Pre-Petition Agents have had notice and an opportunity to object. The
Debtors, the Reorganized Debtors or the Liquidating Trustee, as applicable,
shall have the exclusive authority to File, settle, compromise, withdraw, or
litigate to judgment any objections to other Claims. Except as set forth
above, from and after the Effective Date, the Liquidating Trustee may settle
or compromise any Disputed Claim without approval of the Bankruptcy Court.
Except as set forth above, the Liquidating Trustee also shall have the right
to resolve any Disputed Claim outside the Bankruptcy Court under applicable
governing law.

 



 

(b) **_Objection Deadline_**. As soon as practicable, but no later than the
Claims Objection Deadline, the Liquidating Trustee or the Pre-Petition Agents
may File objections with the Bankruptcy Court and serve such objections on the
Creditors holding the Claims to which such objections are made. Nothing
contained herein, however, shall limit the right of the Liquidating Trustee or
the Pre-Petition Agents to object to Claims, if any, Filed or amended after
the Claims Objection Deadline. The Claims Objection Deadline may be extended
by the Bankruptcy Court upon motion by the applicable Debtor, Reorganized
Debtor or the Liquidating Trustee, as the case may be, or the Pre-Petition
Agents.

 



 

 **Section 11.03** ** ****Estimation of Claims**

 



 

The Liquidating Trustee may (after the Pre-Petition Agents prior written
consent in the case of Disputed Plan Carve Out Claims) at any time request
that the Bankruptcy Court estimate any such Disputed Claim pursuant to
Bankruptcy Code § 502(c), regardless of whether the Liquidating Trustee or any
Debtor, Reorganized Debtor or the Pre-Petition Agents have previously objected
to such Claim or whether the Bankruptcy Court has ruled on any objection, and
the Bankruptcy Court will retain jurisdiction to estimate any Claim at any
time during litigation concerning any objection to any Claim, including during
the pendency of any appeal related to any such objection. In the event the
Bankruptcy Court estimates any Disputed Claim, that estimated amount will
constitute the maximum limitation on such Claim, as determined by the
Bankruptcy Court and the Liquidating Trustee (and the Pre-Petition Agents in
the case of the Disputed Plan Carve Out Claims) may elect to pursue any
supplemental proceedings to object to any ultimate payment on such Claim. All
of the aforementioned objection, estimation and resolution procedures are
cumulative and are not necessarily exclusive of one another. Disputed Plan
Carve Out Claims may be estimated and thereafter resolved by any permitted
mechanism (i)

 



      
 

 



 

if it has the Pre-Petition Agents prior written consent, (ii) if the Pre-
Petition Agents have received a detailed written notice of the proposed
estimation and resolution and the Pre-Petition Agents have not objected
thereto within five (5) Business Days after receipt of such notice, or (iii)
upon the order of the Bankruptcy Court after the Pre-Petition Agents have had
notice and an opportunity to object. Other Claims may be estimated and
thereafter resolved as the Liquidating Trustee may deem appropriate.

 



 

 **Section 11.04** ** ****No Distributions Pending Allowance**

 



 

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, no payments or distributions
shall be made with respect to all or any portion of a Disputed Claim unless
and until all objections to such Disputed Claim have been settled or withdrawn
or have been determined by Final Order, and the Disputed Claim, or some
portion thereof, has become an Allowed Claim.

 



 

 **Section 11.05** ** ****Distributions After Allowance**

 



 

The Liquidating Trustee shall make payments and distributions from the
appropriate Distribution Reserve Account to each Holder of a Disputed Claim
that has become an Allowed Claim in accordance with the provisions of this
Plan governing the class of Claims to which such Holder belongs. As soon as
reasonably practicable after the date that the order or judgment of the
Bankruptcy Court allowing all or part of any Disputed Claim becomes a Final
Order, the Liquidating Trustee shall distribute to the Holder of such Claim
the distribution (if any) that would have been made to such Holder on the
Distribution Date had such Allowed Claim been allowed on the Distribution
Date. After a Disputed Claim is Allowed or otherwise resolved, the excess Cash
or other property that was reserved on account of such Disputed Claim, if any,
shall become a Liquidating Trust Asset for the benefit of other Allowed Claims
of the Class or Classes for which the distribution reserve was created.

 



 

 **Section 11.06** ** ****Reduction of Claims**

 



 

Notwithstanding the contents of the Bankruptcy Schedules or the Bankruptcy
SOFAs, Claims listed therein as undisputed, liquidated and not contingent
shall be reduced by the amount, if any, that was paid by the Debtors before
the Effective Date, including pursuant to orders of the Bankruptcy Court. To
the extent such payments are not reflected in the Bankruptcy Schedules or the
Bankruptcy SOFAs, such Bankruptcy Schedules and Bankruptcy SOFAs will be
deemed amended and reduced to reflect that such payments were made. Nothing in
this Plan shall preclude the Liquidating Trustee from paying Claims that the
Debtors were authorized to pay pursuant to any Final Order entered by the
Bankruptcy Court before the Effective Date.

 **ARTICLE XIII**

 



 

 **AMENDMENTS AND MODIFICATIONS**

 



 

The Debtors may alter, amend, or modify this Plan, the Plan Documents, or any
Exhibits thereto under Bankruptcy Code § 1127(a) at any time before the

Except for those Avoidance Actions and Causes of Action transferred to the
Liquidating Trust, pursuant to Bankruptcy Code § 363 and Bankruptcy Rule 9019,
and in consideration for the classification, distribution and other benefits
provided under this Plan, the provisions of this Plan shall constitute a good
faith compromise and settlement of all Claims, Interests and controversies
resolved pursuant to this Plan, including, without limitation, all Claims
arising before the Petition Date, whether known or unknown, foreseen or
unforeseen, asserted or unasserted, arising out of, relating to or in
connection with the business or affairs of, or

 



      
 

 



 

transactions with, the Debtors. The entry of the Confirmation Order shall
constitute the Bankruptcy Courts approval of each of the foregoing
compromises or settlements, and all other compromises and settlements provided
for in this Plan, and the Bankruptcy Courts findings shall constitute its
determination that such compromises and settlements are in the best interests
of the Debtors, the Estates, Creditors and other parties in interest, and are
fair, equitable and within the range of reasonableness.

 



 

 **Section 15.02** ** ****Satisfaction of Claims**

 



 

The rights afforded in this Plan and the treatment of all Claims and Interests
herein shall be in exchange for and in complete satisfaction, discharge, and
release of all Claims and Interests of any nature whatsoever against the
Debtors or any of their Estates, assets, properties, or interests in property.
Except as otherwise provided herein, on the Effective Date, all Claims against
and Interests in the Debtors shall be satisfied, discharged, and released in
full. None of the Debtors, the Reorganized Debtors or their Affiliates, shall
be responsible for any pre-Effective Date obligations of the Debtors or the
Reorganized Debtors, except those expressly assumed by the Debtors or the
Reorganized Debtors, as applicable. Except as otherwise provided herein, all
Persons and Entities shall be precluded and forever barred from asserting
against the Debtors and their Affiliates, their respective successors or
assigns, or their Estates, assets, properties, or interests in property any
event, occurrence, condition, thing, or other or further Claims or Causes of
Action based upon any act, omission, transaction, or other activity of any
kind or nature that occurred or came into existence before the Effective Date,
whether or not the facts of or legal bases therefore were known or existed
before the Effective Date.

 



 

 **Section 15.03** ** ****Discharge of Liabilities**

 



 

Pursuant to Bankruptcy Code §1141(d), and except as otherwise specifically
provided in this Plan, the Sale Order and/or the Confirmation Order, the
distributions, rights, and treatment that are provided in this Plan shall be
in complete satisfaction, discharge, and release, effective as of the
Effective Date, of all Claims, Interests, and Causes of Action of any nature
whatsoever, including any interest accrued on Claims or Interests from and
after the Petition Date, whether known or unknown, against, liabilities of,
Liens on, obligations of, rights against, and Interests in, the Debtors or any
of their assets or properties, regardless of whether any property shall have
been distributed or retained pursuant to this Plan on account of such Claims
and Interests, including demands, liabilities, and Causes of Action that arose
before the Effective Date, any liability (including withdrawal liability) to
the extent such Claims or Interests relate to services performed by employees
of the Debtors before the Effective Date and that arise from a termination of
employment or a termination of any employee or retiree benefit program,
regardless of whether such termination occurred before or after the Effective
Date, any contingent or non-contingent liability on account of representations
or warranties issued on or before the Effective Date, and all debts of the
kind specified in Bankruptcy Code §§ 502(g), 502(h), or 502(i), in each case
whether or not: (a) a Proof of Claim or Interest based upon such debt, right,
Claim, or Interest is Filed or deemed Filed pursuant to Bankruptcy Code §501;
(b) a Claim or Interest based upon such Claim, debt, right, or Interest is
Allowed pursuant to Bankruptcy Code §502; or (c) the Holder of such a Claim or
Interest has accepted this Plan. Subject to the terms of this Plan, the Sale
Order and/or the Confirmation Order, any default by the Debtors or their
Affiliates with respect to any Claim or Interest that existed immediately

 



      
 

 



 

before or on account of the Filing of the Chapter 11 Cases shall be deemed
satisfied on the Effective Date. Subject to the terms of this Plan, the Sale
Order and/or the Confirmation Order shall be a judicial determination of the
discharge of all Claims and Interests subject to the Effective Date occurring.
Subject to the terms of this Plan, the Sale Order and/or the Confirmation
Order shall be a judicial determination of discharge of all liabilities of the
Debtors, their Estates, the Reorganized Debtors and all successors thereto. As
provided in Bankruptcy Code §524, subject to the terms of this Plan, the Sale
Order and/or the Confirmation Order such discharge shall void any judgment
against the Debtors, their Estates, the Reorganized Debtors or any successors
thereto at any time obtained to the extent it relates to a Claim or Interest
discharged, and operates as an injunction against the prosecution of any
action against the Reorganized Debtors or their respective property and assets
to the extent it relates to a discharged Claim or Interest.

 



 

 **Section 15.04** ** ****Releases**

 



 

(a) **_Releases by Debtors and Estates_** **.** Except as otherwise expressly

Plan on account of such Allowed Claim or Interest (before such distribution is
made), any Claims, rights, and Causes of Action of any nature that such Debtor

Allowed Claim or Interest, to the extent such Claims, rights, or Causes of
Action against such Holder have not been otherwise compromised or settled on
or before the Effective Date (whether pursuant to this Plan or otherwise);
provided, however, that neither the failure to effect such a setoff nor the
allowance of any Claim or Interest

 



      
 

 



 

pursuant to this Plan shall constitute a waiver or release by such Debtor or
Reorganized Debtor of any such Claims, rights, and Causes of Action that such
Debtor may possess against such Holder. In no event shall any Holder of Claims
or Interests be entitled to setoff any Claim or Interest against any Claim,
right, or cause of action of the Debtors or Reorganized Debtors, as
applicable, unless such Holder has Filed a motion with the Bankruptcy Court
requesting the authority to perform such setoff on or before the Confirmation
Date, and notwithstanding any indication in any Proof of Claim or Interest or
otherwise that such Holder asserts, has, or intends to preserve any right of
setoff pursuant to Bankruptcy Code § 553 or otherwise.

Except as provided in this Plan, any Holder of a Claim or Interest shall not
be entitled to recoup any Claim or Interest against any Claim, right, or cause
of action of the Debtors or Reorganized Debtors, as applicable, unless such
Holder actually has performed such recoupment and provided notice thereof in
writing to the Debtors on or before the Confirmation Date, notwithstanding any
indication in any Proof of Claim or Interest or otherwise that such Holder
asserts, has, or intends to preserve any right of recoupment.

 



 

 **Section 15.09** ** ****Release of Liens**

 



 

Except as otherwise provided in this Plan or in any contract, instrument,

full of the portion of the Secured Claim that is Allowed as of the Effective
Date, all mortgages, deeds of trust, Liens, pledges, or other security
interests against any property of the Debtors Estates shall be fully released
and discharged, and all of the right, title, and interest of any Holder of
such mortgages, deeds of trust, Liens, pledges, or other security interests
shall revert to the applicable Debtor and its successors and assigns.

 



 

 **Section 15.10** ** ****Good Faith**

 



 

As of the Confirmation Date, the Debtors shall be deemed to have solicited
acceptance or rejections of this Plan in good faith and in compliance with the
applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.

 



 

 **Section 15.11** ** ****Rights of defendants and Avoidance Actions**

 



 

All rights, if any, of a defendant to assert a Claim arising from relief
granted in an Avoidance Action, together with the Liquidating Trustees right

such term or provision to make it valid or enforceable to the maximum extent
practicable, consistent with the original purpose of the term or provision
held to be invalid, void or unenforceable, and such term or provision shall
then be applicable as altered or interpreted. Notwithstanding any such
holding, alteration or interpretation, the remainder of the terms and
provisions of this Plan shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no
way be affected, impaired or invalidated by such holding, alteration or
interpretation. The Confirmation Order shall constitute a judicial
determination and shall provide that each term and provision of this Plan, as
it may have been altered or interpreted in accordance with the foregoing, is
valid and enforceable pursuant to its terms.

 ** _Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements_**

 



 

This Disclosure Statement contains forward-looking statements within the
meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Securities
Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ "). All statements other than
statements of historical facts included in this Disclosure Statement that
address activities, events or developments that the Debtors expect, project,
believe or anticipate will or may occur in the future are forward-looking
statements. These statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking
terminology, including "may," "believe," "anticipate," "estimate," "continue,"
"foresee," "project," "could," or other similar words. These forward-looking
statements may include, but are not limited to, references to procedures in
which the Debtors bankruptcy cases and the distribution of the Debtors
assets pursuant to the Plan, the Debtors financial projections and
liquidation analysis, and the Debtors future operating results. Forward-
looking statements are not guaranties of performance. Cano has based these
statements on Canos assumptions and analysis in light of Canos experience
and perception of historical trends, current conditions, expected future
developments and other factors Cano believes are appropriate in the
circumstances. No assurance can be given that these assumptions are accurate.
Moreover, these statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties.
Important factors that could cause the Debtors actual results to differ
materially from the expectations reflected in the Debtors forward-looking
statements include those described under 1(a) of Canos Form 10-K for the
fiscal year ended June 30, 2011, and any subsequently filed Form 10-Q or Form
10-K, any factors set forth in Canos other reports filed with the SEC, and
the following factors, among others:

 



 

* The ability of the Debtors to develop, prosecute, confirm, and consummate a plan of reorganization with respect to the Debtors bankruptcy cases;

 



 

* The ability of the Debtors to obtain Bankruptcy Court approval with respect to motions in the Debtors bankruptcy cases;

 



 

* Risk associated with litigation and other claims that involve the Debtors;

 



 



      
 

 



 

* Risk associated with the Debtors bankruptcy cases being converted to cases under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code; and

 



 

* The potential adverse impact of the Debtors bankruptcy cases on the Debtors liquidity.

 



 

Other factors that are unknown or unpredictable could also have a material
adverse effect on future results.

 



 

All subsequent written or oral forward-looking information attributable to the
Debtors or to persons acting on the Debtors behalf are expressly qualified in
their entirety by the foregoing. In light of these risks, uncertainties and
assumptions, the events anticipated by the Debtors forward-looking statements
may not occur, and you should not place any undue reliance on any of the
Debtors forward-looking statements. The Debtors forward-looking statements
speak only as of the date made and the Debtors undertake no obligation to
update or revise their forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new
information, future events or otherwise.

 



 

 ** _ARTICLE I_**

 



 

 ** _INTRODUCTION_**

 



 

 **Section 1.01** ** ****_Overview of Chapter 11_**

 



 

Chapter 11 is the principal business reorganization chapter of the Bankruptcy
Code. The commencement of a chapter 11 case creates an "estate" comprised of
all the legal and equitable interests of a debtor. Unless the bankruptcy court
orders otherwise, a chapter 11 debtor may continue to operate its business and
control the assets of its estate as a "debtor in possession."

 



 

The filing of a chapter 11 case also triggers the application of Bankruptcy
Code § 362, which provides for an automatic stay of all attempts to collect
upon claims against a debtor that arose before a bankruptcy filing. Generally
speaking, the automatic stay prohibits interference with a debtors property
or business.

 



 

Formulation and confirmation of a plan or reorganization is the principal
purpose of chapter 11 case. Unless a trustee is appointed, only the debtor may
file a plan of reorganization during the first 120 days of the chapter 11
case. A creditor or party in interest may file a plan only after that 120-day
exclusive period has expired or has terminated pursuant to a court order. If a
debtor files its plan within the 120 day period, it has an additional 60 days
to solicit acceptances of its plan. The bankruptcy court can reduce or enlarge
the solicitation and the exclusive periods for cause shown.

 



 

A plan of reorganization sets forth the means for satisfying all claims
against, and interests in, a debtor. Although usually referred to as a plan of
reorganization, a plan may provide for the liquidation of assets. Generally, a
claim against a debtor arises from a normal debtor/creditor transaction, such
as a promissory note or a trade credit relationship, but may also arise from
other contractual agreements or from alleged torts. An interest in a debtor is
held by a party that owns the debtor, such as a shareholder.

 



      
 

 



 

Subject to certain limited exceptions, the bankruptcy court order confirming a
plan of reorganization discharges a debtor from any debt that arose before the
date of confirmation of the plan and provides for the treatment of such debt
in accordance with the terms of the confirmed plan of reorganization.

 



 

Before soliciting acceptances of a plan of reorganization, Bankruptcy Code §
1125 requires a plan proponent to prepare a disclosure statement containing
information of a kind, and in sufficient detail, to enable a hypothetical
investor to make an informed judgment regarding acceptance of the plan of
reorganization. This Disclosure Statement is submitted in accordance with
Bankruptcy § 1125.

 



 

The Bankruptcy Code provides that creditors and shareholders are to be grouped
into "classes" under a plan and that they are to vote to accept or reject a
plan by class. As a general matter, creditors with similar legal rights are
placed together in the same class and equity holders with similar legal rights
are placed together in the same class. For example, creditors entitled to
similar priority under the Bankruptcy Code should commonly be grouped
together.

 



 

The Bankruptcy Code does not require that each claimant or equity holder vote
in favor of a plan in order for the court to confirm the plan. Rather, the
plan must be accepted by each class of claimants and shareholders (subject to
an exception discussed below). A class of claimants accepts the plan if, of
the claimants in the class who actually vote on the plan, such claimants
holding at least two-thirds in dollar amount and more than one-half in number
of allowed claims vote to accept the plan. For example, if a hypothetical
class has ten creditors that vote and the total dollar amount of those ten
creditors claim is $1,000,000, then for such class to have accepted the plan,
six or more of those creditors must have voted to accept the plan (a simple
majority) and the claims of the creditors voting to accept the plan must total
at least $666,667 (a two-thirds majority).

 



 

The Bankruptcy Court may confirm a plan even though fewer than all classes of
claims and equity interests vote to accept such plan. In such instance, the
plan must be accepted by at least one "impaired" class of claims, without
including any acceptance of the plan by an "insider." Bankruptcy Code § 1124
defines "impairment" and generally provides that a claim as to which legal,
equitable or contractual rights are altered under a plan is deemed to be
"impaired."

 



 

If all impaired classes of claims under the plan do not vote to accept the
plan and at least one impaired class of claims votes to accept the plan, a
debtor is entitled to request that the court confirm the plan pursuant to the
"cramdown" provisions of Bankruptcy Code § 1129(b). These "cramdown"
provisions permit the plan to be confirmed over the dissenting votes of
classes of claims or equity interests if the Bankruptcy Court determines that
the plan does not discriminate unfairly and is fair and equitable with respect
to each impaired, dissenting class of claims or equity interests.

 



 

Except to the extent that the holder of a particular claim has agreed to a
different treatment of such claim, the plan must provide that holders of
administrative and priority claims (other than tax claims) be paid in full in
cash on the effective date of the plan, and that holders of priority tax
claims receive on account of such claims deferred cash payments, over a period
not

 



      
 

 



 

exceeding five (5) years after the petition date, of a value, as of the
effective date of the plan, equal to the allowed amount of such claim
(Bankruptcy Code § 1129(a)(9)).

 



 

Independent of the acceptance of the plan as described above, to confirm a
plan the bankruptcy court must determine that the requirements of Bankruptcy
Code § 1129(a) have been satisfied.

 



 

 **Section 1.02** ** ****_The Debtors  Plan of Reorganization_**

 



 

The Debtors believe that the Plan satisfies the confirmation requirements of
the Bankruptcy Code. Confirmation of the Plan makes the Plan binding upon the
Debtors, the Reorganized Debtors, all holders of Claims and Interests, and
other parties-in-interest, irrespective of whether they have filed Proofs of
Claim or Interests and/or they have voted to accept or reject the Plan.

 



 

 **Section 1.03** ** ****_The Disclosure Statement_**

 



 

The Debtors are furnishing this Disclosure Statement (" _Disclosure Statement_
")(3) to the holders of Claims against and Interests in the Debtors pursuant
to Section 1125 of title 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the "

acceptance of the _Joint Plan of Reorganization_ (the " _Plan_ ")(4) dated
March 7, 2012, a copy of which is attached as **_Exhibit A_**. The Plan was
formulated after extensive negotiations with (i) the holders of the Senior
Secured Claims and (ii) holders of the UBE Junior Secured Claim. This

aspects of the Plan, including but not limited to, the treatment of holders of
Claims and Interests, the proposed transaction relating to the Debtors to be
effected pursuant to the Plan, significant events that the Debtors believe
will occur in these Chapter 11 Cases, and related matters.

 



 

The purpose of this Disclosure Statement is to provide "adequate information"
to Persons who hold Claims to enable them to make an informed decision before
exercising their right to vote to accept or reject the Plan. By order of the
Bankruptcy Court entered on , 2012 (the "
_Disclosure Statement Order_ "), this Disclosure Statement was approved and
held to contain adequate information. A true and correct copy of the

 **Section 1.09** ** ****_Voting Tabulation_**

 



 

Under the Bankruptcy Code, for purposes of determining whether the requisite
acceptances have been received, only Holders who are entitled to vote and
actually vote will be counted. The failure of a Holder to deliver a duly
executed Ballot will be deemed to constitute an abstention by such Holder with
respect to voting on the Plan and such abstentions will not be counted.

 



 

Unless otherwise ordered by the Bankruptcy Court, Ballots that are signed,
dated, and timely received, but on which a vote to accept or reject the Plan
has not been indicated, will not be counted. The Debtors, in their sole
discretion, may request that the Balloting Agent attempt to contact such
voters to cure any such defects in the Ballots.

 



 

Except as provided below, unless the applicable Ballot is timely submitted to
the Balloting Agent before the Voting Deadline, together with any other
documents required by such Ballot, the Debtors may, in their sole discretion,
reject such Ballot as invalid and decline to count such vote or to utilize it
in connection with seeking Confirmation of the Plan.

 



       
 

 



 

A vote may be disregarded if the Bankruptcy Court determines, pursuant to
Bankruptcy Code § 1126(e), that it was not solicited or procured in good faith
or in accordance with the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.

 



 

If a Ballot is signed by a trustee, executor, administrator, guardian,
attorney-in-fact, officer of a corporation, or another acting in a fiduciary
or representative capacity, such Person should indicate such capacity when
signing and, unless otherwise determined by the Debtors, must submit proper
evidence satisfactory to the Debtors of authority to so act.

 



 

The period during which Ballots with respect to the Plan will be accepted by
the Debtors will terminate on the Voting Deadline. Except to the extent
permitted by the Bankruptcy Court, Ballots that are received after the Voting
Deadline will not be counted or otherwise used by the Debtors in connection
with the Debtors request for Confirmation of the Plan (or any permitted
modification thereof). IN NO CASE SHOULD A BALLOT BE DELIVERED TO ANY ENTITY
OTHER THAN THE BALLOTING AGENT.

 



 

 **Section 1.10 _Agreements Upon Furnishing Ballots_**

 



 

The delivery of an accepting Ballot to the Balloting Agent by a Holder
pursuant to the procedures set forth above approved by the Bankruptcy Court,
will constitute the agreement of such Holder to accept (i) all of the terms
of, and conditions to, the solicitation and voting procedures; and (ii) the
terms of the Plan; _provided_ , _however_ , all parties-in-interest retain
their right to object to Confirmation of the Plan pursuant to Bankruptcy Code
§ 1128.

 



 

 **Section 1.11 _Recommendation of the Debtors to Approve Plan_**

 



 

The Debtors approved the solicitation of acceptances of the Plan and all of
the Transactions contemplated thereunder. In light of the benefits to be
attained by the Holders of Claims pursuant to consummation of the Transactions
contemplated under the Plan, the Debtors recommend that such Holders of Claims
vote to accept the Plan. The Debtors have reached this decision after
considering the alternatives to the Plan that are available to the Debtors and
the possible effect on the Debtors business operations. These alternatives
include liquidation under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code or reorganization
under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code with an alternative plan of
reorganization. The Debtors determined, after consulting with their financial
and legal advisors and the Pre-Petition Secured Lenders and/or such other
procedures that the Transactions contemplated in the Plan would likely result
in a distribution of greater value to creditors and shareholders than would a
liquidation under chapter 7.

 



 

THE DEBTORS AND THE PRE-PETITION SECURED LENDERS SUPPORT THE PLAN AND
RECOMMEND ALL HOLDERS OF CLAIMS WHOSE VOTES ARE BEING SOLICITED TO TIMELY
SUBMIT BALLOTS TO ACCEPT THE PLAN.

 ** _HISTORICAL BACKGROUND AND PRE-PETITION BUSINESS OPERATIONS_**

 



 

 **Section 2.01 _Overview of the Debtors  Business_**

potential by implementing various secondary and/or tertiary enhanced oil
recovery techniques. The Debtors hold leases covering approximately
gross acres ( net acres) of oil and gas property (including
approximately drilling locations), operate approximately
wells, and hold working interests in approximately wells. Their
assets are located in Texas, Oklahoma, and New Mexico.

 



 

Historical information concerning the Debtors is available as filed with the
United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") under
Sections 13(a), 13(c), 14, or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
(excluding any information furnished pursuant to Item 2.02 or Item 7.01 on any
Current Report on Form 8-K). Cano has not filed any reports with the SEC since
filing a Notification of Late Filing on Form 12b-25 on February 15, 2012. The
last Quarterly Report filed on Form 10-Q by Cano was filed for the quarter
ended December 30, 2011. The information contained in the SEC filings referred
to herein speaks only as to the date of the reports referenced herein or as of
another date specified in such reports.

 



 

All documents filed by Cano with the SEC may be accessed at www.sec.gov and at
Canos Case website, www.bmcgroup.com/cano. Pleadings and other documents
filed in the Chapter 11 Cases may also be obtained from the website maintained

(a) _Debtors  Customers_

 



 

Cano sells crude oil and natural gas production to multiple independent
purchasers pursuant to contracts generally terminable by either party upon 30
days prior written notice to the other party. During the year ended June 30,
2011, 10% or more of Canos total revenue or attributable to three customers
accounting for: 34% (the Laro Marketing Supply Co.), 24% (Coffeyville
Resources Refinery and Marketing, LLC), and 11% (Sunoco, Inc.) of total
operating revenue, respectively.

 



      
 

 



 

Title to the produced commodities transfers to the Purchaser at the time the
Purchaser collects or receives such commodities. Prices for such production
are defined in sales contracts and are readily determinable based on certain
publicly available indices. The purchasers of such production have
historically made payment for crude oil and natural gas purchases within 35
days of the end of each production month. Cano periodically reviews the
difference between the dates of the production and the dates the company
collects payment for such production to ensure that receivables from those
purchasers are collectible. The point of sale for Canos oil and natural gas
production is the title transfer point in Canos field gathering systems.

 



 

In the event that one or more of these significant purchasers ceases doing
business with Cano, Cano believes that there are potential alternative
purchasers with whom it can establish new relationships and those
relationships will result in the replacement of one or more loss purchasers.
Cano would not expect the loss of any single purchaser to have a material
adverse affect on its operations. The loss of a single purchaser, however,
could potentially reduce the competion for Canos crude oil and natural gas
production, which could negatively affect the prices Cano receives.

 



 

(b) _Competition_

 



 

Cano faces competition from other oil and natural gas companies in all
respects of its business, including in the acquisition of producing properties
and oil and natural gas leases, and in obtaining goods, services, and labor.
Many of Canos competitors have substantially greater financial and other
resources than Cano does. Factors that affect Canos ability to acquire
producing properties include available funds, available information about the
property, and Canos standards established for minimum projected return on
investment.

 



 

 **Section 2.02 _Debtors  Corporate Structure_**

 



 

Cano was organized as a Delaware corporation in May 2003 under the name of
Huron Ventures, Inc. (" _Huron_ "), and changed its name to Cano in May of
2004. Cano is the surviving corporation of a merger transaction between Huron,
Davenport Field Unit Inc. and other entities, that was effective in May of
2004.

 



 

Cano is the parent company to (i) Cano Petro of New Mexico (" _Cano New
Mexico_ "), a Texas corporation; (ii) Ladder Companies, Inc. (" _Ladder_ "), a
Delaware corporation; (iii) Square One Energy, Inc. (" _Square One_ "), a
Texas corporation; (iv) Tri-Flow, Inc. (" _Tri-Flow_ "), an Oklahoma
corporation; (v) W.O. Energy of Nevada, Inc. (" _W.O. Nevada_ "), a Nevada
corporation; (vi) WO Energy, Inc. (" _WO Energy_ "), a Texas corporation;
(viii) W.O. Operating Company, Ltd. (" _W.O. Operating_ "), a Texas limited
partnership; and (ix) W.O. Production Company, Ltd. (" _W.O. Production_ "), a
Texas limited partnership.

 



 

 **Section 2.03 _Debtors  Existing Capital Structure_**

 



 

(a) _Cano Common Stock_. As of February 21, 2012, Cano had 47,057,992 shares
of common stock outstanding, with a par value of $0.0001 per share and there
were 99 holders of record of Cano common stock as of that date. Before January
17, 2012, Canos common stock was publicly traded on NYSE Amex (the "
_Exchange_ ") under the trading symbol "CFW." On December 21, 2011, Cano
notified the Exchange of its intention to file a Form 25, which it filed

 



      
 

 



 

on January 4, 2012, to delist the common stock. As a result of the Form 25
filing, the Cano common stock ceased trading on NYSE Amex on January 17, 2012
and Cano will cease to have securities registered under Section 12 of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on April 3, 2012. Canos common stock is
currently trading in the OTCQB marketplace, operated by OTC Markets Group
under the symbol "CANO".

 



 

(b) _Cano Preferred Stock._ On September 6, 2006, Cano sold $49.1 million of
Series D Convertible Preferred Stock to investors with a 7.875% dividend of
cash or PIK distribution option. The Certificate of Designations, Preferences
and Rights of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock (the "Certificate of
Designations") required Cano to redeem its outstanding shares of Preferred
Stock on September 6, 2011. This obligation has been outstanding as of
September 6, 2011, for a redemption amount in cash equal to the stated value
of the Preferred Stock, plus accrued dividends and PIK dividends. As of
September 30, 2011, Cano had 23,849 shares of Preferred Stock, no par value
per share outstanding and unpaid cumulative dividends on the Preferred Stock
of $5.8 million. The subordination provisions of the Certificate of
Designations prohibit Cano from redeeming the Preferred Stock while Cano is in
default under the Senior Credit Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 2.04 _Debtors  Board Members and Management_**

 



 

The current members of Canos board of directors are James R. Latimer, III,
Donald Niemiec, and Garrett Smith.

 



 

The current senior management group of Cano includes James R. Latimer,
President and Chief Executive Officer; John Homier as Chief Financial Officer.

 



 

 **Section 2.05 _Debtors  Employees_**

 



 

The Debtors workforce, which at one time consisted of approximately 50
employees now consists of only 26 field employees. All workers at the
executive corporate level are contractors. In of 2012, the Debtors
top management was replaced with new management which is committed to
maximizing the value of the Debtors assets for the benefit of the estates and
their creditors.

 



 

 **Section 2.06 _Events Leading to Chapter 11_**

 



 

The Debtors oil and gas business depends heavily on the availability of
capital and liquidity. Substantial capital expenditures are needed for the
exploitation and development of crude oil and natural gas reserves. The
downturn in the economy, the credit crisis, and the Debtors current liquidity
constraints have all negatively impacted the Debtors business and their
ability to meet their obligations to the Pre-Petition Secured Lenders and
trade creditors. As of September 30, 2011, the Debtors reported total assets
of approximately $63.4 million and total liabilities of approximately $116.3
million on their unaudited and unreviewed consolidated balance sheets.

 



 

Before the Petition Date, the Debtors actively pursued strategic alternatives
to position the Debtors for a sale or similar business combination
transaction. The Debtors declining revenues, continued losses, borrowing
constraints, loan defaults and limited to no capital

 



      
 

 



 

availability forced the Debtors to drastically reduce costs, replace
management and hire financial advisors to assist in a strategic process.
Factors contributing to the Debtors financial difficulties before the
Petition Date included iniatives to successfully recapitalize did not
materialize such as the terminated merger with a third party on July 20, 2011,
development and production targets were not reached, the costs of operations
were greater than anticipated, and the lack of return on investment resulted
in a decrease in cash flow which led to the inability of the Debtors to
service their debt obligations. Due to the current economic environment, the
Debtors have been unable to raise cash or to identify capital resources from
other sources such as bank funding, private investment, or the public debt and
equity markets. The combination of these factors have impaired the Debtors
liquidity and compelled the Debtors to commence the Chapter 11 Cases to
maximize the value of their assets for the benefit of their creditors and
other constituencies.

 



 

 **Section 2.07 _Reorganization Strategy_**

 



 

To facilitate its goal of maximizing the value of its assets, the Debtors and
the Pre-Petition Secured Lenders have been discussing restructuring
alternatives for the Debtors business. These efforts have resulted in the
parties signing a _Plan Support and Lock-Up Agreement_ dated March 7, 2012 in
which the Debtors and their Pre-Petition Secured Lenders seek to enhance the
value of the Debtors assets by seeking approval of the sale of the Debtors
Assets and/or Interests and to implement the sale through a consensual plan of
reorganization.

 



 

The Debtors (with the consent of the Pre-Petition Agents) entered into that
certain _Stock Purchase Agreement_ (the " _Stalking Horse SPA_ ")(5) with NBI
Services, Inc. (the " _Stalking Horse_ ") dated March 7, 2012 in which Cano
agreed to sell and the Stalking Horse agreed to purchase and acquire all of
the newly-issued and outstanding capital stock of Cano for a base purchase
price of $47.5 million, subject to adjustment as provided in the Stalking
Horse SPA, and in accordance with the Bid Procedures Order, and the Sale Order
and/or Confirmation Order.

 **Section 3.06 _Preferences, Fraudulent Transfers and Other Avoidance
Actions_**

 



 

Under Bankruptcy Code § 547, a debtors bankruptcy estate may recover certain
preferential transfers of property, including cash, made insolvent during the
90 days immediately before the filing of its bankruptcy petition with respect
to pre-exiting debts, to the extent the transferee receive more than it would
have in respect of the preexisting debt had the debtor been liquidated under
chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. In the case of "insiders," the Bankruptcy
Code provides for one (1) year preference period.

 



 

Certain defenses can be made to preference recoveries. Transfers made in the
ordinary course of the debtors and transferees business according the
ordinary business terms in respect of debts less than 90 days before the
filing of a bankruptcy case are not recoverable. Additionally, if the
transferees extended credit subsequent to the transfer (and before the
commencement of the bankruptcy case), such extension of credit may constitute
a defense to recovery, to the extent of any new value, against an otherwise
recoverable transfer of property. If a transfer is recovered by the estate,
the transferee has an unsecured claim against the debtor to the extent of the
recovery.

 



 

Under Bankruptcy Code § 547 and various state laws, a debtor may recover
certain pre-petition transfers of property including the grant of a security
interest in property, made while insolvent to the extent that the debtor
receives less than fair value for such property. Additionally, avoidance
actions exists under sections 544, 545, 549 and 553(b) of the Bankruptcy Code
that allow a debtor to avoid and/or recover certain property.

 



 

The Bankruptcy Code preserves the Debtors rights to prosecute claims and
causes of action that exist outside of bankruptcy, and also empowers the
Debtors to prosecute certain claims that are established by the Bankruptcy
Code, including claims to avoid and recover preferential transfers, and
fraudulent conveyances.

 



 

Under the Plan, all of the Debtors rights in respect of all Avoidance Actions
are preserved and are transferred to the Liquidating Trustee. As such, the
Liquidating Trustee, as a representative of the Estates, will have the
authority to investigate, prosecute, collect, and/or settle the Avoidance
Actions in accordance with Bankruptcy Code § 1123(b)(3).

 



 

To date, the Debtors have not identified and/or investigated any potential
Avoidance Actions.

 



 

 **IN REVIEWING THIS DISCLOSURE STATEMENT AND THE PLAN, AND IN DETERMINING
WHETHER TO VOTE IN FAVOR OR AGAINST THE PLAN, HOLDERS OF CLAIMS (INCLUDING
PARTIES THAT RECEIVED PAYMENTS FROM THE DEBTORS WITHIN NINETY (90) DAYS BEFORE
THE PETITION DATE)**

 



      
 

 



 

 **SHOULD CONSIDER THAT A CAUSE OF ACTION MAY EXIST AGAINST THEM, THAT THE
PLAN PRESERVES ALL CAUSES OF ACTION, AND THAT THE PLAN AUTHORIZES THE
LIQUIDATING TRUSTEE TO PROSECUTE SUCH CLAIMS.**

Debtors have submitted an interim cash collateral order wherein the Debtors
are authorized, and the Pre-Petition Lenders agree to the Debtors use of cash
collateral in accordance with a pre-negotiated budget. In exchange for the
Pre-Petition Lenders consensual use of cash collateral, the Debtors have
agreed to provide the Pre-Petition Lenders with adequate protection including,

or Better Offers; (D) Approve the Form and Manner of Notice; (E) Approve
Procedures for Determining Cure Amounts for Executory Contracts and Unexpired
Leases; and (F) Grant Related Relief_ __ (the " _Bid Procedures Motion_ "),
which seeks Bankruptcy Court approval of a process under which the Debtors
will seek competing bids for the sale of their Equity Interests or the
Debtors Assets. Specifically, the Bid procedures contemplate the following:

 



 

* Notice of Auction and Sale Hearing (the " _Sale Notice_ ") will be (i) served on certain parties within five (5) business days after entry of the Bid Procedures Order; and (ii) published in the national edition of The Wall Street Journal within ten (10) business days after the entry of the Bid Procedures Order.

Horse SPA. To entice NBI to act as the stalking horse, the Debtors have sought
bankruptcy approval of certain buyer protections, including the

 



      
 

 



 

payment of a break up fee of $1,475,000 if certain conditions set forth in the
Stalking Horse SPA and the Bid procedures Order are met.

LLP as their general bankruptcy and restructuring counsel and (b) BMC Group as
their noticing, soliciting, and balloting agent.

 



 

 **Section 4.07** ** ****_Retention of Chief Restructuring Officer_**

 



 

The Debtors have filed applications to retain Blackhill Partners, LLC to
provide the services of James R. Latimer III to serve as the Debtors Chief
Restructuring Officer.

 



 

 **Section 4.08** ** ****_Administrative Expense Claim Estimate_**

 



 

As of the Petition Date, the Debtors estimate that on the Effective Date, the
total amount of Allowed Administrative Claims will be $
. The Debtors further estimate that approximately $ of
the total amount of Allowed Administrative Claims will consist of unpaid
Professional Fees and the remaining $ will
constitute unpaid ordinary course accounts payable.

 



 

 **Section 4.09** ** ****_Schedules and SOFAs_**

 



 

On the Petition Date, each of the Debtors filed their Bankruptcy Schedules and
SOFAs.

 



 

 **Section 4.10** ** ****_Preference Analysis and Other Potential Avoidance

The Bankruptcy Code preserves the Debtors rights to prosecute claims and
causes of action that exist outside of bankruptcy, and also empowers the
Debtors to prosecute certain claims that are established by the Bankruptcy
Code, including claims to avoid and recover preferential transfers, and
fraudulent conveyances. Under the Plan, all of the Debtors rights in respect
of all Avoidance Actions are preserved and are transferred to the Liquidating
Trustee. As such, the Liquidating Trustee, as a representative of the Estates,
will have the authority to investigate, prosecute, collect, and/or settle the
Avoidance Actions in accordance with Bankruptcy Code § 1123(b)(3).

 



      
 

 



 

To date, the Debtors have not identified and/or investigated any potential
Avoidance Actions. The Debtors anticipate filing a Plan Supplement identifying
Avoidance Actions.

 



 

 **IN REVIEWING THIS DISCLOSURE STATEMENT AND THE PLAN, AND IN DETERMINING
WHETHER TO VOTE IN FAVOR OR AGAINST THE PLAN, HOLDERS OF CLAIMS AND INTERESTS
(INCLUDING PARTIES THAT RECEIVED PAYMENTS FROM THE DEBTORS WITHIN NINETY (90)
DAYS BEFORE THE PETITION DATE) SHOULD CONSIDER THAT A CAUSE OF ACTION MAY
EXIST AGAINST THEM, THAT THE PLAN PRESERVES ALL CAUSES OF ACTION, AND THAT THE
PLAN AUTHORIZES THE LIQUIDATING TRUSTEE TO PROSECUTE THE SAME.**

 



 

 **Section 4.11** ** ****_Deemed Consolidation of Debtors for Plan Purposes
Only_**

 



 

Subject to the occurrence of the Effective Date, the Debtors shall be deemed
consolidated under the Plan solely for the limited purposes of distribution
under the Plan. Each and every Claim filed or to be filed against any of the
Debtors shall be deemed filed against the deemed consolidated Debtors and
shall be deemed one Claim against all Debtors and (a) all Claims of each
Debtor against any other Debtor will be eliminated and released; (b) any
obligation of any Debtor and all guarantees thereof executed by one or more of
the Debtors shall be deemed to be one obligation of all of the consolidated
Debtors; (c) any Claims filed or to be filed in connection with any such
obligation and such guarantees shall be deemed one Claim against the
consolidated Debtors; (d) all duplicative Claims (identical in amount and
subject matter) filed against one or more of the Debtors will be automatically
expunged so that only one Claim survives against the consolidated Debtors; and
(e) the consolidated Debtors will be deemed, for purposes of determining the
availability of the right of set-off under section 553 of the Bankruptcy Code,
to be one entity, so that, subject to other provisions of Bankrupcy Code §
553, the debts due to a particular Debtor may be offset against the Claims
against such Debtor or Debtors.

 



 

Such deemed consolidation, however, shall not (other than for purposes related
to funding distributions under the Plan and as set forth above in this
Section) affect: (a) the legal and organizational structure of the Reorganized
Debtors; (b) pre- and post-Petition Date guaranties, liens, and security
interests that are required to be maintained (i) in connection with executory
contracts or unexpired leases that were entered into during the Chapter 11
Cases or that have been or will be assumed; (ii) pursuant to the Plan; or
(iii) in connection with any financing entered into, or New Interests issued,
by the Reorganized Debtors on the Effective Date; and (iv) distributions out
of any insurance policies or proceeds of such policies.

 



 

 **Section 4.12** ** ****_Exclusivity_**

 



 

The Debtors have the exclusive right to file a plan of reorganization in the
Chapter 11 Cases until and the exclusive right to solicit acceptances
until . Although a possibility always exists that Confirmation of the
Plan will not occur, at this time, the Debtors do not contemplate the need to
extend these dates.

 



      
 

 



 

 ** _ARTICLE V_**

 



 

 ** _SUMMARY OF THE DEBTORS  PLAN OF REORGANIZATION_**

 



 

 **Section 5.01** ** ****_General Structure of the Plan_**

 



 

The primary purpose of the Plan is to facilitate the restructuring of the
Debtors pursuant to the Purchase and Sale Agreement. The Debtors have
determined in the exercise of their business judgment that the effectuation of
the Purchase and Sale Agreement is the best course of action given the
Debtors financial constraints. A reorganization strategy other than a sale,
is not possible given the position taken by various creditors of the Debtors,
the lack of availability in the credit markets, and the Debtors inability to
sustain operations given their current cash balances. The Plan is structured
to enable the Debtors to facilitate a flexible Transaction which is expressly
subject to a process to solicit higher or better offers for the Debtors
Assets and Equity Interests. Additionally, the Plan contemplates the creation
of a Liquidating Trust to liquidate certain Liquidating Trust Assets and
distribute any remaining funds (after the payment of Allowed Plan Carve Out
Claims), in accordance with the Plan. Under the Plan, Claims against the
Debtors Estates and Interests in the Debtors are classified, treated,
entitled to vote as follows:

 



 

 **Section 5.02** ** ****_Classification of Claims and Interests_**

 



 

All Claims and Interests, except for Administrative Claims and Priority Tax
Claims, are placed in the Classes as set forth below. In accordance with
Bankruptcy Code § 1123(a)(1), Administrative Claims, and Priority Tax Claims
of the kinds specified in Section 507(a)(1) and 507(a)(8) of the Bankruptcy
Code have not been classified.

 



 

The categories of Claims and Interests set forth in the Plan classify Claims
and Interests for all purposes, including for purposes of voting,
confirmation, and distribution pursuant to the Plan and Bankruptcy Code §§
1122 and 1123(a)(l). A Claim or Interest shall be deemed classified in a
particular Class only to the extent that it qualifies within the description
of such Class, and shall be deemed classified in other Classes to the extent
that any portion of such Claim or Interest qualifies within the description of
such other Classes. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Plan, a
Claim or Interest shall be deemed classified in a Class only to the extent
that such Claim or Interest has not been paid, released, or otherwise settled
before the Effective Date.

 



 

Under the Plan, Claims and Interests are classified as follows:

 **Section 5.03** ** ****_Summary of Proposed Distributions Under the Plan_**

 



 

Certain Claims, including Administrative Expense Claims and Priority Tax
Claims, are not classified under the Plan and are not entitled to vote on the
Plan and are, therefore, treated as follows:

 



 

Each Holder of an Allowed Administrative Claim shall, in full satisfaction,
release, settlement, and discharge of such Allowed Administrative Claim: (a)
to the extent such claim is due and owing on the Effective Date, be paid in
full, in Cash, on the Effective Date; (b) to the extent such claim is not due
and owing on the Effective Date, be paid in full, in Cash, (i) in accordance
with the terms of any agreement among the Liquidating Trustee, the Pre-
Petition Agents and such Holder, or (ii) when such claim becomes due and
payable under applicable non-bankruptcy law, or (iii) in the ordinary course
of business; or (c) receive such other treatment as to which such Holder may
agree with the Liquidating Trustee and the Pre-Petition Agents. Cash payments
of Allowed Administrative Claims shall be paid from the Claims Reserve, or if
the Claims Reserve is insufficient to pay all Allowed Administrative Claims,
any shortfall shall be paid from the Gift Reserve or from the Avoidance
Actions Proceeds Reserve.

 



 

Each Holder of an Allowed Priority Tax Claim shall, in full satisfaction,
release, and discharge thereof, receive (i) such treatment as to which such
Holder may agree with the Liquidating Trustee, and the Pre-Petition Agents or
(ii) at the sole option of the Liquidating Trustee, (a) payment in full, in
Cash, of such Allowed Priority Tax Claim on the Effective Date; or (b)
treatment in accordance with Bankruptcy Code §§ 1129(a)(9)(C) or
1129(a)(9)(D), as the case may be, with the Liquidating Trustees selection of
(a) or (b) being subject to the prior written approval of Pre-Petition Agents.
Cash payments of Allowed Priority Tax Claims shall be paid from the Claims
Reserve, or if the Claims Reserve is insufficient to pay all Allowed Priority
Tax Claims, any shortfall shall be paid from the Gift Reserve or from the
Avoidance Actions Proceeds Reserve.

 ** _ARTICLE VII_**

 



 

 ** _PLAN EXECUTION AND IMPLEMENTATION_**

 



 

 **Section 7.01** ** ****_Sale of the Acquired Property_**

 



 

The Plan contemplates the sale of the Acquired Property to a third party. To
effect this, the Debtors Filed the Bid Procedures and Sale Motion which seeks,
inter alia, to approve the Stalking Horse SPA and to establish the Auction. On
March 2012, the Bankruptcy Court entered the Bid Procedures Order,
which established [ ] as the deadline for
Potential Bidders to submit bids for the Acquired Property, and established [
], 2012 as the date for the Auction. In connection with the Auction, the
Debtors have identified the Stalking Horse as a potential purchaser for the
Equity Interests. If no timely Qualifying Bid (as defined in the Bid
Procedures) (other than the Stalking Horse bid) is received by the Bid
Deadline (as defined in the Bid Procedures), the Debtors shall not hold an
Auction and instead shall request at the Sale Hearing that the Bankruptcy
Court approve the Stalking Horse SPA as the Purchase and Sale Agreement and
declare the Stalking Horse to be the Successful Bidder/Bid. If additional
Qualified Bidders are identified, at the conclusion of the Auction, the
Debtors, with the consent of the Pre-Petition Agents, will seek Bankruptcy
Court approval to sell the Acquired Property pursuant to the Purchase and Sale
Agreement to the Successful Bidder, Free and Clear. The Sale Order and/or the
Confirmation Order shall contain specific authority for the Debtors to comply
with the Purchase and Sale Agreement as set forth above.

 



 

 **Section 7.02** ** ****_Means for Implementation_**

 



 

(a) _Application of PSA Sale Proceeds_.

 



 

(i) _Claims Reserve Funding_. Contemporaneously with the Closing, the
Effective Date and the delivery of the PSA Sale Proceeds to the Pre-Petition
Senior Secured Agent described below, the Debtors will transfer from their
Available Cash

 



      
 

 



 

(other than Retained Funds) an amount sufficient to fund the Claims Reserve
for the benefit of the Holders of Allowed Plan Carve Out Claims (and, to the
extent of any surplus from such reserve after the payment of such Allowed
Claims, for the benefit of the Holders of Senior Secured Claims and the UBE
Junior Secured Claim) to the Liquidating Trust. If the amount of the Debtors
Available Cash at the time of the Closing is insufficient to fund the Claims
Reserve in full, then the Purchaser shall transfer a portion of the PSA Sale
Proceeds (in an amount equal to such insufficiency) to the Liquidating Trust
(rather than being transferred to the Pre-Petition Senior Secured Agent as
described below) to complete the funding of the Claims Reserve.

 



 

(ii) _Liquidating Trust Funding. _If there is additional Available Cash after
the Claims Reserve is funded, then the Debtors will transfer an amount
sufficient to fund the Liquidating Trust Expense Reserve in full from their
Available Cash (other than Retained Funds) to the Liquidating Trust. If the
amount of the Debtors Available Cash after funding the Claims Reserve is less
than the Liquidating Trust Expense Reserve, the Purchaser shall transfer a
portion of the PSA Sale Proceeds equal to the shortfall to the Liquidating
Trust (rather than being transferred to the Pre-Petition Senior Secured Agent
as described below) to fund the Liquidating Trust Expense Reserve.

 



 

(iii) _Payment of Senior Secured Claims and UBE Junior Secured Claim_.
Contemporaneously with and as part of the Closing and the Effective Date, the

Purchase and Sale Agreement or Bid Procedures) and any subsequent adjustments
or payments received from the Purchaser pursuant to the Purchase and Sale
Agreement or the Sale Order, less (i) the Gifted Amount; (ii) any portion of
the PSA Sale Proceeds transferred by the Purchaser to the Liquidating Trust to
fund the Claims Reserve for a shortfall in the Debtors Available Cash
described above; and (iii) any portion of the PSA Sale Proceeds transferred by
the Purchaser to the Liquidating Trust to fund the Liquidating Trust Expense
Reserve for a shortfall in the Debtors Available Cash described above. In the
event that the Allowed Senior Secured Claims are paid in full, excess amounts
of the PSA Sale Proceeds shall be transferred to UBE on account of the UBE
Junior Secured Claim.

 



 

(iv) _Gift Reserve Funding_. The Purchaser, on behalf of the Pre-Petition
Secured Lenders, shall transfer and/or gift a portion of the PSA Sale Proceeds
equal to the Gifted Amount to the Liquidating Trust to fund the Gift Reserve
for the benefit of the Holders of Allowed General Unsecured Claims in Classes
A6, B6, D6, E3, F6, G6, H6, and I6.

 



 

(b) _Available Cash_. After the Claims Reserve and Liquidating Trust Expense
Reserve are funded, any remaining Available Cash (other than Retained Funds)

applicable, for the benefit of the Senior Secured Claims and the UBE Junior
Secured Claim, as applicable.

 



 

(c) _Other Assets_. ** **Any Other Assets (excluding Avoidance Actions), shall
revest or vest in the appropriate Reorganized Debtor and shall be transferred
to the Liquidating Trust for the benefit of the Holders of Senior Secured
Claims and the UBE Junior Secured Claim. Except

 



      
 

 



 

as otherwise provided in the Purchase and Sale Agreement, any assets received
by the Liquidating Trust after the Effective Date of the Plan (other than the
proceeds of Avoidance Actions) shall also be Other Assets and transferred to
the Liquidating Trust for the benefit of the Holders of Senior Secured Claims
and the UBE Junior Secured Claim.

 



 

(d) _Avoidance Actions_. ** **All Avoidance Actions are transferred to the
Liquidating Trust for the benefit of the Holders of Allowed General Unsecured
Claims in Classes A6, B6, C6, D6, E3, F6, G6, H6, and I6.

applicable Debtor (or Reorganized Debtor) any Collateral or other property of
any Debtor (or Reorganized Debtor) held by such Holder, and any termination
statements, instruments of satisfactions, or releases of all security

shall be terminated and extinguished and the certificates that previously

law, rule or regulation pursuant to Bankruptcy Code § 1145 or other applicable
law requiring registration before the offering, issuance, distribution or sale

qualify for an exemption under Bankruptcy Code § 1145, the New Interests shall
be issued in a manner, which qualifies for any other available exemption from
registration, whether as a private placement under Rule 506 of the Securities
Act, Section 4(2) of the Securities Act, and/or the safe harbor provisions
promulgated thereunder.

 



 

(n) _Authorization for Transaction_. ** **On the Effective Date or as soon as

liquidation of General Unsecured Claims and/or Avoidance Actions shall be paid
by the Liquidating Trust solely from the Liquidating Trust Expense Reserve and
amounts otherwise distributable to Holders of Allowed General Unsecured

expenses of the Liquidating Trustees retained professionals and other costs,
expenses and liabilities of the Liquidating Trust, the Liquidating Trustee
shall provide written notice thereof to the Pre-Petition Agents in such detail
and with such support as the Pre-Petition Agents may reasonably request. If

five (5) Business Days after receipt of such notice, the Liquidating Trustee
may make such payments. If any Pre-Petition Agents objects and the objecting
Pre-Petition Agent(s) and the Liquidating Trustee cannot agree on the

such payment unless he or she obtains an order from the Bankruptcy Court
approving such payment.

All costs, expenses and obligations incurred by the Liquidating Trustee in
administering this Plan and the Liquidating Trust, or in any manner connected,
incidental or related thereto shall come from amounts distributable to the
appropriate beneficiaries for whose benefit such expenses or obligations were
incurred. For example, reasonable costs incurred in resolving Avoidance
Actions and General Unsecured Claims shall be paid first from the Liquidating
Trust Expense Reserve and then from amounts otherwise distributable to Holders
of Allowed General Unsecured Claims, and expenses incurred in monetizing Other
Assets shall be paid first from the Liquidating Trust Expense Reserve and then

withholding is required, the Liquidating Trustee shall file such information
return with the Internal Revenue Service and provide any required statements
in connection therewith to the recipients of such distribution or effect any

respect to any Person from whom a tax identification number, certified tax
identification number or other tax information required by law has not been
received by the Liquidating Trustee within thirty (30) days from the date of
such request (the " _Initial Request_ "), the Liquidating Trustee may, at
his/her option, withhold the amount required to such Person and decline to
make such distribution until the information is received. Failure of any
Person to provide the information requested within six months of the Initial
Request shall result in the forfeit of the affected distribution and the
treatment of said distribution as Unclaimed Property.

 



 

 **Section 9.06 _De Minimis Distributions_**

 



 

No Cash payment of less than twenty-five ($25.00) dollars shall be made to the
Holder of any Claim on account of its Allowed Claim.

 



 

 **Section 9.07 _Setoffs_**

 



 

Except for any Claim that is Allowed in an amount set forth in the Plan
(including the Union Senior Secured Claim, the Natixis Hedge Claim, and the
UBE Junior Secured Claim), the Debtors or the Liquidating Trustee may, but
shall not be required to, set off against any Claims and the payments or
distributions to be made pursuant to the Plan in respect of such Claims, any
and all debts, liabilities and claims of every type and nature whatsoever that
the Estate or a Debtor may have against the Holder of any Claim, but neither
the failure to do so nor the Allowance of any such Claims, whether pursuant to
the Plan or otherwise, shall constitute a waiver or release by any Debtor of
any such claims the Debtor may have against such Holder of any Claim, and all
such claims shall be reserved for and retained by the Liquidating Trustee.

 



 

 **Section 9.08 _Distribution Record Date_**

 



 

As of the close of business on the fifth (5th) Business Day following the
Effective Date (the " _Distribution Record Date_ "), all transfer ledgers,
transfer books, registers and any other records maintained by the designated
transfer agents with respect to ownership of any Claims will be closed and,
for purposes of the Plan, there shall be no further changes in the record
holders of such Claims. The Liquidating Trustee shall have no obligation to
recognize the transfer of any Claims occurring after the Distribution Record
Date, and will be entitled for all purposes to recognize and deal only with
the Holder of any Claim as of the close of business on the Distribution Record
Date, as reflected on such ledgers, books, registers or records.

 



      
 

 



 

 ** _ARTICLE X_**

 



 

 ** _EXECUTORY CONTRACTS, UNEXPIRED LEASES, AND OTHER AGREEMENTS_**

 



 

 **Section 10.01 _Assumption/Rejection_**

 



 

On the Effective Date, and to the extent permitted by applicable law, all of
the Debtors executory contracts and unexpired leases will be rejected unless
such executory contract or unexpired lease: (a) is a Desired 365 Contract and
being assumed pursuant to the Plan; (b) is the subject of a motion to assume
Filed on or before the Confirmation Date; or (c) has been previously rejected
or assumed.

 



 

 **Section 10.02 _Cure Amounts_**

 



 

The Bid Procedures and Sale Motion contemplates that Desired 365 Contracts
will be assumed by the Debtors and/or assigned to the Purchaser pursuant to
the Sale Order and/or the Confirmation Order. In accordance with the Bid
Procedures, as part of the Plan Supplement, the Debtors will file a list of
the Desired 365 Contracts along with the proposed Cure Costs. Any party taking
exception to the proposed Cure Costs shall, in accordance with the Bid
Procedures Order, File a detailed statement setting forth its reason and the
Bankruptcy Court shall determine the proper amount of the Cure Costs at the
Combined Hearing. The fixing of the Cure Costs shall constitute the Debtors
right to assign the Desired 365 Contract lease to the Purchaser under
Bankruptcy Code §§ 365(c) and (f).

 



 

 **Section 10.03 _Assumed Executory Contracts and Unexpired Leases_**

 



 

Each Desired 365 Contract will include (a) all amendments, modifications,
supplements, restatements, or other agreements made directly or indirectly by
any agreement, instrument, or other document that in any manner affect such
executory contract or unexpired lease; and (b) with respect to any executory
contract or unexpired lease that relates to the use, ability to acquire, or
occupancy of real property, all executory contracts or unexpired leases and
other rights appurtenant to the property, including all easements, licenses,
permits, rights, privileges, immunities, options, rights of first refusal,
powers, uses, usufructs, reciprocal easement agreements, vaults, tunnel or
bridge agreements or franchises, and any other equity interests in real estate
or rights in rem related to such premises, unless any of the foregoing
agreements have been rejected pursuant to an order of the Bankruptcy Court or
are the subject of a motion to reject Filed on or before the Confirmation
Date.

 



 

Amendments, modifications, supplements, and restatements to executory
contracts and unexpired leases that have been executed by the Debtors during
their Chapter 11 Cases shall not be deemed to alter the pre-petition nature of
the executory contract or unexpired lease, or the validity, priority, or
amount of any Claims that may arise in connection therewith.

 



 

 **Section 10.04 _Insurance Policies_**

 



 

All insurance policies pursuant to which the Debtors have any obligations in
effect as of the date of the Confirmation Hearing shall be deemed and treated
as executory contracts pursuant to the Plan and shall be assumed by the
Liquidating Trust.

 



      
 

 



 

 **Section 10.05 _Pass-through_**

 



 

Except as otherwise provided in the Plan, any rights or arrangements necessary
or useful to the administration of the Liquidating Trust but not otherwise
addressed as a Claim or Interest, and other executory contracts not assumable
under Bankruptcy Code § 365(c), shall, in the absence of any other treatment
under the Plan, the Purchase and Sale Agreement, the Sale Order and/or the
Confirmation Order, be passed through the Chapter 11 Cases for the benefit of
the Liquidating Trust and the counterparty unaltered and unaffected by the
Chapter 11 Cases.

 



 

 **Section 10.06 _Claims Based on Rejection of Executory Contracts and
Unexpired Leases_**

 



 

Unless otherwise provided by a Bankruptcy Court order, any Proofs of Claim
asserting Claims arising from the rejection of the Debtors executory
contracts and unexpired leases pursuant to the Plan or otherwise must be Filed
no later than thirty (30) days after the later of the Effective Date or the
date a Final Order is entered granting the rejection. Any Proofs of Claim
arising from the rejection of the Debtors executory contracts or unexpired
leases that are not timely filed shall be disallowed automatically, forever
barred from assertion, and shall not be enforceable against any Debtor or the
Liquidating Trust without the need for any objection by any Person or further
notice to or action, order, or approval of the Bankruptcy Court, and any Claim
arising out of the rejection of the executory contract or unexpired lease
shall be deemed fully satisfied, released, and discharged, notwithstanding
anything in the Bankruptcy Schedules or a Proof of Claim to the contrary. All
Allowed Claims arising from the rejection of the Debtors executory contracts
and unexpired leases shall be classified as General Unsecured Claims for the
particular Debtor in question and shall be treated in accordance with the
particular provisions of the Plan for such Debtor; _provided_ _however_ , if
the Holder of an Allowed Claim for rejection damages has an unavoidable
security interest in any Collateral to secure obligations under such rejected
executory contract or unexpired lease, the Allowed Claim for rejection damages
shall be treated as an Other Secured Claim to the extent of the value of such
Holders interest in the Collateral, with the deficiency, if any, treated as a
General Unsecured Claim.

 



 

 **Section 10.07 _Reservation of Rights_**

 



 

Nothing contained in the Plan or this Disclosure Statement shall constitute an
admission by the Debtors that any such Desired 365 Contract is in fact an
executory contract or unexpired lease or that any Debtor has any liability
thereunder. If there is a dispute regarding whether a contract or lease is or
was executory or unexpired at the time of assumption or rejection, the
Debtors, the Liquidating Trustee, or the Reorganized Debtors, as applicable,
shall have thirty (30) days following entry of a Final Order resolving such
dispute to alter and to provide appropriate treatment of such contract or
lease.

 



 

 **Section 10.08 _Nonoccurrence of Effective Date_**

 



 

In the event that the Effective Date does not occur, the Bankruptcy Court
shall retain jurisdiction with respect to any request by the Debtors to extend
the deadline for assuming or rejecting unexpired leases pursuant to Bankruptcy
Code § 365(d)(4).

 



      
 

 



 

 ** _ARTICLE XI_**

 



 

 ** _PROCEDURES FOR RESOLVING DISPUTED, 
CONTINGENT, AND UNLIQUIDATED CLAIMS_**

 



 

 **Section 11.01 _Expunging of Certain Claims_**

 



 

All Claims marked or otherwise Scheduled as contingent, unliquidated or
disputed on the Bankruptcy Schedules and for which no Proof of Claim has been
timely filed, shall be deemed Disallowed Claims and such Claims shall be
expunged as of the Effective Date without the necessity of filing a claim
objection and without further notice to, or action, order or approval of the
Bankruptcy Court.

 



 

 **Section 11.02 _Objections to Claims_**

 



 

(a) _Authority_. The Debtors, the Reorganized Debtors, or the Liquidating
Trustee (as applicable) and the Pre-Petition Agents shall have the exclusive
authority to File objections to the Plan Carve Out Claims, and to withdraw any
objections to such Claims that they File. The Debtors, the Reorganized Debtors
or the Liquidating Trustee (as applicable) shall have the exclusive authority
to settle, compromise, or litigate to judgment any objections to Disputed Plan
Carve Out Claims, (i) if they have the prior written consent of Pre-Petition
Agents, (ii) if they have given detailed written notice of the proposed
settlement, compromise or litigation to the Pre-Petition Agents and the Pre-
Petition Agents have not objected thereto within five (5) Business Days after
receipt of such notice, or (iii) upon the order of the Bankruptcy Court after
the Pre-Petition Agents have had notice and an opportunity to object. The
Debtors, the Reorganized Debtors or the Liquidating Trustee, as applicable,
shall have the exclusive authority to File, settle, compromise, withdraw, or
litigate to judgment any objections to other Claims. Except as set forth
above, from and after the Effective Date, the Liquidating Trustee may settle
or compromise any Disputed Claim without approval of the Bankruptcy Court.
Except as set forth above, the Liquidating Trustee also shall have the right
to resolve any Disputed Claim outside the Bankruptcy Court under applicable
governing law.

 



 

(b) _Objection Deadline_. As soon as practicable, but no later than the Claims
Objection Deadline, the Liquidating Trustee or the Pre-Petition Agents may
File objections with the Bankruptcy Court and serve such objections on the
Creditors holding the Claims to which such objections are made. Nothing
contained herein, however, shall limit the right of the Liquidating Trustee or
the Pre-Petition Agents to object to Claims, if any, Filed or amended after
the Claims Objection Deadline. The Claims Objection Deadline may be extended
by the Bankruptcy Court upon motion by the applicable Debtor, Reorganized
Debtor or the Liquidating Trustee, as the case may be, or Pre-Petition Agents.

 



 

 **Section 11.03 _Estimation of Claims_**

 



 

The Liquidating Trustee may (after the Pre-Petition Agents prior written
consent in the case of Disputed Plan Carve Out Claims) at any time request
that the Bankruptcy Court estimate any such Disputed Claim pursuant to
Bankruptcy Code § 502(c), regardless of whether the Liquidating Trustee or any
Debtor, Reorganized Debtor or the Pre-Petition Agents have

 



      
 

 



 

previously objected to such Claim or whether the Bankruptcy Court has ruled on
any objection, and the Bankruptcy Court will retain jurisdiction to estimate
any Claim at any time during litigation concerning any objection to any Claim,
including during the pendency of any appeal related to any such objection. In
the event the Bankruptcy Court estimates any Disputed Claim, that estimated
amount will constitute the maximum limitation on such Claim, as determined by
the Bankruptcy Court and the Liquidating Trustee (and the Pre-Petition Agents
in the case of the Disputed Plan Carve Out Claims) may elect to pursue any
supplemental proceedings to object to any ultimate payment on such Claim. All
of the aforementioned objection, estimation and resolution procedures are
cumulative and are not necessarily exclusive of one another. Disputed Plan
Carve Out Claims may be estimated and thereafter resolved by any permitted
mechanism (i) if it has the Pre-Petition Agents prior written consent, (ii)
if the Pre-Petition Agents have received a detailed written notice of the
proposed estimation and resolution and the Pre-Petition Agents have not
objected thereto within five (5) Business Days after receipt of such notice,
or (iii) upon the order of the Bankruptcy Court after the Pre-Petition Agents
have had notice and an opportunity to object. Other Claims may be estimated
and thereafter resolved as the Liquidating Trustee may deem appropriate.

 



 

 **Section 11.04 _No Distributions Pending Allowance_**

 



 

Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, no payments or distributions
shall be made with respect to all or any portion of a Disputed Claim unless
and until all objections to such Disputed Claim have been settled or withdrawn
or have been determined by Final Order, and the Disputed Claim, or some
portion thereof, has become an Allowed Claim.

 



 

 **Section 11.05 _Distributions After Allowance_**

 



 

The Liquidating Trustee shall make payments and distributions from the
appropriate Distribution Reserve Account to each Holder of a Disputed Claim
that has become an Allowed Claim in accordance with the provisions of the Plan
governing the class of Claims to which such Holder belongs. As soon as
reasonably practicable after the date that the order or judgment of the
Bankruptcy Court allowing all or part of any Disputed Claim becomes a Final
Order, the Liquidating Trustee shall distribute to the Holder of such Claim
the distribution (if any) that would have been made to such Holder on the
Distribution Date had such Allowed Claim been allowed on the Distribution
Date. After a Disputed Claim is Allowed or otherwise resolved, the excess Cash
or other property that was reserved on account of such Disputed Claim, if any,
shall become a Liquidating Trust Asset for the benefit of other Allowed Claims
of the Class or Classes for which the distribution reserve was created.

 



 

 **Section 11.06 _Reduction of Claims_**

 



 

Notwithstanding the contents of the Bankruptcy Schedules or the Bankruptcy
SOFAs, Claims listed therein as undisputed, liquidated and not contingent
shall be reduced by the amount, if any, that was paid by the Debtors before
the Effective Date, including pursuant to orders of the Bankruptcy Court. To
the extent such payments are not reflected in the Bankruptcy Schedules or the
Bankruptcy SOFAs, such Bankruptcy Schedules and Bankruptcy SOFAs will be
deemed amended and reduced to reflect that such payments were made. Nothing in
the Plan

 



      
 

 



 

shall preclude the Liquidating Trustee from paying Claims that the Debtors
were authorized to pay pursuant to any Final Order entered by the Bankruptcy
Court before the Effective Date.

 



 

 ** _ARTICLE XII_**

consummation of any of the Transactions contemplated by the Plan.

 



 

 **Section 12.03 _Substantial Consummation_**

 



 

On the Effective Date, the Plan shall be deemed to be substantially
consummated under Bankruptcy Code §§ 1101 and 1127(b).

 



 

 **Section 12.04 _Waiver of Conditions_**

or the Pre-Petition Agents regardless of the circumstances giving rise to the
failure of such condition to be satisfied.

void; and (iii) nothing contained in the Plan, and no acts taken in

the Debtors or any Person in any further proceedings involving the Debtors, or
(c) constitute an admission of any sort by the Debtors or any other Person.

 



 

 ** _ARTICLE XIII_**

 



 

 ** _AMENDMENTS AND MODIFICATIONS_**

 



 

The Debtors may alter, amend, or modify the Plan, the Plan Supplement, or any
Exhibits thereto under Bankruptcy Code § 1127(a) at any time before the
Confirmation Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that where the Plan requires a

Except for those Avoidance Actions and Causes of Action transferred to the
Liquidating Trust, pursuant to Bankruptcy Code § 363 and Bankruptcy Rule 9019,
and in consideration for the classification, distribution and other benefits
provided under the Plan, the provisions of the Plan shall constitute a good
faith compromise and settlement of all Claims, Interests and controversies
resolved pursuant to the Plan, including, without limitation, all Claims
arising before the Petition Date, whether known or unknown, foreseen or
unforeseen, asserted or unasserted, arising out of, relating to or in
connection with the business or affairs of, or transactions with, the Debtors.
The entry of the Confirmation Order shall constitute the Bankruptcy Courts
approval of each of the foregoing compromises or settlements, and all other
compromises and settlements provided for in the Plan, and the Bankruptcy
Courts findings shall constitute its determination that such compromises and
settlements are in the best interests of the Debtors, the Estates, Creditors
and other parties in interest, and are fair, equitable and within the range of
reasonableness.

 



 

 **Section 15.02** ** ****_Satisfaction of Claims_**

 



 

The rights afforded in the Plan and the treatment of all Claims and Interests
herein shall be in exchange for and in complete satisfaction, discharge, and
release of all Claims and Interests of any nature whatsoever against the
Debtors or any of their Estates, assets, properties, or interests in property.
Except as otherwise provided herein, on the Effective Date, all Claims against
and Interests in the Debtors shall be satisfied, discharged, and released in
full. None of the Debtors, the Reorganized Debtors or their Affiliates, shall
be responsible for any pre-Effective Date obligations of the Debtors or the
Reorganized Debtors, except those expressly assumed by the Debtors or the
Reorganized Debtors, as applicable. Except as otherwise provided herein, all
Persons and Entities shall be precluded and forever barred from asserting
against the Debtors and their Affiliates, their respective successors or
assigns, or their Estates, assets, properties, or interests in property any
event, occurrence, condition, thing, or other or further Claims or Causes of
Action based upon any act, omission, transaction, or other activity of any
kind or nature that occurred or came into existence before the Effective Date,
whether or not the facts of or legal bases therefore were known or existed
before the Effective Date.

 



 

 **Section 15.03** ** ****_Discharge of Liabilities_**

 



 

Pursuant to Bankruptcy Code §1141(d), and except as otherwise specifically
provided in the Plan, the Sale Order and/or the Confirmation Order, the
distributions, rights, and treatment that are provided in the Plan shall be in
complete satisfaction, discharge, and release, effective as of the Effective
Date, of all Claims, Interests, and Causes of Action of any nature whatsoever,
including any interest accrued on Claims or Interests from and after the
Petition Date, whether known or unknown, against, liabilities of, Liens on,
obligations of, rights against, and Interests

 



      
 

 



 

in, the Debtors or any of their assets or properties, regardless of whether
any property shall have been distributed or retained pursuant to the Plan on
account of such Claims and Interests, including demands, liabilities, and
Causes of Action that arose before the Effective Date, any liability
(including withdrawal liability) to the extent such Claims or Interests relate
to services performed by employees of the Debtors before the Effective Date
and that arise from a termination of employment or a termination of any
employee or retiree benefit program, regardless of whether such termination
occurred before or after the Effective Date, any contingent or non-contingent
liability on account of representations or warranties issued on or before the
Effective Date, and all debts of the kind specified in Bankruptcy Code §§
502(g), 502(h), or 502(i), in each case whether or not: (a) a Proof of Claim
or Interest based upon such debt, right, Claim, or Interest is Filed or deemed
Filed pursuant to Bankruptcy Code §501; (b) a Claim or Interest based upon
such Claim, debt, right, or Interest is Allowed pursuant to Bankruptcy Code
§502; or (c) the Holder of such a Claim or Interest has accepted the Plan.
Subject to the terms of the Plan, the Sale Order and/or the Confirmation
Order, any default by the Debtors or their Affiliates with respect to any
Claim or Interest that existed immediately before or on account of the Filing
of the Chapter 11 Cases shall be deemed satisfied on the Effective Date.
Subject to the terms of the Plan, the Sale Order and/or the Confirmation Order
shall be a judicial determination of the discharge of all Claims and Interests
subject to the Effective Date occurring. Subject to the terms of the Plan, the
Sale Order and/or the Confirmation Order shall be a judicial determination of
discharge of all liabilities of the Debtors, their Estates, the Reorganized
Debtors and all successors thereto. As provided in Bankruptcy Code §524,
subject to the terms of the Plan, the Sale Order and/or the Confirmation Order
such discharge shall void any judgment against the Debtors, their Estates, the
Reorganized Debtors or any successors thereto at any time obtained to the
extent it relates to a Claim or Interest discharged, and operates as an
injunction against the prosecution of any action against the Reorganized
Debtors or their respective property and assets to the extent it relates to a
discharged Claim or Interest.

 



 

 **Section 15.04** ** ****_Releases_**

 



 

(a) _Releases by Debtors and Estates_. Except as otherwise expressly provided
in the Plan, the Purchase and Sale Agreement, the Sale Order and/or the

Except as otherwise expressly provided in the Plan, the Purchase and Sale
Agreement the Confirmation Order, all Persons who have held, hold or may hold
Claims against, or Interests in, the Debtors are permanently enjoined, on and

 **Section 15.07** ** ****_Setoffs_**

 



 

Except as otherwise expressly provided for in the Plan, pursuant to the
Bankruptcy Code (including Bankruptcy Code § 553), applicable non-bankruptcy

or each Reorganized Debtor may setoff against any Allowed Claim or Interest

UBE Junior Secured Claim) and the distributions to be made pursuant to the
Plan on account of such Allowed Claim or Interest (before such distribution is
made), any Claims, rights, and Causes of Action of any nature that such Debtor
or Reorganized Debtor, as applicable, may hold against the Holder of such
Allowed Claim or Interest, to the extent such Claims, rights, or Causes of
Action against such Holder have not been otherwise compromised or settled on
or before the Effective Date (whether pursuant to the Plan or otherwise);
provided, however, that neither the failure to effect such a setoff nor the
allowance of any Claim or Interest pursuant to the Plan shall constitute a
waiver or release by such Debtor or Reorganized Debtor of any such Claims,
rights, and Causes of Action that such Debtor may possess against such Holder.
In no event shall any Holder of Claims or Interests be entitled to setoff any
Claim or Interest against any Claim, right, or cause of action of the Debtors
or Reorganized Debtors, as applicable, unless such Holder has Filed a motion
with the Bankruptcy Court requesting the authority to perform such setoff on
or before the Confirmation Date, and notwithstanding any indication in any

intends to preserve any right of setoff pursuant to Bankruptcy Code § 553 or

Except as provided in the Plan, any Holder of a Claim or Interest shall not be
entitled to recoup any Claim or Interest against any Claim, right, or cause of
action of the Debtors or Reorganized Debtors, as applicable, unless such
Holder actually has performed such recoupment and provided notice thereof in
writing to the Debtors on or before the Confirmation Date, notwithstanding any
indication in any Proof of Claim or Interest or otherwise that such Holder
asserts, has, or intends to preserve any right of recoupment.

 



 

 **Section 15.09** ** ****_Release of Liens_**

release, or other agreement or document created pursuant to the Plan, on the

of the portion of the Secured Claim that is Allowed as of the Effective Date,
all mortgages, deeds of trust, Liens, pledges, or other security interests
against any property of the Debtors Estates shall be fully released and
discharged, and all of the right, title, and interest of any Holder of such
mortgages, deeds of trust, Liens, pledges, or other security interests shall
revert to the applicable Debtor and its successors and assigns.

 



      
 

 



 

 **Section 15.10** ** ****_Good Faith_**

 



 

As of the Confirmation Date, the Debtors shall be deemed to have solicited
acceptance or rejections of the Plan in good faith and in compliance with the
applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.

 



 

 **Section 15.11** ** ****_Rights of Defendants and Avoidance Actions_**

 



 

All rights, if any, of a defendant to assert a Claim arising from relief
granted in an Avoidance Action, together with the Liquidating Trustees right
to oppose such Claim are fully preserved. Any such Claim that is Allowed shall
be entitled to treatment and distribution under the Plan as a General
Unsecured Claim.

 



 

 ** _ARTICLE XVI_**

 



 

 ** _MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS_**

 



 

 **Section 16.01** ** ****_Bar Dates for Certain Claims._**

(30) days after the Confirmation Date (the " _Administrative Claims Bar Date_
"). Holders of asserted Administrative Claims, other than Professional Fee
Claims, claims for U.S. Trustee fees under 28 U.S.C. §1930, administrative tax
claims and administrative ordinary case liabilities described in section (b)
below, must submit proofs of Administrative Claim on or before such
Administrative Claims Bar Date or forever be barred from doing so. A notice
prepared by the Debtors will set forth such date and constitute notice of this
Administrative Claims Bar Date. The Reorganized Debtors and the Pre-Petition
Agents shall have thirty days (30) days (or such longer period as may be
allowed by order of the Bankruptcy Court) following the Administrative Claims
Bar Date to review and object to such Administrative Claims before a hearing
for determination of allowance of such Administrative Claims.

Claims that are based on liabilities incurred and paid by any Debtor in the
ordinary course of the applicable Debtors business (other than Claims of
governmental units for taxes and for interest and/or penalties related to such
taxes) on and after the Petition Date shall not be required to File any
request for payment of such Administrative Claims. For the avoidance of doubt,
Holders of Administrative Claims pursuant to Bankruptcy Code § 503(b)(9) shall
be required to File a proof of Administrative Claim on or before the
Administrative Claims Bar Date.

 



 

(c) _Administrative Tax Claims_. All requests for payment of Administrative
Claims by a governmental unit for taxes (and for interest and/or penalties
related to such taxes) for any tax year or period, all or any portion of which
occurs or falls within the period from and including the Petition Date through
and including the Effective Date, and for which no bar date has otherwise been
previously established, must be Filed and served on the Reorganized Debtors,
the Pre-Petition Agents, and any other party specifically requesting a copy in
writing on or

 



      
 

 



 

before the later of (a) thirty (30) days following the Confirmation Date; and
(b) one hundred and twenty (120) days following the Filing of the tax return
for such taxes for such tax year or period with the applicable governmental
unit. Any Holder of any such Claim that is required to File a request for
payment of such taxes and does not File and properly serve such a claim by the
applicable Bar Date shall be forever barred from asserting any such claim
against the Debtors, the Reorganized Debtors, the Liquidating Trust or their
property, regardless of whether any such Claim is deemed to arise on or before
the Effective Date. Any interested party desiring to object to an
Administrative Claim for taxes must File and serve its objection on counsel to
the Debtors and the relevant taxing authority no later than ninety (90) days
after the taxing authority Files and serves its application.

 



 

(d) _Professional Fee Claims_. All final requests for compensation or

applicable Debtors or the Committee (if one has been appointed) before the
Confirmation Date (other than substantial contribution claims under Bankruptcy
Code § 503(b)(4)) must be Filed and served on the Reorganized Debtors, the
Pre-Petition Agents, and their respective counsel no later than thirty days
(30) after the Confirmation Date, unless otherwise ordered by the Bankruptcy
Court. Objections to applications of such Professionals or other entities for
compensation or reimbursement of expenses must be Filed and served on the
Debtors, Pre-Petition Agents, and their counsel and the requesting
Professional or other entity no later than thirty (30) days (or such longer
period as may be allowed by order of the Bankruptcy Court) after the date on
which the applicable application for compensation or reimbursement was served.

 



 

 **Section 16.02** ** ****_Payment of Statutory Fees_**

 



 

On or before the Effective Date, the Debtors shall have paid in full, in Cash
(including by check or wire transfer), in U.S. dollars, all fees payable
pursuant to section 1930 of title 28 of the United States Code, in the amount
determined by the Bankruptcy Court at the Confirmation Hearing.

 



 

 **Section 16.03** ** ****_Severability of Plan Provisions_**

 



 

If, before Confirmation, any term or provision of the Plan is held by the
Bankruptcy Court to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the Bankruptcy Court,
at the request of the Debtors, shall have the power to alter and interpret
such term or provision to make it valid or enforceable to the maximum extent
practicable, consistent with the original purpose of the term or provision
held to be invalid, void or unenforceable, and such term or provision shall
then be applicable as altered or interpreted. Notwithstanding any such
holding, alteration or interpretation, the remainder of the terms and
provisions of the Plan shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no
way be affected, impaired or invalidated by such holding, alteration or
interpretation. The Confirmation Order shall constitute a judicial
determination and shall provide that each term and provision of the Plan, as
it may have been altered or interpreted in accordance with the foregoing, is
valid and enforceable pursuant to its terms.

 



       
 

 



 

 **Section 16.04 _Successors and Assigns_**

 



 

The rights, benefits and obligations of any Person named or referred to in the
Plan, including any Holder of a Claim, shall be binding on, and shall inure to
the benefit of, any heir, executor, administrator, successor or assign of such
entity.

 



 

 **Section 16.05 _Binding Effect_**

 



 

The Plan shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Debtors, all
present and former Holders of Claims against and Interests in the Debtors,
their respective successors and assigns, including, but not limited to, the
Debtors, and all other parties-in-interest in these Chapter 11 Cases.

 



 

 **Section 16.06 _Term of Injunctions or Stay_**

 



 

Unless otherwise provided in the Plan, the Sale Order and/or Confirmation
Order, all injunctions or stays provided for in the Chapter 11 Cases under
Bankruptcy Code §§ 105 or 362 or otherwise, and in existence on the
Confirmation Date (excluding any injunctions or stays contained in the Plan or
Confirmation Order), shall remain in full force and effect until the Effective
Date. All injunctions or stays contained in the Plan, the Sale Order and/or
Confirmation Order shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with
their terms.

 



 

 **Section 16.07 _Dissolution of Committee_**

 



 

On the Effective Date, the Committee, if any, shall dissolve and the members
of the Committee shall be released and discharged from all authority, duties,
responsibilities and obligations related to and arising from and in connection
with the Chapter 11 Cases.

 



 

 **Section 16.08 _No Admissions_**

 



 

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, nothing in the Plan shall be
deemed as an admission by the Debtors with respect to any matter set forth
herein, including liability on any Claim.

 



 

 **Section 16.09 _Default Under Plan_**

 



 

(a) _Plan Default Notice_. Except or otherwise provided for in the Plan, after
the Effective Date, in the event of an alleged default by the Liquidating
Trustee under the Plan, any party alleging such default shall provide written
notice of default (the " _Plan Default Notice_ ") to the Liquidating Trustee
at the address set forth in the Notice of Effective Date filed pursuant to
Setion 16.11 of the Plan with a copy thereof to the Debtors counsel and the
Pre-Petition Agents counsel at the addresses set forth in the Plan and shall
contemporaneously file such Plan default notice with the Bankruptcy Court and
serve it on the Committee, if any. The Liquidating Trustee shall have thirty
(30) days from the receipt of a Plan Default Notice to cure any actual default
that may have occurred.

 



 

(b) _Cure_. The Liquidating Trustee and any other party-in-interest shall have
the right to dispute an alleged default that has occurred and to notify the
party alleging such default that

 



      
 

 



 

the Liquidating Trustee (or such other party-in-interest) contends no default
has occurred, with such notice to be sent within the thirty-day period
following receipt of a Plan Default Notice. In such event, the Bankruptcy
Court shall retain jurisdiction over the dispute relating to the alleged
default and the remedy with respect to any remedy therefore.

 



 

(c) _Failure to Cure_. In the event the Liquidating Trustee (or any other
party-in-interest) fails to either dispute the alleged default or timely cure
such default, the party alleging such default shall be entitled to assert its
rights under applicable law.

 



 

 **Section 16.10 _Governing Law_**

 



 

Unless a rule of law or procedure is supplied by federal law (including the
Bankruptcy Code and Bankruptcy Rules), the laws of the State of Texas, without
giving effect to the principles of conflicts of law thereof, shall govern the
construction and implementation of the Plan and any agreements, documents, and
instruments executed in connection with the Plan (except as otherwise set
forth in those agreements, in which case the governing law of such agreement
shall control) as well as corporate governance matters with respect to the
Debtors; provided, however, that corporate governance matters relating to the
Debtors or Reorganized Debtors, as applicable, not organized under Texas law
shall be governed by the laws of the state of organization of such Debtor.

 



 

 **Section 16.11 _Entire Agreement_**

 



 

This Plan and the Plan Documents set forth the entire agreement and
understanding among the parties-in-interests relating to the subject matter
hereof and supersede all prior discussions and documents.

 



 

 **Section 16.12 _Plan Documents_**

 



 

The Plan Documents are incorporated herein and are a part of this Plan as set
forth in full herein.

 



 

 ** _ARTICLE XVII_**

 



 

 ** _CERTAIN RISK FACTORS AFFECTING CERTAIN OF THE DEBTORS_**

 



 

BEFORE VOTING TO ACCEPT OR REJECT THE PLAN, ALL HOLDERS OF IMPAIRED CLAIMS
SHOULD READ AND CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE FACTORS SET FORTH BELOW, AS WELL AS ALL
OTHER INFORMATION SET FORTH OR OTHERWISE REFERENCED IN THIS DISCLOSURE
STATEMENT. THESE FACTORS SHOULD NOT, HOWEVER, BE REGARDED AS CONSTITUTING THE
ONLY RISKS INVOLVED IN CONNECTION WITH THE PLAN AND ITS IMPLEMENTATION.

 



 

 **Section 17.01 _General Risks_**

 



 

The bankruptcy proceeding could possibly adversely affect (i) the Debtors
relationships with their key vendors; (ii) the Debtors relationships with
their customers; (iii) the Debtors

 



      
 

 



 

relationships with their employees; and (iv) the legal rights and obligations
of the Debtors under agreements that may be in default as a result of the
Cases.

 



 

The extent to which the Chapter 11 Case has and will continue to disrupt the
Debtors businesses will likely be directly related to the length of time it
takes to complete the proceeding. If the Debtors are unable to obtain
Confirmation of the Plan on a timely basis because of a challenge to the Plan
or a failure to satisfy the conditions to the Plan, they may be forced to
operate in chapter 11 for an extended period while they try to develop a
different reorganization plan that can be confirmed. That would increase both
the probability and the magnitude of the adverse effects described in this
Disclosure Statement.

 



 

 **Section 17.02 _Certain Bankruptcy Law Considerations_**

 



 

Although the Debtors believe that the Plan will satisfy all requirements
necessary for Confirmation by the Bankruptcy Court, the Debtors give no
assurance that the Bankruptcy Court will reach the same conclusion. Moreover,
the Debtors give no assurance that modifications to the Plan will not be
required for Confirmation or that such modifications would not necessitate the
resolicitation of votes. Although the Debtors believe that the Effective Date
will occur soon after the Confirmation Date, the Debtors give no assurance as
to such timing. In the event the conditions precedent to Confirmation of the
Plan have not been satisfied or waived (to the extent possible) by the Debtors
or applicable party (as provided in the Plan) as of the Effective Date, then
the Confirmation Order will be vacated, no Distributions under the Plan will
be made, and the Debtors and all Holders of Claims and Interests will be
restored to the status quo ante as of the day immediately preceding the
Confirmation Date as though such Confirmation Date had never occurred.

 



 

 **Section 17.03 _Risks Related to Volatility in the Prices of Natural Gas
and Oil_**

 



 

In the absence of the sale contemplated under the Plan, the Debtors revenue,
profitability, cash flow, and the carrying value of gas and oil properties are
substantially dependent on prevailing prices of natural gas and oil.
Historically, the markets for natural gas and oil have been volatile and those
markets are likely to continue to be volatile in the future. Predicting future
natural gas and oil price movements with certainty is impossible. Prices for
natural gas and oil are subject to wide fluctuation in response to relatively
minor changes in the supply of and demand for natural gas and oil, market
uncertainty, and a variety of additional factors beyond the Debtors control.
These factors include the level of consumer product demand, overall economic
conditions, weather conditions, domestic and foreign governmental relations,
governmental regulations, taxes, price and availability of alternative fuels,
level and price of foreign imports of natural gas and oil, and the actions of
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. Declines in natural gas and
oil prices may materially adversely affect the Debtors financial condition

 



 

 **Section 17.04 _Risks Related to the Sale of the Debtors  Assets_**

 



 

The Bankruptcy Court has not yet approved a sale of the Equity Interests
and/or the Debtors Assets. Further, the Purchase and Sale Agreement is
subject to certain conditions precedent, which must be satisfied before the
Transaction is consummated. There is no

 



      
 

 



 

guarantee that these conditions precedent will be satisfied or that the
Bankruptcy Court will approve a sale of the Equity Interests and/or the
Debtors Assets. If the sale of the Equity Interests and/or the Debtors
Assets is not consummated, the feasibility of the Plan may be adversely
affected.

 ** _FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND FEASIBILITY_**

 



 

 **Section 18.01 _Financial Information_**

 



 

The Projections set forth in **_Exhibit E_** and the above summary reflect
the Debtors reasonable judgments as to the cash flow of the Reorganized
Debtors; however, there can be no assurance that any of the various
assumptions on which they are based will prove to be accurate, that any of the
forecasted expenses will not exceed assumptions or that the projected results
will be realized any time in the future or at all. Actual results will be
impacted by a number of factors, including, without limitation, general
economic and business conditions, successful implementation of business plans,
third-party contractual relationships, sufficient working capital and sources
of funding, as well as other conditions which affect the capital markets and
the oil and natural gas industry, all of which can be materially adverse to
the Reorganized Debtors.

 



 

 **Section 18.02 _Feasibility of the Plan_**

 



 

In connection with Confirmation of the Plan, Bankruptcy Code § 1129(d)(ii)
requires the Bankruptcy Court to find that Confirmation of the Plan is not
likely to be followed by the liquidation of, or the need for further
reorganization of, the Reorganized Debtors. This requirement is the so-called
"feasibility" test. After Consummation of the Plan, the Reorganized Debtors
will have virtually no debt other than trade debt reincurred in the ordinary
course of business.

 



 

 ** _ARTICLE XIX_**

 



 

 ** _CERTAIN FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE PLAN_**

 



 

 **Section 19.01 _General_**

 



 

The following discussion summarizes certain United States federal income tax
consequences of the implementation of the Plan to the Debtors and certain
Holders of Claims or Interests. This summary is for general information
purposes only, and should not be relied upon for purposes of determining the
specific tax consequences of the Plan with respect to any particular Holder of
a Claim or Interest. This discussion does not purport to be a complete
analysis or listing of all potential tax considerations.

 



 

The discussion is based upon the Internal Revenue Code, Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder, judicial decisions, and published administrative rules
and pronouncements of the Internal Revenue Service (the " _IRS_ ") as in
effect on the date hereof. Legislative, judicial or administrative changes or
new interpretations enacted or promulgated after the date hereof could alter
or modify the analyses set forth below with respect to the United

 



      
 

 



 

States federal income tax consequences of the Plan. Any such changes or new
interpretations may have retroactive effect and could significantly affect the
federal income tax consequences of the Plan.

 



 

The federal income tax consequences of the Plan are complex and are subject to
significant uncertainties. The Debtors have not requested a ruling from the
IRS or an opinion of counsel with respect to any of the tax aspects of the
Plan. Thus, no assurance can be given as to the interpretation that the IRS
will adopt. In addition, this discussion does not address foreign, state or
local tax consequences of the Plan, nor does it purport to address the federal
income tax consequences of the Plan to (i) special classes of taxpayers (such
as Persons who are related to the Debtors within the meaning of the Internal
Revenue Code, foreign taxpayers, broker-dealers, banks, mutual funds,
insurance companies, financial institutions, small business investment
companies, regulated investment companies, tax-exempt organizations, and
investors in pass-through entities and holders of Claims or Interests who are
themselves in bankruptcy) or (ii) Holders not entitled to vote on the Plan,
including Holders whose Claims or Interests are entitled to reinstatement or
payment in full in cash under the Plan or Holders whose Claims or Interests
are to be extinguished without any Distribution.

 



 

This discussion assumes that Holders of Claims or Interests hold only Claims
or Interests in a single Class. Holders of multiple Classes of Claims or
Interests should consult their own tax advisors as to the effect such
ownership may have on the federal income tax consequences described below.

 



 

ACCORDINGLY, THE FOLLOWING SUMMARY OF CERTAIN FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES
IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR CAREFUL TAX
PLANNING AND ADVICE BASED UPON THE INDIVIDUAL CIRCUMSTANCES PERTAINING TO A
HOLDER OF A CLAIM OR INTEREST. ALL HOLDERS OF CLAIMS OR INTERESTS ARE URGED TO
CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS FOR THE FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND OTHER TAX
CONSEQUENCES APPLICABLE UNDER THE PLAN.

 



 

TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH TREASURY DEPARTMENT CIRCULAR 230, HOLDERS OF CLAIMS
OR INTERESTS ARE HEREBY NOTIFIED THAT: (1) ANY DISCUSSION OF FEDERAL TAX
ISSUES IN THIS DISCLOSURE STATEMENT IS NOT INTENDED OR WRITTEN TO BE RELIED
UPON, AND CANNOT BE RELIED UPON, BY ANY HOLDER OF A CLAIM OR INTERESTS FOR THE
PURPOSE OF AVOIDING PENALTIES THAT MAY BE IMPOSED ON HOLDERS OF CLAIMS OR
INTERESTS UNDER THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE, (2) SUCH DISCUSSION IS WRITTEN IN
CONNECTION WITH THE CONFIRMATION OF THE PLAN TO WHICH THE TRANSACTIONS
DESCRIBED IN THIS DISCLOSURE STATEMENT ARE ANCILLARY, AND (3) HOLDERS OF
CLAIMS OR INTERESTS SHOULD SEEK ADVICE BASED UPON THEIR PARTICULAR
CIRCUMSTANCES FROM THEIR OWN TAX ADVISOR.

 



 

 **Section 19.02 _Consequences to the Debtors_**

 



 

The Debtors have consolidated NOLs for federal income tax purposes of
approximately $114,002,931 as of June 30, 2011.

 



      
 

 



 

As discussed below, the amount of the Debtors NOL carryforwards, and possibly
certain other tax attributes, may be significantly reduced upon implementation
of the Plan. In addition, the Reorganized Debtors subsequent utilization of
any net built-in losses with respect to their assets and NOLs remaining, and
possibly certain other tax attributes, may be restricted as a result of and
upon the implementation of the Plan.

 



 

(a) _Cancellation Of Indebtedness Income_. Under the Internal Revenue Code, a
taxpayer generally must recognize income from the cancellation of debt (" _COD
Income_ ") to the extent that its indebtedness is discharged during the
taxable year. COD Income generally equals the excess of the adjusted issue
price of the indebtedness discharged over the sum of (i) the amount of cash,
(ii) the issue price of any new debt, and (iii) the fair market value of any
other property (including stock) transferred by the debtor in satisfaction of
such discharged indebtedness. COD Income also includes any interest that has
been previously accrued and deducted but remains unpaid at the time the
indebtedness is discharged.

 



 

Section 108(a)(1)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code provides an exception to
this rule, however, where a taxpayer is in bankruptcy and where the discharge
is granted, or is effected, pursuant to a plan approved by the bankruptcy
court. In that case, instead of recognizing income, the taxpayer is required,
under Section 108(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, to reduce certain of its
tax attributes by the amount of COD Income. The attributes of the taxpayer are
to be reduced in the following order: NOLs, general business and minimum tax
credit carryforwards, capital loss carryforwards, the basis of the taxpayers
assets, and finally, foreign tax credit carryforwards (collectively, " _Tax
Attributes_ "). Section 108(b)(5) of the Internal Revenue Code permits a
taxpayer to elect to first apply the reduction to the basis of the taxpayers
depreciable assets, with any remaining balance applied to the taxpayers other
Tax Attributes in the order stated above. In addition to the foregoing,
Section 108(e)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code provides a further exception to
the realization of COD Income upon the discharge of debt to the extent that
the taxpayers satisfaction of the debt would have given rise to a deduction
for federal income tax purposes.

 



 

The Debtors expect to realize a significant amount of COD Income as a result
of the Plan. The ultimate amount of COD income realized by the Debtors is
uncertain. Regardless of the amount of the Debtors COD Income, the Debtors
will not be required to include COD Income in gross income because the
indebtedness will be discharged while the Debtors are under the jurisdiction
of a court in a Title 11 case. Accordingly, the Debtors expect that there will
be no United States federal income taxes payable by the Debtors in respect of
the COD Income. However, certain Tax Attributes of the Debtors will be reduced
or eliminated. The Debtors do not currently anticipate that they will make the
election under Section 108(b)(5) of the Internal Revenue Code to apply any
required attribute reduction first to the basis of the Debtors depreciable
property. The Debtors will avoid recognition of COD Income and reduction of
Tax Attributes pursuant to Section 108(e)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code only
to the extent that the discharge is of amounts that the Debtors would have
been entitled to deduct if the Debtors had paid such amounts.

 



 

(b) _Net Operating Losses And Other Attributes_. The Debtors currently have
NOLs that will carry forward to the extent that they are not offset by income
and/or gain and are not reduced by the attribute reduction rules of Section
108(b) of the Internal Revenue Code

 



      
 

 



 

discussed above. In addition, the Debtors may generate NOLs in future taxable
years to the extent they generate deductions that exceed their income and gain
in those years.

 



 

(c) _Annual Section 382 Limitation on Use of NOLs. _With respect to any NOLs
of the Debtors remaining after confirmation of the Plan and any required
attribute reduction, Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code contains certain
rules limiting the amount of NOLs a corporate taxpayer can utilize in the
years following an "ownership change" (the " _Annual Section 382
Limitation_"). An "ownership change" generally is defined as a more than 50
percentage point change in ownership of the stock of a "loss corporation" (a
corporation with NOLs or net unrealized built-in losses) that takes place
during a testing period (generally three years) ending on the date on which
such change in ownership is tested. The Debtors will undergo an ownership
change on the Effective Date.

 



 

(1) _General Annual Section 382 Limitation. _As a general rule, a loss
corporations Annual Section 382 Limitation equals the product of the value of
the stock of the corporation (with certain adjustments) immediately before the
ownership change and the applicable "long-term tax-exempt rate," a rate
published monthly by the Treasury Department (for example, 3.55% for ownership
changes that occur during February, 2012). Any unused portion of the Annual
Section 382 Limitation generally is available for use in subsequent years. If
a loss corporation does not continue its historic business or use a
significant portion of its assets in a new business for two years after the
ownership change, the corporations Annual Section 382 Limitation is zero. The
Annual Section 382 Limitation is increased if the loss corporation has net
unrealized built-in gains, i.e., gains economically accrued but unrecognized
at the time of the ownership change, in excess of a threshold amount. A loss
corporation can use NOLs in excess of its Annual Section 382 Limitation to the
extent that it realizes those net unrealized built-in gains for federal income
tax purposes in the five years following the ownership change. A correlative
rule applies to a corporation that has net unrealized built in losses, i.e.,
losses economically accrued but unrecognized as of the date of the ownership
change in excess of a threshold amount. Such a corporations ability to deduct
its built-in losses (in addition to its NOLs) following an ownership change is
limited. Although the Debtors will expect to have a net unrealized built-in
loss as of the Effective Date, this is uncertain at this time.

 



 

(2) _Special Bankruptcy Exceptions_. Section 382(1)(5) of the Internal Revenue
Code provides an exception to the application of the Annual Section 382
Limitation when a corporation is under the jurisdiction of a court in a Title
11 case (the " _382(1)(5) Exception_"). The 382(1)(5) Exception provides that
where an ownership change occurs pursuant to a bankruptcy reorganization or
similar proceeding, the Annual Section 382 Limitation will not apply if the
pre-change shareholders and/or "qualified creditors" (as defined by applicable
Treasury Regulations) own at least 50 percent of the stock of the reorganized
corporation immediately after the ownership change. However, under the Plan,
the Debtors do not expect to qualify for the 382(l)(5) Exception because not
of the pre-change shareholders and/or "qualified creditors" will own any of
the Equity Interests of

 



      
 

 



 

the Reorganized Debtors.

 



 

(d) _Exchange of Liquidating Trust Assets_. The Debtors will transfer the
Liquidating Trust Assets to the Liquidating Trust and will transfer the
interests in the Liquidating Trust to certain Holders of Allowed Claims. For
federal income tax purposes, these transfers will be treated as a taxable
disposition by the Debtors of the Liquidating Trust Assets to such Holders of
Allowed Claims in satisfaction of a Pro Rata portion of their Claims. The
Debtors will recognize gain or loss measured by the difference between the
fair market value of the Liquidating Trust Assets and their basis in the
Liquidating Trust Assets. The character of any gain or loss as capital or
ordinary, and in the case of capital gain or loss, as short term or long term,
will depend upon the nature of the Liquidating Trust Assets and the Debtors
holding period for the Liquidating Trust Assets.

 



 

(e) _Accrued Interest. _To the extent that the consideration issued to Holders
of Claims pursuant to the Plan is attributable to accrued but unpaid interest,
the Debtors should be entitled to interest deductions in the amount of such
accrued interest, but only to the extent the Debtors have not already deducted
such amount. The Debtors should not have COD Income from the discharge of any
accrued but unpaid interest pursuant to the Plan to the extent that the
payment of such interest would have given rise to a deduction pursuant to
Section 108(e)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code, as discussed above.

 



 

(f) _Federal Alternative Minimum Tax_. In general, a federal alternative
minimum tax (" _AMT_ ") is imposed on a corporations alternative minimum
taxable income (" _AMTI_ ") at a 20% rate to the extent that such tax exceeds
the corporations regular federal income tax for the year. AMTI is generally
equal to regular taxable income with certain adjustments. For purposes of
computing AMTI, certain tax deductions and other beneficial allowances are
modified or eliminated. In particular, even though a corporation might
otherwise be able to offset all of its taxable income for regular federal
income tax purposes by available NOL carryforwards, a corporation is generally
entitled to offset no more than 90% of its AMTI with NOL carryforwards (as
recomputed for AMT purposes). Accordingly, usage of the Debtors NOLs by the
Reorganized Debtors or Purchaser may be subject to limitations for AMT
purposes in addition to any other limitations that may apply.

 



 

In addition, if a corporation (or a consolidated group) undergoes an ownership
change and is in a net unrealized built-in loss position on the date of the
ownership change, the corporations (or groups) aggregate tax basis in its
assets may be reduced for certain AMT purposes to reflect the fair market
value of such assets as of the change date. Accordingly, if the Debtors are in
a net unrealized built-in loss position on the Effective Date, for AMT
purposes the tax benefits attributable to basis in assets may be reduced.

 



 

Any AMT that a corporation pays generally will be allowed as a nonrefundable
credit against its regular federal income tax liability in future taxable
years when the corporation is no longer subject to AMT.

 



      
 

 



 

 **Section 19.03 _Federal Income Tax Consequences to Holders of Senior
Secured Claims and the UBE Junior Secured Claim_**

 



 

(a) _Receipt of Cash and Liquidating Trust Interests._ Pursuant to the Plan,
each Holder of a Senior Secured Claim and the UBE Junior Secured Claim will
receive Cash and Liquidating Trust interests in exchange for its Claim. For
federal income tax purposes, a Holder of a Senior Secured Claim or the UBE
Junior Secured Claim should be treated as exchanging a Pro Rata portion of its
Claim for Cash, and the transfers of the Liquidating Trust interests will be
treated as the transfer by the Debtors of a Pro Rata portion of the
Liquidating Trust Assets to a Holder of a Senior Secured Claim or the UBE
Junior Secured Claim in satisfaction of a portion of its Claim, followed by
the transfer by such Holders of a Pro Rata portion of the Liquidating Trust
Assets to the Liquidating Trust. A Holder of a Senior Secured Claim or the UBE
Junior Secured Claim will recognize gain or loss measured by the difference
between (i) the amount of Cash and the fair market value of its Pro Rata share
of the Liquidating Trust Assets it is treated as receiving (net of any
liabilities it is treated as assuming), and (ii) its basis in the Claims
exchanged therefor (other than any claims for accrued interest as discussed
below). The character of any gain or loss as capital or ordinary and, in the
case of capital gain or loss, as short-term or long-term, will depend on a
number of factors, including: (i) the tax status of the Holder of the Claim;
(ii) whether the Claim is a capital asset in the hands of the Holder; (iii)
whether the Claim has been held by the Holder for more than one year; (iv) the
extent to which the Holder previously claimed a loss or a bad debt deduction
with respect to the Claim; and (v) the extent to which the Holder acquired the
Claim at a market discount. The rules governing the character, timing, and
amount of bad debt deduction place considerable emphasis on the facts and
circumstances of the Holder, the obligor, and the instrument with respect to
which a deduction is claimed and are subject to the exchange provisions of
Section 1271 of the Internal Revenue Code. Holders of Senior Lien Notes or
Junior Lien Documents, therefore, should consult their tax advisors with
respect to their ability to take such a deduction.

 



 

(b) _Accrued Interest._ Consideration received by a Holder of a Senior Secured
Claim or the UBE Junior Secured Claim that is attributable to accrued but
unpaid interest will be treated as ordinary income, regardless of whether the
Holders existing Claims are capital assets in its hands.

 



 

The manner in which consideration is to be allocated between accrued and
unpaid interest and principal of the Claims of the Senior Secured Lenders and
the Junior Secured Lenders for federal income tax purposes is unclear under
present law. Although there can be no assurance with respect to this issue,
the consideration paid pursuant to the Plan with respect to the Senior Secured
Claims and the UBE Junior Secured Claim shall be allocated, pursuant to the
Plan, first to the principal amount of the Senior Secured Claims and the UBE
Junior Secured Claim as determined for federal income tax purposes and then to
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, with respect to the Senior Secured Claims
and the UBE Junior Secured Claim. Accordingly, in cases where a Holder of a
Senior Secured Claim or the UBE Junior Secured Claim receives distributions
under the Plan having a value less than the principal amount of the Senior
Secured Claim or the UBE Junior Secured Claim, the Debtors allocate the full
amount of consideration transferred to such Holder to the principal amount of
such claim and do not treat any amount of the consideration to be received by
such Holder as attributable to accrued and unpaid interest.

 



      
 

 



 

Holders should be aware, however, that the IRS may take a different position
with respect to the proper allocation.

 



 

 **Section 19.04 _Federal Income Tax Consequences to Holders of General
Unsecured Claims_**

 



 

(a) _Receipt of Liquidating Trust Interests by Holders of General Unsecured
Claims_. The Debtors will transfer the Liquidating Trust Assets to the
Liquidating Trust and will transfer Liquidating Trust interests to the Holders
of General Unsecured Claims. For federal income tax purposes, these transfers
will be treated as the transfer by the Debtors of a Pro Rata portion of the
Liquidating Trust Assets to the Holders of General Unsecured Claims in
satisfaction of their Claims, followed by the transfer by such Holders of a
Pro Rata portion of the Liquidating Trust Assets to the Liquidating Trust. A
Holder of a General Unsecured Claim will recognize gain or loss measured by
the difference between (i) the fair market value of its Pro Rata share of the
Liquidating Trust Assets it is treated as receiving (net of any liabilities it
is treated as assuming), and (ii) its basis in the Claims exchanged therefor
(other than any claims for accrued interest as discussed below). The character
of any gain or loss as capital or ordinary and, in the case of capital gain or
loss, as short-term or long-term, will depend on a number of factors,
including: (i) the tax status of the Holder of the Claim; (ii) whether the
Claim is a capital asset in the hands of the Holder; (iii) whether the Claim
has been held by the Holder for more than one year; (iv) the extent to which
the Holder previously claimed a loss or a bad debt deduction with respect to
the Claim; and (v) the extent to which the Holder acquired the Claim at a
market discount. The rules governing the character, timing, and amount of bad
debt deduction place considerable emphasis on the facts and circumstances of
the Holder, the obligor, and the instrument with respect to which a deduction
is claimed and are subject to the exchange provisions of Section 1271 of the
Internal Revenue Code. Holders of General Unsecured Claims, therefore, should
consult their tax advisors with respect to their ability to take such a
deduction.

 



 

The deemed contribution by the Holders of General Unsecured Claims of the
Liquidating Trusts Assets to the Liquidating Trust should not be a taxable
transaction.

 



 

(b) _Accrued Interest._ Consideration received by a Holder of a General
Unsecured Claim that is attributable to accrued but unpaid interest will be
treated as ordinary income, regardless of whether the Holders existing Claims
are capital assets in its hands.

 



 

The manner in which consideration is to be allocated between accrued and
unpaid interest and principal of the Claims of the Holders of General
Unsecured Claims for federal income tax purposes is unclear under present law.
Although there can be no assurance with respect to this issue, the
consideration paid pursuant to the Plan with respect to the General Unsecured
Claims shall be allocated, pursuant to the Plan, first to the principal amount
of the General Unsecured Claims as determined for federal income tax purposes
and then to accrued and unpaid interest, if any, with respect to the General
Unsecured Claims. Accordingly, in cases where a Holder of a General Unsecured
Claim receives distributions under the Plan having a value less than the
principal amount of the General Unsecured Claim, the Debtors allocate the full
amount of consideration transferred to such Holder to the principal amount of
such claim and do not treat any amount of the consideration to be received by
such Holder as attributable to accrued and

 



       
 

 



 

unpaid interest. Holders should be aware, however, that the IRS may take a
different position with respect to the proper allocation.

 



 

 **Section 19.05 _Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Liquidating Trust_**

 



 

(a) _Classification of the Liquidating Trust._ The Liquidating Trust will be
organized for the primary purpose of liquidating the Liquidating Trust Assets
transferred to it with no objective to continue or engage in the conduct of a
trade or business, except to the extent reasonably necessary to, and
consistent with, the liquidating purpose of the Liquidating Trust. Thus, the
Liquidating Trust is intended to be classified for federal income tax purposes
as a "Liquidating Trust" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section
301.7701-4(d). Under the Plan, all parties are required to treat the
Liquidating Trust as a "Liquidating Trust," subject to definitive guidance to
the contrary from the IRS. In general, a liquidating trust is not a separate
taxable entity but rather is treated as a grantor trust, pursuant to Sections
671 et seq. of the Internal Revenue Code, owned by the Persons who transfer
assets to it.

 



 

No request for a ruling from the IRS will be sought on the classification of
the Liquidating Trust. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the IRS
would not take a contrary position to the classification of the Liquidating
Trust. If the IRS were to challenge successfully the classification of the
Liquidating Trust as a grantor trust, the federal income tax consequences to
the Liquidating Trust and the Holders of General Unsecured Claims could vary
from those discussed herein (including the potential for an entity-level tax).

 



 

(b) _Allocation of Liquidating Trust Taxable Income and Loss And Disposition
of Trust Assets_. Each Holder of a Liquidating Trust interest must report on
its federal income tax return its allocable share of income, gain, loss,
deduction and credit recognized or incurred by the Liquidating Trust. None of
the Debtors NOLs (if any) will be available to reduce any income or gain of
the Liquidating Trust. Moreover, upon the sale or other disposition of any
Liquidating Trust Asset, each Holder of a Liquidating Trust interest must
report on its federal income tax return its share of any gain or loss measured
by the difference between (i) its Pro Rata share of the amount of cash and/or
the fair market value of any property received by the Liquidating Trust in
exchange for the Liquidating Trust Asset so sold or otherwise disposed of and
(ii) such Holders adjusted tax basis in its share of such Liquidating Trust
Asset. The character of any such gain or loss to any such Holder will be
determined as if such Holder itself had directly sold or otherwise disposed of
the Liquidating Trust Asset. The character of items of income, gain, loss,
deduction and credit to any Holder of a Liquidating Trust interest, and the
ability of such Holder to benefit from any deductions or losses, may depend on
the particular circumstances or status of such Holder.

 



 

As a grantor trust, each Holder of a Liquidating Trust interest has an
obligation to report its share of the Liquidating Trusts tax items (including
gain on the sale or other disposition of a Liquidating Trust Asset) that is
not dependent on the distribution of any Cash or other Liquidating Trust
Assets by the Liquidating Trust. Accordingly, a Holder of a Liquidating Trust
interest may incur a tax liability as a result of owning a share of the
Liquidating Trust Assets, regardless of whether the Liquidating Trust
distributes Cash or other Liquidating Trust Assets to the Holders. Although
the Liquidating Trust Agreement provides that the Liquidating Trust generally
make at least semi-annual distributions of Cash, due to the Liquidating
Trusts

 



      
 

 



 

requirement to satisfy certain liabilities, and due to possible differences in
the timing of income on, and the receipt of Cash from, the Liquidating Trust
Assets, a Holder of a Liquidating Trust interest may, in certain years, report
and pay tax on a greater amount of income than the amount of Cash received
from the Liquidating Trust by such Holder in such year.

 



 

 **Section 19.06 _Information Reporting and Backup Withholding_**

 



 

Certain payments, including the payments with respect to Claims pursuant to
the Plan, may be subject to information reporting by the Debtors or the
Liquidating Trust to the IRS. Moreover, such reportable payments may be
subject to backup withholding (currently at a rate of 28%) under certain
circumstances. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Rather, amounts
withheld under the backup withholding rules may be credited against a Holders
federal income tax liability, and a Holder may obtain a refund of any excess
amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules by timely filing an
appropriate claim for refund with the IRS (generally a U.S. federal income tax
return). The Debtors and the Liquidating Trust intend to comply with all
applicable reporting withholding requirements of the Internal Revenue Code.

 



 

Holders of Allowed Claims should consult their own tax advisors regarding
their qualification for exemption from backup withholding and information
reporting and the procedures for obtaining such an exemption.

 



 

The Treasury Regulations generally require disclosure by a taxpayer on its
U.S. federal income tax return of certain types of transactions in which the
taxpayer participated, including, among other types of transactions, certain
transactions that result in the taxpayers claiming a loss in excess of
certain thresholds. Holders of Allowed Claims should consult their own tax
advisors regarding these Treasury Regulations and whether the exchanges
contemplated by the Plan would be subject to these Treasury Regulations and
require disclosure on the Holders tax returns.

 



 

 **Section 19.07 _Importance of Obtaining Professional Tax Assistance_**

 



 

THE FOREGOING SUMMARY HAS BEEN PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY AS
MANDATED BY SECTION 1125 OF THE BANKRUPTCY CODE. THE TAX CONSEQUENCES ARE IN
MANY CASES UNCERTAIN AND MAY VARY DEPENDING ON A HOLDERS PARTICULAR
CIRCUMSTANCES. ALL HOLDERS OF CLAIMS AND EQUITY INTERESTS ARE URGED TO CONSULT
THEIR TAX ADVISORS CONCERNING THE FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL, AND OTHER TAX
CONSEQUENCES APPLICABLE UNDER THE PLAN.

 



 

 ** _ARTICLE XX_**

 



 

 ** _SECURITIES LAW MATTERS_**

 



 

 **Section 20.01 _Issuance and Delivery of Securities_**

 



 

The Debtors intend to issue New Interests to the Purchaser as part of the
Transaction. Pursuant to Section 2.02(c) of the Stalking Horse SPA. At the
Closing, Reorganized Cano will issue the New Interests and deliver to the
Purchaser certificates representing the New

 



      
 

 



 

Interests. Such certificates will bear the following restrictive legend:
"These securities have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended, or any state securities law. These securities may not be sold,
offered for sale, pledged or hypothecated in the absence of a registration
statement in effect with respect to the securities under the Securities Act
and any such state securities laws or the issuer has received documentation
reasonably satisfactory to it that such transaction does not require
registration under such Act and state securities laws."

 



 

Bankruptcy Code § 1145(a)(l) exempts the offer or sale of securities under a
chapter 11 plan of reorganization from registration under the Securities Act
and under state securities laws if three (3) principal requirements are
satisfied:

 



 

(a) the securities are offered or sold under a plan of reorganization and must
be securities of the debtors, of an affiliate participating in a joint plan
with the debtors or of a successor to the debtors under the plan;

 



 

(b) the recipients of the securities must hold a claim against, an interest
in, or a claim for an administrative expense against the debtors or such
affiliate; and

 



 

(c) the securities are offered or sold entirely in exchange for the
recipients claim against or interest in the debtors, or principally in such
exchange and partly for cash or property.

 



 

The New Interests shall be exempt from registration under any federal
(including the Securities Act), state or local law, rule or regulation
pursuant to Bankruptcy Code § 1145 or other applicable law requiring
registration prior to the offering, issuance, distribution or sale of
securities; provided that if the issuance of the New Interests does not
qualify for an exemption under Bankruptcy Code § 1145, the New Interests shall
be issued in a manner, which qualifies for any other available exemption from
registration, whether as a private placement under Rule 506 of the Securities
Act, Section 4(2) of the Securities Act, and/or the safe harbor provisions
promulgated thereunder with respect to transactions with accredited investors
or qualified institutional buyers and not involving a public offering.

 



 

In connection with the confirmation of the Plan, the Debtors intend to seek an
order from the Bankruptcy Court to the effect that the issuance of the New
Interests is exempt from registration under the Securities Act and state laws.

 



 

No registration rights will be provided with respect to holders of New
Interests.

 



 

 **Section 20.02 _Subsequent Transfers Under Federal Securities Laws_**

 



 

In general, all resales and subsequent transactions involving the New
Interests will be exempt from registration under the Securities Act under
Section 4(1) of the Securities Act, unless the holder is deemed to be an
"underwriter" with respect to such securities, an "affiliate" of the issuer of
such securities or a "dealer." Bankrupcy Code § 1145(b)(1) defines four types
of "underwriters":

 



 

(a) persons who purchase a claim against, an interest in, or a claim for
administrative expense against the debtors with a view to distributing any
security received or to be received in exchange for such a claim or interest
("accumulators");

 



      
 

 



 

(b) persons who offer to sell securities offered or sold under a plan for the
holders of such securities ("distributors");

 



 

(c) persons who offer to buy securities offered or sold under a plan from the
holders of the securities, if the offer to buy is (1) with a view to
distributing such securities and (2) made under an agreement in connection
with the plan or with the offer and sale of securities under the plan; and

 



 

(d) a person who is an "issuer" with respect to the securities, as the term
"issuer" is defined in Section 2(11) of the Securities Act.

 



 

Under Section 2(11) of the Securities Act, an "issuer" includes any
"affiliate" of the issuer, which means any person directly or indirectly
controlling or controlled by the issuer, or any person under direct or
indirect common control with the issuer. Under Section 2(12) of the Securities
Act, a "dealer" is any person who engages either for all or part of his or her
time, directly or indirectly, as agent, broker or principal, in the business
of offering, buying, selling or otherwise dealing or trading in securities
issued by another person.

 



 

The determination of whether a particular Person would be deemed to be an
"underwriter" or an "affiliate" with respect to any security to be issued
under the Plan, or would be deemed a "dealer," would depend on various facts
and circumstances applicable to that Person. Accordingly, the Debtors express
no view as to whether any Person would be an "underwriter" or an "affiliate"
with respect to any security to be issued under the Plan or would be a
"dealer."

 



 

ANY PERSON INTENDING TO RELY ON THIS EXEMPTION IS URGED TO CONSULT HIS OR HER
OWN COUNSEL AS TO THEIR APPLICABILITY TO HIS OR HER CIRCUMSTANCES.

 



 

 ** _ARTICLE XXI_**

 



 

 ** _BEST INTEREST OF CREDITORS TEST_**

 



 

 **Section 21.01 _Best Interest of Creditors Test_**

 



 

The Bankruptcy Code requires that the Bankruptcy Court find that the Plan is
in the best interest of all holders of Claims and Interests that are Impaired
by the Plan and that have not accepted the Plan as a requirement to confirm
the Plan. The "best interests" test, as set forth in Bankruptcy Code §
1129(a)(11), requires the Bankruptcy Court to find either that all members of
an Impaired Class of Claims or Interests have accepted the Plan or that the
Plan will provide a member who has not accepted the Plan with a recovery of
property of a value, as of the Effective Date of the Plan, that is not less
than the amount that such holder would receive or retain if the Debtors were
liquidated under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code on such date.

 



 

To calculate the probable distribution to members of each Impaired Class of
Claims and Interests if the Debtors were liquidated under chapter 7, the
Bankruptcy Court must first determine the aggregate dollar amount that would
be generated from the disposition of the Debtors property if liquidated in
chapter 7 cases under the Bankruptcy Code. This "liquidation

 



      
 

 



 

value" would consist primarily of the proceeds from a forced sale of the
Debtors property by a chapter 7 trustee.

 



 

The amount of liquidation value available to Holders of unsecured Claims
against the Debtors would be reduced by, first, the Claims of secured
creditors (to the extent of the value of their collateral), and by the costs
and expenses of liquidation, as well as by other administrative expenses and
costs of the chapter 7 cases. Costs of a chapter 7 liquidation of the debtors
would include the compensation of a chapter 7 trustee and his or her counsel
and other professionals, asset disposition expenses, and litigation costs. The
liquidation itself would trigger certain priority payments that otherwise
would be due in the ordinary course of business. Those priority claims would
be paid in full from the liquidation proceeds before the balance would be made
available to pay unsecured Claims or to make any distribution in respect of
Interests. The liquidation would also prompt the rejection of executory
contracts and unexpired leases and thereby create a significantly greater
amount of unsecured Claims.

 



 

In chapter 7 liquidation, no junior class of Claims or Interests may be paid
unless all classes of Claims or Interests senior to such junior class are paid
in full. Bankruptcy Code § 510(a) provides that subordination agreements are
enforceable in a bankruptcy case to the same extent that such subordination is
enforceable under applicable non-bankruptcy law. Therefore, no class of Claims
or Interests that is contractually subordinated to another class would receive
any payment on account of its Claims or Interests, unless and until such
senior classes were paid in full.

 



 

In a chapter 7 liquidation, unsecured creditors and equity holders of a debtor
are paid from available assets generally in the following order, with no
junior class receiving any payments until all amounts due to senior classes
have been paid fully or any such payment is provided for:

 



 

* Secured creditors (to the extent of the value of their collateral);

 



 

* Administrative and other priority creditors;

 



 

* Unsecured creditors;

 



 

* Debt expressly subordinated by its terms or by order of the Bankruptcy Court; and

 



 

* Equity holders.

 



 

Once the Bankruptcy Court ascertains the recoveries in liquidation of the
Debtors secured and priority creditors, it would then determine the probable
distribution to unsecured creditors from the remaining available proceeds of
the liquidation. If this probable distribution has a value greater than the
value of distributions to be received by the unsecured creditors under the
Plan, then the Plan is not in the best interests of creditors and cannot be
confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court.

 



 

As shown in the Liquidation Analysis attached as **_Exhibit D_** , the Debtors
believe that each member of each Class of Impaired Claims and Interests will
receive at least as much, if not

 



      
 

 



 

more, under the Plan as it would receive if the Debtors were liquidated.
Accordingly, the Plan satisfies the best interest of Creditors Test.

 



 

 **Section 21.02 _Liquidation Analysis_**

 



 

The Debtors believe that the value of any distributions in a chapter 7 case
would be less than the value of distributions under the Plan. The Debtors
belief is based primarily on:

 



 

* consideration of the effects that a chapter 7 liquidation would have on the ultimate proceeds available for distribution to holders of Impaired Claims and Interests, including:

 



 

* increased costs and expenses of a liquidation under chapter 7 arising from fees payable to one or more chapter 7 trustees and professional advisors to such trustee(s), who may not be familiar with the Debtors industry and business operations;

 



 

* erosion in value of assets in a chapter 7 case in the context of the rapid liquidation required under chapter 7 and the "forced sale" atmosphere that would prevail in todays negative environment for the sale of oil and gas production assets;

 



 

* significant adverse effects on the Debtors businesses as a result of the likely departure of key employees;

 



 

* substantial increases in Claims, as well as substantially increased estimated contingent Claims, lease and contract rejection Claims;

 



 

* substantial delay in distributions, if any, to the holders of Claims and Interests that would likely ensue in a chapter 7 liquidation; and

 



 

* the Liquidation Analysis prepared by the Debtors.

 



 

 ** _ARTICLE XXII_**

 



 

 ** _ALTERNATIVES TO CONFIRMATION AND CONSUMMATION OF THE PLAN_**

 



 

The Debtors believe that the Plan affords Holders of Claims and Interests the
potential for the greatest realization on the Debtors property and,
therefore, is in the best interests of such Holders. If, however, enough
acceptances received from the Impaired Classes sufficient for the Debtors to
confirm the Plan are not received, or the Plan is not subsequently confirmed
and consummated, the theoretical alternatives include: (a) liquidation of the
Debtors under chapter 7 or chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code; and (b)
formulation of an alternative plan of reorganization.

 



      
 

 



 

 **Section 22.01 _Alternative Plan(s)_**

 



 

If enough acceptances to confirm the Plan are not received or if the Plan is
not confirmed, the Debtors (or, if the Debtors exclusive periods in which to
file and solicit acceptances of a reorganization plan have expired, any other
party-in-interest) could attempt to formulate and propose a different plan or
plans of reorganization. Such a plan or plans might involve either a
reorganization and continuation of the Debtors businesses, or an orderly
liquidation of assets.

 



 

A likely scenario would involve the Debtors turning over all assets to the
Pre-Petition Secured Lenders and immediately ceasing operations. The Debtors
believe that the Plan, as described herein, enables Holders of Claims and
Interests to realize the highest and best value under the circumstances. The
Debtors believe that this scenario or any other alternative form of chapter 11
plan is a much less attractive alternative to creditors than the Plan because
of the far greater returns and certainty provided by the Plan. Other
alternatives could involve diminished recoveries, significant delay,
uncertainty, and substantial additional administrative costs.

 



 

 **Section 22.02 _Liquidation Under Chapter 7_**

 



 

If no plan can be confirmed, the Debtors Chapter 11 Cases may be converted to
cases under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, pursuant to which a chapter 7
trustee would be appointed (or elected) to liquidate the Debtors assets for
distribution in accordance with the priorities established by the Bankruptcy
Code. A discussion of the effects that a chapter 7 liquidation would have on
the recoveries of Holders of Claims and Interests is set forth below. The
Debtors believe that a chapter 7 liquidation would result in smaller
distributions to creditors than those provided for in the Plan because of: (a)
the likelihood that the property of the Debtors would have to be sold or
otherwise disposed of in a less orderly fashion over a shorter period of time;
(b) additional administrative expenses involved in the appointment of a
trustee; and (c) additional expenses and claims, some of which would be
entitled to priority, which would be generated during the liquidation and from
the rejection of leases and other executory contracts in connection with a
cessation of the Debtors operations.

 



 

Specifically, the Debtors costs of a chapter 7 liquidation would include the
fees payable to a chapter 7 trustee, as well as those fees that might be
payable to attorneys and other professionals that the trustee might engage. In
addition, claims would arise by reason of the breach or rejection of
obligations incurred and leases and executory contracts assumed or entered
into by the Debtors during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases. The foregoing
types of claims and other claims that might arise in a liquidation case or
result from the pending Chapter 11 Cases, including any unpaid expenses
incurred by the Debtors and the Committee (if any) during the Chapter 11 Cases
such as compensation for attorneys, financial advisors and accountants, would
be paid in full from the liquidation proceeds before the balance of those
proceeds would be made available to pay the Allowed General Unsecured Claims.

 



 

To determine if the Plan is in the best interests of each Impaired Class, the
value of the distributions from the proceeds of a liquidation of the Debtors
unencumbered assets and properties, after subtracting the amounts attributable
to the foregoing claims, are then compared with the value of the property
offered to such Classes of Claims and Interests under the Plan.

 



      
 

 



 

After considering the effects that a chapter 7 liquidation would have on the
ultimate proceeds available for distribution to the Holders of Claims and
Interests in the Chapter 11 Cases, including (i) the increased costs and
expenses of a chapter 7 liquidation arising from fees payable to a chapter 7
trustee in bankruptcy and professional advisors to the trustee; (ii) the
likely erosion in value of assets in a chapter 7 case in the context of an
expeditious liquidation and the "forced sale" atmosphere that would prevail
under a chapter 7 liquidation; and (iii) the substantial increases in Claims
which would be satisfied on a priority basis or on parity with creditors in
the Chapter 11 Cases, the Debtors have determined that Confirmation of the
Plan will provide each Holder of an Allowed Claim or Interest with a recovery
that is not less than such Holder would receive pursuant to a chapter 7
liquidation.

 



 

The Debtors Liquidation Analysis provides a summary of the liquidation values
of the Debtors assets, assuming a chapter 7 liquidation in which a chapter 7
trustee appointed by the Bankruptcy Court would liquidate the assets of the
Debtors estates. The Liquidation Analysis was prepared by the Debtors.

 



 

Underlying the Liquidation Analysis are a number of estimates and assumptions
that, although developed and considered reasonable by management, are
inherently subject to significant economic and competitive uncertainties and
contingencies beyond the control of the Debtors and their management. The
Liquidation Analysis is also based on assumptions with regard to liquidation
decisions that are subject to change. Accordingly, the values reflected might
not be realized if the Debtors were, in fact, to undergo such a liquidation.
The chapter 7 liquidation period is assumed to be a period of 6 months,
allowing for, among other things, the (i) discontinuation of the Debtors
operations; (ii) sale of property; and (iii) collection of receivables.

 



 

 ** _ARTICLE XXIII_**

 



 

 ** _VOTING PROCEDURES AND 
CONFIRMATION REQUIREMENTS_**

 



 

 **Section 23.01 _Ballots and Voting Deadline_**

 



 

A Ballot for voting to accept or reject the Plan is enclosed with this
Disclosure Statement, and has been mailed to holders of Claims and Interests
entitled to vote. After carefully reviewing this Disclosure Statement and all
exhibits, including the Plan, each holder of a Claim entitled to vote should
indicate its vote on the enclosed Ballot. All holders of Claims or Interests
entitled to vote must (i) carefully review the Ballot and instructions
thereon, (ii) execute the Ballot, and (iii) return it to the address indicated
on the Ballot by the Voting Deadline (defined below) for the Ballot to be
considered.

 



 

The Bankruptcy Court has directed that, in order to be counted for voting
purposes, Ballots for the acceptance or rejection of the Plan must be received
by the Balloting Agent **no later than , 2012 at :00 p.m. Central Standard
Time**, (the " _Voting Deadline_ ") at the following address:

 



 

 



      
 

 



 

 

 

ANY BALLOTS RECEIVED AFTER THE VOTING DEADLINE WILL NOT BE COUNTED.

 



 

 **Section 23.02 _Holders of Claims Entitled to Vote_**

 



 

Except as otherwise provided in the Plan, any holder of a Claim against the
Debtors whose claim is impaired under the Plan is entitled to vote, if either
(i) the Debtors have scheduled the holders Claim at a specific amount other
than $0.00 (and such Claim is not scheduled as "disputed," "contingent," or
"unliquidated") or (ii) the holder of such Claim has filed a Proof of Claim on
or before the deadline set by the Bankruptcy Court for such filings in a
liquidated amount. Any holder of a Claim as to which an objection has been
filed (and such objection is still pending as of the time of confirmation of
the Plan) is _not_ entitled to vote, unless the Bankruptcy Court (on motion by
a party whose Claim is subject to an objection) temporarily allows the Claim
in an amount that it deems proper for the purpose of accepting or rejecting
the Plan. Such motion must be heard and determined by the Bankruptcy Court
before the first date set by the Bankruptcy Court for the Confirmation Hearing
of the Plan. In addition, the vote of a holder of a Claim may be disregarded
if the Bankruptcy Court determines that the holders acceptance or rejection
was not solicited or procured in good faith or in accordance with the
applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.

 



 

 **Section 23.03 _Classes Impaired Under the Plan_**

 



 

Priority Non-Tax Claims (Classes A1, B1, C1, D1, E1, F1, G1, H1 and I1),
Miscellaneous Secured Claims (Classes A4, B4, C4, D4, E2, F4, G4, H4 and I4)
and Royalty Claims (Classes B7, C7, D7 and G7) are not impaired under the
Plan. Pursuant to Bankruptcy Code § 1126(f), holders of Priority Non-Tax
Claims, Miscellesnous Seucred Claims, and Royalty Claims are conclusively
presumed to have accepted the Plan, and therefore are not entitled to vote to
accept or reject the Plan.

 



 

The Senior Secured Claims (Classes A2, B2, C2, D2, F2, G2, H2 and I2), UBE
Junior Secured Claims (Classes A3, B3, C3, D3, F3, G3, H3 and I3), and General
Unsecured Claims (Classes A5, B5, C5, D5, E3, F5, G5, H5 and I5), are impaired
under the Plan and are entitled to vote to accept or reject the Plan.

 



 

Holders of Intercompany Claims (Classes A6, B6, C6, D6, E4, F6, G6, H6 and
I6), Preferred Stock (Class A7), and Interests (Classes A8, B8, C8, D8, E4,
F7, G8, H7 and I7) are impaired under the Plan, but will not not receive or
retain any property under the Plan. As such, holders of Intercomapny Claims,
Preferred Stock, and Interst are conclusivedly deemed to reject the Plan, and
therefore, are not entitled to vote to accept or reject the Plan.

 



 

 **Section 23.04 _Information on Voting and Ballots_**

 



 

(a) _Transmission of Ballots to Creditors. _Ballots are being forwarded to all
holders of Claims entitled to vote. Those holders of Claims whose Claims are
unimpaired under the Plan

 



      
 

 



 

are conclusively presumed to have accepted the Plan under Bankruptcy Code
Section 1126(f), and therefore need not vote with regard to the Plan.

 



 

(b) _Ballot Tabulation Procedures_. For purposes of voting on the Plan, the
amount and classification of a Claim and the procedures that will be used to
tabulate acceptances and rejections of the Plan shall be exclusively as
follows:

 



 

(i) If no Proof of Claim has been timely filed, the voted amount of a Claim
shall be equal to the amount listed for the particular Claim in the Schedules,
as and if amended, to the extent such Claim is not listed as "contingent,"
"unliquidated," or "disputed," and the Claim shall be placed in the
appropriate Class, based on the Debtors records, and consistent with the
Schedules of Assets and Liabilities and the Claims registry of the Clerk of
the Bankruptcy Court (the " _Clerk_ ");

 



 

(ii) If a Proof of Claim has been timely filed, and has not been objected to
before the expiration of the Voting Deadline, the voted amount of that Claim
shall be as specified in the Proof of Claim filed with the Clerk;

 



 

(iii) Subject to subparagraph (d) below, a Claim that is the subject of an
objection filed before the Voting Deadline shall be disallowed for voting
purposes;

 



 

(iv) If a Claim has been estimated or otherwise allowed for voting purposes by
order of the Bankruptcy Court, the voted amount and classification shall be
that set by the Bankruptcy Court;

 



 

(v) If a holder of a Claim or its authorized representative did not use the
Ballot form provided by the Debtors, or the Official Ballot Form authorized
under the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, such vote will not be
counted;

 



 

(vi) If the Ballot is not received by the Balloting Agent on or before the
Voting Deadline at the place fixed by the Bankruptcy Court, the Ballot will
not be counted;

 



 

(vii) If the Ballot is not signed by the holder of a Claim or its authorized
representative the Ballot will not be counted;

 



 

(viii) If the individual or institution casting the Ballot (whether directly
or as a representative) was not the holder of a Claim on the Voting Record
Date (as that term is defined below), the Ballot will not be counted;

 



 

(ix) If the holder of a Claim or its authorized representative did not check
one of the boxes indicating acceptance or rejection of the Plan, or checked
both such boxes, the Ballot will not be counted;

 



 

(x) Whenever a holder of a Claim submits more than one Ballot voting the same
Claim(s) before the applicable deadline for submission of Ballots, except as
otherwise directed by the Bankruptcy Court after notice and a hearing, the
last such Ballot shall be deemed to reflect the voters intent and shall
supersede any prior Ballots.

 



       
 

 



 

(c) _Execution of Ballots by Representatives. _If a Ballot is signed by
trustees, executors, administrators, guardians, attorneys-in-fact, officers of
corporations, or others acting in a fiduciary or representative capacity, such
persons _must_ indicate their capacity when signing and, at the Debtors
request, must submit proper evidence satisfactory to the Debtors of their
authority to so act.

 



 

(d) _Waivers of Defects and Other Irregularities Regarding Ballots. _Unless
otherwise directed by the Bankruptcy Court, all questions concerning the
validity, form, eligibility (including time of receipt), acceptance, and
revocation or withdrawal of Ballots will initially be determined by the
Debtors, subject to review by the Bankruptcy Court, whose determination will
be final and binding.

 



 

(e) _Withdrawal of Ballots and Revocation. _Any holder of a Claim in an
impaired Class who has delivered a valid Ballot for the acceptance or
rejection of the Plan may withdraw such acceptance or rejection by delivering
a written notice of withdrawal to counsel for the Debtors at any time before
the Voting Deadline.

 



 

To be valid, a notice of withdrawal must: (i) contain the description of the
Claims to which it relates and the aggregate principal amount, represented by
such Claims; (ii) be signed by the holder of the Claim or Interest in the same
manners as the Ballot; and (iii) be received by counsel for the Debtors in a
timely manner at the addresses set forth herein. The Debtors expressly reserve
the absolute right to contest the validity of any such withdrawals of Ballots.

 



 

Unless otherwise directed by the Bankruptcy Court, a purported notice of
withdrawal of Ballot that is not received in a timely will not be effective to
withdraw a previously furnished Ballot.

 



 

Any holder of a Claim who has previously submitted a properly completed Ballot
before the Voting Deadline may revoke such Ballot and change its vote by
submitting to the Balloting Agent before the Voting Deadline a subsequent,
properly completed Ballot for acceptance or rejection of the Plan.

 



 

 **Section 23.05** ** ****_The Confirmation Hearing_**

 



 

Bankruptcy Code § 1128(a) requires the Bankruptcy Court, after notice, to hold
a Confirmation Hearing. Bankruptcy Code § 1128(b) provides that any party-in-
interest may object to Confirmation of the Plan.

 



 

The Bankruptcy Court has scheduled the Confirmation Hearing for
, 2012, at a.m./p.m., prevailing Central Time, before the Honorable
, United States Bankruptcy Judge, United States Bankruptcy Court for the
Northern District of Texas at the United States Courthouse, Earle Cabell
Federal Building, 14th Floor, 1100 Commerce Street, Dallas, Texas 75242.

 



 

Objections to Confirmation of the Plan must be filed and served on the Debtors
and the other parties set forth in this Disclosure Statement Order, and
certain other parties, by no later than , 2012, at
a.m./p.m. prevailing Central Time, in accordance with this Disclosure
Statement Order. THE BANKRUPTCY COURT MAY NOT CONSIDER

 



      
 

 



 

OBJECTIONS TO CONFIRMATION OF THE PLAN IF ANY SUCH OBJECTIONS HAVE NOT BEEN
TIMELY SERVED AND FILED IN COMPLIANCE WITH THIS DISCLOSURE STATEMENT ORDER.

 



 

The notice of the Confirmation Hearing will contain, among other things, the
deadline to object to Confirmation of the Plan, the Voting Deadline, and the
date and time of the Confirmation Hearing.

 



 

 **Section 23.06** ** ****_Statutory Requirements for Confirmation of the
Plan_**

 



 

At the Confirmation Hearing, the Bankruptcy Court shall determine whether the
requirements of Bankruptcy Code § 1129 have been satisfied. The Debtors
believe that the Plan satisfies or will satisfy the applicable requirements,
as follows:

 



 

* The Plan complies with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.

 



 

* The Debtors, as Plan proponent, will have complied with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code

 



 

* The Plan has been proposed in good faith and not by any means forbidden by law.

 



 

* Any payment made or promised under the Plan for services or for costs and expenses in, or in connection with, the Chapter 11 Cases, or in connection with the Plan and incident to the case, has been disclosed to the Bankruptcy Court, and any such payment: (a) made before the Confirmation of the Plan is reasonable; or (b) subject to the approval of the Bankruptcy Court as reasonable if it is to be fixed after the Confirmation of the Plan.

 



 

* The Debtors, as Plan proponent, have disclosed the identity and affiliations of any individual proposed to serve, after Confirmation of the Plan, as a director, officer, or voting trustee of the Debtors, an Affiliate of the Debtors participating in the Plan with the Debtors, or a successor to the Debtors under the Plan, and the appointment to, or continuance in, such office of such individual is consistent with the interests of creditors and equity holders and with public policy.

 



 

* The Debtors, as Plan proponent, have disclosed the identity of any insider (as defined in Bankruptcy Code section 101) that will be employed or retained by Reorganized Cano, and the nature of any compensation for such insider.

 



 

* The Plan does not propose any rate change that is subject to approval by a governmental regulatory commission.

 



 

* Either each Holder of an Impaired Claim or Interest has accepted the Plan, or will receive or retain under the Plan on account of that Claim or Interest, property of a value, as of the Effective Date of the Plan, that is not less than the amount that the Holder would receive or retain if the Debtors were liquidated on that date under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code.

 



      
 

 



 

* Each Class of Claims that is entitled to vote on the Plan has either accepted the Plan or is not Impaired under the Plan, or the Plan can be confirmed without the approval of each voting Class pursuant to Bankruptcy Code § 1129(b).

 



 

* Except to the extent that the Holder of a particular Claim will agree to a different treatment of its Claim, the Plan provides that Administrative Claims, Priority Tax Claims and, Priority Non-Tax will be paid in full, in Cash, on the Effective Date, or as soon thereafter as practicable.

 



 

* At least one Class of Impaired Claims will accept the Plan, determined without including any acceptance of the Plan by any insider holding a Claim of that Class.

 



 

* Confirmation of the Plan is not likely to be followed by the liquidation or the need for further financial reorganization of the Debtors or any successors thereto under the Plan unless such a liquidation or reorganization is proposed in the Plan.

 



 

* All fees of the type described in 28 U.S.C. § 1930, including the fees of the United States Trustee, will be paid as of the Effective Date.

 



 

* The Debtors have no retirement benefit obligations except for 401(k) plans, and such plans will be rolled over.

 



 

The Debtors believe that: (a) the Plan satisfies or will satisfy all of the
statutory requirements of chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code; (b) it has
complied or will have complied with all of the requirements of chapter 11; and
(c) the Plan has been proposed in good faith.

 



 

 **Section 23.07** ** ****_Acceptance by Impaired Class_**

 



 

The Bankruptcy Code requires, as a condition to Confirmation, that, except as
described in the following section, each Class of Claims or Interests that is
Impaired under the Plan accept the Plan. A class that is not impaired under a
plan of reorganization is deemed to have accepted the plan and, therefore,
solicitation of acceptances with respect to such class is not required. A
class is impaired unless the plan: (a) leaves unaltered the legal, equitable
and contractual rights to which the claim or interest entitles the holder of
that claim or interest; or (b) notwithstanding any contractual provision or
applicable law that entitles the holder of such claim or interest after the
occurrence of a default(1) cures any such default that occurred before or
after the commencement of the case under this title, other than a default of a
kind specified in Bankruptcy Code § 365(b)(2) of this title or of a kind that
Bankruptcy Code § 365(b)(2) expressly does not require to be cured; (2)
reinstates the maturity of such claim or interest; (3) compensates the holder
of such claim or interest for any damages incurred as a result of any
reasonable reliance by such holder on such contractual provision or such
applicable law; and (4) if such claim or such interest arises from any failure
to perform a nonmonetary obligation, other than a default arising from failure
to operate a nonresidential real property lease subject to Bankruptcy Code §
365(b)(1)(A), compensates the holder of such claim or such interest (other
than the debtor or an insider) for any actual pecuniary loss incurred by such
holder as a result of such failure; and (5) does not otherwise alter the
legal, equitable, or contractual rights to which such claim or interest
entitles the holder of such claim or interest.

 



      
 

 



 

 **Section 23.08** ** ****_Confirmation Without Acceptance of All Impaired
Classes_**

 



 

Bankruptcy Code § 1129(b) allows a bankruptcy court to confirm a plan, even if
an impaired classes entitled to vote on the plan has not accepted it, provided
that the plan has been accepted by at least one impaired Class. Holders of
Interests in Classes A8, A9, B8, C8, D8, E8, F8, G8 and I8 are deemed to
reject the Plan and, therefore, the Debtors intend to confirm the plan
pursuant to Bankruptcy Code § 1129(b). Bankruptcy Code § 1129(b) states that,
notwithstanding an impaired classs failure to accept a plan of
reorganization, the plan shall be confirmed, at the plan proponents request,
in a procedure commonly known as "cram down," so long as the plan does not
"discriminate unfairly" and is "fair and equitable" with respect to each class
of claims or equity interests that is impaired under, and has not accepted,
the plan.

 



 

The condition that a plan be "fair and equitable" with respect to a non-
accepting class of unsecured claims includes the following requirement that

_AND (F) RELATED RELIEF_**

 



 

Having considered the _Debtors  Motion to (A) Approve the Stock Purchase
Agreement and Authorize the Debtors to Enter Into the Stock Purchase Agreement
and Comply with Their Obligations Thereunder; (B) Approve Break-Up Fee in
Connection with the Transaction Contemplated by the Stock Purchase Agreement;
(C) Approve the Procedures for the Solicitation_

 _of Higher or Better Offers; (D) Approve the Form and Manner of Notice; (E)
Approve Procedures for Determining Cure Amounts for Executory Contracts and
Unexpired Leases; and (F) Grant Related Relief_ (the " _Motion_ ")(1), the
Court finds that: (a) jurisdiction over the matters in the Motion is proper
pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1334 and 157; (b) venue in this Court is proper
pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1408 and 1409; (c) proper and adequate notice of the
Motion has been provided and no further notice is needed; (d) the relief
sought in the Motion is in the best interest of the Debtors estates, their
creditors, and all parties-in-interest; and (e) good and sufficient cause
exist for granting the relief requested in the Motion. The Court further finds
and determines:

 



 

A. The record at the hearings on the Motion (the " _Bid Protections Hearing_
") is incorporated by reference herein and, among other things, forms the
basis for the findings of fact and conclusions of law set forth herein.

 



 

B. The Bid Procedures substantially in the form attached as **_Exhibit A_**,
are fair, reasonable and appropriate and are designed to maximize the value of
the Debtors estates.

 



 

C. The Debtors have demonstrated a compelling and sound business justification
for authorization (1) to enter into the Stalking Horse SPA(2) with NBI, and
(2) to perform all of their respective obligations thereunder, including the
Break-Up Fee payment to the Stalking Horse in the amount of $1,475,000 under
the circumstances described in the Stalking Horse SPA.

 



 

D. The Stalking Horse has expended, and likely will continue to expend,
considerable time, money and energy pursuing the Transaction and has engaged
in extended and lengthy good faith negotiations. In particular, the Stalking
Horse SPA is part of an extensive process undertaken by the Debtors and their
professionals to identify and negotiate a transaction

  (1) All capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the meaning ascribed
to them in the Motion.

 



 

(2) See _Exhibit A_ to the Motion.

 



      
 

 



 

that the Debtors believe to be the highest or best proposal for an
acquisition of the Debtors, to maximize the value realized for the benefit of
the Debtors estates, their creditors and other parties in interest.

 



 

E. The Stalking Horse SPA, including the Break-Up Fee, was negotiated,
proposed and entered into by the Debtors and the Stalking Horse without
collusion, in good faith and from arms length bargaining positions.

 



 

F. The Break-Up Fee (1) is an actual and necessary cost of preserving the
Debtors estates within the meaning of section 503(b) and 507(a) of the
Bankruptcy Code; (2) confers a real and substantial benefit upon the Debtors
estates; (3) is reasonable and appropriate in light of, among other things (a)
the size and nature of the Transaction and the Plan(3) and comparable
transactions; (b) the substantial efforts that have been and will be expended
by the Stalking Horse; and (c) the benefits the Stalking Horse has provided to
the Debtors estates, their creditors and other parties-in-interest,
notwithstanding the fact that the Stalking Horse SPA may be terminated by the
Debtors if any higher or otherwise better transaction is identified; and (4)
is necessary to induce NBI to serve as a "stalking horse" and to continue to
pursue the Transaction.

 



 

G. The grant, allowance, and payment of the Break-Up Fee are in the best
interest of the Debtors, their respective estates, and creditors. The Break-Up
Fee induced the Stalking Horse to submit a bid that will serve as a minimum
floor on which the Debtors, their creditors and other bidders may rely. The
Stalking Horse has provided a material benefit to the Debtors and their
creditors (and the Debtors have received a material benefit) by increasing the
likelihood that the best possible price for the New Cano Stock or the Acquired
Property (as defined in the Plan) will be received.

  (3) Dkt. No. .

 



      
 

 



 

H. The Debtors payment of the Break-Up Fee to the Stalking Horse under the
terms and conditions set forth in the Stalking Horse SPA should be approved
because, among other things: (1) the protection afforded to the Stalking Horse
by the Break-Up Fee was a material inducement for, and express condition of,
the Stalking Horses willingness to enter into the Stalking Horse SPA; and (2)
the Stalking Horse is unwilling to commit to hold open its offer to effect the
Transaction under the terms and conditions of the Stalking Horse SPA unless it
is assured of payment of the Break-Up Fee as provided therein. Thus, assurance
to the Stalking Horse of payment of the Break-Up Fee has promoted (and will
promote) more competitive bidding by, among other things, inducing NBIs
offer, which offer otherwise would not have been made and without which
competitive bidding would be limited. Further, the Break-Up Fee induced the
Stalking Horse to conduct due diligence with respect to the Transaction. Thus,
the Stalking Horse has provided a material and substantial benefit to the
Debtors estates, their creditors and other parties-in-interest by increasing
the likelihood that the price for the Acquired Property reflect their true
value. Accordingly, the Bid Procedures and the Break-Up Fee are fair,
reasonable and appropriate and represent the best method for maximizing value
for the benefit of the Debtors estates.

 



 

I. The service of the Transaction Notice substantially in the form attached as
**_Exhibit B_**, and the service of one or more subsequent notices (the "
_Supplemental Notices_ "), for which the Courts approval will be sought,
advising parties of, among other things, (1) the deadline to file objections
to the Transaction; and (2) the date of the Combined Hearing, are adequate and
reasonably calculated to provide due, proper, and timely notice to all
interested parties of (a) the Bid Procedures; (b) the Auction of, and/or
transaction involving, the New Cano Shares or the Acquired Property; (c) the
deadline to object to the Transaction, and (iv) the

 



      
 

 



 

hearing to consider the sale of the Acquired Property (the " _Sale Hearing_ ")
and the Confirmation Hearing in accordance with Bankruptcy Rule 2002 and the
applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.(4) No other or further notice
is necessary.

 



 

J. The service of the notice of the assumption and/or assignment of executory
contracts and unexpired leases (the " _Assumption Notice_ "), substantially in
the form attached as **_Exhibit C_,** is adequate and reasonably calculated
to provide due, proper and timely notice to all counterparties of the
potential assumption (and, if applicable, assignment) of their executory
contracts and unexpired leases and the Cure Amounts. No other or further
notice is necessary.

 



 

K. The findings of fact and conclusions of law herein constitute the Courts
findings of fact and conclusions of law for the purposes of Bankruptcy Rule
7052, made applicable pursuant to Bankruptcy Rule 9014. To the extent any
findings of facts are conclusions of law, they are adopted as such. To the
extent any conclusions of law are findings of fact, they are adopted as such.

 



 

 **NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT**:

 



 

1. The Motion is **GRANTED** in its entirety and as set forth herein.

 



 

2. All objections to the relief requested in the Motion, if any, that have not been withdrawn, waived, or settled as announced to the Court at the Bid Protections Hearing are denied and **OVERRULED** in their entirety on the merits, with prejudice.

 



 

3. The Stalking Horse SPA, including all schedules, addendums, exhibits, annexes, or other attachments thereto, is hereby **APPROVED** , and the Debtors are hereby granted the power and authority to execute, and deliver, and to perform all of their obligations under, the Stalking Horse SPA and all of the other Transaction Documents as defined therein. 

  (4) In the event that the Plan is not confirmed for any reason, these Bid
Procedures may be used in conjunction with and to support a sale of assets
pursuant to a motion filed with the Bankruptcy Court provided that any
distributions of proceeds from such sale shall be subject to further Order of
the Bankruptcy Court.

 



      
 

 



 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the consummation of the Transaction shall
remain subject to the entry of an Order confirming the Plan.

 



 

4. The Bid Procedures are hereby **APPROVED** in their entirety in the form attached as **_Exhibit A_**. The Debtors are authorized to take any and all actions necessary or appropriate to implement the Bid Procedures.

 



 

5. The process for submitting Qualified Bids (as defined in the Bid Procedures) is fair, reasonable and appropriate and is designed to maximize recoveries for the benefit of the Debtors estates, their creditors and other parties in interest. The Debtors may proceed with the Transaction, as applicable, in accordance with the Bid Procedures. Any disputes as to the selection of the Qualifying Bid, Initial Highest Bid and/or Successful Bid (all as defined in the Bid Procedures) shall be resolved by this Court.

 



 

6. The Debtors shall serve this Order by (a) first class United States mail, postage prepaid on the parties identified on the Master Service List (who do not receive electronic notice) at the addresses set forth therein; and (b) the Courts electronic filing system (" _ECF_ ") on those parties receiving electronic notice by such system.

 



 

7. The Transaction Notice, in the form attached as **_Exhibit B_**, is hereby **APPROVED**.

 



 

8. Within five (5) business days after the Court enters this Order, the Debtors shall serve the Transaction Notice by (a) first class United States mail, postage prepaid on (i) the parties identified on the Master Service List maintained in these Cases (who do not receive electronic notice) at the addresses set forth therein; (ii) the parties identified on the Creditor Matrix filed in these Cases at the addresses set forth therein; (iii) the parties that have filed proofs of claim in these Cases at the addresses set forth in the respective proofs of claim; (iv) the 

 



      
 

 



 

counterparties to executory contracts and unexpired leases with one or more of
the Debtors; (v) all other parties who have expressed an interest in acquiring
or in investing in the Debtors or any of their assets or interests; and (vi)
the Debtors equity holders; (b) the Courts ECF on those parties receiving
electronic notice by such system; (c) by publication of the Transaction Notice
in the national edition of _The Wall Street Journal_ and other periodicals of
the Debtors choice, if any.

 



 

9. The Transaction Notice shall be deemed proper, due, timely, good, and sufficient notice of, among other things, the entry of this Order, the Bid Procedures, the Auction (if required under the Bid Procedures), the Sale Hearing, the Confirmation Hearing, and the proposed Transaction, including the vesting or transferring of substantially all of the Debtors assets free and clear of any and all Liens (as defined in the Plan), claims and other interests except as otherwise set forth in the Plan, and the procedure for objecting thereto.

 



 

10. The Assumption Notice, in the form attached as **_Exhibit C_**, is hereby **APPROVED**.

 



 

11. The Assumption Notice (a) contains the type of information required under Bankruptcy Rule 2002 that is currently known to the Debtors; and (b) is reasonably calculated to provide due, adequate and timely notice to all interested parties of (i) the potential assumption (and, as applicable, assignment) of executory contracts and unexpired leases, and (ii) the maximum amount and manner offered to satisfy the Cure Amounts.

 



 

12. Within five (5) business days after the Court enters this Order, the Debtors shall serve the Assumption Notice by (a) first class United States mail, postage prepaid on (i) the parties identified on the Master Service List maintained in these Cases (who do not receive electronic notice) at the addresses set forth therein, and (ii) all counterparties to executory

 



       
 

 



 

contracts and unexpired leases of the Desired 365 Contracts; and (b) the
Courts ECF on those parties receiving electronic notice by such system.

 



 

13. The Assumption Notice is deemed proper, due, timely, good, and sufficient notice of, among other things, the proposed assumption (and, if applicable, assignment) of the Desired 365 Contracts, the Cure Amounts, and the procedures for objecting thereto.

 



 

14. The Auction is necessary to determine whether any person, other than the Stalking Horse, is willing to enter into a definitive agreement on terms and conditions more favorable to the Debtors than the Stalking Horse SPA. The protections afforded to Stalking Horse by the Break-Up Fee were material inducements for, and express conditions of, the Stalking Horses willingness to enter into the Stalking Horse SPA, given the possibility that the Debtors may terminate the Stalking Horse SPA if a higher or otherwise better offer is identified. The Stalking Horse has indicated that it is unwilling to commit to hold open its proposal to consummate the Transaction under the terms and conditions of the Stalking Horse SPA absent approval of the Break-Up Fee.

 



 

15. The Break-Up Fee as set forth in the Stalking Horse SPA is hereby **APPROVED**.

 



 

16. The Break-Up Fee shall be a joint and several obligation of the Debtors, shall be paid when due, and shall constitute an administrative expense claim against each Debtor under Bankruptcy Code §§ 503(b) or 507(a)(2).

 



 

17. The Debtors are authorized and directed to pay the Break-Up Fee, in cash, on the date that an alternative transaction is consummated by the Debtors or one business day thereafter, from the sale proceeds thereof or otherwise from the Debtors cash balances in accordance with the Stalking Horse SPA and this Order without need for any further action by the Court.

 



      
 

 



 

18. The attendance and participation by the Stalking Horse at the Auction shall not terminate or otherwise adversely affect any of its respective rights and obligations under the Stalking Horse SPA, including the right of the Stalking Horse to receive the Break-Up Fee(5) and to terminate the Stalking Horse SPA in accordance with the Stalking Horse SPA.

 



 

19. No person or entity, other than the Stalking Horse, shall be entitled to any expense reimbursement, break-up fee, "topping," termination or similar fee or payment.

 



 

20. The Objection and Cure Procedures are **APPROVED**.

 



 

21. Objections, if any, to the Transaction and/or the proposed assumption (and, if applicable, assignment) of the Desired 365 Contracts, including but not limited to objections relating to any Cure Amounts and/or adequate assurances of future performance, must (a) be in writing; (b) state with specificity the nature of such objection; (c) if concerning a Cure Amount, set forth a specific default in the Desired 365 Contract and claim a specific monetary amount that differs from the Cure Amount (if any) specified by the Debtors in the Assumption Notice (with appropriate documentation in support thereof); and (d) comply with the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure.

 



 

22. Objections, if any, must be filed with this Court and served upon the following parties in accordance with the Assumption Notice on or before 4:00 p.m., (Prevailing Central Time), on January , 2012 (the " _Objection Deadline_ ")(6): (i) counsel for the Debtors at Thompson and Knight LLP, Attn: David M.

  (5) Subject to the Stalking Horses obligation to act as a Back-Up Bidder if
it makes a Qualifying Bid at the Auction in accordance with the Bid
Procedures.

 



 

(6) The Supplemental Notices shall identify the Objection Deadline.

 



      
 

 



 

counsel for the Pre-Petitions Agents at Bracewell and Giuliani LLP, Attn:
William (Trey) Wood, III, 711 Louisiana Street, Suite 2300, Houston, Texas
77002-2770, (fax) 713.221.2124, trey.wood@bgllp.com, and (iv) the United

@usdoj.gov, (collectively, the " _Notice Parties_ ").

 



 

23. The Debtors are authorized to amend the Assumption Notice by adding or deleting Desired 365 Contracts and/or amending Cure Amounts at any time before the Combined Hearing by sending a new or amended Assumption Notice; _provided_ , _however_ , that counterparties to any Desired 365 Contracts that are added to the Assumption Notice or whose Cure Amounts are amended shall have the right to (i) object to such addition/deletion or Cure Amount amendment, and (ii) modify their vote to accept or reject the Plan.

 



 

24. Any Person (as defined in the Plan) failing to timely file an objection to the Transaction, shall be forever barred from objecting to the Transaction, including the vesting or transferring of substantially all of the Debtors assets Free and Clear (as defined in the Plan), claims and other interests except as otherwise set forth in the Plan, and will be deemed to consent to the Transaction, including the vesting or transferring of substantially all of the Debtors assets Free and Clear (as defined in the Plan), claims and other interests except as otherwise set forth in the Plan and provided by such Transaction.

 



 

25. Any Person (as defined in the Plan) failing to timely file an objection to any Cure Amounts set forth in the Assumption Notice or the proposed assumption (and, if applicable, assignment) of the Desired 365 Contracts shall be forever barred from objecting to the assumption of the Cure Amounts and from asserting a claim for any cure or other amounts against any Debtors, their estates, the Reorganized Debtors (if applicable), the Stalking Horse, or

 



      
 

 



 

any of their respective affiliates (or such other Person that agrees to
purchase the New Cano Stock or Acquired Property under a different transaction
that is approved by the Bankruptcy Court) with respect to its Desired 365
Contract arising before assumption (and, if applicable, assignment) of the
Desired 365 Contract and will be deemed to consent to the proposed assumption
(and, if applicable, assignment) of its Desired 365 Contract as provided by
such Transaction.

 



 

26. Where a counterparty to a Desired 365 Contract files a timely objection asserting a higher Cure Amount than the Cure Amount set forth in the Assumption Notice and the parties are unable to consensually resolve the dispute before the Confirmation Hearing, the amount to be paid or reserved with respect to such objection will be determined at the Confirmation Hearing or such other date and time as may be fixed by this Court. All other objections to the proposed assumption (and, if applicable, assignment) of the Desired 365 Contracts will be heard at the Confirmation Hearing.

 



 

27. If any Person asserts that any property, other than an executory contract or unexpired lease, cannot be transferred, sold, vested, assumed, and/or assigned Free and Clear (as defined in the Plan), claims and other interests except as otherwise set forth in the Plan, in accordance with the Transaction and Bankruptcy Code § 1141 on account of one or more alleged approval rights, consent rights, preferential purchase rights, rights of purchase, rights of first refusal, rights of first offer, or similar rights, then such Person shall file and serve a notice (a " _Rights Notice_ ") so that the Rights Notice is actually received by the Notice Parties on or before the Objection Deadline. Each Rights Notice must identify the property or properties that are subject to such alleged right, identify the type of right(s) claimed by such party, identify the

 



      
 

 



 

agreement, document, or statute giving rise to such right, and identify the
portion of the agreement, document, or statute giving rise to such right.

 



 

28. Any Person failing to timely file and serve a Rights Notice shall be (a) forever barred from objecting to the transfer, sale, vesting, assumption, and/or assignment of the properties, Free and Clear (as defined in the Plan), claims and other interests except as otherwise set forth in the Plan, and from asserting any alleged approval rights, consent rights, preferential purchase rights, rights of purchase, rights of first refusal, rights of first offer, or similar rights with respect to the Debtors transfer, sale, assumption, and/or assignment of the properties, as set forth in (a) the Plan and (b) the Stalking Horse SPA or Purchase and Sale Agreement (if applicable); and (c) deemed to consent to and approve of the transfer, sale, vesting, assumption, and/or assignment of the properties, free and clear of all Liens (as defined in the Plan), claims and other interests except as otherwise set forth in the Plan by the Debtors (regardless of whether such consent must be in writing).

 



 

29. Any Person desiring to submit a bid for the Acquired Property, including, but not limited to, New Cano Stock or the Debtors Assets (as defined by the Plan), must comply with the Bid Procedures and shall not be permitted to participate at the Auction unless such Person is an Auction Participant (as defined in the Bid Procedures).

Qualified Bidders (as defined in the Bid Procedures). Qualified Bidders

misconduct.

until Escrow Agent shall have received (A) a final non-appealable order of a
court of competent jurisdiction directing delivery of the Escrow Funds,
together with a legal opinion by counsel for the presenting Party satisfactory
to Escrow Agent to the effect that the order is final and non-appealable, in
which case Escrow Agent shall disburse the Escrow Funds in accordance with
such court order or (B) a written agreement without any conditions for
disbursement executed by all of the Parties directing delivery of the Escrow
Funds, in which case Escrow Agent shall disburse the Escrow Funds in
accordance with such written agreement; or (ii) institute a bill of
interpleader in a court of competent jurisdiction to determine the rights of
the Parties and thereafter be absolved of any further duty or obligation
hereunder with respect to the Escrow Funds.

 



 

8. _Tax Matters_.
