 THE MERGER

   

 1. _The Merger.
   _

 1. At the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.02 hereof), and subject to and upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement and in accordance with the DGCL, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease upon the filing of a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware pursuant to the DGCL. The Company shall continue as the surviving company being the successor to all the property, rights, powers, privileges, liabilities and obligations of both Merger Sub and the Company. The Company as the surviving corporation after the Merger is hereinafter sometimes referred to as the "Surviving Company."
 

 2. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place at a time and on a date to be specified by the parties, which shall be no later than the second business day after satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI, unless another time or date is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto. The Closing will be held at the offices of Morrison and Foerster LLP, 425 Market Street, San Francisco, California 94105, unless another place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto.
  

 2. _Effective Time.
 _

As promptly as practicable after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions
set forth in Article VI, but in no event later than two business days
thereafter, the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated
by filing all necessary documentation (the "Merger Documents"), together
with any required related certificates, with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware, in such form as required by, and executed in
accordance with the relevant provisions of, the DGCL (the time of such filing
being the "Effective Time").

 

 3. _Effect of the Merger.
 _

At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as provided in this
Agreement, the Merger Documents and the applicable provisions of the
DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto,
at the Effective Time all the property, rights, privileges, powers and
privileges of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Company,
and all liabilities and obligations of the Company and Merger Sub shall
become the liabilities and obligations of the Surviving Company.

 

 4. _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws.
 _

Unless otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective Time, at the
Effective Time the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Merger Sub,
as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the certificate
of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Company (the "Certificate
of Incorporation" and "Bylaws") until thereafter changed or amended as
provided therein or by the DGCL; provided, however, that Article I of the
Certificate of Incorporation shall be amended to read as follows: "The name
of the company is E-TEK Dynamics, Inc."

 

 5. _Directors and Officers.
 _

The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
the initial directors of the Surviving Company, each to hold office
in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, and the
officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the
initial officers of the Surviving Company, in each case until their
respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified.

 

 6. _Merger Consideration; Conversion and Cancellation of Securities.
 _

At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of any of the Shares:

    _

 1. Conversion of Securities_. Each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding any Shares to be canceled pursuant to Section 1.06(b) and any Dissenting Shares as defined in Section 1.09) shall be converted, subject to Section 1.06(f), into the right to receive 1.1 shares (the "Exchange Ratio") of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of Parent Common Stock, $0.001 par value per share ("Parent Common Shares").
  _

 2. Cancellation_. Each Share owned by the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company or Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be canceled and retired without payment of any consideration therefor and cease to exist.
  _

 3. Assumption of Stock Options_.
   

 1. At the Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase Company Common Stock (a "Stock Option") granted under the Company\'s 1998 Stock Plan, 1998 Director Option Plan, 1997 Equity Incentive Plan and 1997 Executive Equity Incentive Plan (collectively, the "Company Stock Option Plans"), whether vested or unvested, shall be deemed assumed by Parent and deemed to constitute an option to acquire, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such Stock Option prior to the Effective Time, the number (rounded down to the nearest whole number) of Parent Common Shares as the holder of such Stock Option would have been entitled to receive pursuant to the Merger had such holder exercised such option in full immediately prior to the Effective Time (not taking into account whether or not such option was in fact exercisable), at a price per share rounded up to the nearest whole cent equal to (x) the aggregate exercise price for Company Common Stock otherwise purchasable pursuant to such Stock Option divided by (y) the number of Parent Common Shares deemed purchasable pursuant to such Stock Option; provided, however, that the vesting schedule of the assumed options shall continue to be determined by reference to the applicable Company Stock Option Plan.
 

 2. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to each holder of an outstanding Stock Option an appropriate notice setting forth such holder\'s rights pursuant thereto and such Stock Option shall continue in effect on the same terms and conditions (including any applicable anti-dilution provisions, and subject to the adjustments required by this Section 1.06(c) after giving effect to the Merger). Parent shall comply with the terms of all such Stock Options and ensure, to the extent required by, and subject to the provisions of, the applicable Company Stock Option Plan that any Stock Options which qualified for special tax treatment prior to the Effective Time continue to so qualify after the Effective Time. Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of Parent Common Shares for delivery pursuant to the terms set forth in this Section 1.06(c).
   _

 4. Common Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of the common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and exchanged for a validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Company. Each share certificate of Merger Sub evidencing ownership of any such shares shall evidence, from and after the Effective Time, ownership of such shares of the Surviving Company.
  _

 5. Adjustments to Exchange Ratio_. The Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any share split, reverse split, share dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Parent Common Shares or Company Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization or other like change with respect to Parent Common Shares or Company Common Stock occurring or having a record date after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time, including without limitation the two-for-one stock split announced by Parent on January 3, 1999 proposed to be paid March 10, 2000.
  _

 6. Fractional Shares_. No fraction of a Parent Common Share will be issued, but in lieu thereof each holder of Company Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a Parent Common Share (after aggregating all fractional Parent Common Shares to be received by such holder) shall receive from Parent an amount of cash (rounded up to the nearest whole cent), without interest, equal to the product of (i) such fraction, multiplied by (ii) the closing price of a Parent Common Share on the Nasdaq National Market on the last trading day immediately prior to the Effective Time (as reported in the Wall Street Journal or, if not reported therein, any other authoritative source).
  

 7. _Exchange of Certificates.
   

 1. Exchange Agent_. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall supply, or shall cause to be supplied, to or for the account of a bank or trust company designated by Parent (the "Exchange Agent"), in trust for the benefit of the holders of Company Common Stock (other than Dissenting Shares), for exchange in accordance with this Section 1.07, through the Exchange Agent, certificates evidencing the Parent Common Shares issuable pursuant to Section 1.06 in exchange for outstanding Shares. Parent shall promptly make available to the Exchange Agent from time to time as needed, cash sufficient to pay cash in lieu of fractional shares.
  _

 2. Exchange Procedures_. On or prior to the tenth (10) Business Day after the Effective Time, Parent will instruct the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time evidenced outstanding Shares (other than Dissenting Shares) (the "Certificates") (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions to effect the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the certificates evidencing Parent Common Shares and, in lieu of any fractional shares thereof, cash pursuant to Section 1.06(f). Upon surrender of a Certificate to the Exchange Agent for cancellation together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other customary documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (A) certificates evidencing that number of whole Parent Common Shares which such holder has the right to receive in accordance with the Exchange Ratio in respect of the Shares formerly evidenced by such Certificate, (B) any dividends or other distributions with respect to Shares to which such holder was entitled to receive prior to the Effective Time, and (C) cash in lieu of fractional Parent Common Shares to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 1.06(f) (the Parent Common Shares, dividends, distributions and cash described in clauses (A)-(C) delivered for each Share being, collectively, the "Merger Consideration"), and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares which is not registered in the transfer records of the Company as of the Effective Time, Parent Common Shares and cash may be issued and paid in accordance with this Article I to a transferee if the Certificate evidencing such Shares is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer pursuant to this Section 1.07(b) and by evidence that any applicable stock/share transfer taxes have been paid. Until so surrendered, each outstanding Certificate that, prior to the Effective Time, represented Shares will be deemed from and after the Effective Time, for all corporate purposes, other than the payment of dividends, to evidence the ownership of the number of full Parent Common Shares into which such Shares shall have been so converted and the right to receive an amount in cash in lieu of the issuance of any fractional shares in accordance with Section 1.06.
  _

 3. Distributions With Respect to Unexchanged Parent Common Shares_. No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with respect to Parent Common Shares with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the Parent Common Shares they are entitled to receive until the holder of such Certificate shall surrender such Certificate. Subject to applicable law, following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the record holder of the certificates representing whole shares of Parent Common Shares issued in exchange therefor, without interest, at the time of such surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Shares and cash in lieu of any fractional Parent Common Share pursuant to Section 1.06(f) above.
  _

 4. Transfers of Ownership_. If any certificate for Parent Common Shares is to be issued in a name other than that in which the Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it will be a condition of the issuance thereof that the Certificate so surrendered will be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such exchange will have paid to Parent or any agent designated by it any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the issuance of a certificate for Parent Common Shares in any name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or established to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent or any agent designated by it that such tax has been paid or is not payable.
  _

 5. No Liability_. Neither Parent, Merger Sub nor the Company shall be liable to any holder of Shares for any Merger Consideration (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.
  _

 6. Withholding Rights_. Parent or the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares such amounts as Parent or the Exchange Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent or the Exchange Agent.
  

 8. _Stock Transfer Books.
 _

At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall
be closed, the Merger Consideration delivered upon the surrender for exchange
of Shares in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been
issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Shares, and
there shall be no further registration of transfers on the records of the
Surviving Company of Shares which were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to
the Surviving Company for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as
provided in this Article I.

 

 9. _Dissenting Shares.
   _

 1. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, any shares of capital stock of the Company held by a holder who has exercised appraisal rights for such shares in accordance with the DGCL and who, as of the Effective Time, has not effectively withdrawn or lost such appraisal rights ("Dissenting Shares"), shall not be converted into or represent a right to receive Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.06, but the holder thereof shall only be entitled to such rights as are granted under the DGCL.
 

 2. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) if any holder of Dissenting Shares shall effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to perfect or otherwise) such holder\'s appraisal rights, then, as of the later of the Effective Time or the occurrence of such event, such holder\'s shares shall automatically be converted into and represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest thereon, upon surrender of the certificate or certificates representing such Dissenting Shares.
 

 3. The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demands received by the Company to require the Company to purchase shares of capital stock of the Company pursuant to the DGCL, withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any such demands or offer to settle or settle any such demands.
  

 10. _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificate.
 _

In the event any Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the
Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder
thereof, such Parent Common Shares and cash as may be required pursuant to
Section 1.06; provided, however, that Parent may, in its discretion and as a
condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it
may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
Parent or the Exchange Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have
been lost, stolen or destroyed.

 

 11. _Federal Income Tax Consequences.
 _

It is intended by the parties here to that the Merger shall constitute a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. The parties
hereto hereby adopt this Agreement as a "plan of reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368 of the Code.

 

 12. _Material Adverse Effect.
  _

When used in connection with the Company or any of its subsidiaries,
or Parent or any of its respective subsidiaries, as the case may be, the
term "Material Adverse Effect" means any change or effect that, individually
or in the aggregate, is materially adverse to the business, assets (including
intangible assets), financial condition or results of operations of the
Company and its subsidiaries (a "Company Material Adverse Effect") or Parent
and its respective subsidiaries (a "Parent Material Adverse Effect"),
respectively, in each case taken as a whole, but other than those adverse
effects occurring as a result of the execution and public announcement of
this Agreement, the pendency of this Agreement or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby (including, without limitation, loss of
customers, orders, suppliers or employees resulting therefrom) or general
market or industry conditions (including, without limitation, any change in
trading prices, in and of itself and without the occurrence of any other
Material Adverse Effect, of either Parent\'s or the Company\'s outstanding
publicly traded equity securities).

 

 2. 
 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

 

The Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that,
except as set forth in the written disclosure schedule previously delivered
by the Company to Parent, the paragraphs of which are numbered to correspond
to the Sections of this Agreement (the "Company Disclosure Schedule"):

   

 1. _Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries.
 _

The Company and each of its subsidiaries is a corporation duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of
its incorporation and has the requisite corporate power and authority and is
in possession of all franchises, grants, authorizations, licenses, permits,
easements, consents, certificates, approvals and orders ("Approvals")
necessary to own, lease and operate the properties it purports to own,
operate or lease and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted,
except where the failure to have such power, authority and Approvals would
not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. The Company and each subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed as a
foreign corporation to do business, and is in good standing, in each
jurisdiction where the character of its properties owned, leased or operated
by it or the nature of its activities makes such qualification or licensing
necessary, except for such failures to be so duly qualified or licensed and
in good standing that would not, either individually or in the aggregate,
have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company\'s subsidiaries are the
only entities in which the Company has any equity interest.

 

 2. _Charter Documents.
 _

The Company has heretofore furnished or made available to Parent a complete
and correct copy of the charter documents (including the articles
or certificate of incorporation and bylaws, if any), as most recently amended
to date of the Company and each of its subsidiaries. Each such charter
document is in full force and effect. Neither the Company nor any subsidiary
is in violation or any of the provisions of its respective charter documents.

 

 3. _Capitalization.
 _

The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of shares of Company
Common Stock and shares of Preferred Stock. As of January 1, 2000, (i)
67,915,191 shares of Company Common Stock were issued and outstanding, all of
which are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and issued
in compliance with applicable securities laws, (ii) no shares of
Company Common Stock were held in the Company\'s treasury or by any
subsidiary, (iii) no shares of Company Preferred Stock were issued and
outstanding and (iv) 6,733,218 shares of Company Common Stock were reserved
for future issuance pursuant to outstanding employee stock options granted
pursuant to the Company\'s Stock Option Plans. No shares of Company Common
Stock have been issued between January 1, 2000 and the date hereof, other
than pursuant to the Company\'s Stock Option Plans. Except as set forth in
Sections 2.03, 2.08 or 2.10 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, as of the
date hereof, there are no options, warrants or other rights, agreements,
arrangements or commitments of any character relating to the issued or
unissued shares (or other equity interests) of the Company or of any
subsidiary or obligating the Company or any subsidiary to issue or sell any
shares of, or other equity interests in, the Company or any subsidiary. All
shares of Company Common Stock subject to issuance as aforesaid, upon
issuance on the terms and conditions specified in the instruments pursuant to
which they are issuable, shall be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable. As of the date hereof, there are no obligations,
contingent or otherwise, of the Company or of any subsidiary to repurchase,
redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of Company Common Stock or the shares
of any subsidiary or to provide funds to or make any investment (in the form
of a loan, capital contribution or otherwise) in any subsidiary or any other
entity other than guarantees of bank obligations of a subsidiary entered into
in the ordinary course of business. None of the options, warrants,
rights, agreements, arrangements or commitments identified in Section 2.03 or
2.10 of the Company Disclosure Schedule provide that, absent action by the
board of directors of the Company or a committee thereof, upon exercise or
conversion the holder thereof shall receive cash, and no such action of the
board of directors or a committee thereof has been taken. Except as set forth
in Section 2.03 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, all of the outstanding
shares of each subsidiary (and all shares to be issued prior to the Effective
Time) are or will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable, and issued in compliance with applicable securities laws, and
all such shares are or will be owned by the Company free and clear of all
security interests, liens, claims, pledges, agreements, limitations in voting
rights, charges, encumbrances or rights or interests of others of any nature
whatsoever (collectively, "Liens"), other than Liens for taxes not yet due
and payable.

 

 4. _Authority Relative to this Agreement.
 _

The Company has all necessary corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement and subject to obtaining any necessary
stockholder approval of this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder
and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and
delivery of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the Company
of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and validly authorized
by all necessary corporate action and no other corporate proceedings on the
part of the Company are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to
consummate the transactions so contemplated (other than the approval and
adoption of the Merger by a majority of the holders of the outstanding Shares
entitled to vote in accordance with the DGCL and the Company\'s certificate
of incorporation and bylaws). This Agreement has been duly and validly
executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming the due authorization,
execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub, as applicable, constitutes a
legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company enforceable against the
Company in accordance with its terms. The board of directors of the Company
has on the date of this Agreement unanimously determined that it is advisable
and in the best interest of the Company\'s stockholders for the Company to
enter into a strategic business combination with Parent upon the terms and
subject to the conditions of this Agreement, and has on the date of this
Agreement unanimously recommended that the Company\'s stockholders approve
and adopt this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, and,

No subsidiary is required to file any forms, reports or other documents with the SEC.

information, inventions, trade secrets, processes or material that are
required for the conduct of the business of the Company and its subsidiaries
as currently conducted (the "Company Intellectual Property Rights"). Section
2.18 of the Company Disclosure Schedule contains a list of all registered
Company Intellectual Property Rights and the jurisdictions where such
registrations have been made.

 

Either the Company or a subsidiary is the sole and exclusive owner of, or
the exclusive or non-exclusive licensee of, with all right, title and
interest in and to (free and clear of any Liens), the Company Intellectual
Property Rights, and, in the case of Company Intellectual Property Rights

respect thereof) to the use thereof or the material covered thereby in
connection with the services or products in respect of which the Company
Intellectual Property Rights are currently being used. To the knowledge of

infringement or misappropriation by the Company or any of its subsidiaries of
any patents, trademarks, trade names, service marks, copyrights, and any
applications therefor, technology, know-how and tangible or intangible
proprietary information, inventions, trade secrets or processes of any third
party. All registered patents, trademarks, service marks and copyrights held
by the Company are valid and subsisting. To the knowledge of the Company,
there is no unauthorized use, infringement or misappropriation of any of the
Company Intellectual Property Rights by any third party, including any
employee or former employee of the Company or any subsidiary. No
Company Intellectual Property Right or product of the Company or any
subsidiary is subject to any outstanding decree, order, judgment, or
stipulation restricting in any manner the licensing thereof by the Company or
any subsidiary, except to the extent any such restriction does not constitute
a Company Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any subsidiary has
entered into any agreement under which the Company or any subsidiary is
restricted from selling, licensing or otherwise distributing any of its
products to any class of customers, in any geographic area, during any period
of time or in any segment of the market, except to the extent any such
restriction does not constitute a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each of
the Company and its subsidiaries has used commercially reasonable efforts to
(i) protect through nondisclosure agreements or other appropriate means all
material patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret rights and
confidential information of the Company and its subsidiaries, and (ii)
otherwise to secure and protect for the Company\'s benefit all
Company Intellectual Property Rights of the Company. Each employee, officer
and consultant of the Company and each of its subsidiaries has executed
a proprietary information and inventions agreement substantially in the
form provided by the Company to Parent. The execution of this Agreement and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not impair
or invalidate in any way any of the Company Intellectual Property Rights.

 

 19. _Change in Control Payments.
 _

Except as set forth in Section 2.19 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries have any plans,
programs or agreements to which they are parties, or to which they are
subject, pursuant to which payments (whether in cash or property or the
vesting of property) may be required upon, or may become payable directly or
indirectly as a result of, a change of control of the Company.

 

 20. _Antitakeover Statutes.
 _

other antitakeover or similar statute or regulation applies or purports to
apply to the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

 21. _Title to Property.
 _

The Company and its subsidiaries own or lease no material real property other
than as set forth in Section 2.21 of the Company Disclosure Schedule or the
Company SEC Reports. Except as reflected in the Company\'s
financial statements included in the Company SEC Reports, each of the Company
and its subsidiaries has good and valid title to all of its respective
properties and assets, free and clear of all Liens except Liens for Taxes not
yet due and payable and such liens or other imperfections of title, if any,
as do not materially detract from the value of or materially interfere with
the present use of the property affected thereby; and, to the knowledge of
the Company, all leases pursuant to which the Company or any subsidiary
leases from others material amounts of real or personal property are in good
standing, valid and effective in accordance with their respective terms, and
there is not, to the knowledge of the Company, under any of such leases, any
existing material default or event of default (or event which with notice or
lapse of time, or both, would constitute a material default and in respect of
which the Company or any of its subsidiaries, as applicable, has not taken
adequate steps to prevent such a default from occurring).

 

 22. _Year 2000 Matters.
  _

Any reprogramming required to permit the proper functioning in and following
the year 2000 of computer systems and other equipment containing embedded
microchips, in either case owned or operated by the Company or any of its
subsidiaries or used or relied upon in the conduct of their
respective businesses (including any systems and other equipment supplied by
others or with which the computer systems of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries interface) has been completed. The testing of all such systems
and other equipment as so reprogrammed has been completed. The costs to the
Company and its subsidiaries for such reprogramming and testing and for other
foreseeable consequences to them of any improper functioning of other
computer systems and equipment containing embedded microchips due to the
occurrence of the year 2000 will not have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 16. _Intellectual Property.
 _

Parent, directly or indirectly, owns, or is licensed or otherwise possesses

service marks, copyrights, and any applications therefor, technology, know-
how and tangible or intangible proprietary information, inventions,
trade secrets, processes or material that are required for the conduct of the
business of Parent and its subsidiaries as currently conducted (the
"Parent Intellectual Property Rights"). Section 3.16 of the Parent
Disclosure Schedule contains a list of all registered Parent Intellectual
Property Rights and the jurisdictions where such registrations have been
made.

 

Either Parent or a subsidiary is the sole and exclusive owner of, or
the exclusive or non-exclusive licensee of, with all right, title and
interest in and to (free and clear of any Liens), the Parent Intellectual
Property Rights, and, in the case of Parent Intellectual Property Rights
owned by Parent or a subsidiary, has sole and exclusive rights (and is not
contractually obligated to pay any compensation to any third party in respect
thereof) to the use thereof or the material covered thereby in connection
with the services or products in respect of which the Parent Intellectual
Property Rights are currently being used. To the knowledge of Parent, there
is no and there has not been any unauthorized use, infringement or
misappropriation by Parent or any of its subsidiaries of any patents,
trademarks, trade names, service marks, copyrights, and any applications
therefor, technology, know-how and tangible or intangible proprietary
information, inventions, trade secrets or processes of any third party. All
registered patents, trademarks, service marks and copyrights held by Parent
are valid and subsisting. To the knowledge of Parent, there is
no unauthorized use, infringement or misappropriation of any of the
Parent Intellectual Property Rights by any third party, including any
employee or former employee of Parent or any subsidiary. No Parent
Intellectual Property Right or product of Parent or any subsidiary is subject
to any outstanding decree, order, judgment, or stipulation restricting in any
manner the licensing thereof by Parent or any subsidiary, except to the
extent any such restriction does not constitute a Parent Material Adverse
Effect. Neither Parent nor any subsidiary has entered into any agreement
under which Parent or any subsidiary is restricted from selling, licensing or
otherwise distributing any of its products to any class of customers, in any
geographic area, during any period of time or in any segment of the market,
except to the extent any such restriction does not constitute a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. Each of Parent and its subsidiaries has used
commercially reasonable efforts to (i) protect through nondisclosure
agreements or other appropriate means all material patent, copyright,
trademark and trade secret rights and confidential information of Parent and
its subsidiaries, and (ii) otherwise to secure and protect for Parent\'s
benefit all Parent Intellectual Property Rights of Parent. Each employee,
officer and consultant of Parent and each of its subsidiaries has executed a
proprietary information and inventions agreement substantially in the form
provided by Parent to the Company. The execution of this Agreement and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not impair
or invalidate in any way any of the Parent Intellectual Property Rights.

 

 17. _Title to Property.
 _

Parent and its subsidiaries own or lease no material real property other than
as set forth in Section 3.17 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule or the Parent
SEC Reports. Except as reflected in Parent\'s financial statements included
in the Parent SEC Reports, each of Parent and its subsidiaries has good and
valid title to all of its respective properties and assets, free and clear of
all Liens except Liens for taxes not yet due and payable and such liens
or other imperfections of title, if any, do not materially detract from the
value of or materially interfere with the present use of the property
affected thereby; and, to the knowledge of Parent, all leases pursuant to
which Parent or any subsidiary leases from others material amounts of real or
personal property are in good standing, valid and effective in accordance
with their respective terms, and there is not, to the knowledge of Parent,
under any of such leases, any existing material default or event of default
(or event which with notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a
material default and in respect of which Parent or any of its subsidiaries,
as applicable, has not taken adequate steps to prevent such a default from
occurring). _

 

 18. Year 2000 Matters.
 _

Any reprogramming required to permit the proper functioning in and following
the year 2000 of computer systems and other equipment containing embedded
microchips, in either case owned or operated by Parent or any of
its subsidiaries or used or relied upon in the conduct of their
respective businesses (including any systems and other equipment supplied by
others or with which the computer systems of Parent or any of its
subsidiaries interface) has been completed. The testing of all such systems
and other equipment as so reprogrammed has been completed. The costs to
Parent and its subsidiaries for such reprogramming and testing and for other
foreseeable consequences to them of any improper functioning of other
computer systems and equipment containing embedded microchips due to the
occurrence of the year 2000 will not have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

 19. _Material Contracts; No Violation_.
   

 1. Except as set forth in Section 3.19(a) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, (i) neither the Parent nor any subsidiary has breached, is in default under, or has received written notice of any breach or default under, any contract filed as an exhibit or required to be filed as an exhibit to the Parent SEC Reports (a "Parent Material Contract"), (ii) to the knowledge of Parent, no other party to any of the Parent Material Contracts has breached or is in default of any of its obligations thereunder, and (iii) each of the Parent Material Contracts is in full force and effect, except in any such case for breaches, defaults or failures to be in full force that in the aggregate do not constitute a Parent Material Adverse Effect.
 

 2. Except as set forth in Section 3.19(b) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Parent does not, and the performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by Parent will, (i) conflict with or violate the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of Parent, (ii) conflict with or violate any Laws applicable to the Parent or any subsidiary or by which any of their respective properties are bound or affected, or (iii) result in any breach of or constitute a default (or an event that with notice or lapse of time or both would become a default) under, or impair the Company\'s or any subsidiary\'s rights or alter the rights or obligations of any third party under, or give to others any rights of termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, any contract, or result in the creation of a Lien on any of the properties or assets of the Company or any subsidiary pursuant to, any material contract filed as an exhibit or required to be filed as an exhibit to the Parent SEC Reports or other note, bond, mortgage, indenture, contract, agreement, lease, license, permit, franchise or other instrument or obligation to which Parent or any subsidiary is a party or by which Parent or any subsidiary or any of their respective properties are bound or affected, except in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) for any such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults or other occurrences that would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.
