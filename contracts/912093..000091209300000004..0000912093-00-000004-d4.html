on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of any of the

<I><LI>Conversion of Securities</I>.  Each Share issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding any Shares to be canceled
pursuant to Section&nbsp;1.06(b) and any Dissenting Shares as defined in
Section&nbsp;1.09) shall be converted, subject to Section&nbsp;1.06(f), into the

<I><LI>Assumption of Stock Options</I>.</LI>
<OL TYPE="i">

<LI>At the Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase Company Common
Stock (a &quot;<B>Stock Option</B>&quot;) granted under the Company's 1998 Stock
Plan, 1998 Director Option Plan, 1997 Equity Incentive Plan and 1997 Executive
Equity Incentive Plan (collectively, the &quot;<B>Company Stock Option
Plans</B>&quot;), whether vested or unvested, shall be deemed assumed by Parent
and deemed to constitute an option to acquire, on the same terms and conditions
as were applicable under such Stock Option prior to the Effective Time, the
number (rounded down to the nearest whole number) of Parent Common Shares as the
holder of such Stock Option would have been entitled to receive pursuant to the
Merger had such holder exercised such option in full immediately prior to the
Effective Time (not taking into account whether or not such option was in fact
exercisable), at a price per share rounded up to the nearest whole cent equal to
(x) the aggregate exercise price for Company Common Stock otherwise purchasable
pursuant to such Stock Option divided by (y) the number of Parent Common Shares
deemed purchasable pursuant to such Stock Option; provided, however, that the
vesting schedule of the assumed options shall continue to be determined by
reference to the applicable Company Stock Option Plan.</LI>
<LI>As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to
each holder of an outstanding Stock Option an appropriate notice setting forth
such holder's rights pursuant thereto and such Stock Option shall continue in
effect on the same terms and conditions (including any applicable anti-dilution
provisions, and subject to the adjustments required by this Section&nbsp;1.06(c)
after giving effect to the Merger).  Parent shall comply with the terms of all
such Stock Options and ensure, to the extent required by, and subject to the
provisions of, the applicable Company Stock Option Plan that any Stock Options
which qualified for special tax treatment prior to the Effective Time continue
to so qualify after the Effective Time.  Parent shall take all corporate action
necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of Parent Common Shares
for delivery pursuant to the terms set forth in this
Section&nbsp;1.06(c).</LI></OL>

<I><LI>Common Stock of Merger Sub</I>.  Each share of the common stock of Merger
Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and exchanged for a validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
share of common stock of the Surviving Company.  Each share certificate of
Merger Sub evidencing ownership of any such shares shall evidence, from and
after the Effective Time, ownership of such shares of the Surviving
Company.</LI>
<I><LI>Adjustments to Exchange Ratio</I>.  The Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted
to reflect fully the effect of any share split, reverse split, share dividend
(including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Parent
Common Shares or Company Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization or
other like change with respect to Parent Common Shares or Company Common Stock
occurring or having a record date after the date hereof and prior to the
Effective Time, including without limitation the two-for-one stock split
announced by Parent on January 3, 1999 proposed to be paid March 10, 2000.</LI>
<I><LI>Fractional Shares</I>.  No fraction of a Parent Common Share will be
issued, but in lieu thereof each holder of Company Common Stock who would
otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a Parent Common Share (after aggregating
all fractional Parent Common Shares to be received by such holder) shall receive
from Parent an amount of cash (rounded up to the nearest whole cent), without
interest, equal to the product of (i)&nbsp;such fraction, multiplied by
(ii)&nbsp;the closing price of a Parent Common Share on the Nasdaq National
Market on the last trading day immediately prior to the Effective Time (as
reported in the Wall Street Journal or, if not reported therein, any other
authoritative source).</LI></OL>

<LI><A NAME="_Toc472697574"><I>Exchange of Certificates.</A></LI>
<OL TYPE="a">

<LI>Exchange Agent</I>.  Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall supply,
or shall cause to be supplied, to or for the account of a bank or trust company
designated by Parent (the &quot;<B>Exchange Agent</B>&quot;), in trust for the
benefit of the holders of Company Common Stock (other than Dissenting Shares),
for exchange in accordance with this Section 1.07, through the Exchange Agent,
certificates evidencing the Parent Common Shares issuable pursuant to Section
1.06 in exchange for outstanding Shares.  Parent shall promptly make available
to the Exchange Agent from time to time as needed, cash sufficient to pay cash
in lieu of fractional shares.</LI>
<I><LI>Exchange Procedures</I>.  On or prior to the tenth (10) Business Day
after the Effective Time, Parent will instruct the Exchange Agent to mail to
each holder of record of a certificate or certificates which immediately prior
to the Effective Time evidenced outstanding Shares (other than Dissenting
Shares) (the &quot;<B>Certificates</B>&quot;) (i)&nbsp;a letter of transmittal
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title
to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to
the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as
Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii)&nbsp;instructions to effect the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the certificates evidencing Parent
Common Shares and, in lieu of any fractional shares thereof, cash pursuant to
Section 1.06(f).  Upon surrender of a Certificate to the Exchange Agent for
cancellation together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such
other customary documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the
holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor
(A)&nbsp;certificates evidencing that number of whole Parent Common Shares which
such holder has the right to receive in accordance with the Exchange Ratio in
respect of the Shares formerly evidenced by such Certificate, (B)&nbsp;any
dividends or other distributions with respect to Shares to which such holder was
entitled to receive prior to the Effective Time, and (C)&nbsp;cash in lieu of
fractional Parent Common Shares to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
Section&nbsp;1.06(f) (the Parent Common Shares, dividends, distributions and
cash described in clauses (A)-(C) delivered for each Share being, collectively,
the &quot;<B>Merger Consideration</B>&quot;), and the Certificate so surrendered
shall forthwith be canceled.  In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares
which is not registered in the transfer records of the Company as of the
Effective Time, Parent Common Shares and cash may be issued and paid in
accordance with this Article&nbsp;I to a transferee if the Certificate
evidencing such Shares is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all
documents required to evidence and effect such transfer pursuant to this
Section&nbsp;1.07(b) and by evidence that any applicable stock/share transfer
taxes have been paid.  Until so surrendered, each outstanding Certificate that,
prior to the Effective Time, represented Shares will be deemed from and after
the Effective Time, for all corporate purposes, other than the payment of
dividends, to evidence the ownership of the number of full Parent Common Shares
into which such Shares shall have been so converted and the right to receive an
amount in cash in lieu of the issuance of any fractional shares in accordance
with Section&nbsp;1.06.</LI>
<I><LI>Distributions With Respect to Unexchanged Parent Common Shares</I>.  No
dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with
respect to Parent Common Shares with a record date after the Effective Time
shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the
Parent Common Shares they are entitled to receive until the holder of such
Certificate shall surrender such Certificate.  Subject to applicable law,
following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the record
holder of the certificates representing whole shares of Parent Common Shares
issued in exchange therefor, without interest, at the time of such surrender,
the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent
Common Shares and cash in lieu of any fractional Parent Common Share pursuant to
Section&nbsp;1.06(f) above.</LI>
<I><LI>Transfers of Ownership</I>.  If any certificate for Parent Common Shares
is to be issued in a name other than that in which the Certificate surrendered
in exchange therefor is registered, it will be a condition of the issuance
thereof that the Certificate so surrendered will be properly endorsed and
otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such
exchange will have paid to Parent or any agent designated by it any transfer or
other taxes required by reason of the issuance of a certificate for Parent
Common Shares in any name other than that of the registered holder of the
Certificate surrendered, or established to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent
or any agent designated by it that such tax has been paid or is not
payable.</LI>
<I><LI>No Liability</I>.  Neither Parent, Merger Sub nor the Company shall be
liable to any holder of Shares for any Merger Consideration (or dividends or
distributions with respect thereto) properly delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.</LI>
<I><LI>Withholding Rights</I>.  Parent or the Exchange Agent shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration otherwise payable pursuant
to this Agreement to any holder of Shares such amounts as Parent or the Exchange
Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law.  To
the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent or the Exchange Agent, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the holder of the Shares in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by Parent or the Exchange Agent.</LI></OL>

<LI><A NAME="_Toc472697575"><I>Stock Transfer Books.</A>  </LI>
</I><P>  At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed, the Merger Consideration delivered upon the surrender for exchange of
Shares in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been issued
in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Shares, and there shall be
no further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Company of
Shares which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.  If,
after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Company
for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this
Article&nbsp;I.</P>

shares of capital stock of the Company held by a holder who has exercised
appraisal rights for such shares in accordance with the DGCL and who, as of the
Effective Time, has not effectively withdrawn or lost such appraisal rights
(&quot;<B>Dissenting Shares</B>&quot;), shall not be converted into or represent
a right to receive Merger Consideration pursuant to Section&nbsp;1.06, but the
holder thereof shall only be entitled to such rights as are granted under the
DGCL.</LI>
<LI>Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection&nbsp;(a) if any holder of
Dissenting Shares shall effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to perfect
or otherwise) such holder's appraisal rights, then, as of the later of the
Effective Time or the occurrence of such event, such holder's shares shall
automatically be converted into and represent only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, without interest thereon, upon surrender of the
certificate or certificates representing such Dissenting Shares.</LI>
<LI>The Company shall give Parent (i)&nbsp;prompt notice of any written demands
received by the Company to require the Company to purchase shares of capital
stock of the Company pursuant to the DGCL, withdrawals of such demands, and any
other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company and
(ii)&nbsp;the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to such demands.  The Company shall not, except with the prior
written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any such
demands or offer to settle or settle any such demands.</LI></OL>

<LI><A NAME="_Toc472697577"><I>Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificate.</A></LI>
</I><P>  In the event any Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
holder thereof, such Parent Common Shares and cash as may be required pursuant
to Section&nbsp;1.06; provided, however, that Parent may, in its discretion and
as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it may
reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent
or the Exchange Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been
lost, stolen or destroyed.</P>

properties it purports to own, operate or lease and to carry on its business as
it is now being conducted, except where the failure to have such power,

standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of its properties owned,
leased or operated by it or the nature of its activities makes such
qualification or licensing necessary, except for such failures to be so duly

of the Company Disclosure Schedule, all of the outstanding shares of each
subsidiary (and all shares to be issued prior to the Effective Time) are or will
be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and issued in

repurchase by the Company or any of its subsidiaries of shares of the Company's
capital stock representing at least 25&nbsp;percent or more of the aggregate
voting power of all voting securities of the Company; provided, however, that
the term Alternative Transaction shall not include any acquisition of securities

<LI>Parent shall pay the Company a fee of $100 million (the &quot;<B>Fee Payable

(i) any of the conditions set forth in Section 6.02 is not satisfied as of the
Final Date; or (ii) the failure to effect the Closing prior to the Final Date is
not solely the result of the failure of any of the conditions set forth in
