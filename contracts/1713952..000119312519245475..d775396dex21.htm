Agreement:

Preferred Stock that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall automatically convert into a number of shares of Company
Common Stock in accordance with Section 6(b)(2) of the Certificate of
Designations. All of the shares of Company Preferred Stock converted into
shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall cease
to exist, and each holder of Company Preferred Stock shall thereafter cease to
have any rights with respect to such securities;

 

(b) at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of any Acquiror Stockholder, each share of Company Common Stock
(including shares of Company Common Stock resulting from the conversion of
Company Preferred Stock described in _Section_ __ _ 3.01(a)_) that is issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the
Dissenting Shares), shall thereupon be converted into, and the holder of such
share of Company Common Stock shall be entitled to receive, (1) the number of
shares of Acquiror Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio (the " _Per Share
Merger Consideration_ "), (2) a number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock
issuable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.06(a)_, if any, and (3) a number of
shares of Acquiror Common Stock issuable pursuant to _Section_ __ _
3.06(b)_, if any. All of the shares of Company Common Stock converted into the
right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Section_
__ _ 3.01(b)_ shall no longer be outstanding and shall cease to exist, and
each holder of Company Common Stock shall thereafter cease to have any rights
with respect to such securities, except the right to receive the Per Share
Merger Consideration into which such shares of Company Common Stock shall

(c) at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of any holder thereof, each share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the

converted into and become one validly issued fully paid and non-assessable
share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Company and

of the Surviving Company as of immediately following the Effective Time; and

 



20

    

(d) at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of any holder thereof, each share of Company Common Stock and
Company Preferred Stock held in the treasury of the Company immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be cancelled without any conversion thereof and no
payment or distribution shall be made with respect thereto.

3.02 _Equitable Adjustments_. If, between the date of this Agreement and
the Closing, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, Company Preferred
Stock or shares of Acquiror Common Stock shall have been changed into a
different number of shares or a different class, by reason of any stock
dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination
or exchange of shares, or any similar event shall have occurred, then any
number, value (including dollar value) or amount contained herein which is
based upon the number of shares of Company Common Stock, Company Preferred
Stock or shares of Acquiror Common Stock will be appropriately adjusted to
provide to the holders of Company Common Stock, Company Preferred Stock and
the holders of Acquiror Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated
by this Agreement; _provided_ , however, that this _Section_ __ _ 3.02_ shall
not be construed to permit Acquiror, the Company, or Merger Sub to take any
action with respect to their respective securities that is prohibited by the
terms and conditions of this Agreement.

3.03 _Delivery of Per Share Merger Consideration_.

(a) Concurrently with the mailing of the Consent Solicitation Statement,
Acquiror shall cause to be mailed to each holder of record of Company Common
Stock and Company Preferred Stock a letter of transmittal in customary form to
be approved by the Company (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) prior to the Closing (the " _Letter of Transmittal_
"), which shall (i) have customary representations and warranties as to title,
authorization, execution and delivery and (ii) specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the shares of Company Common Stock
and Company Preferred Stock, as applicable, shall pass, only upon delivery of
the shares of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock, as applicable,
to Acquiror (including all certificates representing shares of Company Common
Stock and Company Preferred Stock (each, a " _Company Certificate_ " and,
collectively, the " _Company Certificates_ "), to the extent such shares of
Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock are certificated), together
with instructions thereto.

(b) Upon the receipt of a Letter of Transmittal (accompanied with all
Company Certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock and Company
Preferred Stock and the holder of such shares of Company Common Stock and
Company Preferred Stock, to the extent such shares of Company Common Stock
and Company Preferred Stock are certificated) duly, completely and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents
as may reasonably be required by Acquiror, the holder of such shares of
Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock, as applicable, shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor, the Per Share Merger Consideration
into which such shares of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock, as
applicable, have been converted pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.01(b)_ (after
giving effect to _Section_ __ _ 3.01(a)_). Until surrendered as contemplated
by _Section_ __ _ 3.03(b)_, each share of Company Common Stock and Company
Preferred Stock shall be deemed at any time from and after the Effective Time
to represent only

 



21

    

 the right to receive upon such surrender the Per Share Merger Consideration
which the holders of shares of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred
Stock, as applicable, were entitled to receive in respect of such shares
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 3.03(b)_.

3.04 _Lost Certificate_. In the event any Company Certificate has been

3.05 _Conversion of Company Group Equity Awards_.

 

(a) Effective as of the Effective Time, each Company Group RSU, to the
extent then outstanding and unsettled, shall automatically, without any
action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into, and
thereafter evidence, a restricted stock unit with respect to that number of
shares of Acquiror Common Stock that is equal to the product of (a) the
number of shares of VGI Common Stock subject to such Company Group RSU as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by (b) the VGI Exchange
Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Acquiror
Common Stock (after such conversion, " _Rollover RSUs_ "). The Rollover RSUs
also will be entitled to the adjustments described in _Section_ __ _
3.06(a)(iv)_ and _Section_ __ _ 3.06(b)(iv)_, if applicable. 

(b) Effective as of the Effective Time, each Company Group SAR, to the
extent then outstanding and unexercised, shall automatically, without any
action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into, and
thereafter evidence, a stock appreciation right with respect to that number of
shares of Acquiror Common Stock that is equal to the product of (a) the
number of shares of VGI Common Stock subject to such Company Group SAR as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by (b) the VGI Exchange
Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Acquiror Common
Stock (after such conversion, " _Rollover SARs_ "), with a strike price per
share of Acquiror Common Stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x)
the per share strike price of such Company Group SAR as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time by (y) the VGI Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest
whole cent. The Rollover SARs also will be entitled to the adjustments
described in _Section_ __ _ 3.06(a)(iv)_ and  _Section_ __ _ 3.06(b)(iv)_,
if applicable.

(c) Effective as of the Effective Time, the Acquiror shall assume the
Company Group LTIP Plans and all awards granted thereunder (as amended as set
forth on _Exhibit E_ ), including any liabilities and obligations associated
therewith and make adjustments such that awards under the Company Group LTIP
Plans shall be settled in a number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock with a
fair market value equal to a number of hypothetical Rollover SARs with respect
to (a) the number of shares of VGI Common Stock subject to the hypothetical
Company Group SARs underlying such Company Group LTIP Plan as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time, _multiplied by_ (b) the VGI Exchange Ratio,
rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock,
with a strike price per share of Acquiror Common Stock equal to the quotient
obtained by dividing (x) the per share strike price of such

 



22

    

 hypothetical Company Group SARs as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time by (y) the VGI Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent (such
assumed and adjusted plans, the " _Rollover LTIP Plans_ "). The Parties
acknowledge and agree that the occurrence of the Closing shall constitute an
event similar to a "Public Offering" of Vivint Group, Inc. for purposes of the
Rollover LTIP Plans. The hypothetical Rollover SARs underlying the Rollover
LTIP Plans also will be entitled to the adjustments described in _Section_ __
_ 3.06(a)(iv)_ and _Section_ __ _ 3.06(b)(iv)_, if applicable.

(ii) Effective as of the Effective Time, each share of Company Restricted
Stock (as amended pursuant to _Exhibit E_ ), to the extent then unvested and

thereof, be cancelled and converted into (1) a number of shares of restricted
Acquiror Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio, rounded to the nearest
whole share of Acquiror Common Stock (after such conversion, " _Rollover
Restricted Stock_ "), (2) a number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock issuable
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 3.06(a)_, if any, and (3) a number of shares of
Acquiror Common Stock issuable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.06(b)_, if any.

 

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the conversions described in this
_Section_ __ _ 3.05_ will be subject to such modifications, if any, as are
required to cause the conversion to be made in a manner consistent with the
requirements of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(5)(v)(D). Following
the Effective Time, each Rollover Equity Award shall be subject to the
Acquiror Omnibus Incentive Plan (and considered "Substitute Awards" for
purposes thereof) and to the same terms and conditions, including, without
limitation, any vesting conditions (as amended pursuant to _Exhibit E_ ), as
had applied to the corresponding Company Group Equity Award as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time, except for such terms rendered inoperative by
reason of the Transactions, subject to such adjustments as reasonably
determined by the Acquiror Board to be necessary or appropriate to give effect
to the conversion or the Transactions.

 

3.06 _Earnout_.

 

(a) If, at any time during the five (5) years following the Closing, the
VWAP of Acquiror Common Stock is greater than or equal to $12.50 for any
twenty (20) Trading Days within any thirty- (30-) Trading Day period (such

transactions contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 3.05(d)(i)_), a number of shares
of Acquiror

 



23

    

 Common Stock equal to the product of (1) the quotient of (A) the number of
shares of Acquiror Common Stock issued to such holder at the Effective Time in
respect of the Company Common Stock held by such holder as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time _divided by_ (B) the First Earnout Fully Diluted
Shares _multiplied by_ (2) 12,500,000;

 

(ii) issue to each holder of shares of Acquiror Common Stock who received
such Acquiror Common Stock in respect of a settled, vested, or exercised
Rollover Equity Award, as applicable, a number of shares of Acquiror Common
Stock equal to the product of (1) the quotient of (A) the number of shares of
Acquiror Common Stock so issued to such holder in respect of such Rollover
Equity Award _divided by_ (B) the First Earnout Fully Diluted Shares
_multiplied by_ (2) 12,500,000;

 

(iii) issue to each holder of shares of outstanding Rollover Restricted
Stock, a number of shares of restricted Acquiror Common Stock (subject to the
same vesting terms as the Rollover Restricted Stock) equal to the product of

Stock so issued to such holder in respect of the Rollover Restricted Stock
outstanding on the First Earnout Achievement Date _divided by_ (B) the First
Earnout Fully Diluted Shares _multiplied by_ (2) 12,500,000; and

 

(iv) the Company shall adjust the strike price and/or other terms and
conditions of each outstanding unsettled or unexercised Rollover Equity Award
(other than Rollover Restricted Stock), such that each such Rollover Equity
Award is increased in value by the equivalent of the product of (1) the
quotient of (A) the number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock subject to such
Rollover Equity Award outstanding on the First Earnout Achievement Date
_divided by_ (B) the First Earnout Fully Diluted Shares _multiplied by_ (2)
12,500,000; provided that any such adjustments shall be subject to the same
vesting terms and conditions as the underlying Rollover Equity Award.

(b) If, at any time during the five (5) years following the Closing, the
VWAP of Acquiror Common Stock is greater than or equal to $15.00 for any
twenty (20) Trading Days within any thirty- (30-) Trading Day period (such
time when the foregoing is first satisfied, the " _Second Earnout Achievement
Date_ "), the Company shall promptly:

 

(i) issue to each holder of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (including holders of shares of
Company Common Stock resulting from the conversion of Company Preferred Stock
described in _Section_ __ _ 3.01(a)_ or issued as a result of the
transactions contemplated by  _Section_ __ _ 3.05(d)(i)_), a number of
shares of Acquiror Common Stock equal to the product of (1) the quotient of
(A) the number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock issued to such holder at the
Effective Time in respect of the Company Common Stock held by such holder as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time _divided by_ (B) the Second Earnout
Fully Diluted Shares _multiplied by_ (2) 12,500,000;

 



24

    

(ii) issue to each holder of shares of Acquiror Common Stock who received
such Acquiror Common Stock in respect of a settled, vested, or exercised
Rollover Equity Award, as applicable, a number of shares of Acquiror Common
Stock equal to the product of (1) the quotient of (A) the number of shares of
Acquiror Common Stock so issued to such holder in respect of such Rollover
Equity Award _divided by_ (B) the Second Earnout Fully Diluted Shares
_multiplied by_ (2) 12,500,000;

of shares of restricted Acquiror Common Stock (subject to the same vesting
terms as the Rollover Restricted Stock) equal to the product of (1) the
quotient of (A) the number of shares of restricted Acquiror Common Stock so
issued to such holder in respect of the Rollover Restricted Stock outstanding
on the Second Earnout Achievement Date _divided by_ (B) the Second Earnout
Fully Diluted Shares _multiplied by_ (2) 12,500,000; and

 

(iv) the Company shall adjust the strike price and/or other terms and
conditions of each outstanding unsettled or unexercised Rollover Equity Award
(other than Rollover Restricted Stock), such that each such Rollover Equity
Award is increased in value by the equivalent of the product of (1) the
quotient of (A) the number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock subject to such
Rollover Equity Award outstanding on the Second Earnout Achievement Date
_divided by_ (B) the Second Earnout Fully Diluted Shares _multiplied by_ (2)
12,500,000; provided that any such adjustments shall be subject to the same
vesting terms and conditions as the underlying Rollover Equity Award.

(c) The Acquiror Common Stock price targets set forth in _Section_ __ _
3.06(a)_ and _Section_ __ _ 3.06(b)_ and the number of shares to be issued
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.06(a)_ and  _Section_ __ _ 3.06(b)_ shall be
equitably adjusted for any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification,
recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of shares, or any similar
event affecting the Acquiror Common Stock after the date of this Agreement.

(d) In the event that there is an agreement with respect to an Acquiror
Sale entered into after the Closing and prior to the date that is five (5)
years following the Closing Date, the First Earnout Achievement Date shall be
deemed to occur on the day prior to the closing of such Acquiror Sale if the
price paid per share of Common Stock in such Acquiror Sale exceeds $12.50 and
the Second Earnout Achievement Date shall also be deemed to occur on the day
prior to the closing of such Acquiror Sale if the price paid per share of
Common Stock in such Acquiror Sale exceeds $15.00 (in each case, to the

share includes contingent consideration or property other than cash, the
Acquiror Board shall determine the price paid per share of Common Stock in
such Acquiror Sale in good faith) and the Company shall issue the Acquiror
Common Stock issuable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.06(a)_ and _Section_ __ _

deduction or withholding and shall reasonably consult and cooperate with the
Company in good faith to attempt to reduce or eliminate any amounts that would
otherwise be deducted or withheld pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 3.07_. To
the extent that Acquiror, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Company or
any of their respective Affiliates withholds such amounts with respect to any
Person and properly remits such withheld amounts to the applicable
Governmental Authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated as having been
paid to or on behalf of such Person for all purposes. In the case of any such

contrary contained herein, no certificates or scrip representing fractional
shares of Acquiror Common Stock shall be issued upon the conversion of Company
Common Stock pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.01(b)_, and such fractional share
interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights
of a holder of Acquiror Common Stock. In lieu of the issuance of any such
fractional share, Acquiror shall pay to each former holder of Company Common
Stock who otherwise would be entitled to receive such fractional share an
amount in cash, without interest, rounded down to the nearest cent, equal to
the product of (i) the amount of the fractional share interest in a share of
Acquiror Common Stock to which such holder otherwise would have been entitled
but for this _Section_ __ _ 3.08_) _multiplied by_ (ii) an amount equal to
the VWAP of shares of Acquiror Common Stock for the 20 trading days prior to
the date that is three Business Days prior to the Closing.

3.09 _Payment of Expenses_.

 

(a) No sooner than five or later than two Business Days prior to the

forth a list of the following fees and expenses incurred by or on behalf of
the Company or the Company Shareholders in connection with the preparation,

transfer instructions for the payment thereof), solely to the extent such fees
and expenses are incurred and expected to remain unpaid as of the close of
business on the Business Day immediately preceding the Closing Date: (i) the
fees and disbursements of outside counsel to the Company or the Company
Shareholders incurred in connection with the Transactions and (ii) the 

 



26

    

 fees and expenses of any other agents, advisors, consultants, experts and
financial advisors employed by the Company in connection with the Transactions
(collectively, the " _Outstanding Company Expenses_ "). On the Closing Date
following the Closing, Acquiror shall pay or cause to be paid by wire transfer
of immediately available funds all such Outstanding Company Expenses.

 

(b) No sooner than five or later than two Business Days prior to the

the Sponsors or for any other agents, advisors, consultants, experts and
financial advisors employed by or on behalf of Acquiror, Merger Sub or the
Sponsors in connection with the Transactions (together with written invoices
and wire transfer instructions for the payment thereof) (collectively, the "
_Outstanding Acquiror Expenses_ "). On the Closing Date following the Closing,
Acquiror shall pay or cause to be paid by wire transfer of immediately
available funds all such Outstanding Acquiror Expenses.

 

3.10 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time and owned by a holder who is entitled to demand and has
properly demanded appraisal for such shares in accordance with, and who
complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (such shares, "
_Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the
Per Share Merger Consideration, and shall instead represent the right to
receive payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance
with and to the extent provided by Section 262 of the DGCL. At the Effective
Time, (a) all Dissenting Shares shall be cancelled, extinguished and cease to
exist and (b) the holders of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled only to such
rights as may be granted to them under the DGCL. If any such holder fails to
perfect or otherwise waives, withdraws or loses such holders right to
appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL or other applicable Law, then
the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such Dissenting Shares
shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted,
as of the Effective Time, into and shall be exchangeable solely for the right
to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration in accordance with this
_Article III_. The Company shall give Acquiror prompt notice (and in any event
within two Business Days) of any demands received by the Company for appraisal
of shares of Company Common Stock, attempted withdrawals of such demands and
any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company
relating to rights to be paid the fair value of Dissenting Shares, and
Acquiror shall have the right to participate in and direct all negotiations
and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Acquiror, make any
payment with respect to, or settle or compromise or offer to settle
or compromise, any such demands or waive any failure to timely deliver a
written demand for appraisal or otherwise comply with the provisions under
Section 262 of the DGCL, or agree or commit to do any of the foregoing.

in which its ownership of property or the character of its activities is such

assuming due authorization and execution by each other party hereto and
thereto, this Agreement constitutes, and each such ancillary agreement will
constitute, a legal, valid and binding obligation of each of Acquiror and
Merger Sub, enforceable against each of Acquiror and Merger Sub in accordance

this Agreement and consummate the Transactions, (i) there has been no action
taken by the Acquiror, its Subsidiaries, or, to the knowledge of the Acquiror,

any of their respective Subsidiaries maintains, contributes to or has any
obligation or liability, or could reasonably be expected to have any

Management Trust Agreement, dated October 18, 2017, by and between Acquiror
and the Trustee (the " _Trust Agreement_ "). The Trust Agreement is in full
force and effect and is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Acquiror and,
to the knowledge of Acquiror, the Trustee, enforceable in accordance with its

reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws affecting creditors rights
generally and subject, as to enforceability, to general principles of equity.
The Trust Agreement has not been terminated, repudiated, rescinded, amended or
supplemented or modified, in any respect, and, to the knowledge of Acquiror,
no such termination, repudiation, rescission, amendment, supplement or
modification is contemplated. There are no side letters and there are no
agreements, Contracts, arrangements or understandings, whether written or
oral, with the Trustee or any other Person that would (i) cause the
description of the Trust Agreement in the Acquiror SEC Reports to be
inaccurate or (ii) entitle any Person (other than any Acquiror Stockholder who
is a Redeeming Stockholder) to any portion of the proceeds in the Trust
Account. Prior to the Closing, none of the funds held in the Trust Account
may be released except in accordance with the Trust Agreement, Acquiror
Organizational Documents and Acquirors final prospectus dated October 18,
2017. Amounts in the Trust Account are invested in United States Government
securities or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7
promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Acquiror has performed
all material obligations required to be performed by it to date under, and is
not in material default, breach or delinquent in performance or any other
respect (claimed or actual) in connection with, the Trust Agreement, and no
event has occurred which, with due notice or lapse of time or both, would
constitute such a default or breach thereunder. There are no Actions pending
or, to the knowledge of Acquiror, threatened with respect to the Trust
Account. Since October 23, 2017, Acquiror has not released any money from the
Trust Account (other than interest income earned on the principal held in the
Trust Account as permitted by the Trust Agreement). As of the Effective Time,
the obligations of Acquiror to dissolve or liquidate pursuant to the
Acquiror Organizational Documents shall terminate, and, as of the Effective
Time, Acquiror shall have no obligation whatsoever pursuant to the Acquiror
Organizational Documents to dissolve and liquidate the assets of Acquiror by
reason of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Following
the Effective Time, no Acquiror Stockholder shall be entitled to receive any
amount from the Trust Account except to the extent such Acquiror Stockholder
is a Redeeming Stockholder.

 



50

    

(b) As of the date hereof, assuming the accuracy of the representations
and warranties of the Company herein and the compliance by the Company with
its respective obligations hereunder, Acquiror has no reason to believe that
any of the conditions to the use of funds in the Trust Account will not
be satisfied or funds available in the Trust Account will not be available to
Acquiror on the Closing Date.

(c) As of the date hereof, Acquiror does not have, or have any present
intention, agreement, arrangement or understanding to enter into or incur, any
obligations with respect to or under any Indebtedness.

or judicial proceeding with a taxing authority with respect to Taxes.
Acquiror has not received any written notice from a taxing authority of a
proposed deficiency of a material amount of Taxes, other than any such
deficiencies that have since been resolved. No written claim has been made by
any Governmental Authority in a jurisdiction where Acquiror does not file a
Tax Return that such entity is or may be subject to Taxes by that jurisdiction
in respect of Taxes that would be the subject of such Tax Return, which claim
has not been resolved. There are no outstanding agreements extending or
waiving the statutory period of limitations applicable to any claim for, or
the period for the collection or assessment or reassessment of, material Taxes
of Acquiror, and no written request for any such waiver or extension is
currently pending.

(e) Acquiror has not constituted either a "distributing corporation" or a
"controlled corporation" in a distribution of stock qualifying for tax-free
treatment under Section 355 of the Code (or so much of Section 356 of the
Code as relates to Section 355 of the Code) in the prior two years.

(f) Acquiror has not been a party to any "listed transaction" within the
meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4(b)(2).

 

(g) Acquiror will not be required to include any material item of income

taxable period (or portion thereof) ending after the Closing Date as a result
of any: (A) change in method of accounting for a taxable period (or portion
thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing Date and made prior to the
Closing; (B) ruling by, or written agreement with, a Governmental Authority
(including any

provision of Tax Law) issue or executed prior to the Closing; (C) installment
sale or open transaction disposition made prior to the Closing; (D) prepaid
amount received prior to the Closing; (E) intercompany transaction or excess
loss accounts described in the Treasury Regulations promulgated under Section
1502 of the Code (or any corresponding or similar provision of state, local
or foreign income Tax Law) that existed prior to the Closing; or (F) Section
965 of the Code.

 

(h) Acquiror does not have any liability for the Taxes of any Person (other
than the Company or its Subsidiaries) (i) under Treasury Regulation Section
1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local or foreign Law), or (ii) as
a transferee or successor.

 

(i) Acquiror is not party to, or bound by, or have any obligation to, any
Governmental Authority or other Person under any Tax allocation, Tax sharing
or Tax indemnification agreements (except, in each case, for any such
agreements that are commercial contracts not primarily relating to Taxes).

 

(j) To the knowledge of Acquiror, there are no facts, circumstances or
plans that, either alone or in combination, could reasonably be expected to
prevent the Transactions from qualifying for the Intended Tax Treatment.

(k) Other than the representations and warranties set forth in _Section_
__ _ 5.06_, this _Section_ __ _ 5.09_ contains the exclusive representations
and warranties of Acquiror with respect to Tax matters. Nothing in this 
_Section_ __ _ 5.09_ shall be construed as providing a representation or
warranty with respect to (i) other than the representations and warranties set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 5.09(g)_ any taxable period (or portion thereof)
beginning following the Closing Date or (ii) the existence, amount, expiration
date or limitations on (or availability of) any Tax attribute.

 

5.10 _Brokers_ __ _Fees_. Except for fees described on _Schedule 5.10_
(including the amounts owed with respect thereto), no broker, finder,
investment banker or other Person is entitled to any brokerage fee, finders
fee or other commission in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement based upon arrangements made by Acquiror or Merger Sub or any
of their respective Affiliates, including the Sponsors.

5.11 _Acquiror SEC Reports; Financial Statements; Sarbanes-Oxley Act_.

(a) Acquiror has filed in a timely manner all required registration
statements, reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents required
to be filed by it with the SEC since October 23, 2017 (collectively, as they
have been amended since the time of their filing and including all
exhibits thereto, the " _Acquiror_ _SEC Reports_ "). None of the Acquiror SEC
Reports, as of their respective dates (or if amended or superseded by a filing
prior to the date of this Agreement or the Closing Date, then on the date of
such filing), contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading. The audited financial statements and
unaudited interim financial statements (including, in each case, the notes and
schedules thereto) included in the Acquiror SEC Reports complied as to form in
all material respects with the published rules and regulations of the SEC
with respect thereto, were prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on

 



52

    

 a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated
therein or in the notes thereto and except with respect to unaudited
statements as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC), and fairly present (subject,
in the case of the unaudited interim financial statements included therein, to
normal year-end adjustments and the absence of complete footnotes) in all
material respects the financial position of Acquiror as of the respective
dates thereof and the results of their operations and cash flows for the
respective periods then ended.

 

(b) Acquiror has established and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act). Such disclosure
controls and procedures are designed to ensure that material information
relating to Acquiror and other material information required to be disclosed
by Acquiror in the reports and other documents that it files or furnishes
under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all
such material information is accumulated and communicated to Acquirors
principal executive officer and its principal financial officer as appropriate
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the
certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act. Such disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely
alerting Acquirors principal executive officer and principal financial
officer to material information required to be included in Acquirors
periodic reports required under the Exchange Act.

(c) Acquiror has established and maintained a system of internal controls.
Such internal controls are sufficient to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of Acquirors financial reporting and the
preparation of Acquirors financial statements for external purposes
in accordance with GAAP.

(d) There are no outstanding loans or other extensions of credit made by
Acquiror to any executive officer (as defined in Rule 3b-7 under the Exchange
Act) or director of Acquiror. Acquiror has not taken any action prohibited by

(e) Neither Acquiror (including any employee thereof) nor Acquirors
independent auditors has identified or been made aware of (i) any significant
deficiency or material weakness in the system of internal accounting controls
utilized by Acquiror, (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
Acquirors management or other employees who have a role in the preparation
of financial statements or the internal accounting controls utilized by
Acquiror or (iii) any claim or allegation regarding any of the foregoing.

 

(f) To the knowledge of Acquiror, as of the date hereof, there are no
outstanding SEC comments from the SEC with respect to the Acquiror SEC
Reports. To the knowledge of Acquiror, none of the Acquiror SEC Reports filed
on or prior to the date hereof is subject to ongoing SEC review or
investigation as of the date hereof.

 

5.12 _Business Activities_ _; Absence of Changes_.

 

(a) Since its incorporation, Acquiror has not conducted any business
activities other than activities directed toward the accomplishment of a
Business Combination. Except as set forth in the Acquiror Organizational
Documents, there is no agreement, commitment or

 



53

    

 Governmental Order binding upon Acquiror or to which Acquiror is a party
which has had or would reasonably be expected to have the effect of
prohibiting or impairing any business practice of Acquiror or any acquisition
of property by Acquiror or the conduct of business by Acquiror as currently
conducted or as contemplated to be conducted as of the Closing other than such
effects, individually or in the aggregate, which have not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the ability of
Acquiror or Merger Sub to enter into and perform its obligations under this
Agreement and consummate the Transactions.

 

(b) Acquiror does not own or have a right to acquire, directly or
indirectly, any interest or investment (whether equity or debt) in any

rights, obligations or liabilities with respect to, and is not party

reasonably be interpreted as constituting, a Business Combination.

 

(c) Except for (i) this Agreement and the agreements expressly contemplated
hereby (including any agreements permitted by _Section_ __ _ 7.03_), (ii) as
set forth on _Schedule 5.12(c)_ and (iii) with respect to fees and expenses of

payments by Acquiror in excess of $150,000 monthly, $250,000 in the aggregate
annually with respect to any individual Contract or more than $500,000 in the
aggregate annually when taken together with all other Contracts (other than
this Agreement and the agreements expressly contemplated hereby (including any
agreements permitted by _Section_ __ _ 7.03_) and Contracts set forth on
_Schedule_ _5.12(c)_ ). 

(d) There is no liability, debt or obligation against Acquiror or its
Subsidiaries, except for liabilities and obligations (i) reflected or
reserved for on Acquirors consolidated balance sheet for the quarterly period
ended June 30, 2019 or disclosed in the notes thereto (other than any such

of attorney-client privilege or other privilege from disclosure or would
conflict with any applicable Law or confidentiality obligations to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is bound, the Company shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to, afford to Acquiror and its
Representatives reasonable access during the Interim Period, during normal
business hours and with reasonable advance notice, in such manner as to not
interfere with the normal operation of the Company and its Subsidiaries, to
all of their respective properties, books, projections, plans, systems,
Contracts, commitments, Tax Returns, records, commitments and analyses and, as
reasonably requested by Acquiror or its Representatives, appropriate officers
and employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and shall furnish such
Representatives with all financial and operating data and other information
concerning the affairs of the Company and its Subsidiaries that are in the
possession of the Company or its Subsidiaries as such Representatives
may reasonably request, in each case, as necessary to facilitate consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The parties shall use

the applicable Governmental Authority, Acquiror and its counsel the

and/or any of its Affiliates, agents or advisors, on the one hand, and any
Governmental Authority, on the other hand, concerning or in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby. Any materials exchanged in connection
with this _Section_ __ _ 6.03_ may be redacted or withheld as necessary to
address reasonable privilege or confidentiality concerns, and to remove
references concerning the valuation of the Company or other competitively
sensitive material; provided, that the Company may, as it deems advisable and
necessary, designate any materials provided to the Acquiror under this

any such investment fund or investment vehicle) to, and the Acquiror shall
not, without the prior written consent of the Company, agree or otherwise be
required to, take any action with respect to the Company, or any of its
Subsidiaries or such Affiliates, including selling, divesting, or otherwise
disposing of, licensing, holding separate, or taking or committing to take any
action that limits in any respect its freedom of action with respect to, or
its ability to retain, any business, products, rights, services, licenses,
assets or properties of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or such
Affiliates, or any interest therein. The Company shall pay 50% of all filing
fees payable to the Regulatory Consent Authorities in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

6.04 _No Acquiror Common Stock Transactions_. From and after the date of
this Agreement until the Effective Time, except as otherwise contemplated by
this Agreement, none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or its

use reasonable best efforts to require each of its Subsidiaries and
stockholders to comply with the foregoing sentence.

 

6.05 _No Claim Against the Trust Account_. The Company acknowledges that
the Acquiror is a blank check company with the power and privileges to effect
a merger, asset

 



64

Company and one or more businesses or assets, and the Company has read
Acquirors final prospectus, dated October 18, 2017 and other Acquiror SEC
Reports, the Acquiror Organizational Documents, and the Trust Agreement and
understands that Acquiror has established the Trust Account described therein
for the benefit of Acquirors public stockholders and that disbursements from
the Trust Account are available only in the limited circumstances set forth
therein. The Company further acknowledges and agrees that the Acquirors sole
assets consist of the cash proceeds of the Acquirors initial public offering
and private placements of its securities, and that substantially all of these
proceeds have been deposited in the Trust Account for the benefit of its
public shareholders. The Company further acknowledges that, if the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are not consummated by January 23,
2020, or, in the event of termination of this Agreement, another Business
Combination is not consummated by October 23, 2019 or such later date
as approved by the shareholders of Acquiror to complete a Business
Combination, Acquiror will be obligated to return to its stockholders the
amounts being held in the Trust Account. Accordingly, the Company (on behalf
of itself and its Affiliates) hereby waives any past, present or future claim
of any kind against, and any right to access, the Trust Account, any trustee
of the Trust Account and Acquiror to collect from the Trust Account any monies
that may be owed to them by Acquiror or any of its Affiliates for any reason
whatsoever, and will not seek recourse against the Trust Account at any time
for any reason whatsoever, including, without limitation, for any Willful
Breach of this Agreement. This  _Section_ __ _ 6.05_ shall survive the
termination of this Agreement for any reason.

 

6.06 _Proxy Solicitation; Other Actions_.

 

(a) The Company agrees to use reasonable best efforts to provide Acquiror,
no later than ten Business Days after the date of this Agreement, audited
financial statements, including consolidated balance sheets, statements of
operations, statements of cash flows, and statements of stockholders equity of
the Company and its Subsidiaries as of and for the years ended December 31,
2016, December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018, in each case, prepared in

business hours and upon reasonable advanced notice, Acquiror and its counsel
in connection with (i) the drafting of the Registration Statement and (ii)
responding in a timely manner to comments on the Registration Statement from
the SEC. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company shall
reasonably cooperate with Acquiror in connection with Acquirors preparation
for inclusion in the Registration Statement of pro forma financial statements

regulations of the SEC (as interpreted by the staff of the SEC) to the extent
such pro forma financial statements are required by Form S-4.

 

(b) From and after the date on which the Registration Statement becomes
effective under the Securities Act, the Company will give Acquiror prompt
written notice of any action taken or not taken by the Company or its
Subsidiaries or of any development regarding the Company or its Subsidiaries,
in any such case which is known by the Company, that would cause
the Registration Statement to contain an untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;
_provided_ , that, if any such action shall be taken or fail to be

 



65

    

 taken or such development shall otherwise occur, Acquiror and the Company
shall cooperate fully to cause an amendment or supplement to be made promptly
to the Registration Statement, such that the Registration Statement no longer
contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact necessary in order to make the statements, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading;  _provided_ , _further_ ,
_however_ , that no information received by Acquiror pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 6.06_ shall operate as a waiver or otherwise affect any
representation, warranty or agreement given or made by the party who
disclosed such information, and no such information shall be deemed to change,
supplement or amend the Schedules.

Company and Acquiror prior to the Closing, and conditioned upon the

indemnification agreements shall continue to be effective following
the Closing.

6.08 _Non-Solicitation; Acquisition Proposals_.

 

(a) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section_ __ _ 6.08_, from the
date of this Agreement until the Effective Time or, if earlier, the valid
termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 10.01_, the
Company shall not, shall cause its subsidiaries not to and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective Representatives not
to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage or
knowingly facilitate any inquiries or requests for information with respect
to, or the making of, any inquiry regarding, or any proposal or offer that
constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to result in or lead to, any
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any
negotiations or discussions concerning, or provide access to its properties,
books and records or any confidential information or data to, any Person

constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to result in or lead to, any
Acquisition Proposal, (iii) approve, endorse or recommend, or propose
publicly to approve, endorse or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal, (iv)

6.08(b)(iii)_), merger agreement, acquisition agreement, exchange agreement,
joint venture agreement, partnership agreement, option agreement or other
similar agreement for or relating to any Acquisition Proposal or (v) resolve
or agree to do any of the foregoing; provided that it is understood and agreed
that any determination or action by the Company Board made in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 6.08(b)_ or _Section_ __ _ 6.08(c)_ shall not be deemed to be
a breach or violation of this _Section_ __ _ 6.08(a)_. The Company also
agrees that immediately following the execution of this Agreement it shall,
and shall cause each of its subsidiaries and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause its and their Representatives to, cease any solicitations,
discussions or negotiations with any Person (other than the Parties and their
respective Representatives) conducted heretofore in connection with an
Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry or request for information that could
reasonably be

 



66

    

 expected to lead to, or result in, an Acquisition Proposal. The Company also
agrees that within three (3) Business Days of the execution of this Agreement,
the Company shall request each Person (other than the Parties and their
respective Representatives) that has prior to the date hereof executed a
confidentiality agreement in connection with its consideration of acquiring
the Company (and with whom the Company has had contact in 12 months prior to
the date of this Agreement regarding the acquisition of the Company) to return
or destroy all confidential information furnished to such Person by or on
behalf of it or any of its subsidiaries prior to the date hereof
and terminate access to any physical or electronic data room maintained by or
on behalf of the Company or any of its subsidiaries. The Company shall
promptly (and in any event within one Business Day) notify, in writing,
Acquiror of the receipt of any inquiry, proposal, offer or request for
information received after the date hereof that constitutes, or could
reasonably be expected to result in or lead to, any Acquisition Proposal,
which notice shall include a summary of the material terms of, and the
identity of the Person or group of Persons making, such inquiry, proposal,
offer or request for information and an unredacted copy of any Acquisition
Proposal or inquiry, proposal or offer made in writing or, if not in writing,
a written description of the material terms and conditions of such inquiry,
proposal or offer (and shall include any other documents evidencing or
specifying the terms of such proposal, offer, inquiry or request). The Company
shall promptly (and in any event within one Business Day) keep Acquiror
reasonably informed of any material developments with respect to any such
inquiry, proposal, offer, request for information or Acquisition Proposal
(including any material changes thereto and copies of any additional written
materials received by the Company, its subsidiaries or their respective
Representatives). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Company
may grant a waiver, amendment or release under any confidentiality
or standstill agreement to the extent necessary to allow for a confidential
_bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal (which Acquisition Proposal was made
after the date of this Agreement and did not result from a material breach of
this  _Section_ __ _ 6.08_) to be made to the Company or the Company Board
so long as the Company promptly (and in any event within one Business Day
thereafter) notifies Acquiror thereof (including the identity of such
counterparty) after granting any such waiver, amendment or release and the
Company Board determines prior to the grant of such waiver, amendment or
release in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel to the
Company, that the failure of the Company Board to take such action would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law. Without limiting
the foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the restrictions
contained in this _Section_ __ _ 6.08_ by any of the Companys subsidiaries,
or any of the Companys or its subsidiaries respective Representatives acting
on the Companys or one of its subsidiaries behalf, shall be deemed to be a
breach of this  _Section_ __ _ 6.08_ by the Company.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in  _Section_ __ _ 6.08(a)_
or _Section_ __ _ 8.02(e)_, this Agreement shall not prevent the Company or
the Company Board from:

 

(i) taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by
Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication
to stockholders in connection with the making or amendment of a tender offer
or exchange offer) or from making any legally required disclosure to
stockholders with regard to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
an Acquisition Proposal; provided that this clause (i) shall not be deemed to
permit the Company or the Company Board to effect a Company Change
in Recommendation except in accordance with _Sections 6.08(c)_ and _6.08(d)_
;

 



67

    

(ii) prior to obtaining the Company Requisite Approval, contacting and
engaging in discussions with any Person or group and their respective
Representatives who has made a _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal after
the date hereof that did not result from a material breach of  _Section_ __ _
6.08(a)_, solely for the purpose of clarifying such Acquisition Proposal and
the terms thereof;

 

(iii) prior to obtaining the Company Requisite Approval, (A) contacting and
engaging in any negotiations or discussions with any Person and its
Representatives who has made a _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal after
the date hereof that did not result from a material breach of _Section_ __ _
6.08(a)_ (which negotiations or discussions need not be solely for
clarification purposes) and (B) providing access to the Companys or any of
its subsidiaries properties, books and records and providing information or
data in response to a request therefor by a Person who has made a _bona fide_
written Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a material breach of
_Section_ __ _ 6.08(a)_, in each case, if the Company Board (I) shall have
determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel
and financial advisor(s), that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or could
reasonably be expected to constitute, result in or lead to a Superior
Proposal, (II) shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with
its outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and (III) has received from
the Person so requesting such information an executed Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement; provided that the Company shall provide to Acquiror
and Merger Sub any material non-public information or data that is provided to
any Person given such access that was not previously made available to
Acquiror or Merger Sub prior to or substantially concurrently with the time it
is provided to such Person (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours
thereof);

 

(iv) prior to obtaining the Company Requisite Approval, making a Company
Change in Recommendation (only to the extent permitted by _Section_ __ _
6.08(c)_ or Section _ 6.08(d)_); or

 

(v) resolving, authorizing, committing or agreeing to take any of the
foregoing actions, only to the extent such actions would be permitted by the
foregoing clauses (i) through (iv).

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section_ __ _ 6.08_ to the
contrary, if, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Requisite Approval,
the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisor(s) and outside legal counsel, in response to a _bona fide_
written Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a material breach of
this _Section_ __ _ 6.08_, that (i) such proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal and (ii) the failure to take the actions specified in clause (A) or
(B) of this _Section_ __ _ 6.08(c)_ would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law, the Company or the Company Board may, prior to 

 



68

    

 obtaining the Company Requisite Approval, (A) make a Company Change in
Recommendation or (B) terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _
10.01(e)_ to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior
Proposal; provided that the Company pays to Acquiror the Company Termination
Payment required to be paid pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.02(b)_ at or prior
to the time of such termination (it being agreed that such termination shall
not be effective unless such fee is so paid); provided further that the
Company will not be entitled to make a Company Change in Recommendation or
terminate this Agreement in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 10.01(e)_ unless
(x) the Company delivers to Acquiror a written notice (a " _Company Notice_ ")
advising Acquiror that the Company Board proposes to take such action and
containing the material terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal that is
the basis of the proposed action of the Company Board, and (y) at or after
5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the fifth (5th) Business Day immediately
following the day on which the Company delivered the Company Notice (such
period from the time the Company Notice is provided until 5:00 p.m. New York
City time on the fifth (5th) Business Day immediately following the day on
which the Company delivered the Company Notice (it being understood that any
material revision, amendment, update or supplement to the terms and conditions
of such Superior Proposal shall be deemed to constitute a new Superior
Proposal and shall require a new notice but with an additional four (4)
Business Day (instead of five (5) Business Day) period from the date of such
notice), the " _Notice Period_ "), the Company Board reaffirms in good faith
(1) after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor(s)
that such Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal if
the adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement proposed by
Acquiror (if any) were to be given effect and (2) after consultation with its
outside legal counsel, that the failure to make a Company Change in
Recommendation or so terminate would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law. If requested by Acquiror, the Company
will, and will cause its subsidiaries to, and will use its reasonable best
efforts to cause its or their Representatives to, during the Notice Period,
engage in good faith negotiations with Acquiror and its Representatives to
make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that
such Acquisition Proposal would cease to constitute a Superior Proposal.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section_ __ _ 6.08_ or  _Section_
__ _ 8.02(e)_ to the contrary, if, at any time prior to obtaining the Company
Requisite Approval, the Company Board determines in good faith, in response to
an Intervening Event, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that
the failure to make a Company Change in Recommendation would be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, the Company or the Company
Board may, prior to obtaining the Company Requisite Approval, make a Company
Change in Recommendation; provided that the Company will not be entitled to
make, or agree or resolve to make, a Company Change in Recommendation unless
(i) the Company delivers to Acquiror a written notice (an " _Intervening
Event Notice_ ") advising Acquiror that the Company Board proposes to take
such action and containing the material facts underlying the Company Boards
determination that an Intervening Event has occurred, and (ii) at or after
5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the fifth (5th) Business Day immediately
following the day on which the Company delivered the Intervening Event Notice
(such period from the time the Intervening Event Notice is provided until
5:00 p.m. New York City time on the fifth (5th) Business Day immediately
following the day on which the Company delivered the Intervening Event Notice
(it being understood that any material development with respect to an
Intervening Event shall require a new notice but with an additional four (4)
Business Day (instead of five (5) Business Day) period from the date of such
notice), the " _Intervening Event Notice Period_ "), the Company Board

 



69

    

 reaffirms in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel)
that the failure to make a Company Change in Recommendation would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law. If requested by
Acquiror, the Company will, and will cause its subsidiaries to, and will use
its reasonable best efforts to cause its or their Representatives to, during
the Intervening Event Notice Period, engage in good faith negotiations with
Acquiror and its Representatives to make such adjustments in the terms and
conditions of this Agreement so as to obviate the need for a Company Change in
Recommendation.

assets, (C) acquisition of beneficial ownership, or the right to acquire

the Company (or any subsidiary of the Company whose business constitutes 20%

Proposal made after the date hereof, that did not result from a material
breach of this _Section_ __ _ 6.08_, that the Company Board in good faith

advisor(s)) is reasonably likely to be consummated in accordance with its
terms and would, if consummated, result in a transaction that is more
favorable from a financial point of view to the stockholders of the Company
(solely in their capacity as such) than the transactions contemplated hereby
after taking into account all such factors and matters deemed relevant in good
faith by the Company Board, including legal, financial (including the
financing terms of any such proposal), regulatory, timing or other aspects of
such proposal and this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
(including any offer by

 



70

    

 Acquiror to amend the terms of this Agreement, termination or break-up fee
and conditions to consummation); provided that for purposes of the definition
of "Superior Proposal," the term "Acquisition Proposal" shall have the
meaning assigned to such term herein, except that the references to "20%" in
such definition shall be deemed to be references to "80%".

 

(iii) " _Intervening Event_ " means an event, fact, development,
circumstance or occurrence (but specifically excluding any Acquisition
Proposal or Superior Proposal) that materially affects the business, assets,
operations or prospects of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole,

the Company Board as of the date hereof (or the consequences of which were not
reasonably foreseeable to the Company Board as of the date hereof), and that

in connection with this _Section_ __ _ 7.01_ may be redacted or withheld as
necessary to address reasonable privilege or confidentiality concerns, and to
remove references concerning the valuation of the Company or other
competitively sensitive material; provided, that the Acquiror may, as it
deems advisable and necessary, designate any materials provided to the
Company under this _Section_ __ _ 7.01_ as "outside counsel only."

 

(e) Acquiror shall pay 50% of all filing fees payable to the Regulatory
Consent Authorities in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

72

    

 of or equity in, or by any other manner, any business or any corporation,
partnership, association or other business organization or division thereof,
or otherwise acquire or agree to acquire any assets, or take any other
action, if the entering into of a definitive agreement relating to, or the
consummation of such acquisition, merger or consolidation, or the taking of
any other action, would reasonably be expected to (i) impose any delay in the
obtaining of, or increase the risk of not obtaining, any authorizations,
consents, orders or declarations of any Regulatory Consent Authorities or the
expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period; (ii) increase
the risk of any Governmental Authority entering an order prohibiting the
consummation of the transaction contemplated hereby; (iii) increase the risk
of not being able to remove any such order on appeal or otherwise; or (iv)
delay or prevent the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the restrictions
and obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 7.01(f)_ shall not apply to
or be binding upon Acquirors Affiliates, the Sponsors, the Forward
Purchasers, the Fortress Subscriber, their respective Affiliates or any
investment funds or investment vehicles affiliated with, or managed or advised
by, Acquirors Affiliates, the Sponsors, the Forward Purchasers, the Fortress
Subscriber or any portfolio company (as such term is commonly understood in
the private equity industry) or investment of Acquirors Affiliates, the
Sponsors, the Forward Purchasers, the Fortress Subscriber or of any such
investment fund or investment vehicle.

7.02 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Acquiror and the Surviving Company
agree that they shall indemnify and hold harmless each present and former
director and officer of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries against any
costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any
Action, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out
of or pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time,
to the fullest extent that the Company or its Subsidiaries, as the case may
be, would have been permitted under applicable Law and its certificate of
incorporation, bylaws or other organizational documents in effect on the date
of this Agreement to indemnify such Person (including the advancing of
expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law).
Without limiting the foregoing, Acquiror shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Company and its Subsidiaries to, (i) maintain for a period of not less than
six years from the Effective Time provisions in its certificate of
incorporation (if applicable), bylaws and other organizational documents
concerning the indemnification and exoneration (including provisions relating
to expense advancement) of officers and directors that are no less favorable
to those Persons than the provisions of such certificates of incorporation (if
applicable), bylaws and other organizational documents as of the date of this
Agreement and (ii) not amend, repeal or otherwise modify such provisions in
any respect that would adversely affect the rights of those Persons
thereunder, in each case, except as required by Law. Acquiror shall assume,
and be liable for, and shall cause the Surviving Company and their respective
Subsidiaries to honor, each of the covenants in this _Section_ __ _ 7.02_.

 

(b) For a period of six years from the Effective Time, Acquiror shall, or
shall cause one or more of its Subsidiaries to, maintain in effect directors
and officers liability insurance covering those Persons who are currently
covered by the Companys or its Subsidiaries directors and officers
liability insurance policies (true, correct and complete

 



73

    

 copies of which have been heretofore made available to Acquiror or its
agents or representatives) on terms not less favorable than the terms of such
current insurance coverage, except that in no event shall Acquiror or its
Subsidiaries be required to pay an annual premium for such insurance in excess
of 300% of the aggregate annual premium payable by the Company and its
Subsidiaries for such insurance policy for the year ended December 31, 2018;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (i) Acquiror may cause coverage to be extended
under the current directors and officers liability insurance by obtaining
a six-year "tail" policy containing terms not materially less favorable than
the terms of such current insurance coverage with respect to claims existing
or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and (ii) if any claim is
asserted or made within such six-year period, any insurance required to be
maintained under this _Section_ __ _ 7.02_ shall be continued in respect of
such claim until the final disposition thereof.

(c) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the
contrary, this _Section_ __ _ 7.02_ shall survive the consummation of the
Merger indefinitely and shall be binding, jointly and severally, on Acquiror
and the Surviving Company and all successors and assigns of Acquiror and the
Surviving Company. In the event that Acquiror, the Surviving Company or any
of their respective successors or assigns consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, Acquiror and the Surviving Company shall ensure that proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Acquiror or the
Surviving Company, as the case may be, shall succeed to the obligations set
forth in this _Section_ __ _ 7.02_. The obligations of Acquiror and the
Surviving Company under this  _Section_ __ _ 7.02_ shall not be terminated
or modified in such a manner as to materially and adversely affect any present
and former director and officer of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries to
whom this  _Section_ __ _ 7.02_ applies without the consent of the affected
Person.

7.03 _Conduct of Acquiror During the Interim Period_.

party.

 

7.04 _Trust Account_. Prior to or at the Closing (subject to the

restrictions that may be applicable to information furnished to Acquiror or
its Subsidiaries by third parties that may be in Acquirors or its
Subsidiaries possession from time to time, and except for any information

any of its Subsidiaries is bound, Acquiror shall afford to the Company, its
Affiliates and their respective Representatives reasonable access during the
Interim Period, during normal business hours and with reasonable advance
notice, to all of their respective properties, books, projections, plans,

commercially reasonable efforts to make alternative arrangements for such
disclosure where the restrictions in the preceding sentence apply.
All information obtained by the Company, its Affiliates and their respective
Representatives under this Agreement shall be subject to the Confidentiality
Agreement prior to the Effective Time.

 

7.06 _Acquiror NYSE Listing_.

7.07 _Acquiror Public Filings_. From the date hereof through the Closing,

7.08 _Financing_. Acquiror and Merger Sub shall take, or cause to be
taken, as promptly as practicable after the date hereof, all actions, and to

prior to the Closing Date, to consummate (x) the FP Financing on the terms
and conditions described in or contemplated by the Forward Purchase Agreements
and (y) the purchases contemplated by the Subscription Agreements on the terms
and conditions described or contemplated therein. Acquiror irrevocably agrees
(but conditioned upon the occurrence of the Closing) to elect under Section 9
of the Forward Purchase Agreements that the Purchaser Designee (as defined in

Forward Purchase Agreements). Acquiror shall deliver all notices it is

order to cause the Forward Purchasers to consummate the FP Financing
concurrently with the Closing.

7.09 _Termination of Acquiror Affiliate Agreements_. On and as of the

obligation to Acquiror or its Subsidiaries (including and the Company and its
Subsidiaries), and there shall be no further obligations of any of the
relevant parties thereunder following the Closing.

 

7.10 _Additional Insurance Matters_. Prior to the Closing, Acquiror shall
obtain directors and officers liability insurance that shall be effective
as of Closing and will cover those Persons who will be the directors and
officers of Acquiror and its Subsidiaries (including the directors and
officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries) at and after the Closing on
terms not less favorable than the better of (a) the terms of the current
directors and officers liability insurance in place for the Companys and
its Subsidiaries directors and officers and (b) the terms of a typical
directors and officers liability insurance policy for a company whose equity
is listed on NYSE which policy has a scope and amount of coverage that is
reasonably appropriate for a company of similar characteristics (including
the line of business and revenues) as Acquiror and its Subsidiaries (including
the Company and its Subsidiaries).

 

7.11 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Closing, the board of directors
of Acquiror, or an appropriate committee of "non-employee directors" (as
defined in Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange Act) thereof, shall adopt a resolution
consistent with the interpretive guidance of the SEC so that the acquisition
of Acquiror Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement (including the Earnout
Shares) and the other agreements contemplated hereby, by any person owning
securities of the Company who is expected to become a director or officer (as
defined under Rule 16a-1(f) under the Exchange Act) of the Acquiror following
the Closing shall be an exempt transaction for purposes of Section 16(b) of
the Exchange Act pursuant to Rule 16b-3 thereunder.

agreement with, or encourage, respond, provide information to or commence due
diligence with respect to, any Person (other than the Company, its
shareholders and/or any of their Affiliates or Representatives), concerning,
relating to or which is intended or is reasonably likely to give rise

 



78

    

 to or result in, any offer, inquiry, proposal or indication of interest,
written or oral relating to any Business Combination (a " _Business
Combination Proposal_ ") other than with the Company, its shareholders and
their respective Affiliates and Representatives. Acquiror shall, and shall
cause its Affiliates and Representatives to, immediately cease any and all
existing discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted prior to the
date hereof with respect to, or which is reasonably likely to give rise to or
result in, a Business Combination Proposal.

 

7.13 _Extension_. Acquiror shall use its reasonable best efforts to take
all actions necessary (in its discretion or at the request of the Company) to
obtain the approval of Acquirors stockholders to extend the deadline for
Acquiror to consummate its initial Business Combination (as defined in the
Certificate of Incorporation) beyond October 23, 2019 to a date to be
determined by Acquiror (in its sole discretion) (such extension, the "
_Extension_ ") and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
such approval. In connection with obtaining the approval, Acquiror
may prepare with the assistance of the Company and file with the SEC under
the Exchange Act, and with all other regulatory bodies, materials in the form
of a proxy statement to be used for the purpose of soliciting proxies from the
Acquiror Stockholders to approve, at a Special Meeting, an amendment to the
Acquiror Organizational Documents to provide for the Extension, and providing
the Acquiror Stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their shares of
Acquiror Common Stock in connection therewith (the " _Extension Proxy

ARTICLE VIII

 

JOINT COVENANTS

 

8.01 _Support of Transaction_. Without limiting any covenant contained in
_Article VI_ or _Article VII_ , including the obligations of the Company and
Acquiror with respect to the notifications, filings, reaffirmations and
applications described in _Section_ __ _ 6.03_ and _Section_ __ _ 7.01_,
respectively, which obligations shall control to the extent of any conflict
with the succeeding provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 8.01_, Acquiror and the
Company shall each, and shall each cause their respective Subsidiaries to: (a)
use commercially reasonable efforts to assemble, prepare and file any
information (and, as needed, to supplement such information) as may be
reasonably necessary to obtain as promptly as practicable all governmental and
regulatory consents required to be obtained in connection with the
Transactions, (b) use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all material
consents and approvals of third parties that any of Acquiror, the Company, or
their respective Affiliates are required to obtain in order to consummate the

Agreement and to consummate the Transactions as soon as practicable.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall Acquiror, Merger Sub, the
Company or its Subsidiaries be obligated to bear any expense or pay any fee
or grant any concession in connection with obtaining any consents,
authorizations or approvals pursuant to the terms of any Contract to which the

consummation of the Transactions.

 



79

    

8.02 _Preparation of Registration Statement; Special
Meeting; Solicitation of Company Requisite Approval_.

(a) As promptly as practicable following the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, Acquiror shall prepare, with the assistance of the Company,
and cause to be filed with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4 (as
amended or supplemented from time to time, and including the Proxy Statement
and the Consent Solicitation Statement contained therein, the " _Registration
Statement_ ") in connection with the registration under the Securities Act of
the Acquiror Common Stock to be issued under this Agreement (including the
Earnout Shares), which Registration Statement will also contain the Proxy
Statement and the Consent Solicitation Statement. Each of Acquiror and the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Registration Statement, the Proxy Statement and the Consent Solicitation
Statement to comply with the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC, to
have the Registration Statement declared effective under the Securities Act as
promptly as practicable after such filing and to keep the Registration
Statement effective as long as is necessary to consummate the Merger. Each of
Acquiror and the Company shall furnish all information concerning it as may
reasonably be requested by the other Party in connection with such actions
and the preparation of the Registration Statement, the Proxy Statement and the
Consent Solicitation Statement. Promptly after the Registration Statement is
declared effective under the Securities Act, Acquiror will cause the Proxy
Statement to be mailed to stockholders of Acquiror.

(b) Each of Acquiror and the Company shall cooperate and mutually agree
upon (such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), any response
to comments of the SEC or its staff with respect to the Registration Statement
and any amendment to the Registration Statement filed in response thereto. If
Acquiror or the Company becomes aware that any information contained in the
Registration Statement shall have become false or misleading in any material
respect or that the Registration Statement is required to be amended in order
to comply with applicable Law, then (i) such party shall promptly inform the
other parties and (ii) Acquiror, on the one hand, and the Company, on the
other hand, shall cooperate and mutually agree upon (such agreement not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) an amendment or supplement to the
Registration Statement. Acquiror and the Company shall use reasonable best
efforts to cause the Registration Statement as so amended or supplemented, to
be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to the holders of shares of
Acquiror Common Stock, as applicable, in each case pursuant to applicable Law
and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Acquiror
Organizational Documents. Each of the Company and Acquiror shall provide the
other parties with copies of any written comments, and shall inform such other
parties of any oral comments, that Acquiror receives from the SEC or its staff
with respect to the Registration Statement promptly after the receipt of such
comments and shall give the other parties a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on any proposed written or oral responses to such comments prior
to responding to the SEC or its staff.

 

(c) Acquiror agrees to include provisions in the Proxy Statement and to
take reasonable action related thereto, with respect to (i) approval of the
Business Combination (as defined in the Certificate of Incorporation) (the "
_Transaction Proposal_ "), (ii) approval of the Acquiror AandR Charter (the "
_Amendment Proposal_ "), (iii) approval of the issuance of the Per Share
Merger Consideration and the issuance of Acquiror Common Stock to the
Blackstone Subscribers in connection with the payment of the Per Share Merger
Consideration pursuant to 

 



80

    

  _Section_ __ _ 3.03_ (the " _Issuance Proposal_ "), (iv) approval of the
issuance of Acquiror Common Stock pursuant to the Fortress Subscription
Agreement and the Blackstone Subscription Agreements and any other issuance
of Acquiror Common Stock in connection with the Transactions in accordance
with this Agreement, in each case to the extent required by NYSE listing rules
(the " _Subscription Proposals_ "), (v) the adoption of the Acquiror Omnibus
Incentive Plan (the " _Omnibus Incentive Plan Proposal_ ") and (vi) approval
of any other proposals reasonably agreed by Acquiror and the Company to be
necessary or appropriate in connection with the transaction contemplated
hereby (the " _Additional Proposal_ " and together with the Agreement
Proposal, Merger Proposal, Amendment Proposal, Omnibus Incentive Plan
Proposal, the Subscription Proposals and Issuance Proposal, the " _Proposals_
"). The Acquiror Omnibus Incentive Plan Proposal shall provide that an
aggregate number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock equal to 10% of the
outstanding shares of Acquiror Common Stock as of Closing shall be reserved
for issuance pursuant to the Acquiror Omnibus Incentive Plan, subject to
annual increases as provided therein. Without the prior written consent of the
Company, the Proposals shall be the only matters (other than
procedural matters) which Acquiror shall propose to be acted on by Acquirors
stockholders at the Special Meeting.

 

(d) Acquiror and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to, as
promptly as practicable, (i) establish the record date for, duly call, give
notice of, convene and hold the Special Meeting in accordance with the DGCL,
(ii) cause the Proxy Statement to be disseminated to Acquirors stockholders
in compliance with applicable Law and (iii) solicit proxies from the holders
of Acquiror Common Stock to vote in favor of each of the Proposals. Acquiror
shall, through the Acquiror Board, recommend to its stockholders that they
approve the Proposals (the " _Acquiror Board Recommendation_ ") and shall
include the Acquiror Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, subject to
the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 8.02(d)_. The Acquiror Board shall not
(and no committee or subgroup thereof shall) change, withdraw, withhold,
qualify or modify, or publicly propose to change, withdraw, withhold, qualify
or modify, the Acquiror Board Recommendation (an " _Acquiror Change in
Recommendation_ "); provided, that the Acquiror Board may make a Acquiror
Change in Recommendation if it determines in good faith, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel, that a failure to make an Acquiror Change in
Recommendation would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
_Section_ __ _ 8.02(d)_, if on a date for which the Special Meeting is
scheduled, Acquiror has not received proxies representing a sufficient number
of shares of Acquiror Common Stock to obtain the Acquiror Stockholder
Approval, whether or not a quorum is present, Acquiror shall have the right to
make one or more successive postponements or adjournments of the Special
Meeting.

 

(e) The Company shall solicit the Company Requisite Approval via written
consent as soon as promptly as practicable after the Registration Statement
becomes effective. In connection therewith, Acquiror and the Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to, as promptly as practicable, (i) establish the
record date for determining the Company Shareholders entitled to provide such
written consent, (ii) cause the Consent Solicitation Statement to be
disseminated to the Company Shareholders in compliance with applicable Law and
(iii) unless a Company Change in Recommendation has been made, solicit
written consents from the Company Shareholders to give the Company Requisite
Approval. The Company shall, through the Company Board, recommend to the
Company Shareholders that they adopt this Agreement (the " _Company
Board Recommendation_ ") and shall include the Company Board

 



81

    

 Recommendation in the Consent Solicitation Statement, subject to the
provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 8.02(e)_. The Company Board shall not (and
no committee or subgroup thereof shall) (i) change, withdraw, withhold,
qualify or modify, or publicly propose to change, withdraw, withhold, qualify
or modify, the Company Board Recommendation or (ii) approve, recommend or
declare advisable, or propose publicly to approve, recommend or declare
advisable, any Acquisition Proposal (any action described in clause (i) or
(ii), a " _Company Change in Recommendation_ ") except in accordance with
_Sections 6.08(c)_ and _6.08(d)_. The Company will provide Acquiror with
copies of all stockholder consents it receives within one (1) Business Day of
receipt. If the Company Requisite Approval is obtained, then promptly
following the receipt of the required written consents, the Company will
prepare and deliver to its stockholders who have not consented the notice
required by Section 228(e) of the DGCL. Unless this Agreement has been
terminated in accordance with its terms, the Companys obligation to
solicit written consents from the Company Shareholders to give the Company
Requisite Approval in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 8.02(e)_ shall not
be limited or otherwise affected by the making, commencement, disclosure,
announcement or submission of any Acquisition Proposal or Superior Proposal,
or by any Company Change of Recommendation.

 

8.03 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) _Transfer Taxes_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, the Company shall pay all transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration, value added or other similar Taxes incurred in connection with
the Transactions. The Company shall, at its own expense, file all necessary
Tax Returns with respect to all such Taxes, and, if required by applicable
Law, Acquiror will join in the execution of any such Tax Returns.

(b) _Tax Treatment_. Acquiror, Merger Sub and the Company intend that the
Transactions shall qualify for the Intended Tax Treatment. None of the parties
or their respective Affiliates shall knowingly take or cause to be taken, or
knowingly fail to take or knowingly cause to be failed to be taken, any
action that would reasonably be expected to prevent qualification for such
Intended Tax Treatment. Each party shall, unless otherwise required by a final

similar state, local or non-U.S. final determination) or a change in

the Transactions from the terms described in this Agreement, cause all Tax
Returns to be filed on a basis of treating the Merger as a "reorganization"

transaction that qualifies under Section 351 of the Code. Each of the parties
agrees to use reasonable best efforts to promptly notify all other parties of
any challenge to the Intended Tax Treatment by any Governmental Authority.
Acquiror and the Company shall execute and deliver officers certificates

, that, notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary,
each party and its Affiliates may make announcements and may provide
information regarding this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby

10.02 _Effect of Termination_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 10.02_, in the
event of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _

any liability on the part of any party hereto or its respective Affiliates,
officers, directors, employees or stockholders, other than liability of any
party hereto for any Willful Breach of this Agreement by such party occurring
prior to such termination subject to _Section_ __ _ 6.06_. The provisions of
_Sections 6.06_ , _8.04_ ,  _10.02_ and _Article XI_ (collectively, the "
_Surviving Provisions_ ") and the Confidentiality Agreement, and any other
Section or Article of this Agreement referenced in the Surviving Provisions,
which are required to survive in order to give appropriate effect to the
Surviving Provisions, shall in each case survive any termination of this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a failure by Acquiror and Merger Sub
to close in accordance with this Agreement when they are obligated to do so

(b) In the event that this Agreement is validly terminated by (A) the
Company pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.01(e)_ or (B) by Acquiror pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 10.01(f)_, then the Company shall pay the Company

of a termination pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.01(f)_ (and, in any event,
within two Business Days following such termination), payable by wire transfer
of immediately available funds.

 

(c) The Parties acknowledge and hereby agree that the Company Termination
Payment, if, as and when required pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 10.02_,
shall not constitute a penalty but will be liquidated damages, in a reasonable
amount that will compensate Acquiror in the circumstances in which it is
payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone
while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the Merger, which amount would otherwise be
impossible to calculate with precision. The Parties acknowledge and hereby
agree that in no event shall the Company be required to pay the Company
Termination Payment on more than one occasion. Each of the Company, Acquiror
and Merger Sub acknowledges that the agreements contained in this  _Section_
__ _ 10.02_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and that, without these agreements, the Parties would not enter into
this Agreement.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in any
circumstance in which this Agreement is terminated and Acquiror is paid the
Company Termination Payment pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 10.02_, the
Company Termination Payment shall be

 



88

    

 the sole and exclusive monetary remedy of Acquiror, Merger Sub or any of the
Acquiror Related Parties against the Company or any other Company Related
Party for any loss or damage suffered as a result of the failure of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be
consummated or for a breach (including any Willful Breach) of, or failure to
perform under, this Agreement or any certificate or other document delivered
in connection herewith or otherwise or in respect of any oral representation
made or alleged to have been made in connection herewith or therewith, and
upon payment of such amounts, none of the Company Related Parties shall have
any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or in respect of representations made or alleged to be made in
connection herewith, whether in equity or at law, in contract, in tort or
otherwise.

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages,

that the parties do not perform their obligations under the provisions of this
Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are required of them
hereunder to consummate this Agreement) in accordance with its specified
terms or otherwise breach such provisions. The parties acknowledge and agree

or other equitable relief, to prevent breaches of this Agreement and
to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, without proof of
damages, prior to the valid termination of this Agreement in accordance with

enforcement is an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and without that right, none of the parties would have entered into

specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that the other
parties have an adequate remedy at Law or that an award of specific
performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or equity. The
parties acknowledge and agree that any party seeking an injunction to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this  _Section_ __ _

A. The board of directors of the Corporation (the " _Board of Directors_
") is hereby expressly authorized, by resolution or resolutions, at any time
and from time to time, to provide, out of the unissued shares of Preferred
Stock, for one or more series of Preferred Stock and, with respect to each
such series, to fix, without further stockholder approval (subject to any
separate vote or consent of the holders of one or more classes or series of
stock of the Corporation expressly required therefor under this Restated
Certificate (including any certificate of designation relating to any series
of Preferred Stock)), the designation of such series, the powers (including
voting powers), preferences and relative, participating, optional and
other special rights, and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions
thereof, of such series of Preferred Stock and the number of shares of such

participating, optional and other special rights of, and the qualifications,
limitations or restrictions thereof, of each series of Preferred Stock, if
any, may differ from those of any and all other series at any time
outstanding.

 

B. Each holder of record of Common Stock, as such, shall be entitled to one
vote for each share of Common Stock held of record by such holder on all
matters on which stockholders are entitled to vote generally or holders of
Common Stock as a separate class are entitled to vote (whether voting
separately as a class or together with one or more classes of
the Corporations capital stock); provided, however, that to the fullest
extent permitted by law, holders of Common Stock, as such, shall have no
voting power with respect to, and shall not be entitled to vote on, any
amendment to this Restated Certificate (including any certificate of
designation relating to any series of Preferred Stock) that relates solely to
the terms of one or more outstanding series of Preferred Stock if the holders
of such affected series are entitled, either separately or together with the
holders of one or more other such series, to vote thereon pursuant to this
Restated Certificate (including any certificate of designation relating to any
series of Preferred Stock) or pursuant to the DGCL.

 

C. Except as otherwise required by law, holders of any series of Preferred
Stock shall be entitled to only such voting rights, if any, as shall
expressly be granted thereto by this Restated Certificate (including any
certificate of designation relating to such series of Preferred Stock).

 

D. Subject to applicable law and the rights, if any, of the holders of any
outstanding series of Preferred Stock or any class or series of stock of the
Corporation having a preference over or the right to participate with the
Common Stock with respect to the payment of dividends and other distributions
in cash, property or shares of capital stock of the Corporation, such
dividends and other distributions may be declared and paid ratably on the
Common Stock out of the assets of the Corporation which are legally available
for this purpose at such times and in such amounts as the Board of Directors
in its discretion shall determine.

outstanding series of Preferred Stock or any class or series of stock of
the Corporation having a preference over or the right to participate with the
Common Stock with respect to the distribution of assets of the Corporation
upon such dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Corporation, the
holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive the remaining assets of
the Corporation available for distribution to its stockholders ratably in
proportion to the number of shares held by them.

 

F. The number of authorized shares of Preferred Stock or Common Stock may
be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then
outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting
power of the stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon irrespective of
the provisions of Section 242(b)(2) of the DGCL (or any successor provision
thereto), and no vote of the holders of any of the Common Stock or the
Preferred Stock voting separately as a class shall be required therefor,
unless a vote of any such holder is required pursuant to this Restated
Certificate (including any certificate of designation relating to any series
of Preferred Stock).

ARTICLE V

including any Person (as defined below) that from time to time becomes a
Stockholder Party pursuant to the terms of, the Stockholders Agreement,
dated [ ] (as the same may be amended, supplemented, restated or
otherwise modified from time to time, the " _Stockholders Agreement_
"),(together with their respective Affiliates, successors and permitted
assigns, each, a " _Stockholder Party_ ", and collectively the " _Stockholder
Parties_ ")) beneficially own, in the aggregate, less than 30% of the total

all the then-outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote
thereon, voting together as a single class: this Article V, Article VI,
Article VII, Article VIII, Article IX, Article X and Article XI(B). For the
purposes of this Restated Certificate, beneficial ownership of shares shall
be determined in accordance with Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ ").

 

B. In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred by the
DGCL, the Board of Directors is expressly authorized to make, amend, alter,
change, add to or repeal, in whole or in part, the bylaws of the Corporation
(as in effect from time to time, the " _Bylaws_ ") without the assent or vote
of the stockholders in any manner not inconsistent with the laws of the State
of Delaware or this Restated Certificate. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Restated Certificate or any provision of law which
might otherwise permit a 

 



3

    

 lesser vote of the stockholders, at any time when the Stockholder Parties
beneficially own, in the aggregate, less than 30% of the total voting power of
all the then outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote
generally in the election of directors, in addition to any vote of the holders
of any class or series of capital stock of the Corporation required herein
(including any certificate of designation relating to any series of Preferred
Stock), by the Bylaws or by applicable law, the affirmative vote of the
holders of at least 66 2/3% in voting power of all the then outstanding shares
of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon, voting together as
a single class, shall be required in order for the stockholders of the
Corporation to alter, amend, repeal or rescind, in whole or in part, any
provision of the Bylaws or to adopt any provision inconsistent therewith.

 

C. As used in this Article V and Article VIII only, the term " _Affiliate_
" means a Person that directly, or indirectly through one or more
intermediaries, controls, or is controlled by, or is under common control
with, another Person, and as used in this Article V and Article IX only, the
term " _Person_ " means any individual, corporation, general or limited
partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust, association or
any other entity.

 

ARTICLE VI

_BOARD OF DIRECTORS_

A. Except as otherwise provided in this Restated Certificate or the DGCL,
the business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by or under the
direction of the Board of Directors. Except as otherwise provided for or fixed
pursuant to the provisions of Article IV (including any certificate of
designation with respect to any series of Preferred Stock) and this Article
VI relating to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock to
elect additional directors and subject to the applicable requirements of the
Stockholders Agreement, the total number of directors shall be determined
from time to time exclusively by resolution adopted by the Board of Directors.
The directors (other than those directors elected by the holders of any series
of Preferred Stock, voting separately as a series or together with one or
more other such series, as the case may be) shall be divided into three
classes designated Class I, Class II and Class III. Each class shall consist,
as nearly as possible, of one-third of the total number of such directors.
Class I directors shall initially serve for a term expiring at the first
annual meeting of stockholders following the initial classification of the
Board of Directors (the " _Classification Date_ "), Class II directors shall
initially serve for a term expiring at the second annual meeting of
stockholders following the Classification Date and Class III directors
shall initially serve for a term expiring at the third annual meeting of
stockholders following the Classification Date. Commencing with the first
annual meeting of stockholders following the Classification Date, the
directors of the class to be elected at each annual meeting shall be elected
for a three-year term. If the number of such directors is changed, any
increase or decrease shall be apportioned among the classes so as to maintain
the number of directors in each class as nearly equal as possible, and any
such additional director of any class elected to fill a newly created
directorship resulting from an increase in such class shall hold office for a
term that shall coincide with the remaining term of that class, but in no
case shall a decrease in the number of directors remove or shorten the term
of any incumbent director. Any such director shall hold office until the
annual meeting at which his or her term expires and until his or her successor
shall be elected and qualified, or

 



4

    

 his or her earlier death, resignation, retirement, disqualification or
removal from office. The Board of Directors is authorized to assign members of
the Board of Directors already in office to their respective class.

B. Subject to the rights granted to the holders of any one or more series
of Preferred Stock then outstanding and the rights granted pursuant to the
Stockholders Agreement, any newly-created directorship on the Board of
Directors that results from an increase in the number of directors and any
vacancy occurring in the Board of Directors (whether by death, resignation,
retirement, disqualification, removal or other cause) may be filled by the
affirmative vote of a majority of the directors then in office (other than
directors elected by the holders of any series of Preferred Stock, voting
separately as a series or together with one or more series, as the case may
be), although less than a quorum, by a sole remaining director or by the
stockholders; _provided, however,_ that, subject to the rights of the holders
of Preferred Stock or those granted pursuant to the Stockholders Agreement, at
any time when the Stockholder Parties beneficially own, in the aggregate, less
than 30% of the total voting power of all the then outstanding shares of stock
of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors,
any newly-created directorship on the Board of Directors that results from an
increase in the number of directors and any vacancy occurring in the Board of
Directors shall be filled only by a majority of the directors then in office,
although less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director (other than
directors elected by the holders of any series of Preferred Stock, by voting
separately as a series or together with one or more series, as the case may
be) (and not by stockholders). Any director elected to fill a vacancy or newly
created directorship shall hold office until the next election of the class
for which such director shall have been chosen and until his or her successor
shall be elected and qualified, or until his or her earlier death,
resignation, retirement, disqualification or removal.

 

C. Any or all of the directors (other than the directors elected by the
holders of any series of Preferred Stock of the Corporation, voting
separately as a series or together with one or more other such series, as the
case may be) may be removed at any time either with or without cause by the
affirmative vote of a majority in voting power of all outstanding shares
of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a
single class; _provided, however,_ that at any time when the Stockholder
Parties beneficially own, in the aggregate, less than 30% of the total voting
power of all the then outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation entitled
to vote generally in the election of directors, any such director or all such
directors may be removed only for cause and only by the affirmative vote of
the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the total voting power of all the then
outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon,
voting together as a single class.

 

D. Elections of directors need not be by written ballot unless the Bylaws
shall so provide.

 

E. During any period when the holders of any series of Preferred Stock,
voting separately as a series or together with one or more other such series,
have the right to elect additional directors pursuant to the provisions of
this Restated Certificate (including any certificate of designation with
respect to any series of Preferred Stock) in respect of such series, then
upon commencement and for the duration of the period during which such right
continues; (i) the then otherwise total authorized number of directors of the
Corporation shall automatically

 



5

    

 be increased by such specified number of directors, and the holders of such
Preferred Stock shall be entitled to elect the additional directors so
provided for or fixed pursuant to said provisions, and (ii) each such
additional director shall serve until such directors successor shall have
been duly elected and qualified, or until such directors right to hold such
office terminates pursuant to said provisions, whichever occurs earlier,
subject to his or her earlier death, resignation, retirement, disqualification
or removal. Except as otherwise provided by the Board of Directors in the
resolution or resolutions establishing such series, whenever the holders of
any series of Preferred Stock having such right to elect additional directors
are divested of such right pursuant to the provisions of such stock, the terms
of office of all such additional directors elected by the holders of such
stock, or elected to fill any vacancies resulting from the death,
resignation, disqualification or removal of such additional directors, shall
forthwith terminate (in which case each such director thereupon shall cease to
be qualified as, and shall cease to be, a director) and the total authorized
number of directors of the Corporation shall automatically be reduced
accordingly.

ARTICLE VII

_LIMITATION OF DIRECTOR LIABILITY_

 

A. To the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL as it now exists or may
hereafter be amended, a director of the Corporation shall not be personally
liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach
of fiduciary duty owed to the Corporation or its stockholders.

 

B. Neither the amendment nor repeal of this Article VII, nor the adoption
of any provision of this Restated Certificate, nor, to the fullest extent
permitted by the DGCL, any modification of law shall eliminate, reduce or
otherwise adversely affect any right or protection of a current or former
director of the Corporation in respect of any act or omission occurring prior
to the time of such amendment, repeal, adoption or modification.

ARTICLE VIII

 

 _CONSENT OF STOCKHOLDERS IN LIEU OF MEETING, ANNUAL AND SPECIAL MEETINGS OF
STOCKHOLDERS_

 

A. At any time when the Stockholder Parties beneficially own, in the
aggregate, at least 30% of the total voting power of all the then outstanding
shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election
of directors, any action required or permitted to be taken at any annual or
special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation may be taken without a
meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent or consents in
writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of
outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would
be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all
shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted and shall be delivered
to the Corporation in accordance with the applicable provisions of the DGCL.
At any time when the Stockholder Parties beneficially own, in the aggregate,
less than 30% of the total voting power of all the then outstanding shares of
stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the

 



6

    

 election of directors, any action required or permitted to be taken by the
stockholders of the Corporation must be effected at a duly called annual or
special meeting of such holders and may not be effected by any consent of
stockholders in lieu of a meeting, unless such action is recommended by all
directors then in office; _provided, however_ , that any action required or
permitted to be taken by the holders of Preferred Stock, voting separately as
a series or separately as a class with one or more other such series, may be
taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, to the
extent expressly so provided by the applicable certificate of designation
relating to such series of Preferred Stock.

B. Except as otherwise required by law and subject to the rights of the
holders of any series of Preferred Stock, special meetings of the
stockholders of the Corporation for any purpose or purposes may be called at
any time only by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or the Chairman
of the Board of Directors; provided, however, that at any time when the
Stockholder Parties beneficially own, in the aggregate, at least 30% of the
total voting power of all the then outstanding shares of stock of the
Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, special
meetings of the stockholders of the Corporation for any purpose or purposes
shall also be called by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or the
Chairman of the Board of Directors at the request of any Stockholder Party
that is an Affiliate of The Blackstone Group Inc. (or the successors and
permitted assigns of any such Stockholder Party) (collectively, " _Blackstone_
").

 

C. An annual meeting of stockholders for the election of directors to
succeed those whose terms expire and for the transaction of such other
business as may properly come before the meeting, shall be held at such place,
if any, on such date, and at such time as shall be fixed exclusively by
resolution of the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee thereof.

ARTICLE IX

 

 _COMPETITION AND CORPORATE OPPORTUNITIES_

 

A. In recognition and anticipation that (i) certain directors, principals,
officers, employees and/or other representatives of the Stockholder Parties
and each of their Affiliates (as defined in this Article IX) may serve as
directors, officers or agents of the Corporation, (ii) the Stockholder Parties
and their Affiliates may now engage and may continue to engage in the same or
similar activities or related lines of business as those in which the
Corporation, directly or indirectly, may engage or propose to engage and/or
other business activities that overlap with or compete with those in which
the Corporation or any of its Affiliates, directly or indirectly, may engage
or propose to engage, and (iii) members of the Board of Directors who are not
employees of the Corporation (" _Non-Employee Directors_") and their
respective Affiliates may now engage and may continue to engage in the same or
similar activities or related lines of business as those in which
the Corporation, directly or indirectly, may engage and/or other business
activities that overlap with or compete with those in which the Corporation or
any of its Affiliates, directly or indirectly, may engage or propose to
engage, the provisions of this Article IX are set forth to regulate and
define the conduct of certain affairs of the Corporation with respect to
certain classes or categories of business opportunities as they may involve
any of the Stockholder Parties, the Non-Employee Directors or their respective
Affiliates and the powers, rights, duties and liabilities of the Corporation
and its directors, officers and stockholders in connection therewith.

 



7

    

B. None of (i) the Stockholder Parties or any of their Affiliates or (ii)
any Non-Employee Director (including any Non-Employee Director who serves as
an officer of the Corporation in both his or her director and officer
capacities) or his or her Affiliates (the Persons identified in (i) and (ii)
above being referred to, collectively, as " _Identified Persons_ " and,
individually, as an " _Identified Person_ ") shall, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, have any duty to refrain from directly or indirectly (1)
engaging in the same or similar business activities or lines of business in
which the Corporation or any of its Affiliates now engages or proposes to
engage or (2) otherwise competing with the Corporation or any of its
Affiliates, and, to the fullest extent permitted by law, no Identified Person
shall be liable to the Corporation or its stockholders or to any Affiliate of
the Corporation for breach of any fiduciary duty solely by reason of the fact
that such Identified Person engages in any such activities. To the fullest
extent permitted by law, the Corporation hereby renounces any interest or
expectancy in, or right to be offered an opportunity to participate in, any
business opportunity that may be a corporate opportunity for an Identified
Person and the Corporation or any of its Affiliates, except as provided in
Section (C) of this Article IX. Subject to said Section (C) of this Article
IX, in the event that any Identified Person acquires knowledge of a potential
transaction or other business opportunity that may be a corporate opportunity
for itself, herself or himself and the Corporation or any of its Affiliates,
such Identified Person shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, have no
duty to communicate or offer such transaction or other business opportunity to
the Corporation or any of its Affiliates and, to the fullest extent permitted
by law, shall not be liable to the Corporation or its stockholders or to any
Affiliate of the Corporation for breach of any fiduciary duty as a
stockholder, director or officer of the Corporation solely by reason of the
fact that such Identified Person pursues or acquires such corporate
opportunity for itself, herself or himself, or offers or directs such
corporate opportunity to another Person or does not communicate information
regarding such corporate opportunity to the Corporation.

C. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Article IX, the
Corporation does not renounce its interest in any corporate opportunity
offered to any Non-Employee Director (including any Non-Employee Director who
serves as an officer of the Corporation) if such opportunity is expressly
offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer
of the Corporation, and the provisions of Section (B) of this Article IX shall
not apply to any such corporate opportunity.

 

D. In addition to and notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
Article IX, a potential corporate opportunity shall not be deemed to be a
corporate opportunity for the Corporation if it is a business opportunity that
(i) the Corporation is neither financially or legally able, nor contractually
permitted to undertake, (ii) from its nature, is not in the line of the
Corporations business or is of no practical advantage to the Corporation or
(iii) is one in which the Corporation has no interest or reasonable
expectancy.

 

E. For purposes of this Article IX, " _Affiliate_ " shall mean (a) in
respect of any Stockholder Party, any Person that, directly or indirectly, is
controlled by a Stockholder Party, controls a Stockholder Party or is under
common control with a Stockholder Party and shall include any principal,
member, director, partner, stockholder, officer, employee or other

 



8

    

 representative of any of the foregoing (other than the Corporation and any

meeting by the chairman of the meeting. The Board of Directors may adopt by
resolution such rules and regulations for the conduct of the meeting of
stockholders as it shall deem appropriate. Except to the extent inconsistent
with such rules and regulations as adopted by the Board of Directors, the
chairman of the meeting shall have the right and authority to convene and
(for any or no reason) to recess and/or adjourn the meeting, to prescribe such
rules, regulations and procedures and to do all such acts as, in the judgment
of such chairman, are appropriate for the proper conduct of the meeting. Such

Section 2.03, unless otherwise required by the DGCL, if the stockholder (or a
qualified representative of the stockholder) does not appear at the annual or
special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation to present a nomination or
business, such nomination shall be disregarded and such proposed business
shall not be transacted, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote
may have been received by the Corporation. For purposes of this Section 2.03,
to be considered a qualified representative of the stockholder, a person must
be a duly authorized officer, manager or partner of such stockholder or must
be authorized by a writing executed by such stockholder or an electronic
transmission delivered by such stockholder to act for such stockholder as
proxy at the meeting of stockholders and such person must produce such writing
or electronic transmission, or a reliable reproduction of the

and to the extent determined by the Board of Directors or the chairman of the
meeting, the meeting of stockholders shall not be required to be held in
accordance with the rules of parliamentary procedure.

(2) Whenever used in these Bylaws, "public announcement" shall mean
disclosure (a) in a press release released by the Corporation, provided such
press release is released by the Corporation following its customary
procedures, is reported by the Dow Jones News Service, Associated Press or
comparable national news service, or is generally available on internet news
sites, or (b) in a document publicly filed by the Corporation with the
Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.

(3) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.03, a
stockholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange
Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder with respect to the
matters set forth in this Section 2.03; _provided, however_ , that, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, any references in these Bylaws to the
Exchange Act or the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder are not
intended to and shall not limit any requirements applicable to nominations or
proposals as to any other business to be considered pursuant to these Bylaws
(including paragraphs (A)(1)(d) and (B) of this Section 2.03), and compliance
with paragraphs (A)(1)(d) and (B) of this Section 2.03 of these Bylaws shall
be the exclusive means for a stockholder to make nominations or submit other
business. Nothing in these Bylaws shall be deemed to affect any rights of the
holders of any class or series of stock having a preference over the Common
Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation to elect directors under specified
circumstances.

 

(4) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section
2.03, for as long as the Stockholders Agreement remains in effect with
respect to the Stockholder Parties (as defined in the Certificate of
Incorporation), the Stockholder Parties (to the extent then subject to the
Stockholders Agreement) shall not be subject to the notice procedures set
forth in paragraphs (A)(2), (A)(3) or (B) of this Section 2.03 with respect to
any annual or special meeting of stockholders.

meeting, the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders
and proxyholders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such
meeting, the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at
the meeting, if such date is different from the record date for
determining stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting, and, in the case
of a special meeting, the purposes for which the meeting is called, shall be
mailed to or transmitted electronically by the Secretary of the Corporation to
each stockholder of record entitled to vote thereat as of the record date for
determining the stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting. Unless
otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws,
the notice of any meeting shall be given not less than ten (10) nor more than
sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting to each stockholder entitled to

SECTION 2.05 _Quorum_. Unless otherwise required by law, the
Certificate of Incorporation or the rules of any stock exchange upon which the
Corporations securities are listed, the holders of record of a majority of
the voting power of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of the
Corporation entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by
proxy, shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at all
meetings of stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, where a separate vote
by a class or series or classes or series is required, a majority in voting
power of the outstanding shares of such class or series or classes or series,
present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum entitled
to take action with respect to the vote on that matter. Once a quorum is
present to organize a meeting, it shall not be broken by the subsequent
withdrawal of any stockholders. __

 

SECTION 2.06 _Voting_. Except as otherwise provided by or pursuant to
the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation, each stockholder entitled
to vote at any meeting of the stockholders shall be entitled to one vote for
each share of stock held by such stockholder that has voting power upon the
matters in question. Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of
stockholders or to express consent to corporate action in writing without a
meeting may authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder by
proxy in any manner provided under Section 212(c) of the DGCL or as otherwise
provided under applicable law, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon
after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer
period. A proxy shall be irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and
if, and only as long as, it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to
support an irrevocable power. A stockholder may revoke any proxy that is not
irrevocable by attending the meeting and voting in person or by delivering to
the Secretary of the Corporation a revocation of the proxy or a new proxy
bearing a later date. Unless required by the Certificate of Incorporation or
applicable law, or determined by the chairman of the meeting to be advisable,
the vote on any question need not be by ballot. On a vote by ballot, each
ballot shall be signed by the stockholder voting, or by such stockholders
proxy, if there be such proxy. When a quorum is present or represented at any
meeting, the vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the
shares of stock present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote
on the subject matter shall decide any question brought before such meeting,
unless the question is one upon which, by express provision of applicable
law, of the rules or regulations of any stock exchange applicable to the
Corporation, of any regulation applicable to the Corporation or its
securities, of the Certificate of Incorporation or of these Bylaws,
a different vote is required, in which case such express provision shall
govern and control the decision of such question. Notwithstanding the
foregoing sentence and subject to the Certificate of Incorporation, all
elections of directors shall be determined by a plurality of the votes cast
in respect of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the
meeting and entitled to vote on the election of directors.

 

SECTION 2.07 _Chairman of Meetings_. The Chairman of the Board of
Directors, or in the Chairman of the Board of Directors absence or at the
Chairman of the Board of Directors direction, the Chief Executive Officer of
the Corporation (the " _Chief Executive Officer_ "), or in the absence of the
Chief Executive Officer or at the Chief Executive Officers direction, a
person designated by the Board of Directors shall be the chairman of the
meeting and, as such, preside at all meetings of the stockholders. __

 

SECTION 2.08 _Secretary of Meetings_. The Secretary of the Corporation
shall act as Secretary at all meetings of the stockholders. In the absence or

required or permitted to be taken at any annual or special meeting of
stockholders of the Corporation may be taken without a meeting, without prior
notice and without a vote only to the extent permitted by and in the manner
provided in the Certificate of Incorporation and in accordance with
applicable law.

SECTION 2.10 _Adjournment_. At any meeting of stockholders of the
Corporation, if less than a quorum be present, the chairman of the meeting or
stockholders holding a majority in voting power of the shares of outstanding
stock of the Corporation, present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote
thereon, shall have the power to adjourn the meeting from time to time without
notice other than announcement at the meeting until a quorum shall be present.
Any business may be transacted at the adjourned meeting that might have been
transacted at the meeting originally noticed. If the adjournment is for more
than thirty (30) days, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to
each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. If after the
adjournment a new record date for determination of stockholders entitled to
vote is fixed for the adjourned meeting, the Board of Directors shall fix as
the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of such
adjourned meeting the same or an earlier date as that fixed for determination
of stockholders entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting, and shall give
notice of the adjourned meeting to each stockholder of record entitled to vote
at such adjourned meeting as of the record date so fixed for notice of such
adjourned meeting. __

SECTION 2.11 _Remote Communication_. If authorized by the Board of
Directors in its sole discretion, and subject to such guidelines and
procedures as the Board of Directors may adopt, stockholders and proxy holders
not physically present at a meeting of stockholders may, by means of
remote communication:

(a) participate in a meeting of stockholders; and

 

(b) be deemed present in person and vote at a meeting of stockholders
whether such meeting is to be held at a designated place or solely by means
of remote communication;

_provided_ , that

 

(i) the Corporation shall implement reasonable measures to verify that each
person deemed present and permitted to vote at the meeting by means of remote
communication is a stockholder or proxyholder;

(ii) the Corporation shall implement reasonable measures to provide such
stockholders and proxyholders a reasonable opportunity to participate in the
meeting and to vote on matters submitted to the stockholders, including an
opportunity to read or hear the proceedings of the meeting substantially
concurrently with such proceedings; and

 



8

    

(iii) if any stockholder or proxyholder votes or takes other action at the
meeting by means of remote communication, a record of such vote or other
action shall be maintained by the Corporation.

 

SECTION 2.12 _Inspectors of Election_. The Corporation may, and shall if
required by law, in advance of any meeting of stockholders, appoint one or
more inspectors of election, who may be employees of the Corporation, to act
at the meeting or any adjournment thereof and to make a written report
thereof. The Corporation may designate one or more persons as alternate
inspectors to replace any inspector who fails to act. In the event that no
inspector so appointed or designated is able to act at a meeting of
stockholders, the chairman of the meeting shall appoint one or more inspectors
to act at the meeting. Each inspector, before entering upon the discharge of
his or her duties, shall take and sign an oath to execute faithfully the
duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best of his
or her ability. The inspector or inspectors so appointed or designated shall
(i) ascertain the number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation
outstanding and the voting power of each such share, (ii) determine the shares
of capital stock of the Corporation represented at the meeting and the
validity of proxies and ballots, (iii) count all votes and ballots, (iv)
determine and retain for a reasonable period a record of the disposition of
any challenges made to any determination by the inspectors and (v) certify
their determination of the number of shares of capital stock of the
Corporation represented at the meeting and such inspectors count of all votes
and ballots. Such certification and report shall specify such other
information as may be required by law. In determining the validity and
counting of proxies and ballots cast at any meeting of stockholders of the
Corporation, the inspectors may consider such information as is permitted by
applicable law. No person who is a candidate for an office at an election may
serve as an inspector at such election.

SECTION 5.05 _List of Stockholders Entitled to Vote_. The Corporation
shall prepare, at least ten (10) days before every meeting of stockholders, a
complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting ( _provided_
, _however_ , if the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to
vote is less than ten (10) days before the date of the meeting, the list
shall reflect the stockholders entitled to vote as of the tenth (10th) day
before the meeting date), arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the
address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name
of each stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any
stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting at least ten (10) days
prior to the meeting (a) on a reasonably accessible electronic network;
_provided_ that the information required to gain access to such list is
provided with the notice of meeting or (b) during ordinary business hours at
the principal place of business of the Corporation. In the event that the
Corporation determines to make the list available on an electronic network,
the Corporation may take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is
available only to stockholders of the Corporation. If the meeting is to be
held at a place, then a list of stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting
shall be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the
whole time thereof and may be examined by any stockholder who is present. If
the meeting is to be held solely by means of remote communication, then the
list shall also be open to the examination of any stockholder during the
whole time of the meeting on a reasonably accessible electronic network, and
the information required to access such list shall be provided with the

 notice of the meeting. Except as otherwise provided by the DGCL, the stock
ledger shall be the only evidence as to who are the stockholders entitled to
examine the list of stockholders required by this Section 5.05 or to vote in
person or by proxy at any meeting of stockholders.

 

SECTION 5.06 _Fixing Date for Determination of Stockholders of Record_.

 

(A) In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled
to notice of any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, the
Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede
the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the
Board of Directors, and which record date shall, unless otherwise required by
law, not be more than sixty (60) nor less than ten (10) days before the date
of such meeting. If the Board of Directors so fixes a date, such date shall
also be the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at
such meeting unless the Board of Directors determines, at the time it fixes
such record date, that a later date on or before the date of the meeting shall
be the date for making such determination. If no record date is fixed by the
Board of Directors, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to
notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of
business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if
notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day
on which the meeting is held. A determination of stockholders of record
entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to
any adjournment of the meeting; _provided, however_ , that the Board of
Directors may fix a new record date for determination of stockholders entitled
to vote at the adjourned meeting, and in such case shall also fix as the
record date for stockholders entitled to notice of such adjourned meeting the
same or an earlier date as that fixed for determination of stockholders
entitled to vote in accordance herewith at the adjourned meeting.

 

(B) In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled
to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any
rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change,
conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action,
the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not
precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted,
and which record date shall not be more than sixty (60) days prior to such
action. If no such record date is fixed, the record date for
determining stockholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of
business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution
relating thereto.

 

(C) Unless otherwise restricted by the Certificate of Incorporation, in
order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to express
consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the Board of
Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date
upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of
Directors, and which record date shall not be more than ten (10) days after
the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the
Board of Directors. If no record date for determining stockholders entitled
to express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting is fixed
by the Board of Directors, (i) when no prior action of the Board of Directors
is required by law, the record date for such purpose shall be the first date
on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed
to be taken is delivered to the Corporation in accordance with applicable law,
and (ii) if prior action by the Board of Directors is required by law, the
record date for such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on
which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action.

SECTION 5.07 _Registered Stockholders_. Prior to the surrender to the
Corporation of the certificate or certificates for a share or shares of stock
or notification to the Corporation of the transfer of uncertificated shares
with a request to record the transfer of such share or shares, the
Corporation may treat the registered owner of such share or shares as the
person entitled to receive dividends, to vote, to receive notifications and
otherwise to exercise all the rights and powers of an owner of such share or
shares. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Corporation shall not be
bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in such share
or shares on the part of any other person, whether or not it shall have
express or other notice thereof.

 

ARTICLE VI

Notice and Waiver of Notice

SECTION 6.01 _Notice_. (A) Without limiting the manner by which notice
otherwise may be given effectively to stockholders, any notice to
stockholders given by the Corporation under any provision of the DGCL, the
Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws may be given in writing directed
to the stockholders mailing address (or by electronic transmission directed
to the stockholders electronic mail address, as applicable) as it appears on
the records of the Corporation. Notice shall be given (i) if mailed, when
deposited in the United States mail, (ii) if delivered by courier service,
the earlier of when the notice is received or left at the stockholders
address, or (iii) if given by electronic mail, when directed to such
stockholders electronic mail address (unless the stockholder has notified
the Corporation in writing or by electronic transmission of an objection to
receiving notice by electronic mail or such notice is prohibited by the DGCL
to be given by electronic transmission). A notice by electronic mail must
include a prominent legend that the communication is an important notice
regarding the Corporation. A notice by electronic mail will include any files
attached thereto and any information hyperlinked to a website if such
electronic mail includes the contact information of an officer or agent of
the Corporation who is available to assist with accessing such files or
information. Any notice to stockholders given by the Corporation under any
provision of the DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws
provided by means of electronic transmission (other than any such notice given
by electronic mail) may only be given in a form consented to by such
stockholder, and any such notice by such means of electronic transmission
shall be deemed to be given as provided by the DGCL.

(B) Except as otherwise provided herein or permitted by applicable law,
notices to any director may be in writing and delivered personally or mailed
to such director at such directors address appearing on the books of the
Corporation, or may be given by telephone or by any means of electronic
transmission (including, without limitation, electronic mail) directed to an
address for receipt by such director of electronic transmissions appearing on
the books of the Corporation.

 



17

    

(C) Without limiting the manner by which notice otherwise may be given
effectively to stockholders, and except as prohibited by applicable law, any
notice to stockholders given by the Corporation under any provision of
applicable law, the Certificate of Incorporation, or these Bylaws shall be
effective if given by a single written notice to stockholders who share an
address if consented to by the stockholders at that address to whom such
notice is given. Any such consent shall be revocable by the stockholder by
written notice to the corporation. Any stockholder who fails to object in
writing to the corporation, within 60 days of having been given written notice
by the Corporation of its intention to send the single notice permitted under
this Section 6.01(C), shall be deemed to have consented to receiving such
single written notice.

SECTION 6.02 _Waiver of Notice_. A written waiver of any notice, signed
by a stockholder or director, or waiver by electronic transmission by such
person, whether given before or after the time of the event for which notice
is to be given, shall be deemed equivalent to the notice required to be
given to such person. Neither the business nor the purpose of any meeting
need be specified in such a waiver. Attendance at any meeting (in person or by
remote communication) shall constitute waiver of notice except attendance for
the express purpose of objecting at the beginning of the meeting to the
transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or
convened.

 

ARTICLE VII

 

Indemnification

 

SECTION 7.01 _Right to Indemnification_. Each person who was or is made a
party or is threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved in any
action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative (hereinafter a " _proceeding_ "), by reason of the fact that he
or she is or was a director or an officer of the Corporation or, while a
director or officer of the Corporation, is or was serving at the request of
the Corporation as a director, officer, employee, agent or trustee of another
corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise,
including service with respect to an employee benefit plan (hereinafter an "
_indemnitee_ "), whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an
official capacity as a director, officer, employee, agent or trustee or in
any other capacity while serving as a director, officer, employee, agent or
trustee, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to the
fullest extent permitted by Delaware law, as the same exists or may hereafter
be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that
such amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification
rights than such law permitted the Corporation to provide prior to such
amendment), against all expense, liability and loss (including attorneys
fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid in
settlement) actually and reasonably incurred or suffered by such indemnitee in
connection therewith; provided, however, that, except as provided in Section
7.03 with respect to proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification or
advancement of expenses or with respect to any compulsory counterclaim brought
by such indemnitee, the Corporation shall indemnify any such indemnitee in
connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such indemnitee
only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of
Directors.

 

Any reference to an officer of the Corporation in this Article VII shall be
deemed to refer exclusively to the Chief Executive Officer, President, Chief
Financial Officer, Chief Legal Officer or General Counsel and Secretary of the
Corporation appointed pursuant to Article IV of these Bylaws, and to any Vice
President, Assistant Secretary, Assistant Treasurer or other officer 

 



18

    

 of the Corporation appointed by the Board of Directors pursuant to Article
IV of these Bylaws, and any reference to an officer of any other corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise
shall be deemed to refer exclusively to an officer appointed by the board of
directors or equivalent governing body of such other entity pursuant to the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws or equivalent organizational
documents of such other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust,
employee benefit plan or other enterprise. The fact that any person who is or
was an employee of the Corporation or an employee of any other
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or
other enterprise, but not an officer thereof as described in the preceding
sentence, has been given or has used the title of "Vice President" or any
other title that could be construed to suggest or imply that such person is
or may be such an officer of the Corporation or of such other corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise
shall not result in such person being constituted as, or being deemed to be,
such an officer of the Corporation or of such other corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise for purposes
of this Article VII.

 

SECTION 7.02 _Right to Advancement of Expenses_. In addition to the right
to indemnification conferred in Section 7.01, an indemnitee shall also have
the right to be paid by the Corporation the expenses (including attorneys
fees) incurred in appearing at, participating in or defending any such
proceeding in advance of its final disposition or in connection with a
proceeding brought to establish or enforce a right to indemnification or
advancement of expenses under this Article VII (which shall be governed by
Section 7.03 (hereinafter an " _advancement of expenses_ "); provided,
however, that, if the DGCL requires or in the case of an advance made in a
proceeding brought to establish or enforce a right to indemnification or
advancement, an advancement of expenses incurred by an indemnitee in his or
her capacity as a director or officer of the Corporation (and not in any
other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such indemnitee,
including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) shall be
made solely upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking (hereinafter
an " _undertaking_ "), by or on behalf of such indemnitee, to repay all
amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by final judicial
decision from which there is no further right to appeal (hereinafter a "
_final adjudication_ ") that such indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified
or entitled to advancement of expenses under Sections 7.01 and 7.02 or
otherwise. __

 

SECTION 7.03 _Right of Indemnitee to Bring Suit_. If a claim under Section
7.01 or 7.02 is not paid in full by the Corporation within (i) sixty (60)
days after a written claim for indemnification has been received by the
Corporation or (ii) twenty (20) days after a claim for an advancement of
expenses has been received by the Corporation, the indemnitee may at any time
thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of
the claim or to obtain advancement of expenses, as applicable. To the fullest
extent permitted by law, if the indemnitee is successful in whole or in part
in any such suit, or in a suit brought by the Corporation to recover an
advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the
indemnitee shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting
or defending such suit. In (i) any suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce
a right to indemnification hereunder (but not in a suit brought by the
indemnitee to enforce a right to an advancement of expenses) it shall be a
defense that, and (ii) any suit brought by the Corporation to recover an
advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the
Corporation shall be entitled to recover such expenses upon a final
adjudication that, the indemnitee has not met any applicable standard for

 



19

    

 indemnification set forth in the DGCL. Neither the failure of the
Corporation (including by its directors who are not parties to such action, a
committee of such directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders)
to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such suit that
indemnification of the indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because the
indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL,
nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including by its directors who
are not parties to such action, a committee of such directors, independent
legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the indemnitee has not met such
applicable standard of conduct, shall create a presumption that the
indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct or, in the case of
such a suit brought by the indemnitee, be a defense to such suit. In any suit
brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification or to an
advancement of expenses hereunder, or brought by the Corporation to recover an
advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the burden of
proving that the indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such
advancement of expenses, under this Article VII or otherwise shall be on the
Corporation.

 

SECTION 7.04 _Indemnification Not Exclusive_.

 

(A) The provision of indemnification to or the advancement of expenses and
costs to any indemnitee under this Article VII, or the entitlement of any
indemnitee to indemnification or advancement of expenses and costs under this
Article VII, shall not limit or restrict in any way the power of the
Corporation to indemnify or advance expenses and costs to such indemnitee in
any other way permitted by law or be deemed exclusive of, or invalidate, any
right to which any indemnitee seeking indemnification or advancement of
expenses and costs may be entitled under any law, agreement, vote of
stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in
such indemnitees capacity as an officer, director, employee or agent of the
Corporation and as to action in any other capacity.

 

(B) Given that certain jointly indemnifiable claims (as defined below) may
arise due to the service of the indemnitee as a director and/or officer of
the Corporation and as a director, officer, employee or agent of one or more
indemnitee-related entities (as defined below), the Corporation shall be fully
and primarily responsible for the payment to the indemnitee in respect of
indemnification or advancement of expenses in connection with any such jointly
indemnifiable claims, pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of this
Article VII, irrespective of any right of recovery the indemnitee may have
from any indemnitee-related entity. Under no circumstance shall the
Corporation be entitled to any right of subrogation or contribution by any
indemnitee-related entity and no right of advancement or recovery the
indemnitee may have from any indemnitee-related entity shall reduce or
otherwise alter the rights of the indemnitee or the obligations of the
Corporation hereunder. In the event that any indemnitee-related entity shall
make any payment to the indemnitee in respect of indemnification or
advancement of expenses with respect to any jointly indemnifiable claim, such
indemnitee-related entity shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to
all of the rights of recovery of the indemnitee against the Corporation, and
the indemnitee shall execute all papers reasonably required and shall do all
things that may be reasonably necessary to secure such rights, including the
execution of such documents as may be necessary to enable any indemnitee-
related entity effectively to bring suit to enforce such rights. Each of the
indemnitee-related entities shall be third-party beneficiaries with respect to
this Section 7.04(B) of Article VII, entitled to enforce this Section 7.04(B)
of Article VII.

  



20

have the following meanings:

(1) The term " _indemnitee-related entities_ " means any corporation,
limited liability company, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee
benefit plan or other enterprise (other than the Corporation or any other

as a director, officer, employee or agent and which service is covered by the
indemnity described herein) from whom an indemnitee may be entitled to
indemnification or advancement of expenses with respect to which, in whole or
in part, the Corporation may also have an indemnification or advancement
obligation (other than as a result of obligations under an insurance policy).

(2) The term " _jointly indemnifiable claims_ " shall be broadly construed
and shall include, without limitation, any action, suit or proceeding for
which the indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification or advancement of

to Delaware law, any agreement or certificate of incorporation, bylaws,
partnership agreement, operating agreement, certificate of formation,
certificate of limited partnership or comparable organizational documents of
the Corporation or an indemnitee-related entity, as applicable.

SECTION 7.05 _Nature of Rights_. The rights conferred upon indemnitees in
this Article VII shall be contract rights and such rights shall continue as
to an indemnitee who has ceased to be a director or officer and shall inure to
the benefit of the indemnitees heirs, executors and administrators. Any
amendment, alteration or repeal of this Article VII that adversely affects
any right of an indemnitee or its successors shall be prospective only and
shall not limit, eliminate, or impair any such right with respect to any
proceeding involving any occurrence or alleged occurrence of any action or
omission to act that took place prior to such amendment or repeal. __

 

SECTION 7.06 _Insurance_. The Corporation may purchase and maintain
insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any director, officer,
employee or agent of the Corporation or another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any expense, liability or
loss, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such
person against such expense, liability or loss under the DGCL.

SECTION 7.07 _ Indemnification of Employees and Agents of the
Corporation_. The Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time
by the Board of Directors, grant rights to indemnification and to the
advancement of expenses to any employee or agent of the Corporation to the
fullest extent of the provisions of this Article VII with respect to the
indemnification and advancement of expenses of directors and officers of the
Corporation.

to such Awards.

 

4\. Administration.

 

(a) _General_. The Committee shall administer the Plan. To the extent required
to comply with the provisions of Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act
(if the Board is not acting as the Committee under the Plan), it is intended
that each member of the Committee shall, at the time such member takes any
action with respect to an Award under the Plan that is intended to qualify

be a Qualifying Director. However, the fact that a Committee member shall
fail to qualify as a Qualifying Director shall not invalidate any Award
granted by the Committee that is otherwise validly granted under the Plan.

applicable law, the Committee shall have the sole and plenary authority, in
addition to other express powers and authorizations conferred on the Committee
by the Plan, to: (i) designate Participants; (ii) determine the type or types
of Awards to be granted to a Participant; (iii) determine the number of
shares of Common Stock to be covered by, or with respect to which payments,
rights, or other matters are to be calculated in connection with, Awards; (iv)
determine the terms and conditions of any Award; (v) determine whether,
to what extent, and under what circumstances Awards may be settled in, or
exercised for, cash, shares of Common Stock, other securities, other Awards,
or other property, or canceled, forfeited, or suspended and the method or
methods by which Awards may be settled, exercised, canceled, forfeited, or

inconsistency in, correct any defect in, and/or supply any omission in the

Plan; (viii) establish, amend, suspend, or waive any rules and regulations and
appoint such agents as the Committee shall deem appropriate for the
proper administration of the Plan; (ix) adopt Sub-Plans; and (x) make any
other determination and take any other action that the Committee deems
necessary or desirable for the administration of the Plan. 

(c) _Delegation_. Except to the extent prohibited by applicable law or the
applicable rules and regulations of any securities exchange or inter-dealer
quotation system on which the securities of the Company are listed or traded,
the Committee may allocate all or any portion of its responsibilities and
powers to any one or more of its members and may delegate all or any part of
its responsibilities and powers to any Person or Persons selected by it. Any
such allocation or delegation may be revoked by the Committee at any time.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Committee may delegate
to one or more officers of any member of the Company Group the authority to
act on behalf of the Committee with respect to any matter, right, obligation,
or election which is the responsibility of, or which is allocated to, the 

 



8

    

 Committee herein, and which may be so delegated as a matter of law, except
for grants of Awards to Non-Employee Directors. Notwithstanding the foregoing
in this Section 4(c), it is intended that any action under the Plan intended
to qualify for an exemption provided by Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act related to Persons who are subject to Section 16 of the Exchange
Act will be taken only by the Board or by a committee or subcommittee of two
(2) or more Qualifying Directors. However, the fact that any member of such
committee or subcommittee shall fail to qualify as a Qualifying Director
shall not invalidate any action that is otherwise valid under the Plan.

(d) _Finality of Decisions_. Unless otherwise expressly provided in the Plan,
all designations, determinations, interpretations, and other decisions under
or with respect to the Plan, any Award or any Award Agreement shall be within
the sole discretion of the Committee, may be made at any time, and shall be
final, conclusive, and binding upon all Persons, including, without
limitation, any member of the Company Group, any Participant, any holder or
beneficiary of any Award, and any stockholder of the Company.

 

(e) _Indemnification_. No member of the Board, the Committee, or any employee
or agent of any member of the Company Group (each such Person, an "
_Indemnifiable Person_ ") shall be liable for any action taken or omitted to
be taken or any determination made with respect to the Plan or any Award
hereunder (unless constituting fraud or a willful criminal act or omission).
Each Indemnifiable Person shall be indemnified and held harmless by the
Company against and from any loss, cost, liability, or expense (including
attorneys fees) that may be imposed upon or incurred by such Indemnifiable
Person in connection with or resulting from any action, suit, or proceeding
to which such Indemnifiable Person may be a party or in which such
Indemnifiable Person may be involved by reason of any action taken or omitted
to be taken or determination made with respect to the Plan or any Award
hereunder and against and from any and all amounts paid by such Indemnifiable
Person with the Companys approval, in settlement thereof, or paid by such
Indemnifiable Person in satisfaction of any judgment in any such action,
suit, or proceeding against such Indemnifiable Person, and the Company shall
advance to such Indemnifiable Person any such expenses promptly upon written
request (which request shall include an undertaking by the
Indemnifiable Person to repay the amount of such advance if it shall
ultimately be determined, as provided below, that the Indemnifiable Person is
not entitled to be indemnified); _provided_ , that the Company shall have the
right, at its own expense, to assume and defend any such action, suit, or
proceeding and once the Company gives notice of its intent to assume the
defense, the Company shall have sole control over such defense with counsel of
the Companys choice. The foregoing right of indemnification shall not be
available to an Indemnifiable Person to the extent that a final judgment or
other final adjudication (in either case not subject to further appeal)
binding upon such Indemnifiable Person determines that the acts, omissions,
or determinations of such Indemnifiable Person giving rise to the
indemnification claim resulted from such Indemnifiable Persons fraud or
willful criminal act or omission or that such right of indemnification is
otherwise prohibited by law or by the organizational documents of any member
of the Company Group. The foregoing right of indemnification shall not be
exclusive of or otherwise supersede any other rights of indemnification to
which such Indemnifiable Persons may be entitled under the organizational
documents of any member of the Company Group, as a matter of law, under an
individual indemnification agreement or contract, or otherwise, or any other
power that the Company may have to indemnify such Indemnifiable Persons or
hold such Indemnifiable Persons harmless.

 



9

    

(f) _Board Authority_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
the Plan, the Board may, in its sole discretion, at any time and from time to
time, grant Awards and administer the Plan with respect to such Awards. Any
such actions by the Board shall be subject to the applicable rules of the
securities exchange or inter-dealer quotation system on which the Common
Stock is listed or quoted. In any such case, the Board shall have all the
authority granted to the Committee under the Plan.

 

5\. Grant of Awards; Shares Subject to the Plan; Limitations.

 

(a) _Grants_. The Committee may, from time to time, grant Awards to one or
more Eligible Persons. All Awards granted under the Plan shall vest and
become exercisable in such manner and on such date or dates or upon such event
or events as determined by the Committee, including, without limitation,
attainment of Performance Conditions.

 

(b) _Share Reserve and Limits_. Awards granted under the Plan shall be subject
to the following limitations: (i) subject to Section 11 of the Plan, no more
than [ ]1 shares of Common Stock (the " _Absolute Share Limit_ ")
shall be available for Awards under the Plan; provided, however, that the
Absolute Share Limit shall be automatically increased on the first day of each
fiscal year following the fiscal year in which the Effective Date falls in an
amount equal to the least of (x) [ ]2 shares of Common Stock, (y)
5% of the total number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on the last day
of the immediately preceding fiscal year, and (z) a lower number of shares of
Common Stock as determined by the Board; (ii) subject to Section 11 of the
Plan, no more than the number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Absolute
Share Limit may be issued in the aggregate pursuant to the exercise of
Incentive Stock Options granted under the Plan; and (iii) the maximum number
of shares of Common Stock subject to Awards granted during a single fiscal
year to a Non-Employee Director (or with respect to each single year in the
event awards are granted for more than one year), taken together with any cash
fees paid to such Non-Employee Director during the fiscal year, shall not
exceed $1,000,000 in total value with respect to each such fiscal year
(calculating the value of any such Awards based on the grant date fair value
of such Awards for financial reporting purposes).

 

(c) _Share Counting_. Other than with respect to Substitute Awards, to the
extent that an Award expires or is canceled, forfeited, terminated, settled
in cash, or otherwise is settled without issuance to the Participant of the
full number of shares of Common Stock to which the Award related, the unissued
shares of Common Stock will again be available for grant under the
Plan. Shares of Common Stock withheld in payment of the Exercise Price, or
taxes relating to an Award, and shares equal to the number of shares
surrendered in payment of any Exercise Price, or taxes relating to an Award,
shall be deemed to constitute shares not issued to the



   1  |

_Note to Draft_ : To be equal to 10% of outstanding Common Stock as of
Closing.  

---|--- 
   2  |

_Note to Draft_ : To be equal to 5% of outstanding Common Stock as of
Closing.

10

    

 Participant and shall be deemed to again be available for Awards under the
Plan; _provided, however_ , that such shares shall not become available for
issuance hereunder if either: (i) the applicable shares are withheld or
surrendered following the termination of the Plan; or (ii) at the time the
applicable shares are withheld or surrendered, it would constitute a material
revision of the Plan subject to stockholder approval under any then-
applicable rules of the national securities exchange on which the Common Stock
is listed.

(d) _Source of Shares_. Shares of Common Stock issued by the Company in
settlement of Awards may be authorized and unissued shares of Common Stock,
shares of Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company, shares of Common
Stock purchased on the open market or by private purchase, or a combination
of the foregoing.

(e) _Substitute Awards_. Awards may, in the sole discretion of the Committee,
be granted under the Plan in assumption of, or in substitution for,
outstanding Awards previously granted by an entity directly or indirectly
acquired by the Company or with which the Company combines ("
_Substitute Awards_ "). Substitute Awards shall not be counted against the
Absolute Share Limit; _provided_ , that Substitute Awards issued in connection
with the assumption of, or in substitution for, outstanding Options intended
to qualify as "incentive stock options" within the meaning of Section 422 of
the Code shall be counted against the aggregate number of shares of Common
Stock available for Awards of Incentive Stock Options under the Plan. Subject
to applicable stock exchange requirements, available shares of Common Stock
under a stockholder-approved plan of an entity directly or indirectly acquired
by the Company or with which the Company combines (as appropriately adjusted
to reflect the acquisition or combination transaction) may be used for Awards
under the Plan and shall not reduce the number of shares of Common Stock
available for issuance under the Plan.

 

6\. Eligibility. Participation in the Plan shall be limited to Eligible
Persons.

 

7\. Options.

 

(a) _General_. Each Option granted under the Plan shall be evidenced by an
Award Agreement, which agreement need not be the same for each Participant.
Each Option so granted shall be subject to the conditions set forth in this
Section 7, and to such other conditions not inconsistent with the Plan as may
be reflected in the applicable Award Agreement. All Options granted under
the Plan shall be Nonqualified Stock Options unless the applicable Award
Agreement expressly states that the Option is intended to be an Incentive
Stock Option. Incentive Stock Options shall be granted only to Eligible
Persons who are employees of a member of the Company Group, and no Incentive
Stock Option shall be granted to any Eligible Person who is ineligible to
receive an Incentive Stock Option under the Code. No Option shall be treated
as an Incentive Stock Option unless the Plan has been approved by the
stockholders of the Company in a manner intended to comply with the
stockholder approval requirements of Section 422(b)(1) of the Code; _provided_
, that any Option intended to be an Incentive Stock Option shall not fail to
be effective solely on account of a failure to obtain such approval, but
rather such Option shall be treated as a Nonqualified Stock Option unless and
until such approval is obtained. In the case of an Incentive Stock Option, the
terms and conditions of such grant shall be subject to, and comply with, such
rules as may be prescribed by Section 422 of the Code. If for any reason an
Option intended to be an Incentive Stock Option (or any portion 

 



11

    

 thereof) shall not qualify as an Incentive Stock Option, then, to the extent
of such nonqualification, such Option or portion thereof shall be regarded as
a Nonqualified Stock Option appropriately granted under the Plan.

(b) _Exercise Price_. Except as otherwise provided by the Committee in the
case of Substitute Awards, the exercise price (" _Exercise Price_ ") per
share of Common Stock for each Option shall not be less than 100% of the Fair
Market Value of such share (determined as of the Date of Grant); _provided,
however_ , that in the case of an Incentive Stock Option granted to an
employee who, at the time of the grant of such Option, owns stock representing
more than 10% of the voting power of all classes of stock of any member of the
Company Group, the Exercise Price per share shall be no less than 110% of the
Fair Market Value per share on the Date of Grant.

(c) _Vesting and Expiration; Termination_.

(i) Options shall vest and become exercisable in such manner and on such date
or dates or upon such event or events as determined by the Committee
including, without limitation, those set forth in Section 5(a) of the Plan;
_provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding any such vesting dates or
events, the Committee may in its sole discretion accelerate the vesting of
any Options at any time and for any reason. Options shall expire upon a date
determined by the Committee, not to exceed ten (10) years from the Date of
Grant (the " _Option Period_ ");  _provided_ , that if the Option Period
(other than in the case of an Incentive Stock Option) would expire at a time
when trading in the shares of Common Stock is prohibited by the Companys
insider trading policy (or Company-imposed "blackout period"), then the
Option Period shall be automatically extended until the thirtieth (30th) day
following the expiration of such prohibition. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
in no event shall the Option Period exceed five (5) years from the Date of
Grant in the case of an Incentive Stock Option granted to a Participant who on
the Date of Grant owns stock representing more than 10% of the voting power of
all classes of stock of any member of the Company Group.

(ii) Unless otherwise provided by the Committee, whether in an Award
Agreement or otherwise, in the event of: (A) a Participants Termination by
the Service Recipient for Cause, all outstanding Options granted to such
Participant shall immediately terminate and expire; (B) a Participants
Termination due to death or Disability, each outstanding unvested Option
granted to such Participant shall immediately terminate and expire, and each
outstanding vested Option shall remain exercisable for one (1) year thereafter
(but in no event beyond the expiration of the Option Period); and (C) a
Participants Termination for any other reason, each outstanding unvested
Option granted to such Participant shall immediately terminate and expire, and
each outstanding vested Option shall remain exercisable for ninety (90) days
thereafter (but in no event beyond the expiration of the Option Period).

(d) _Method of Exercise and Form of Payment_. No shares of Common Stock shall
be issued pursuant to any exercise of an Option until payment in full of the
Exercise Price therefor is received by the Company and the Participant has
paid to the Company an amount equal to any Federal, state, local, and
non-U.S. income, employment, and any other applicable taxes

 



12

    

 required to be withheld. Options which have become exercisable may be
exercised by delivery of written or electronic notice of exercise to the
Company (or telephonic instructions to the extent provided by the Committee)
in accordance with the terms of the Option accompanied by payment of the
Exercise Price. The Exercise Price shall be payable: (i) in cash, check, cash
equivalent, and/or shares of Common Stock valued at the Fair Market Value at
the time the Option is exercised (including, pursuant to procedures approved
by the Committee, by means of attestation of ownership of a sufficient number
of shares of Common Stock in lieu of actual issuance of such shares to
the Company); _provided_ , that such shares of Common Stock are not subject
to any pledge or other security interest and have been held by the Participant
for at least six (6) months (or such other period as established from time to
time by the Committee in order to avoid adverse accounting treatment applying
generally accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ")); or (ii) by such other
method as the Committee may permit in its sole discretion, including,
without limitation (A) in other property having a fair market value on the
date of exercise equal to the Exercise Price; (B) if there is a public market
for the shares of Common Stock at such time, by means of a broker-assisted
"cashless exercise" pursuant to which the Company is delivered (including
telephonically to the extent permitted by the Committee) a copy of irrevocable
instructions to a stockbroker to sell the shares of Common Stock otherwise
issuable upon the exercise of the Option and to deliver promptly to the
Company an amount equal to the Exercise Price; or (C) a "net exercise"
procedure effected by withholding the minimum number of shares of Common Stock
otherwise issuable in respect of an Option that is needed to pay the Exercise
Price. Any fractional shares of Common Stock shall be settled in cash.

(e) _Notification upon Disqualifying Disposition of an Incentive Stock
Option_. Each Participant awarded an Incentive Stock Option under the Plan
shall notify the Company in writing immediately after the date the Participant
makes a disqualifying disposition of any share of Common Stock acquired
pursuant to the exercise of such Incentive Stock Option. A disqualifying
disposition is any disposition (including, without limitation, any sale) of
such share of Common Stock before the later of (i) the date that is two (2)
years after the Date of Grant of the Incentive Stock Option, or (ii) the date
that is one (1) year after the date of exercise of the Incentive Stock Option.
The Company may, if determined by the Committee and in accordance with
procedures established by the Committee, retain possession, as agent for the
applicable Participant, of any share of Common Stock acquired pursuant to the
exercise of an Incentive Stock Option until the end of the period described in
the preceding sentence, subject to complying with any instructions from such
Participant as to the sale of such share of Common Stock.

(f)  _Compliance With Laws, etc_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event
shall a Participant be permitted to exercise an Option in a manner which the
Committee determines would violate the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as it may
be amended from time to time, or any other applicable law or the applicable
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission or the
applicable rules and regulations of any securities exchange or inter-dealer
quotation system on which the securities of the Company are listed or traded.

8\. Stock Appreciation Rights.

 

(a) _General_. Each SAR granted under the Plan shall be evidenced by an Award
Agreement. Each SAR so granted shall be subject to the conditions set forth
in this Section 8, and to such other conditions not inconsistent with the Plan
as may be reflected in the applicable Award Agreement. Any Option granted
under the Plan may include tandem SARs. The Committee also may award SARs to
Eligible Persons independent of any Option.

(b) _Strike Price_. Except as otherwise provided by the Committee in the case
of Substitute Awards, the strike price (" _Strike Price_ ") per share of
Common Stock for each SAR shall not be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value
of such share (determined as of the Date of Grant). Notwithstanding
the foregoing, a SAR granted in tandem with (or in substitution for) an
Option previously granted shall have a Strike Price equal to the Exercise
Price of the corresponding Option.

 

(c) _Vesting and Expiration; Termination_.

 

(i) A SAR granted in connection with an Option shall become exercisable and
shall expire according to the same vesting schedule and expiration provisions
as the corresponding Option. A SAR granted independent of an Option shall vest
and become exercisable in such manner and on such date or dates or upon such
event or events as determined by the Committee including, without limitation,
those set forth in Section 5(a) of the Plan; _provided_ , _however_ , that
notwithstanding any such vesting dates or events, the Committee may, in its
sole discretion, accelerate the vesting of any SAR at any time and for any
reason. SARs shall expire upon a date determined by the Committee, not to
exceed ten (10) years from the Date of Grant (the " _SAR Period_ ");
_provided_ , that if the SAR Period would expire at a time when trading in
the shares of Common Stock is prohibited by the Companys insider trading
policy (or Company-imposed "blackout period"), then the SAR Period shall be
automatically extended until the thirtieth (30th) day following the
expiration of such prohibition.

 

(ii) Unless otherwise provided by the Committee, whether in an Award Agreement
or otherwise, in the event of: (A) a Participants Termination by the Service
Recipient for Cause, all outstanding SARs granted to such Participant shall
immediately terminate and expire; (B) a Participants Termination due to death
or Disability, each outstanding unvested SAR granted to such Participant
shall immediately terminate and expire, and each outstanding vested SAR shall
remain exercisable for one (1) year thereafter (but in no event beyond the
expiration of the SAR Period); and (C) a Participants Termination for any
other reason, each outstanding unvested SAR granted to such Participant shall
immediately terminate and expire, and each outstanding vested SAR shall remain
exercisable for ninety (90) days thereafter (but in no event beyond the
expiration of the SAR Period).

(d) _Method of Exercise_. SARs which have become exercisable may be
exercised by delivery of written or electronic notice of exercise to the
Company in accordance with the terms of the Award, specifying the number of
SARs to be exercised and the date on which such SARs were awarded.

 



14

    

(e) _Payment_. Upon the exercise of a SAR, the Company shall pay to the
Participant an amount equal to the number of shares subject to the SAR that
is being exercised multiplied by the excess of the Fair Market Value of one
(1) share of Common Stock on the exercise date over the Strike Price, less an
amount equal to any Federal, state, local, and non-U.S. income, employment,
and any other applicable taxes required to be withheld. The Company shall pay
such amount in cash, in shares of Common Stock valued at Fair Market Value, or
any combination thereof, as determined by the Committee. Any fractional
shares of Common Stock shall be settled in cash.

9. Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units.

(a) _General_. Each grant of Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units
shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement. Each Restricted Stock and Restricted
Stock Unit so granted shall be subject to the conditions set forth in this
Section 9, and to such other conditions not inconsistent with the Plan as may
be reflected in the applicable Award Agreement.

(b) _Stock Certificates and Book-Entry Notation; Escrow or Similar
Arrangement_. Upon the grant of Restricted Stock, the Committee shall cause a
stock certificate registered in the name of the Participant to be issued or
shall cause share(s) of Common Stock to be registered in the name of the
Participant and held in book-entry form subject to the Companys directions
and, if the Committee determines that the Restricted Stock shall be held by
the Company or in escrow rather than issued to the Participant pending the
release of the applicable restrictions, the Committee may require the
Participant to additionally execute and deliver to the Company (i) an escrow
agreement satisfactory to the Committee, if applicable, and (ii) the
appropriate stock power (endorsed in blank) with respect to the Restricted
Stock covered by such agreement. If a Participant shall fail to execute and
deliver (in a manner permitted under Section 13(a) of the Plan or as otherwise
determined by the Committee) an agreement evidencing an Award of Restricted
Stock and, if applicable, an escrow agreement and blank stock power within
the amount of time specified by the Committee, the Award shall be null and
void. Subject to the restrictions set forth in this Section 9 and the
applicable Award Agreement, a Participant generally shall have the rights and
privileges of a stockholder as to shares of Restricted Stock, including,
without limitation, the right to vote such Restricted Stock. To the extent
shares of Restricted Stock are forfeited, any stock certificates issued to
the Participant evidencing such shares shall be returned to the Company, and
all rights of the Participant to such shares and as a stockholder with respect
thereto shall terminate without further obligation on the part of
the Company. A Participant shall have no rights or privileges as a
stockholder as to Restricted Stock Units.

(c) _Vesting; Termination_. 

(i) Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units shall vest, and any applicable
Restricted Period shall lapse, in such manner and on such date or dates or
upon such event or events as determined by the Committee including, without
limitation, those set forth in Section 5(a) of the Plan; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that notwithstanding any such dates or events, the Committee may,
in its sole discretion, accelerate the vesting of any Restricted Stock or
Restricted Stock Unit or the lapsing of any applicable Restricted Period at
any time and for any reason.

 



15

    

(ii) Unless otherwise provided by the Committee, whether in an
Award Agreement or otherwise, in the event of a Participants Termination for
any reason prior to the time that such Participants Restricted Stock or
Restricted Stock Units, as applicable, have vested, (A) all vesting with
respect to such Participants Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units, as
applicable, shall cease and (B) unvested shares of Restricted Stock and
unvested Restricted Stock Units, as applicable, shall be forfeited to the
Company by the Participant for no consideration as of the date of such
Termination.

(d) _Issuance of Restricted Stock and Settlement of Restricted Stock Units_. 

(i) Upon the expiration of the Restricted Period with respect to any shares of
Restricted Stock, the restrictions set forth in the applicable Award
Agreement shall be of no further force or effect with respect to such shares,
except as set forth in the applicable Award Agreement. If an escrow
arrangement is used, upon such expiration the Company shall issue to
the Participant or the Participants beneficiary, without charge, the stock
certificate (or, if applicable, a notice evidencing a book-entry notation)
evidencing the shares of Restricted Stock which have not then been forfeited
and with respect to which the Restricted Period has expired (rounded down to
the nearest full share).

(ii) Unless otherwise provided by the Committee in an Award Agreement or
otherwise, upon the expiration of the Restricted Period with respect to any
outstanding Restricted Stock Units, the Company shall issue to the Participant
or the Participants beneficiary, without charge, one (1) share of Common
Stock (or other securities or other property, as applicable) for each such
outstanding Restricted Stock Unit; _provided, however_ , that the Committee
may, in its sole discretion, elect to (A) pay cash or part cash and part
shares of Common Stock in lieu of issuing only shares of Common Stock in
respect of such Restricted Stock Units or (B) defer the issuance of shares of
Common Stock (or cash or part cash and part shares of Common Stock, as the
case may be) beyond the expiration of the Restricted Period if such extension
would not cause adverse tax consequences under Section 409A of the Code. If a
cash payment is made in lieu of issuing shares of Common Stock in respect of
such Restricted Stock Units, the amount of such payment shall be equal to the
Fair Market Value per share of the Common Stock as of the date on which the
Restricted Period lapsed with respect to such Restricted Stock Units.

 

(e) _Legends on Restricted Stock_. Each certificate, if any, or book entry
representing Restricted Stock awarded under the Plan, if any, shall bear a
legend or book-entry notation substantially in the form of the following, in
addition to any other information the Company deems appropriate, until the
lapse of all restrictions with respect to such shares of Common Stock:

 

TRANSFER OF THIS CERTIFICATE AND THE SHARES REPRESENTED HEREBY IS RESTRICTED
PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF THE VIVINT SMART HOME, INC. [2019] OMNIBUS INCENTIVE
PLAN AND A RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD AGREEMENT BETWEEN VIVINT SMART HOME, INC.
AND THE PARTICIPANT. A COPY OF SUCH PLAN AND AWARD AGREEMENT IS ON FILE AT THE
PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICES OF VIVINT SMART HOME, INC.

 



16

    

10\. Other Equity-Based Awards and Other Cash-Based Awards. The Committee may
grant Other Equity-Based Awards and Other Cash-Based Awards under the Plan to
Eligible Persons, alone or in tandem with other Awards, in such amounts and
dependent on such conditions as the Committee shall from time to time in its
sole discretion determine including, without limitation, those set forth in
Section 5(a) of the Plan. Each Other Equity-Based Award granted under the Plan
shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement and each Other Cash-Based Award
granted under the Plan shall be evidenced in such form as the Committee may
determine from time to time. Each Other Equity-Based Award or Other Cash-Based
Award, as applicable, so granted shall be subject to such conditions not
inconsistent with the Plan as may be reflected in the applicable Award
Agreement or other form evidencing such Award, including, without limitation,
those set forth in Section 13(c) of the Plan.

 

11\. Changes in Capital Structure and Similar Events. Notwithstanding any
other provision in this Plan to the contrary, the following provisions shall
apply to all Awards granted hereunder (other than Other Cash-Based Awards):

(a) _General_. In the event of (i) any dividend (other than regular cash
dividends) or other distribution (whether in the form of cash, shares of
Common Stock, other securities, or other property), recapitalization, stock
split, reverse stock split, reorganization, merger, consolidation, split-up,
split-off, spin-off, combination, repurchase, or exchange of shares of Common
Stock or other securities of the Company, issuance of warrants or other
rights to acquire shares of Common Stock or other securities of the Company,
or other similar corporate transaction or event that affects the shares of
Common Stock (including a Change in Control), or (ii) unusual or nonrecurring
events affecting the Company, including changes in applicable rules, rulings,
regulations, or other requirements, that the Committee determines, in its sole
discretion, could result in substantial dilution or enlargement of the rights
intended to be granted to, or available for, Participants (any event in (i) or
(ii), an " _Adjustment Event_ "), the Committee shall, in respect of any such
Adjustment Event, make such proportionate substitution or adjustment, if any,
as it deems equitable, to any or all of: (A) the Absolute Share Limit, or any
other limit applicable under the Plan with respect to the number of Awards
which may be granted hereunder; (B) the number of shares of Common Stock or
other securities of the Company (or number and kind of other securities or
other property) which may be issued in respect of Awards or with respect to
which Awards may be granted under the Plan or any Sub-Plan; and (C) the terms
of any outstanding Award, including, without limitation, (I) the number of
shares of Common Stock or other securities of the Company (or number and kind
of other securities or other property) subject to outstanding Awards or to
which outstanding Awards relate; (II) the Exercise Price or Strike Price with
respect to any Award; or (III) any applicable performance measures; _provided_
, that in the case of any "equity restructuring" (within the meaning of the
Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic
718 (or any successor pronouncement thereto)), the Committee shall make an
equitable or proportionate adjustment to outstanding Awards to reflect such
equity restructuring. Any adjustment under this Section 11 shall be conclusive
and binding for all purposes.

 



17

    

(b) _Adjustment Events_. Without limiting the foregoing, except as may
otherwise be provided in an Award Agreement, in connection with any
Adjustment Event, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, provide for any
one or more of the following:

 

(i) substitution or assumption of Awards (or awards of an acquiring company),
acceleration of the exercisability of, lapse of restrictions on, or
termination of Awards, or a period of time (which shall not be required to be
more than ten (10) days) for Participants to exercise outstanding Awards prior
to the occurrence of such event (and any such Award not so exercised shall
terminate upon the occurrence of such event); and

(ii) subject to any limitations or reductions as may be necessary to comply
with Section 409A of the Code, cancellation of any one or more outstanding
Awards and payment to the holders of such Awards that are vested as of such
cancellation (including, without limitation, any Awards that would vest as a
result of the occurrence of such event but for such cancellation or for which
vesting is accelerated by the Committee in connection with such event) the
value of such Awards, if any, as determined by the Committee (which value, if
applicable, may be based upon the price per share of Common Stock received or
to be received by other stockholders of the Company in such event), including,
without limitation, in the case of an outstanding Option or SAR, a cash
payment in an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the Fair Market Value
(as of a date specified by the Committee) of the shares of Common Stock
subject to such Option or SAR over the aggregate Exercise Price or Strike
Price of such Option or SAR (it being understood that, in such event, any
Option or SAR having a per share Exercise Price or Strike Price equal to, or
in excess of, the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock subject thereto
may be canceled and terminated without any payment or
consideration therefor), or, in the case of Restricted Stock, Restricted
Stock Units, or Other Equity-Based Awards that are not vested as of such
cancellation, a cash payment or equity subject to deferred vesting
and delivery consistent with the vesting restrictions applicable to such
Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units, or Other Equity-Based Awards prior
to cancellation, or the underlying shares in respect thereof.

 

Payments to holders pursuant to clause (ii) above shall be made in cash or, in
the sole discretion of the Committee, in the form of such other consideration
necessary for a Participant to receive property, cash, or securities (or
combination thereof) as such Participant would have been entitled to receive
upon the occurrence of the transaction if the Participant had been,
immediately prior to such transaction, the holder of the number of shares of
Common Stock covered by the Award at such time (less any applicable Exercise
Price or Strike Price).

 

(c) _Other Requirements_. Prior to any payment or adjustment contemplated
under this Section 11, the Committee may require a Participant to (i)
represent and warrant as to the unencumbered title to the Participants
Awards; (ii) bear such Participants pro rata share of any post-closing
indemnity obligations, and be subject to the same post-closing purchase price
adjustments, escrow terms, offset rights, holdback terms, and similar
conditions as the other holders of Common Stock, subject to any limitations or
reductions as may be necessary to comply with Section 409A of the Code;
and (iii) deliver customary transfer documentation as reasonably determined
by the Committee.

 



18

    

(d) _Fractional Shares_. Any adjustment provided under this Section 11
may provide for the elimination of any fractional share that might otherwise
become subject to an Award.

(e) _Binding Effect_. Any adjustment, substitution, determination of value or
other action taken by the Committee under this Section 11 shall be conclusive
and binding for all purposes.

 

12\. Amendments and Termination.

 

(a) _Amendment and Termination of the Plan_. The Board may amend, alter,
suspend, discontinue, or terminate the Plan or any portion thereof at any
time; _provided_ , that no such amendment, alteration, suspension,
discontinuance, or termination shall be made without stockholder approval if:
(i) such approval is necessary to comply with any regulatory
requirement applicable to the Plan (including, without limitation, as
necessary to comply with any rules or regulations of any securities exchange
or inter-dealer quotation system on which the securities of the Company may be
listed or quoted) or for changes in GAAP to new accounting standards; (ii) it
would materially increase the number of securities which may be issued under
the Plan (except for increases pursuant to Section 5 or 11 of the Plan), or
(iii) it would materially modify the requirements for participation in the
Plan; _provided, further_ , that any such amendment, alteration, suspension,
discontinuance, or termination that would materially and adversely affect the
rights of any Participant or any holder or beneficiary of any Award
theretofore granted shall not to that extent be effective without the consent
of the affected Participant, holder, or beneficiary. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no amendment shall be made to the last proviso of Section 12(b) of
the Plan without stockholder approval.

(b) _Amendment of Award Agreements_. The Committee may, to the
extent consistent with the terms of the Plan and any applicable Award
Agreement, waive any conditions or rights under, amend any terms of, or alter,
suspend, discontinue, cancel, or terminate, any Award theretofore granted or
the associated Award Agreement, prospectively or retroactively (including
after a Participants Termination); _provided_ , that, other than pursuant to
Section 11, any such waiver, amendment, alteration, suspension,
discontinuance, cancellation, or termination that would materially and
adversely affect the rights of any Participant with respect to any Award
theretofore granted shall not to that extent be effective without the consent
of the affected Participant; _provided, further_ , that without stockholder
approval, except as otherwise permitted under Section 11 of the Plan, (i) no
amendment or modification may reduce the Exercise Price of any Option or the
Strike Price of any SAR; (ii) the Committee may not cancel any outstanding
Option or SAR and replace it with a new Option or SAR (with a lower Exercise
Price or Strike Price, as the case may be) or other Award or cash payment that
is greater than the intrinsic value (if any) of the cancelled Option or
SAR; and (iii) the Committee may not take any other action which is
considered a "repricing" for purposes of the stockholder approval rules of any
securities exchange or inter-dealer quotation system on which the securities
of the Company are listed or quoted.

 



19

    

13\. General.

 

(a) _Award Agreements_. Each Award (other than an Other Cash-Based Award)
under the Plan shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement, which shall be
delivered to the Participant to whom such Award was granted and shall specify
the terms and conditions of the Award and any rules applicable thereto,
including, without limitation, the effect on such Award of the death,
Disability, or Termination of a Participant, or of such other events as may
be determined by the Committee. For purposes of the Plan, an Award Agreement
may be in any such form (written or electronic) as determined by the Committee
(including, without limitation, a Board or Committee resolution, an
employment agreement, a notice, a certificate, or a letter) evidencing the
Award. The Committee need not require an Award Agreement to be signed by the
Participant or a duly authorized representative of the Company.

(b) _Nontransferability_.

 

(i) Each Award shall be exercisable only by such Participant to whom such
Award was granted during the Participants lifetime, or, if permissible under
applicable law, by the Participants legal guardian or representative. No
Award may be assigned, alienated, pledged, attached, sold, or otherwise
transferred or encumbered by a Participant (unless such transfer is
specifically required pursuant to a domestic relations order or by applicable
law) other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution and any
such purported assignment, alienation, pledge, attachment, sale, transfer,
or encumbrance shall be void and unenforceable against any member of the
Company Group; _provided_ , that the designation of a beneficiary shall not
constitute an assignment, alienation, pledge, attachment, sale, transfer, or
encumbrance.

 

(ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may, in its sole discretion,
permit Awards (other than Incentive Stock Options) to be transferred by a
Participant, without consideration, subject to such rules as the Committee may
adopt consistent with any applicable Award Agreement to preserve the purposes
of the Plan, to: (A) any Person who is a "family member" of the Participant,
as such term is used in the instructions to Form S-8 under the Securities Act
or any successor form of registration statement promulgated by the Securities
and Exchange Commission (collectively, the " _Immediate Family Members_ ");
(B) a trust solely for the benefit of the Participant and the Participants
Immediate Family Members; (C) a partnership or limited liability company
whose only partners or stockholders are the Participant and the Participants
Immediate Family Members; or (D) a beneficiary to whom donations are eligible
to be treated as "charitable contributions" for federal income tax
purposes (each transferee described in clauses (A), (B), (C), and (D) above
is hereinafter referred to as a " _Permitted Transferee_ "); _provided_ , that
the Participant gives the Committee advance written notice describing
the terms and conditions of the proposed transfer and the Committee notifies
the Participant in writing that such a transfer would comply with the
requirements of the Plan.

 

(iii) The terms of any Award transferred in accordance with clause (ii) above
shall apply to the Permitted Transferee and any reference in the Plan or in
any applicable Award Agreement to a Participant shall be deemed to refer to
the Permitted Transferee, except that: (A) Permitted Transferees shall not be
entitled to transfer any Award, other than by will or the laws of descent and
distribution; (B) Permitted Transferees shall not be entitled to exercise any
transferred Option unless there shall be in effect a registration statement on
an appropriate form covering the shares of Common Stock to be acquired

 



20

    

 pursuant to the exercise of such Option if the Committee determines,
consistent with any applicable Award Agreement, that such a registration
statement is necessary or appropriate; (C) neither the Committee nor the
Company shall be required to provide any notice to a Permitted Transferee,
whether or not such notice is or would otherwise have been required to be
given to the Participant under the Plan or otherwise; and (D) the
consequences of a Participants Termination under the terms of the Plan and
the applicable Award Agreement shall continue to be applied with respect to
the Participant, including, without limitation, that an Option shall
be exercisable by the Permitted Transferee only to the extent, and for the
periods, specified in the Plan and the applicable Award Agreement.

 

(c) _Dividends and Dividend Equivalents_.

 

(i) The Committee may, in its sole discretion, provide a Participant as part
of an Award with dividends, dividend equivalents, or similar payments in
respect of Awards, payable in cash, shares of Common Stock, other securities,
other Awards or other property (in each case, without interest), on a current
or deferred basis, on such terms and conditions as may be determined by the
Committee in its sole discretion, including, without limitation, payment
directly to the Participant, withholding of such amounts by the Company
subject to vesting of the Award or reinvestment in additional shares of Common
Stock, Restricted Stock or other Awards.

(ii) Without limiting the foregoing, unless otherwise provided in the Award
Agreement, any dividend otherwise payable in respect of any share of
Restricted Stock that remains subject to vesting conditions at the time of
payment of such dividend shall be retained by the Company, remain subject to
the same vesting conditions as the share of Restricted Stock to which the
dividend relates and shall be delivered (without interest) to the Participant
within fifteen (15) days following the date on which such restrictions on such
Restricted Stock lapse (and the right to any such accumulated dividends shall
be forfeited upon the forfeiture of the Restricted Stock to which such
dividends relate).

 

(iii) To the extent provided in an Award Agreement, the holder of outstanding
Restricted Stock Units shall be entitled to be credited with dividend
equivalent payments (upon the payment by the Company of dividends on shares of
Common Stock) either in cash or, in the sole discretion of the Committee, in
shares of Common Stock having a Fair Market Value equal to the amount of such
dividends (and interest may, in the sole discretion of the Committee, be
credited on the amount of cash dividend equivalents at a rate and subject to
such terms as determined by the Committee), which accumulated dividend
equivalents (and interest thereon, if applicable) shall be payable at the
same time as the underlying Restricted Stock Units are settled following the
date on which the Restricted Period lapses with respect to such Restricted
Stock Units, and if such Restricted Stock Units are forfeited, the
Participant shall have no right to such dividend equivalent payments (or
interest thereon, if applicable).

 



21

    

(d) _Tax Withholding_.

 

(i) A Participant shall be required to pay to the Company or one or more of
its Subsidiaries, as applicable, an amount in cash (by check or wire
transfer) equal to the aggregate amount of any income, employment, and/or
other applicable taxes that are statutorily required to be withheld in respect
of an Award. Alternatively, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries may
elect, in its sole discretion, to satisfy this requirement by withholding
such amount from any cash compensation or other cash amounts owing to a
Participant.

 

(ii) Without limiting the foregoing, the Committee may (but is not obligated
to), in its sole discretion, permit or require a Participant to satisfy all
or any portion of the minimum income, employment, and/or other applicable
taxes that are statutorily required to be withheld with respect to an Award
by: (A) the delivery of shares of Common Stock (which are not subject to any
pledge or other security interest) that have been both held by the Participant
and vested for at least six (6) months (or such other period as established
from time to time by the Committee in order to avoid adverse
accounting treatment under applicable accounting standards) having an
aggregate Fair Market Value equal to such minimum statutorily required
withholding liability (or portion thereof); or (B) having the Company withhold
from the shares of Common Stock otherwise issuable or deliverable to, or that
would otherwise be retained by, the Participant upon the grant, exercise,
vesting, or settlement of the Award, as applicable, a number of shares of
Common Stock with an aggregate Fair Market Value equal to an amount, subject
to clause (iii) below, not in excess of such minimum statutorily required
withholding liability (or portion thereof).

 

(iii) The Committee, subject to its having considered the applicable
accounting impact of any such determination, has full discretion to allow
Participants to satisfy, in whole or in part, any additional income,
employment, and/or other applicable taxes payable by them with respect to an
Award by electing to have the Company withhold from the shares of Common
Stock otherwise issuable or deliverable to, or that would otherwise be
retained by, a Participant upon the grant, exercise, vesting, or settlement of
the Award, as applicable, shares of Common Stock having an aggregate Fair
Market Value that is greater than the applicable minimum required statutory
withholding liability (but such withholding may in no event be in excess of
the maximum statutory withholding amount(s) in a Participants relevant tax
jurisdictions).

 

(e) _Data Protection_. By participating in the Plan or accepting any rights
granted under it, each Participant consents to the collection and processing
of personal data relating to the Participant so that the Company and its
Affiliates can fulfill their obligations and exercise their rights under the
Plan and generally administer and manage the Plan. This data will include, but
may not be limited to, data about participation in the Plan and shares
offered or received, purchased, or sold under the Plan from time to time and
other appropriate financial and other data (such as the date on which the
Awards were granted) about the Participant and the Participants
participation in the Plan.

(f) _No Claim to Awards; No Rights to Continued Employment; Waiver_. No
employee of any member of the Company Group, or other Person, shall have any
claim or right to be granted an Award under the Plan or, having been selected
for the grant of an Award, to be 

 



22

    

 selected for a grant of any other Award. There is no obligation for
uniformity of treatment of Participants or holders or beneficiaries of Awards.
The terms and conditions of Awards and the Committees determinations and
interpretations with respect thereto need not be the same with respect to each
Participant and may be made selectively among Participants, whether or not
such Participants are similarly situated. Neither the Plan nor any action
taken hereunder shall be construed as giving any Participant any right to be
retained in the employ or service of the Service Recipient or any other member
of the Company Group, nor shall it be construed as giving any Participant
any rights to continued service on the Board. The Service Recipient or any
other member of the Company Group may at any time dismiss a Participant from
employment or discontinue any consulting relationship, free from any liability
or any claim under the Plan, unless otherwise expressly provided in the Plan
or any Award Agreement. By accepting an Award under the Plan, a Participant
shall thereby be deemed to have waived any claim to continued exercise or
vesting of an Award or to damages or severance entitlement related to non-
continuation of the Award beyond the period provided under the Plan or any
Award Agreement, except to the extent of any provision to the contrary in any
written employment contract or other agreement between the Service Recipient
and/or any member of the Company Group and the Participant, whether any such
agreement is executed before, on, or after the Date of Grant.

 

(g) _International Participants_. With respect to Participants who reside or
work outside of the United States of America, the Committee may, in its sole
discretion, amend the terms of the Plan and create or amend Sub-Plans or amend
outstanding Awards with respect to such Participants in order to conform such
terms with the requirements of local law or to obtain more favorable tax or
other treatment for a Participant or any member of the Company Group.

(h) _Designation and Change of Beneficiary_. Each Participant may file with
the Committee a written designation of one or more Persons as the beneficiary
or beneficiaries, as applicable, who shall be entitled to receive the amounts
payable with respect to an Award, if any, due under the Plan upon the
Participants death. A Participant may, from time to time, revoke or change
the Participants beneficiary designation without the consent of any prior
beneficiary by filing a new designation with the Committee. The last such
designation received by the Committee shall be controlling; _provided,
however_ , that no designation, or change or revocation thereof, shall be
effective unless received by the Committee prior to the Participants death,
and in no event shall it be effective as of a date prior to such receipt. If
no beneficiary designation is filed by a Participant, the beneficiary shall be
deemed to be the Participants spouse or, if the Participant is unmarried at
the time of death, the Participants estate.

(i) _Termination_. Except as otherwise provided in an Award Agreement,
unless determined otherwise by the Committee at any point following such
event: (i) neither a temporary absence from employment or service due to
illness, vacation, or leave of absence (including, without limitation, a call
to active duty for military service through a Reserve or National Guard unit)
nor a transfer from employment or service with one Service Recipient to
employment or service with another Service Recipient (or vice-versa) shall be
considered a Termination; and (ii) if a Participant undergoes a Termination,
but such Participant continues to provide services to the Company Group in a
non-employee capacity, such change in status shall not be considered a
Termination for purposes of the Plan. Further, unless otherwise determined by
the Committee, in the event that any Service Recipient ceases to be a member
of the

 



23

    

 Company Group (by reason of sale, divestiture, spin-off, or other similar
transaction), unless a Participants employment or service is transferred
to another entity that would constitute a Service Recipient immediately
following such transaction, such Participant shall be deemed to have suffered
a Termination hereunder as of the date of the consummation of such
transaction.

 

(j) _No Rights as a Stockholder_. Except as otherwise specifically provided in
the Plan or any Award Agreement, no Person shall be entitled to the
privileges of ownership in respect of shares of Common Stock which are subject
to Awards hereunder until such shares have been issued or delivered to such
Person.

 

(k) _Government and Other Regulations_.

 

(i) The obligation of the Company to settle Awards in shares of Common Stock
or other consideration shall be subject to all applicable laws, rules, and
regulations, and to such approvals by governmental agencies as may be
required. Notwithstanding any terms or conditions of any Award to the
contrary, the Company shall be under no obligation to offer to sell or to
sell, and shall be prohibited from offering to sell or selling, any shares of
Common Stock pursuant to an Award unless such shares have been properly
registered for sale pursuant to the Securities Act with the Securities and
Exchange Commission or unless the Company has received an opinion of counsel
(if the Company has requested such an opinion), satisfactory to the Company,
that such shares may be offered or sold without such registration pursuant to
an available exemption therefrom and the terms and conditions of such
exemption have been fully complied with. The Company shall be under no
obligation to register for sale under the Securities Act any of the shares of
Common Stock to be offered or sold under the Plan. The Committee shall
have the authority to provide that all shares of Common Stock or other
securities of any member of the Company Group issued under the Plan shall be
subject to such stop-transfer orders and other restrictions as the Committee
may deem advisable under the Plan, the applicable Award Agreement, the Federal
securities laws, or the rules, regulations, and other requirements of the
Securities and Exchange Commission and any securities exchange or inter-
dealer quotation system on which the securities of the Company are listed or
quoted, and any other applicable Federal, state, local, or non-U.S. laws,
rules, regulations, and other requirements, and, without limiting the
generality of Section 9 of the Plan, the Committee may cause a legend or
legends to be put on certificates representing shares of Common Stock or other
securities of any member of the Company Group issued under the Plan to make
appropriate reference to such restrictions or may cause such Common Stock or
other securities of any member of the Company Group issued under the Plan in
book-entry form to be held subject to the Companys instructions or subject to
appropriate stop-transfer orders. Notwithstanding any provision in the Plan
to the contrary, the Committee reserves the right to add, at any time, any
additional terms or provisions to any Award granted under the Plan that the
Committee, in its sole discretion, deems necessary or advisable in order that
such Award complies with the legal requirements of any governmental entity to
whose jurisdiction the Award is subject.

 



24

    

(ii) The Committee may cancel an Award or any portion thereof if
it determines, in its sole discretion, that legal or contractual restrictions
and/or blockage and/or other market considerations would make the Companys
acquisition of shares of Common Stock from the public markets, the Companys
issuance of Common Stock to the Participant, the Participants acquisition of
Common Stock from the Company, and/or the Participants sale of Common Stock
to the public markets, illegal, impracticable, or inadvisable. If the
Committee determines to cancel all or any portion of an Award in accordance
with the foregoing, the Company shall, subject to any limitations or
reductions as may be necessary to comply with Section 409A of the Code: (A)
pay to the Participant an amount equal to the excess of (I) the aggregate
Fair Market Value of the shares of Common Stock subject to such Award or
portion thereof canceled (determined as of the applicable exercise date, or
the date that the shares would have been vested or issued, as applicable),
over (II) the aggregate Exercise Price or Strike Price (in the case of an
Option or SAR, respectively) or any amount payable as a condition of issuance
of shares of Common Stock (in the case of any other Award), with such
amount being delivered to the Participant as soon as practicable following
the cancellation of such Award (or portion thereof) or (B) in the case of
Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units, or Other Equity-Based Awards,
provide the Participant with a cash payment or equity subject to deferred
vesting and delivery consistent with the vesting restrictions applicable to
such Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units, or Other Equity-Based Awards,
or the underlying shares in respect thereof.

 

(l) _No Section_ __ _ 83(b) Elections Without Consent of Company_. No
election under Section 83(b) of the Code or under a similar provision of law
may be made unless expressly permitted by the terms of the applicable Award
Agreement or by action of the Committee (or its designee in accordance with
Section 4(c) of the Plan) in writing prior to the making of such election. If
a Participant, in connection with the acquisition of shares of Common Stock
under the Plan or otherwise, is expressly permitted to make such election and
the Participant makes the election, the Participant shall notify the Company
of such election within ten (10) days of filing notice of the election with
the Internal Revenue Service or other governmental authority, in addition to
any filing and notification required pursuant to Section 83(b) of the Code or
other applicable provision.

(m) _Payments to Persons Other Than Participants_. If the Committee shall find
that any Person to whom any amount is payable under the Plan is unable to
care for the Participants affairs because of illness or accident, or is a
minor, or has died, then any payment due to such Person or the Participants
estate (unless a prior claim therefor has been made by a duly appointed legal
representative) may, if the Committee so directs the Company, be paid to the
Participants spouse, child, relative, an institution maintaining or having
custody of such Person, or any other Person deemed by the Committee to be a
proper recipient on behalf of such Person otherwise entitled to payment. Any
such payment shall be a complete discharge of the liability of the Committee
and the Company therefor.

 

(n) _Nonexclusivity of the Plan_. Neither the adoption of the Plan by the
Board nor the submission of the Plan to the stockholders of the Company for
approval shall be construed as creating any limitations on the power of the
Board to adopt such other incentive arrangements as it may deem desirable,
including, without limitation, the granting of equity-based awards otherwise
than under the Plan, and such arrangements may be either applicable generally
or only in specific cases.

 



25

    

(o) _No Trust or Fund Created_. Neither the Plan nor any Award shall create or
be construed to create a trust or separate fund of any kind or a fiduciary
relationship between any member of the Company Group, on the one hand, and a
Participant or other Person, on the other hand. No provision of the Plan or
any Award shall require the Company, for the purpose of satisfying any
obligations under the Plan, to purchase assets or place any assets in a trust
or other entity to which contributions are made or otherwise to segregate any
assets, nor shall the Company be obligated to maintain separate bank
accounts, books, records, or other evidence of the existence of a segregated
or separately maintained or administered fund for such purposes. Participants
shall have no rights under the Plan other than as unsecured general creditors
of the Company, except that insofar as they may have become entitled to
payment of additional compensation by performance of services, they shall have
the same rights as other service providers under general law.

 

(p) _Reliance on Reports_. Each member of the Committee and each member of the
Board shall be fully justified in acting or failing to act, as the case may
be, and shall not be liable for having so acted or failed to act in good
faith, in reliance upon any report made by the independent public accountant
of any member of the Company Group and/or any other information furnished
in connection with the Plan by any agent of the Company or the Committee or
the Board, other than himself or herself.

(q) _Relationship to Other Benefits_. No payment under the Plan shall be
taken into account in determining any benefits under any pension, retirement,
profit sharing, group insurance, or other benefit plan of the Company except
as otherwise specifically provided in such other plan or as required by
applicable law.

(r) _Governing Law_. The Plan shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the internal laws of the State of Delaware applicable to
contracts made and performed wholly within the State of Delaware, without
giving effect to the conflict of laws provisions thereof. EACH PARTICIPANT
WHO ACCEPTS AN AWARD IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
SUIT, ACTION, OR OTHER PROCEEDING INSTITUTED BY OR AGAINST SUCH PARTICIPANT IN
RESPECT OF THE PARTICIPANTS RIGHTS OR OBLIGATIONS HEREUNDER.

 

(s) _Severability_. If any provision of the Plan or any Award or Award
Agreement is or becomes or is deemed to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable
in any jurisdiction or as to any Person or Award, or would disqualify the Plan
or any Award under any law deemed applicable by the Committee, such provision
shall be construed or deemed amended to conform to the applicable laws, or
if it cannot be construed or deemed amended without, in the determination of
the Committee, materially altering the intent of the Plan or the Award, such
provision shall be construed or deemed stricken as to such jurisdiction,
Person, or Award and the remainder of the Plan and any such Award shall
remain in full force and effect.

(t) _Obligations Binding on Successors_. The obligations of the Company under
the Plan shall be binding upon any successor corporation or organization
resulting from the merger, consolidation, or other reorganization of the
Company, or upon any successor corporation or organization succeeding to
substantially all of the assets and business of the Company.

 



26

    

(u) _Section_ __ _ 409A of the Code_.

 

(i) Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, it is intended
that the provisions of the Plan comply with Section 409A of the Code, and all
provisions of the Plan shall be construed and interpreted in a manner
consistent with the requirements for avoiding taxes or penalties under Section
409A of the Code. Each Participant is solely responsible and liable for the
satisfaction of all taxes and penalties that may be imposed on or in respect
of such Participant in connection with the Plan (including any taxes and
penalties under Section 409A of the Code), and neither the Service Recipient
nor any other member of the Company Group shall have any obligation to
indemnify or otherwise hold such Participant (or any beneficiary) harmless
from any or all of such taxes or penalties. With respect to any Award that is
considered "deferred compensation" subject to Section 409A of the Code,
references in the Plan to "termination of employment" (and substantially
similar phrases) shall mean "separation from service" within the meaning
of Section 409A of the Code. For purposes of Section 409A of the Code, each
of the payments that may be made in respect of any Award granted under the
Plan is designated as a separate payment.

 

(ii) Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, if a Participant is
a "specified employee" within the meaning of Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the
Code, no payments in respect of any Awards that are "deferred compensation"
subject to Section 409A of the Code and which would otherwise be payable upon
the Participants "separation from service" (as defined in Section 409A of
the Code) shall be made to such Participant prior to the date that is six (6)
months after the date of such Participants "separation from service" or,
if earlier, the date of the Participants death. Following any applicable six
(6)-month delay, all such delayed payments will be paid in a single lump sum
on the earliest date permitted under Section 409A of the Code that is also a
business day.

(iii) Unless otherwise provided by the Committee in an Award Agreement or
otherwise, in the event that the timing of payments in respect of any Award
(that would otherwise be considered "deferred compensation" subject to Section
409A of the Code) are accelerated upon the occurrence of (A) a Change in
Control, no such acceleration shall be permitted unless the event giving rise
to the Change in Control satisfies the definition of a change in the ownership
or effective control of a corporation, or a change in the ownership of a
substantial portion of the assets of a corporation pursuant to Section 409A
of the Code or (B) a Disability, no such acceleration shall be permitted
unless the Disability also satisfies the definition of "Disability" pursuant
to Section 409A of the Code.

 

(v) _Clawback/Repayment_. All Awards shall be subject to reduction,
cancellation, forfeiture or recoupment to the extent necessary to comply with
(i) any clawback, forfeiture or other similar policy adopted by the Board or
the Committee and as in effect from time to time; and (ii) applicable law.
Further, unless otherwise determined by the Committee, to the extent that the
Participant receives any amount in excess of the amount that the Participant
should otherwise have received under the terms of the Award for any reason
(including, without limitation, by reason of a financial restatement, mistake
in calculations or other administrative error), the Participant shall be
required to repay any such excess amount to the Company.

 



27

    

(w) _Detrimental Activity_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, if a Participant has engaged in any Detrimental Activity, as
determined by the Committee, the Committee may, in its sole discretion,
provide for one or more of the following:

 

(i) cancellation of any or all of such Participants outstanding Awards; or

 

(ii) forfeiture by the Participant of any gain realized on the vesting or
exercise of Awards, and repayment of any such gain promptly to the Company.

(x) _Right of Offset_. The Company will have the right to offset against its
obligation to deliver shares of Common Stock (or other property or cash)
under the Plan or any Award Agreement any outstanding amounts (including,
without limitation, travel and entertainment or advance account balances,
loans, repayment obligations under any Awards, or amounts repayable to the
Company pursuant to tax equalization, housing, automobile, or other employee
programs) that the Participant then owes to any member of the Company Group
and any amounts the Committee otherwise deems appropriate pursuant to any
tax equalization policy or agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an
Award is "deferred compensation" subject to Section 409A of the Code, the
Committee will have no right to offset against its obligation to deliver
shares of Common Stock (or other property or cash) under the Plan or any
Award Agreement if such offset could subject the Participant to the additional
tax imposed under Section 409A of the Code in respect of an outstanding Award.

 

(y) _Expenses; Titles and Headings_. The expenses of administering the Plan
shall be borne by the Company Group. The titles and headings of the sections
in the Plan are for convenience of reference only, and in the event of any
conflict, the text of the Plan, rather than such titles or headings, shall
control.

SIXTH. Unless and except to the extent that the bylaws of the Corporation
shall so require, election of directors of the Corporation need not be by
written ballot.

SEVENTH. To the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL as it now exists or
may hereafter be amended, a director of the Corporation shall not be
personally liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages
for breach of fiduciary duty owed to the Corporation or its stockholders.
Neither the amendment nor repeal of this Article SEVENTH, nor the adoption of
any provision of this Certificate of Incorporation, nor, to the fullest extent
permitted by the DGCL, any modification of law shall eliminate, reduce or
otherwise adversely affect any right or protection of a current or former
director of the Corporation existing at the time of such amendment, repeal,
adoption or modification.

 

EIGHTH. Except as otherwise agreed in writing between such director and the
Corporation, or as provided below, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
except as may be otherwise agreed in writing between such director and the
Corporation, (a) no director of the Corporation (other than any director who
is an executive officer of the Corporation) shall have any duty (fiduciary or
otherwise) or obligation, if any, to refrain from (i) engaging in the same or
similar activities or lines of business as the Corporation or any of its
subsidiaries or (ii) doing business with any client, customer or vendor of
the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries, including, in the cases of clauses
(i) or (ii), any such matters as may be Corporate Opportunities (as defined
below); and (b) no director shall be deemed to have breached any
duty (fiduciary or otherwise), if any, to the Corporation or any of its
subsidiaries or stockholders solely by reason of any director of the
Corporation (other than any director who is an executive officer of the
Corporation) engaging in any such activity or entering into such
transactions, including any

   

 Corporate Opportunities. "Corporate Opportunity" means any potential
transaction, investment or business opportunity or prospective economic or
competitive advantage in which the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries
could have any expectancy or interest.

Without limiting the foregoing, the Corporation and its subsidiaries shall
have no interest or expectation in, nor right to be informed of, any Corporate
Opportunity, and in the event that any director of the Corporation (other than
any director who is an executive officer of the Corporation)
acquires knowledge of a potential transaction or matter which may be a
Corporate Opportunity, such director shall, to the fullest extent permitted by
law, have no duty (fiduciary or otherwise) or obligation to communicate or
offer such Corporate Opportunity to the Corporation or any of its
subsidiaries or to any other director of the Corporation and shall not, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, be liable to the Corporation or any of its
subsidiaries or stockholders for breach of any fiduciary duty as a director
of the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries solely by reason of the fact
that any director of the Corporation (other than any director who is an
executive officer of the Corporation) acquires or seeks such Corporate
Opportunity for itself, directs such Corporate Opportunity to another
individual, partnership, joint venture, corporation, association, joint stock
company, limited liability company, trust, unincorporated organization or
government or a department or agency or political subdivision thereof, or
otherwise does not communicate information regarding such Corporate
Opportunity to the Corporation or its subsidiaries, and the Corporation and
its subsidiaries, to the fullest extent permitted by law, waive and renounce
any claim that such business opportunity constituted a Corporate Opportunity
that should have been presented to the Corporation or its subsidiaries;
provided that if an opportunity is expressly communicated to a director of the
Corporation in his or her capacity as a director as an opportunity intended
exclusively for the Corporation or its subsidiaries (hereinafter called an "
_Identified Corporate Opportunity_ "), such Identified Corporate Opportunity
shall belong to the Corporation and its subsidiaries and, unless and until
the Corporation notifies the stockholders that neither the Corporation nor any
of its subsidiaries intend to pursue such Identified Corporate Opportunity, no
director of the Corporation may pursue such Identified Corporate Opportunity.
In addition to and notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Article
EIGHTH, a corporate opportunity shall not be deemed to be a potential
corporate opportunity for the Corporation if it is a business opportunity
that (i) the Corporation is neither financially or legally able, nor
contractually permitted to undertake, (ii) from its nature, is not in the line
of the Corporations business or is of no practical advantage to the
Corporation or (iii) is one in which the Corporation has no interest or
reasonable expectancy. To the fullest extent permitted by law, any person or
entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of capital
stock of the Corporation shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to
the provisions of this Article EIGHTH.

NINTH. The Corporation hereby expressly elects not to be governed by
Section 203 of the DGCL, and the restrictions contained in Section 203 of the
DCGL shall not apply to the Corporation.

 

TENTH. Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an
alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall, to
the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for (i)
any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Corporation, (ii)
any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by, or other
wrongdoing by, any director, officer, employee or agent of the

   

 Corporation to the Corporation or the Corporations stockholders, (iii) any
action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or the
Corporations Certificate of Incorporation or bylaws (as either may be
amended and/or restated from time to time), (iv) any action to interpret,
apply, enforce or determine the validity of the Corporations Certificate of
Incorporation or bylaws (as either may be amended and/or restated from time
to time), or (v) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs
doctrine, in each case subject to said court having personal jurisdiction over
the indispensable parties named as defendants therein; provided, that, if and
only if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware dismisses any such
action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, such action may be brought in
another state court sitting in the State of Delaware. To the fullest
extent permitted by law, any person or entity purchasing or otherwise
acquiring any interest in shares of capital stock of the Corporation shall be
deemed to have notice of and consented to the provisions of this Article
EIGHTH.

ELEVENTH. If any provision or provisions of this Certificate of Incorporation
shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable as applied to any
circumstance for any reason whatsoever: (i) the validity, legality and
enforceability of such provisions in any other circumstance and of the
remaining provisions of this Certificate of Incorporation (including, without
limitation, each portion of any paragraph of this Certificate of Incorporation
containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable
that is not itself held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall not in
any way be affected or impaired thereby and (ii) to the fullest extent
possible, the provisions of this Certificate of Incorporation (including,
without limitation, each such portion of any paragraph of this Certificate of
Incorporation containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable) shall be construed so as to permit the Corporation to protect
its directors, officers, employees and agents from personal liability in
respect of their good faith service or for the benefit of the Corporation to
the fullest extent permitted by law.

_Exhibit E_

 

 _Treatment of 313 Acquisition LLC Equity_

 

Prior to the Effective Time, 313 Acquisition LLC (" _Parent_ ") and the
Company shall take, or cause to take, all necessary actions to effectuate the
following:



     | 1. |

Each Class A Unitholder, other than the Holdback Executives and the Sponsor
Unitholders, shall have the Class A Units held by each redeemed by Parent
immediately prior to the Effective Time for shares of common stock of Vivint
Solar Inc. (" _VSLR Common Stock_ ") and Company Common Stock, as described
below, with an equivalent value as the Class A Units so redeemed, assuming
the liquidation of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time and that,
for purposes of such assumed liquidation, all Company Group Class B Units are
vested (such assumed liquidation, the " _Hypothetical Liquidation_ "), in a
manner determined by the board of managers of Parent (the " _Parent Board_ "),
pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Parent Amended and Restated
Limited Liability Company Agreement, dated as of November 16, 2012 (as it may
be amended and/or restated from time to time, the " _Parent LLCA_ "). The
number of shares of VSLR Common Stock and Company Common Stock issued with
respect to each Class A Unit in such redemptions shall be determined on a
pro-rata basis using the relative value of the shares of VSLR Common Stock and
Company Common Stock held by Parent as of the Effective Time. The relative
value of Parents holdings shall be calculated using (i) with respect to
shares of VSLR Common Stock, the VWAP of VSLR Common Stock for the twenty (20)
trading days prior to the date that is three Business Days prior to the
Closing Date and (ii) with respect to shares of Company Common Stock, the
product of the Exchange Ratio multiplied by the VWAP of Acquiror Common Stock
for the twenty (20) trading days prior to the date that is three Business Days
prior to the Closing Date (the valuation principles set forth in this
sentence, the " _Valuation Principles_ "). 

---|---|--- 



     | a. |

The Company Common Stock issued in such redemption (and any Acquiror Common
Stock into which such Company Common Stock is converted into in accordance
with _Section_ __ _ 3.01(b)_) shall be subject to restrictions on Transfer
until the first anniversary of the Closing Date.1  

---|---|--- 



     | b. |

Holders of the Company Common Stock issued in such redemption (as subsequently
converted into Acquiror Common Stock in accordance with _Section_ __ _
3.01(b)_) shall be eligible to be issued shares of Acquiror Common Stock
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.06(a)_ and _Section_ __ _ 3.06(b)_, if
applicable.  

---|---|--- 



     | 2. |

Holders of vested Company Group Class B Units as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time, other than the Holdback Executives, shall have each such
Company Group Class B Unit redeemed by Parent immediately prior to the
Effective Time for shares of VSLR Common Stock and Company Common Stock as
described below, with an equivalent value as the Company Group Class B Unit
so redeemed, in a manner determined by the Parent 

---|---|--- 



   1  |

For the avoidance of doubt, any shares of VSLR Common Stock issued to a holder
in such redemption shall not be subject to any restrictions on Transfer
following the Effective Time (except for any Vivint Solar trading policy to
the extent applicable to such holder). 

---|--- 
        |  Board, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Company
Group Stock Plans and the Parent LLCA (assuming the Hypothetical Liquidation).
The number of shares of VSLR Common Stock and Company Common Stock issued
with respect to each vested Company Group Class B Unit, in such redemptions
shall be determined on a pro-rata basis using the relative value of the shares
of VSLR Common Stock and Company Common Stock held by Parent as of the
Effective Time. The relative value of Parents holdings shall be calculated
using the Valuation Principles. 
---|--- 



     | a. |

The Company Common Stock issued in such redemption (and any Acquiror Common
Stock into which such Company Common Stock is converted into in accordance
with _Section_ __ _ 3.01(b)_) shall be subject to restrictions on Transfer
until the first anniversary of the Closing Date. 2 

---|---|--- 



     | b. |

The holders of the Company Common Stock issued in such redemption (as
subsequently converted into Acquiror Common Stock in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 3.01(b)_) shall be eligible to be issued shares of Acquiror
Common Stock pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.06(a)_ and _Section_ __ _
3.06(b)_, if applicable. 

---|---|--- 



     | 3. |

Holders of unvested Company Group Class B Units as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time, other than the Holdback Executives, shall have each such
unvested Company Group Class B Unit redeemed by Parent immediately prior to
the Effective Time for a number of shares of Company Restricted Stock, with an
equivalent value as the Company Group Class B Units so redeemed, in a manner
determined by the Parent Board in accordance with the terms of the Company
Group Stock Plans and the Parent LLCA (assuming the Hypothetical Liquidation
and that, after taking into account their respective deemed unit values, an
unvested Company Group Class B Unit has a value equal to a vested Company
Group Class B Unit with the same deemed unit value). Such shares of Company
Restricted Stock shall be subject to the same vesting terms and conditions as
the corresponding Company Group Class B Units (as modified by Section 6(a) of
this _Exhibit E_ ).3 

---|---|--- 
 



     | a. |

The holders of the Company Restricted Stock issued in such redemption (as
subsequently converted into Rollover Restricted Stock in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 3.05(d)(ii)_) shall be eligible to be issued shares of
Acquiror Common Stock pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.06(a)_ and _Section_ __ _
3.06(b)_, if applicable. 

---|---|--- 



   2  |

For the avoidance of doubt, any shares of VSLR Common Stock issued to a holder
in such redemption shall not be subject to any restrictions on Transfer
following the Effective Time (except for VSLR trading policy to the extent
applicable to such holder). 

---|--- 
   3  |

For example: 

---|--- 
     |  |  |

An individual has 10,000 unvested Company Group Class B Units, of which 6,000
vest based on continued service with the Company over a three year period
(e.g., 2,000 Company Group Class B Units vest on each of the next three
anniversaries of the grant date) and 4,000 vest based on continued service
with the Company over a four year period from the Closing (e.g., 1,000
Company Group Class B Units vest on each of the first four anniversaries of
the Closing Date). 

---|---|---|--- 
     |  |  |

If as a result of the redemption into Company Restricted Stock and conversion
into Rollover Restricted Stock, the individual receives 1,000 shares of
Rollover Restricted Stock: 

---|---|---|--- 
     |  |  |

600 of those shares will vest based on continued service with the Company over
a three year period (e.g., 200 shares of Rollover Restricted Stock would vest
on each of the next three anniversaries of the grant date); and 

---|---|---|--- 
     |  |  |

400 of those shares will vest based on continued service with the Company over
a four year period (e.g., 100 shares of Rollover Restricted Stock would vest
on each of the first four anniversaries of the Closing Date).

As of immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Company Group Class B Units
(both vested and unvested) held by the Holdback Executives shall be converted
into a number of Class A Units (the " _Converted Class_ __ _ A Units_"), in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the Company Group Stock Plans and
the Parent LLCA, with an equivalent value (assuming the Hypothetical
Liquidation and taking into account the deemed unit value) and subject to the
same vesting terms and conditions as the corresponding Company Group Class B
Units (as modified by Section 6(a) of this _Exhibit E_ ).

As of immediately following the Effective Time, the Class A Units (including,

the case of unvested Converted Class A Units, unvested Tracking Units4,
subject to the same vesting terms and conditions as the corresponding
Converted Class A Units (as modified by Section 6(a) of this _Exhibit E_ ), as
applicable. As of immediately following the Effective Time the ratio of
vested Tracking Units to unvested Tracking Units held by each Holdback
Executive shall be the same for each type of Tracking Unit held by such
Holdback Executive. The number of VSLR Tracking Units, VSH Tracking Units, VW
Tracking Units and Other Property Tracking Units, respectively, to be issued
to the Holdback Executives shall be determined on a pro-rata basis using the
relative value of the shares of VSLR Common Stock, Company Common Stock and
common stock of Vivint Wireless, Inc. (" _VW Common Stock_ ") and Other
Property held by Parent as of immediately following the Effective Time. The
relative value of Parents holdings of shares of VSLR Common Stock, Company
Common Stock and VW Common Stock and Other Property shall be (i) calculated
using the Valuation Principles and (ii) with respect to shares of VW Common
Stock and Other Property, as determined by the Parent Board in good faith.

Tracking Units, VSLR Tracking Units and VW Tracking Units previously sold by,
or distributed to, such Holdback Executive in accordance with Section 7,
shall be redeemed by Parent for a number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock,
VSLR Common Stock and VW Common Stock equal to, with respect to each class of
Tracking Unit, the proportion of the number of Tracking Units of a class
being so redeemed compared to the aggregate number of Tracking Units of such
class then outstanding multiplied by the total number of shares of common
stock (or any other security or property into which such shares are
converted) tracked by such Tracking Unit that are then owned by Parent, in a
manner determined by the Parent Board, pursuant to the terms and conditions of
the Parent LLCA.

Any unvested Tracking Units that are forfeited shall be forfeited back to
Parent.

         | d. |

On, or following, the 24-month anniversary of the Effective Time,
upon written request to Parent by a Holdback Executive, Parent shall promptly
redeem all (or any portion) of the then-vested VSH Tracking Units, VSLR
Tracking Units and VW Tracking Units held by the Holdback Executives for a
number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock, VSLR Common Stock and VW Common
Stock equal to, with respect to each class of Tracking Unit, the proportion of
the number of Tracking Units of a class being so redeemed compared to the
aggregate number of Tracking Units of such class then outstanding multiplied
by the total number of shares of common stock (or any other security or
property into which such shares are converted) tracked by such Tracking Unit
that are then owned by Parent, in a manner determined by the Parent Board,
pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Parent LLCA. For the avoidance of
doubt, Parent shall have no obligation to redeem any Other Property Tracking
Units at any time and may redeem such Other Property Tracking Units, in its
sole discretion, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Parent
LLCA.

Common Stock and VW Common Stock to the Holdback Executives in respect of the
applicable Tracking Units at any time, pursuant to the terms and conditions of
the Parent LLCA. 

---|---|--- 
 



     | f. |

For the avoidance of doubt any shares of VSLR Common Stock, Acquiror Common
Stock, and/or VW Common Stock issued to the Holdback Executive in such
redemptions or distributions shall not be subject to any restrictions on
Transfer unless otherwise required under the terms of the applicable
stockholders agreement or agreed to by Parent (or the Acquiror) and the
applicable Holdback Executive. 

---|---|--- 



     | 5. |

in such sale divided by (ii) the aggregate number of vested VSH Tracking
Units, VSLR Tracking Units or VW Tracking Units, as applicable for which the
Holdback Executives and the Sponsor Unitholders have elected to participate in
such sale (such quotient described in this clause (b), the " _Participation
