NOT WITH A VIEW TO, OR IN CONNECTION WITH, THE SALE OR DISTRIBUTION THEREOF.
NO TRANSFER MAY BE EFFECTED WITHOUT AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT
RELATED THERETO OR AN OPINION OF COUNSEL IN A FORM SATISFACTORY TO THE
COMPANY THAT SUCH REGISTRATION IS NOT REQUIRED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF
1933, AS AMENDED."

In the event that any shares of Purchaser Common Stock issuable hereunder
shall cease to be Restricted Shares, the Purchaser shall, upon the written
request of the Stockholder, issue to such holder a new certificate
representing such shares of Purchaser Common Stock without the
legend required by this _Section_ __ _ 2.1(c)_.

(d) _Withholding_. The Purchaser (or any of its agents or Affiliates, as the
case may be) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any payment
pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted or
withheld under the Code or any other applicable Tax Law. To the extent amounts
are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of whom the
withholding was made.

 

(e) _Purchase Stock Consideration_. In no event shall the aggregate number of
shares of Purchaser Common Stock issued hereunder (the "Issued Shares")
exceed a number of shares equal to 19.9% of the number of shares of Purchaser
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Closing (the "19.9%
Threshold"). In the event that the number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock
otherwise comprising the Issued Shares would exceed the 19.9% Threshold, the
number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock issued as part of the Purchase
Price will be cut back to the 19.9% Threshold and the cash paid as part of
the Purchase Price will be increased by an amount equal to the Purchaser
Common Stock Price with respect to each cut back share of Purchaser Common
Stock.

 

(f) _Anniversary Transaction Bonus; Earnout Amount_. Following the Closing,
the Purchaser (or an Affiliate thereof) shall pay any Anniversary Transaction
Bonus and the Earnout Amount, as applicable, to the applicable Persons as
provided for in _Schedule 2.1(f)_. Unless otherwise required by

 



14

    

 applicable Law or the Code, for applicable income Tax purposes, no party
hereto shall take any Tax filing position inconsistent with the
characterization that the Earnout Amount paid to the Stockholder (if any) as
provided for in _Schedule 2.1(f)_ is intended to be treated as deferred
contingent purchase price eligible for installment sale treatment under
Section 453 of the Code and any corresponding provision of non-U.S., state or
local law, as appropriate.

2.2 _Closing_. Unless this Agreement is earlier terminated in accordance with
_Section 10.1_ , the closing of the Share Purchase (the "Closing") shall take
place (a) on a Business Day as promptly as practicable (and in any event
within three (3) Business Days) after the satisfaction or, if permissible by
the express terms of this Agreement, waiver of each of the conditions set
forth in _Article VII_ (other than those conditions that by their nature are
to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of
those conditions) or (b) at such other time and date as the parties hereto may
agree in writing; _provided_ , _however_ , that unless otherwise agreed to in
writing by the Purchaser and the Stockholder, if the Marketing Period has not
ended at the time of the satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions set
forth in _Article VII_ (other than those conditions that by their nature are
to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of
those conditions), then the Closing Date shall mean the earlier of (i) a date
during the Marketing Period specified by the Purchaser on no fewer than three
(3) Business Days prior notice to the Stockholder and (ii) three (3)
Business Days after the final day of the Marketing Period (subject in each
case to the satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions set forth in
_Article VII_ (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those
conditions)). The Closing shall take place remotely via the exchange of
documents and signature pages or at such location as the parties hereto agree.
The date on which the Closing occurs is herein referred to as the "Closing
Date".

2.3 _Post-Closing Adjustments_.

 

(a) _Preparation of Estimated Working Capital Statement_.

 

(i) The Company shall prepare in good faith and, at least three (3) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date, deliver to the Purchaser (A) an estimated
balance sheet of the Company, which shall be in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to the Purchaser, as of 11:59 p.m. on the Closing Date (the
"WC Effective Time") without giving effect to the Transactions, reflecting
thereon the Companys best estimate of all balance sheet items of the Company
(the "Estimated Closing Balance Sheet", and together with the estimated
calculations referenced below, the "Estimated Working Capital Statement"), (B)
the Net Working Capital of the Company, based on the Estimated Closing Balance
Sheet ("Estimated Net Working Capital"), (C) the unpaid Transaction Expenses
as of immediately prior to the Closing ("Estimated Transaction Expenses"), (D)
the unpaid Indebtedness of the Company as of immediately prior to the Closing
("Estimated Indebtedness") and (E) Cash ("Estimated Cash"). The Estimated
Closing Balance Sheet, the Estimated Net Working Capital, the Estimated
Transaction Expenses, the Estimated Indebtedness and the Estimated Cash shall
be prepared in accordance with GAAP and the definitions of such terms. The
Company shall also provide reasonable detail supporting each such calculation.

 

(ii) Following receipt of the Estimated Working Capital Statement, the Company
shall permit the Purchaser and its representatives at all reasonable times
and upon reasonable notice to review the Companys working papers relating to
the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet (including the Estimated Net Working
Capital, the Estimated Transaction Expenses, the Estimated Indebtedness and
the Estimated Cash) as well as all of the Companys accounting books and
records relating to the determination of the Estimated Working Capital
Statement, and the Company shall make reasonably available
its representatives responsible for the preparation of the Estimated Working
Capital Statement in order to respond to the reasonable inquiries of the
Purchaser. Prior to Closing, the parties shall discuss in good faith the
computation of any of the items on the Estimated Working Capital Statement
(including the Estimated Net Working Capital, the Estimated Transaction
Expenses, the Estimated Indebtedness and the Estimated Cash).

 



15

    

(b) _Preparation of Final Working Capital Statement_.

 

(i) As promptly as practicable, but no later than ninety (90) days after the
Closing Date, the Purchaser shall prepare and deliver to the Stockholder (A)
a balance sheet of the Company as of the WC Effective Time, reflecting thereon
the Purchasers determination of the balance sheet of the Company as of the WC
Effective Time without giving effect to the Transactions, (B) the Net Working
Capital of the Company, (C) the unpaid Transaction Expenses as of immediately
prior to the Closing, (D) the unpaid Indebtedness of the Company as of
immediately prior to the Closing and (E) Cash (the "Initial Working Capital
Statement").

(ii) Unless the Stockholder delivers the Dispute Notice within forty-five
(45) days after receipt of the Initial Working Capital Statement, such Initial
Working Capital Statement shall be deemed the "Final Working Capital
Statement", shall be binding upon the Stockholder and the Purchaser and shall
not be subject to dispute or review. If the Stockholder disagrees with the
Initial Working Capital Statement, the Stockholder may, within forty-five (45)
days after receipt thereof, notify the Purchaser in writing (the "Dispute
Notice"), which Dispute Notice shall provide reasonable detail of the nature
of each disputed item on the Initial Working Capital Statement, including all
supporting documentation thereto, and the Stockholder shall be deemed to have
agreed with all other items and amounts contained in the Initial Working
Capital Statement delivered pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.3(b)(ii)_. If
the Stockholder timely delivers a Dispute Notice to the Purchaser, the
Purchaser and the Stockholder shall first use commercially reasonable efforts
to resolve such dispute between themselves and, if the Purchaser and the
Stockholder are able to resolve such dispute, the Initial Working Capital
Statement shall be revised to the extent necessary to reflect such
resolution, shall be deemed the "Final Working Capital Statement" and shall be
conclusive and binding upon the Stockholder and the Purchaser and shall not be
subject to dispute or review. If the Purchaser and the Stockholder are unable
to resolve the dispute within fifteen (15) days after receipt by the Purchaser
of the Dispute Notice, the Purchaser and the Stockholder shall submit the
dispute to a nationally recognized independent accounting firm selected by
the Purchaser and the Stockholder which shall not have been engaged for any
material matter, directly or indirectly, by any party hereto within the
preceding two years (the "Accountant"). The Accountant shall be directed to
act as an expert and not an arbiter and shall be directed to determine only
those items that remain in dispute on the Initial Working Capital Statement.
Each of the Purchaser and the Stockholder shall furnish to the Accountant
such workpapers and other documents and information relating to such
objections as the Accountant may reasonably request and are available to that
party or its Affiliates (or its independent public accountants) and will be
afforded the opportunity to present to the Accountant any material relating
to the determination of the matters in dispute and to discuss such
determination with the Accountant. Each of the Purchaser and the Stockholder
shall assign a value to each disputed item and the Accountant shall determine
each disputed item separately (based on the determination that most closely
complies with the terms of this Agreement), but shall not assign a value to
any disputed item that is greater than the greatest value for such disputed
item assigned to it by either party or less than the smallest value for such
disputed item assigned to it by either party. Promptly, but no later than
thirty (30) days after engagement, the Accountant shall deliver a
written report to the Purchaser and the Stockholder as to the resolution of
the disputed items and the resulting calculation of Net Working Capital,
Transaction Expenses, Indebtedness and Cash. The calculations of Net Working
Capital, Transaction Expenses, Indebtedness and Cash, to the extent disputed,
as determined by the Accountant shall be deemed the final calculations
thereof, and the Final Working Capital Statement (including such updated
calculations) shall be conclusive and binding upon the Stockholder and the
Purchaser and shall not be subject to dispute or review. The fees and expenses
of the Accountant in connection with

 



16

    

 the resolution of disputes pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.3(b)(ii)_
shall be paid (A) by the Stockholder, if the Purchasers calculation of the
portion of the Initial Working Capital Statement in dispute is closer to the
Accountants determination than the Companys calculation thereof in the
aggregate, (B) by the Purchaser, if the reverse is true or (C) except as
provided in clauses (A) or (B) above, equally by the Stockholder and the
Purchaser. The Purchaser and the Stockholder agree that they will, and agree
to cause their respective representatives and independent accountants to,
cooperate and assist in the preparation of the Final Working Capital
Statement and in the conduct of the reviews referred to in this _Section_ __ _
2.3(b)(ii)_, including the making promptly available to the extent necessary
of books, records, work papers and personnel. 

(iii) The Closing Cash Consideration shall be adjusted, dollar for dollar,
downwards to the extent that the Adjustment Amount (as defined below) is
negative and upwards to the extent the Adjustment Amount is positive. The
"Adjustment Amount" means an amount equal to the sum of (A) the Net Working
Capital set forth on the Final Working Capital Statement (the "Closing Net
Working Capital") _minus_ the Estimated Net Working Capital, (B) the Estimated
Transaction Expenses _minus_ the Transaction Expenses set forth on the Final
Working Capital Statement (the "Closing Transaction Expenses"), (C) the
Estimated Indebtedness _minus_ the amount the Indebtedness set forth on the
Final Working Capital Statement (the "Closing Indebtedness") and (D) the Cash
set forth on the Final Working Capital Statement (the "Closing Cash") minus
the Estimated Cash. Within three (3) Business Days following the determination
of the Closing Net Working Capital, the Closing Transaction Expenses,
the Closing Indebtedness and the Closing Cash in accordance with _Section_ __
_ 2.3(b)(iii)_, (A) if the Adjustment Amount is negative, the Purchaser shall
be entitled to first recover from the WC Escrow Fund and then, to the
extent necessary, from the Indemnification Escrow Fund an amount equal to the
absolute value of the Adjustment Amount (which amount shall be payable by the
Escrow Agent to the Purchaser within three (3) Business Days of such
determination), or to the extent of any shortfall, from the Stockholder
directly, and (B) if the absolute value of the Adjustment Amount is less than
the amount in the WC Escrow Fund or the Adjustment Amount is positive, the
Stockholder shall be promptly paid in cash an amount equal to the Adjustment
Amount by the Purchaser by wire transfer of immediately available funds to a
bank account designated in writing by the Stockholder. For any release from
the WC Escrow Fund and/or the Indemnification Escrow Fund pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 2.3(b)(iii)_, the Purchaser and the Stockholder shall deliver
to the Escrow Agent a joint written instruction as promptly as possible
following such determination to make the payments in accordance with this
_Section_ __ _ 2.3(b)(iii)_.

2.4 _Closing Deliveries_.

 

(a) _Closing Deliveries of the Purchaser_. In addition to the payments
provided for in _Section_ __ _ 2.1(b)_, at the Closing, the Purchaser shall
have delivered or caused to be delivered to the Stockholder (collectively, the
"Purchaser Closing Deliveries"):

 

(i) executed counterparts of each Ancillary Agreement to which the Purchaser
is a party;

to which the Purchaser is a party.

(iii) a certificate or certificates representing the Company Stock
accompanied by a duly executed share transfer deed for the transfer to the

destroyed, the Seller Parties shall deliver in lieu thereof an affidavit of
loss with respect to such certificate(s), together with a customary
indemnification in form reasonably satisfactory to the Purchaser;

(iv) an executed Director and Officer Resignation and Release Letter in
substantially the form attached hereto as _Exhibit B_ , effective as of the
Closing, for each officer and director of the Company (unless otherwise

which shall have been obtained, not repudiated, in full force and effect and

United States federal and applicable state, local and foreign income tax
purposes; and

 

(xiii) invention assignment agreements in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Purchaser (each, a "Confirmatory Assignment Agreement")
for any Person listed on _Section_ __ _ 2.4(b)(xiii)_ of the Disclosure
Schedule.

 

2.5 _Section 338 Elections; Tax Treatment_.

 

(a) The Stockholder shall join with the Purchaser in making an election under
Code Section 338(h)(10) (and any corresponding election under state, local,
and foreign Tax Law) with respect to the Share Purchase (collectively, the
"Section 338(h)(10) Election"). The Stockholder shall include any income,
gain, loss, deduction, or other tax item resulting from the Section
338(h)(10) Election on his Tax Returns to the extent required by applicable
Law and, for the avoidance of doubt, any incremental Taxes imposed on the
Company (other than as a result of Code Section 1374 or any corresponding
provision of state or local law) arising as a result of the Section 338(h)(10)
Election, shall not be Pre-Closing Taxes and shall be paid by the Company, at
the direction of Purchaser, after the Closing Date.

(b) The Stockholder and the Purchaser shall cooperate fully with each other in
the making of the Section 338(h)(10) Election. The Stockholder shall deliver
to the Purchaser an executed IRS Form 8023 (Elections Under Section 338 for
Corporations Making Qualified Stock Purchases) and any corresponding forms
identified by the Purchaser under applicable state or local Law with respect
to such election, in each case duly executed by the Stockholder, and at any
later time reasonably requested by the Purchaser, any other documents and
forms identified by the Purchaser under applicable Law with respect to such
election. Purchaser shall properly and timely file the IRS Form 8023 (and any
other form and document referred to in this _Section_ __ _ 2.5(b)_ permitted
under applicable Law to be filed solely by Purchaser) and provide fully
executed copies of such IRS Form 8023 (and such other forms and documents) to
the Stockholder within ten (10) days after filing.

 

(c) The parties hereto agree that the Share Purchase will be treated for U.S.
federal and applicable state and local income tax purposes as a purchase of
the assets, and assumption of certain liabilities, of the Company and shall
take no position inconsistent therewith on a Tax Return, in any proceeding
before any Tax authority or otherwise with respect to Taxes. Prior to
ninety (90) days after the final determination of the Final Working Capital
Statement, the Purchaser shall deliver to the Stockholder a schedule
allocating the Purchase Price (including any liabilities of the Company
treated as consideration for the assets of the Company for U.S. federal
income Tax purposes) (the "Allocation Schedule"). The Allocation Schedule
shall be prepared in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code. Purchaser shall
consider any comments the Stockholder may have to the Allocation Schedule in
good faith. Any adjustments to the Purchase Price shall be allocated in a
manner consistent with the Allocation Schedule. The Stockholder and the
Purchaser agree to file their respective Internal Revenue Service Forms 8883
(Asset Allocation Statement Under Section 338) and all federal, state and
local Tax Returns in accordance with the Allocation Schedule.

 



19

    

(d) Notwithstanding anything in the Agreement to the contrary, as additional
consideration for the Stockholders agreement to join in the Section
338(h)(10) Election, Purchaser will pay to Stockholder, in cash, the excess
(if any) of (i) the actual amount of additional consideration necessary to
cause Stockholders after-Tax net proceeds from the sale of the Company Stock
with a Section 338(h)(10) Election to be equal to the after-Tax net proceeds
that Stockholder would have received had the Section 338(h)(10) Election not
been made, taking into account all appropriate state, federal and local income
Tax implications (such clause (i), the "Actual Tax Adjustment Amount") over
(ii) the Estimated Tax Adjustment Amount (any such excess of the Actual Tax
Adjustment Amount over the Estimated Tax Adjustment Amount, the "Tax
Adjustment Payment"). The Actual Tax Adjustment Amount shall be computed (A)
without regard to (i) any Tax imposed by Section 1374 of the Code, (ii) any
tax imposed under Treasury Regulations Section 1.338(h)(10)-1(d)(2), (B) in a
manner limited to income Taxes and based on actual income Tax rates, (C)
without regard to any timing difference resulting from reporting any gain from
the sale transaction pursuant to this Agreement under the installment method
under Section 453 of the Code and (D) assuming that all payments under this
_Section 2.5(d)_ constitute additional purchase price for all relevant Tax
purposes. For the avoidance of doubt, if any payment of the Earnout Amount is
paid to the Stockholder, such amount shall be included in the calculation of
the Actual Tax Adjustment Amount. Upon the later of (i) sixty (60) days after
the due date (with customary extension not in excess of six months) of the
Stockholders income tax returns for the taxable year which includes the
Closing Date or (ii) sixty (60) days after the final determination and payment
of the Earnout Amount, the Stockholder shall determine whether any Tax
Adjustment Payment is owing and, if so, shall deliver its calculation of such
Tax Adjustment Payment to the Purchaser for its review and approval. If the
Stockholder does not so deliver its calculation of the Tax Adjustment Payment
by such due date, the Purchaser shall have no obligation to pay the Tax
Adjustment Payment pursuant to this _Section 2.5(d)_. The Stockholders
calculation of any Tax Adjustment Payment shall be deemed final unless the
Purchaser notifies the Stockholder in writing that the Purchaser objects
within twenty (20) Business Days after the Stockholders delivery of a
written statement setting forth the Tax Adjustment Payment to the Purchaser.
The Stockholders written statement setting forth the Tax Adjustment Payment
shall include reasonable supporting documentation and calculations (including
excel spreadsheets) and following such delivery any other information
reasonably requested by the Purchaser to review and calculate the Tax
Adjustment Payment (which may include pro forma income tax returns of the
Stockholder). In the event of any such objection by the Purchaser, the
Stockholder and the Purchaser shall negotiate in good faith to resolve such
dispute; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Stockholder and the Purchaser
are unable to resolve any dispute with respect to the Tax Adjustment Payment
within thirty (30) days after the delivery of the Purchasers dispute notice,
any such items that remain in dispute shall be resolved by the Accountant. The
Purchaser and the Stockholder shall instruct the Accountant to resolve any
such remaining items in dispute in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement and the Accountant shall be bound to make its determination in
accordance with the requirements of this _Section 2.5(d)_ and the final
Allocation Schedule. The fees and expenses of the Accountant for resolution of
a dispute with respect to the Tax Adjustment Payment pursuant to this _Section
2.5(d)_ shall be borne equally by the Stockholder and the Purchaser. Except
as set forth in _Section 2.5(e)_, the Tax Adjustment Payment shall be a one-
time determination and payment (if any) and the Purchaser shall have
no obligations pursuant to this Section 2.5(d) or otherwise after the payment
(if any) of the Tax Adjustment Payment.

(e) If a Governmental Entity initiates a Tax Contest within the three (3)
year period following the due date (with customary extension not in excess of
six months) of the Stockholders income tax returns for the taxable year which
includes the Closing Date, and such Tax Contest results in a final adjustment
to any income Tax Return of the Stockholder which increases the amount of the
Actual Tax Adjustment Amount beyond the amount of the sum of the Estimated Tax
Adjustment Amount and the Tax Adjustment Payment (each as finally
determined), Purchaser shall pay to the Stockholder such increased Actual Tax
Adjustment Amount (to the extent in excess of the sum of the Estimated Tax
Adjustment Amount and the Tax Adjustment Payment) as set forth by the
Stockholder in a written notice to the Purchaser, which such amount,
calculation, documentation and Purchaser approval thereof shall be subject to
the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 2.5(d)_. The parties agree any such audit
or examination relating to the Code Section 338(h)(10) Election shall be
subject to the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 8.2(c)._

ARTICLE III

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE SELLER PARTIES

 

Each Seller Party hereby jointly and severally represents and warrants to the
Purchaser as of the date hereof and as of the Closing, subject to such
exceptions as are specifically disclosed in the disclosure schedule
(referencing the appropriate section and subsection numbers or disclosed in
any other section or subsection of the disclosure schedule, subject to 
_Section_ __ _ 11.13_) supplied by the Seller Parties to the Purchaser (the
"Disclosure Schedule") concurrently with the execution of this Agreement:

 

3.1 _Organization; Authority and Enforceability_.

 

(a) The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of New Jersey and has the requisite
corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its assets and
properties and to carry on its business as currently conducted. The Company is
duly qualified or licensed as a foreign corporation to do business, and is in
good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character or location of its
assets or properties (whether owned, leased or licensed) or the nature of its
activities make such qualification or licensing necessary to the business of
the Company as currently conducted except where the failure to be so
qualified or licensed, individually or in the aggregate, both (i) has not had
and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect and
(ii) has not had and would not be reasonably expected to have a material
adverse effect on the ability of the Company to perform its obligations under
this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement to which it is a party or to
consummate the Transactions and would not materially impede or delay or be
reasonably expected to materially impede or delay the consummation of the
Transactions. The Company has made available to the Purchaser a true and
correct copy of its certificate of incorporation, as amended to date, and
bylaws, as amended to date, each of which is in full force and effect on the
date hereof (collectively, the "Charter Documents"). The Board of Directors
has not approved or proposed any other amendments to the Charter Documents. 
_Section_ __ _ 3.1(a)(i)_ of the Disclosure Schedule lists the respective
directors, managers, partners and officers of the Company. _Section_ __ _
3.1(a)(ii)_ of the Disclosure Schedule lists, by legal entity, every state or
foreign jurisdiction in which the Company has employees or facilities or
otherwise is required to register to conduct business since January 1, 2015,
whichever is later. _Section_ __ _ 3.1(a)(iii)_ of the Disclosure Schedule
lists each predecessor entity of the Company and any other name under which
the Company has previously operated.

(b) The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter into
this Agreement and any Ancillary Agreement to which it is a party and to
consummate the Transactions. The execution, delivery and performance by the
Company of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which it is a
party, and the consummation of the Transactions, have been duly and validly
authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company. This
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which the Company is a party have
been duly and validly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and
the obligations of the Company hereunder and thereunder are or will be, upon
such execution and delivery (and assuming due authorization, execution and
delivery by the other parties hereto and thereto), valid, legally binding and
enforceable against the Company in accordance with their respective terms.

 

3.2 _Company Capital Structure_.

 

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 1,000 shares of
Company Stock. (i) 400 shares of Company Stock are issued and outstanding,
and (ii) there is no other issued and outstanding capital stock or other
securities of the Company and no commitments or agreements to issue any
Company Stock or other securities of the Company. There are no shares held
in 

 



21

    

 the treasury of the Company. All of the issued and outstanding shares of
Company Stock are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-
assessable and are free and clear of any Liens, preemptive rights, rights of
first refusal or "put" or "call" rights created by statute, the Charter
Documents, or any agreement to which the Company is a party or by which it is
bound. The Stockholder is the sole legal and beneficial owner of, and has
good and marketable title, free and clear of all Liens, to, all of the
outstanding Company Stock and such interest constitutes the entire interest of
the Stockholder in the issued and outstanding share capital or voting
securities of the Company and no other Person has any right, title or interest
in or to the Company Stock. There are no warrants, calls, rights, convertible
securities, commitments or agreements of any character, written or oral, to
which the Company is a party or by which the Company is bound obligating the
Company to reduce its capital or issue, deliver, sell, repurchase, cancel or
redeem, or cause to be issued, delivered, sold, repurchased or redeemed, any
shares of Company Stock or obligating the Company to grant or otherwise amend
or enter into any such warrant, call, right, commitment or agreement. The
Company has no outstanding options, restricted stock units, restricted shares,
stock appreciation right, profit participation, "phantom equity" or any other
type of equity instrument or any plan or similar arrangement pursuant to which
it has reserved Company Stock for issuance; the Company has never promised (in
writing or otherwise) any such equity instrument to any Person. The Company
has never adopted, sponsored or maintained any stock option plan or any other

may be required under applicable securities Laws and (b) such filings and
notifications as may be required under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust
Laws, to be made by the Purchaser, and the expiration or early termination of
any applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act or applicable foreign
Antitrust Laws.

 

5.4 _Purchaser Capital Structure_. As of the date hereof, the authorized
capital stock of the Purchaser is 80,000,000 shares of Purchaser Common
Stock, 43,917,378 of which are outstanding as of April 24, 2019, and 5,000,000
shares of preferred stock, none of which are outstanding as of the date
hereof. All of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Purchaser were
duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and non-assessable.

5.5 _Valid Issuance of Purchaser Common Stock_. The shares of Purchaser
Common Stock to be issued pursuant to this Agreement will, when issued, be
duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and issued in
compliance with federal and state securities Laws.

 

5.6 _Purchaser SEC Reports_. Since January 1, 2018, the Purchaser has timely
filed with the SEC all reports required to be filed by it under the Exchange
Act (the "Purchaser SEC Reports"). Such reports, including any financial
statements or schedules included therein, (a) as of their respective dates or,
if amended, as of the date of the last such amendment, did not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, and (b) when filed, complied in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the applicable rules and
regulations of the SEC thereunder.

 

5.7 _Sufficiency of Funds_. The Purchaser will have sufficient cash on hand or
other sources of immediately available funds, through consummation of a
Financing or otherwise, at the Closing to enable it to pay the Closing Cash
Consideration, the Estimated Indebtedness (to the extent payable at the
Closing), and the Estimated Transaction Expenses (to the extent payable at
the Closing), and to fund the Escrow Amount and consummate the Share
Purchase. Prior to the date hereof, the Purchaser has provided to the
Stockholder a true, complete and correct copy of an executed debt commitment
letter and corresponding customarily redacted fee letters (none of which
redacted terms affect the amount or availability of the Financing or impose
any additional conditions on the receipt of the Financing) from the financial
institutions identified therein (each, a "Lender and collectively, the
"Lenders") to provide, subject to the terms and conditions therein, financing
in the amounts set forth therein (the "Financing Commitments," as each may be
amended, replaced, modified, or terminated from time to time without the
consent of the Seller Parties) for the purpose of a Debt Financing. The
Financing Commitments are in

 



46

    

 full force and effect and are valid and binding obligations of each of the
parties thereto as of the date hereof. As of the date hereof, no event has
occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time, or both, would
reasonably be expected to constitute a material default or material breach on
the part of the Purchaser or, to the knowledge of the Purchaser, any other
party thereto, under the Financing Commitments.

 

5.8 _R andW Insurance Policy_. Prior to the date hereof, the Purchaser has
provided to the Stockholder the final draft of the Binder Agreement dated as
of the date of this Agreement between Purchaser and the Insurer pursuant to
which the Insurer has committed, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions
set forth therein, to issue the RandW Insurance Policy to the Purchaser (the
"Binder Agreement"). Prior to the date hereof, the Purchaser has provided to
the Stockholder the final draft of the RandW Insurance Policy. Except as
expressly set forth in the Binder Agreement, there are no
conditions precedent to the obligation of the Insurer to issue the RandW
Insurance Policy. There are no side letters or other agreements, contracts or
arrangements relating to the issuance of the RandW Insurance Policy in
accordance with the Binder Agreement. To the Purchasers knowledge, there is
no fact or occurrence as of the date of this Agreement that would reasonably
be expected to cause the conditions to the issuance of the RandW Insurance
Policy not to be satisfied at or before the Closing, and the Purchaser has no
reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term
or condition to be satisfied by it contained in the Binder Agreement.

 

5.9 _Brokers_. Except for Perella Weinberg Partners L.P., no broker, finder or
investment banker is entitled to any brokerage, finders or other fee or
commission in connection with the Transactions based upon arrangements made by
or on behalf of the Purchaser.

 

5.10 _No Other Representation and Warranties_. Except for the representations
and warranties contained in this _Article V_ , neither the Purchaser nor any
representative thereof has made or makes any other express or implied
representation or warranty, either written or oral, on behalf of the
Purchaser, or any representation or warranty arising from statute or otherwise
at law with respect to the Purchaser. The Purchaser acknowledges that except
for the representations and warranties contained in _Article III_ and _Article
IV_ or under any Ancillary Agreement to which the Company or the Stockholder
is a party, none of the Company, the Stockholder, nor representative thereof
has made or makes any other express or implied representation or warranty,
either written or oral, on behalf of the Company or the Stockholder, or any
representation or warranty arising from statute or otherwise at law with
respect to the Company or the Stockholder.

6.2 _No Solicitation of Proposals_.

 

(a) During the Pre-Closing Period, neither the Stockholder nor the Company
shall, nor shall the Company authorize or permit any of its officers,
directors, managers, partners, independent contractors, consultants, advisors,
employees, stockholders, agents, representatives or Affiliates (each, a
"Company Representative") to, directly or indirectly, take any of
the following actions with any Person other than the Purchaser: (i) solicit,
initiate, encourage or facilitate any inquiry, proposal, request or offer,
directly or indirectly, relating to an Alternative Transaction (each,
a "Proposal"), (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations relating
to, assist or cooperate with any Person to make, or furnish any Person with
information in connection with, or take any other action to facilitate,
any Proposal or Alternative Transaction, (iii) disclose any information to
any Person concerning the business, technologies or properties of the Company,
or afford to any Person access to the Companys properties, technologies,
books or records, in each case other than in the ordinary course of business
in connection with ongoing commercial transactions, or (iv) propose, authorize
or enter into any agreement or understanding (whether binding or nonbinding,
written or oral) relating to, or engage in or consummate, any Alternative
Transaction or requiring the Company to abandon, terminate or fail to
consummate the Transactions or breach its obligations hereunder or under any
Ancillary Agreement. If the Seller Parties or any Company Representative
receives or has received, during the Pre-Closing Period, any Proposal, or any
request for disclosure or access as referenced in clause (iii) above, the
Seller Parties shall, or shall cause such Company Representative to
immediately (x) suspend any discussions with regard to such Proposal and (y)
notify the Purchaser in writing thereof, and furnish to the Purchaser any
information it may reasonably request, including information as to the
identity of the Person making any such inquiry, offer or proposal and the
specific terms of such inquiry, offer or proposal, and all written
documentation relating thereto.

 

(b) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur if the
provisions of this _Section 6.2_ were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed by the
parties hereto that the Purchaser shall be entitled to injunctive relief,
without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of money damages as a
remedy and without the necessity of posting any bond or other security, to
prevent breaches of the provisions of this _Section 6.2_ and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the United States
or any state having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy
to which the Purchaser may be entitled at law or in equity. Without limiting
the foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the restrictions set
forth above by any Company Representative shall be deemed to be a breach of
this Agreement by the Seller Parties.

6.3 _Access to Information_. During the Pre-Closing Period, subject to
applicable Law, the Seller Parties shall afford the Purchaser and its
representatives with reasonable access during normal business hours and on
reasonable advance notice to the properties, books and records and all other
existing information concerning the business, properties and personnel of the
Seller Parties as the Purchaser may reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_
, that in exercising access rights under this _Section 6.3_, the Purchaser
shall not be permitted to interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the
business of the Company as presently conducted. The Company agrees to provide
to the Purchaser and its accountants, counsel and other representatives copies
of internal financial statements (including income and other material Tax
Returns, supporting documentation and, for the avoidance of doubt, such
monthly, quarterly and annual financial statements and data relating to the
business of the Company as are prepared for distribution to the management of
the Company or the Stockholder), promptly upon request. During the Pre-Closing
Period, the Purchaser may, so long as the Purchaser affords the Company the
opportunity to participate, make inquiries of the suppliers, licensors,
distributors and customers of the Company set forth on _Section 6.3_ of the
Disclosure Schedule and the Company shall help facilitate (and shall
reasonably cooperate with the Purchaser in connection with) such inquiries,
in each case in compliance with all applicable Laws (including any applicable
Antitrust Laws). The Purchaser shall hold information received pursuant to
this _Section 6.3_ in confidence in accordance with the terms of the NDA (as
defined below) until the Closing. No information or knowledge obtained in any
investigation pursuant to this _Section 6.3_ or otherwise shall affect or be
deemed to modify any representation or warranty contained

 



50

    

 herein or be deemed to amend or supplement the Disclosure Schedule, the
conditions to the obligations of the parties to consummate the Transactions,
limit or otherwise affect any rights or remedies available to any Purchaser
Indemnified Party, prevent or cure any misrepresentation, breach of warranty
or breach of covenant or otherwise prejudice in any way the rights and
remedies of any Purchaser Indemnified Party.

 

6.4 _Confidentiality_. Each of the parties hereto hereby agrees that the
disclosure of information obtained hereunder or pursuant to the negotiation
and execution of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement or the consummation
of the Transactions shall be governed by the terms of the Non-Disclosure
Agreement, dated as of October 1, 2018, between the Company and the
Purchaser (the "NDA"); _provided_ , that the NDA shall terminate and be of no
further force and effect effective as of the Closing; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein or therein,
the Purchaser shall not be restricted from making disclosures required by
applicable securities laws or under applicable stock exchange rules if the
Purchaser makes available to the Seller Parties any such disclosure (solely to
the extent it would have otherwise been restricted by the NDA) and considers
in good faith the inclusion of any reasonable and timely comments provided to
the Purchaser by the Seller Parties.

 

6.5 _Public Disclosure_. Except as expressly provided for herein, the Seller
Parties shall not (and shall not authorize any Company Representative to),
directly or indirectly, issue or make any statement or communication to any
third party (other than their respective legal, accounting and financial
advisors that are bound by confidentiality restrictions) regarding the
existence or subject matter of this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements or
the Transactions (including any claim or dispute arising out of or related to
this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements, or the interpretation, making,
performance, breach or termination hereof and the reasons therefor) without
the consent of the Purchaser or as expressly provided for herein.

6.6  _Commercially Reasonable Efforts_.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions provided in this Agreement but subject
to _Sections 6.6(b)_ and _6.6(c)_ , during the Pre-Closing Period, each of
the parties hereto shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take promptly,
or cause to be taken promptly, all actions, and to do promptly, or cause to be
done promptly, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable
Laws to consummate and make effective the Transactions, to cause all
conditions to the obligations of the other parties hereto to effect the Share
Purchase, to obtain all necessary waivers, consents, approvals and other
documents required to be delivered hereunder and to effect all necessary
registrations and filings and to remove any injunctions or other impediments
or delays, legal or otherwise, in order to consummate and make effective the
Transactions for the purpose of securing to the parties hereto the benefits
contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) In connection with all Antitrust Laws applicable to this Agreement and
the Transactions, but subject to _Section 6.6(c)_:

 

(i) The parties will, or will cause their "ultimate parent entities" as that
term is defined in the HSR Act, as promptly as reasonably practicable, to
make all necessary filings and notifications with respect to this Agreement
and the Transactions under the HSR Act and any other applicable Antitrust Laws
(together, the "Antitrust Filings") and, in any event, to each file the
Notification and Report Form under the HSR Act no more than five (5) Business
Days after the date hereof and any filing required under any other applicable
Antitrust Law no more than ten (10) Business Days after the date hereof. The
Purchaser shall be solely responsible for paying the filing fees required to
be paid to any Governmental Entity in connection with the Antitrust Filings.

 

(ii) The parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain clearance
of the Share Purchase and the other Transactions under the Antitrust Laws by
the Outside Date.

(iii) The parties shall each cooperate reasonably with one another
in connection with resolving any inquiry or investigation by any Governmental
Entity relating to

 



51

    

 their respective Antitrust Filings or the Transactions. Without limiting the
foregoing, each party shall (A) promptly inform the other party of any written
or oral communication received from any Governmental Entity relating to its
Antitrust Filing or the Transactions (and if in writing, furnish the other
party with a copy of such communication); (B) respond as promptly as
practicable to any request from any Governmental Entity for information,
documents or other materials in connection with the review of the Antitrust
Filings or the Transactions; (C) provide to the other party and its outside
antitrust counsel, and permit the other party and such counsel to review and
comment in advance of submission, all proposed correspondence, filings, and
written communications to any Governmental Entity with respect to the
Transactions; and (D) not participate in any substantive meeting or discussion
with any Governmental Entity in respect of investigation or inquiry
concerning the Transactions unless it consults with the other party in advance
and, except as prohibited by applicable Law or Governmental Entity, gives the
other party the opportunity to attend and participate thereat.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement to
the contrary:

 

(i) The Purchaser shall not be required to agree (and the Seller Parties shall
not agree without the prior written consent of the Purchaser) to (A) any
license, divestiture, sale or other disposition or holding separate (through
establishment of a trust or otherwise) of any shares of its capital stock or
of any of its or its Affiliates or the Companys or the Companys
Affiliates businesses, assets, product lines or properties, (B) the
imposition of any limitation on the ability of the Purchaser or its Affiliates
to conduct their respective businesses or own any capital stock or assets or
to acquire, hold or exercise full rights of ownership of their respective
businesses, assets, product lines or properties or the businesses, assets,
product lines or properties of the Company and its Affiliates, or (C) the
imposition of any impediment or undertaking whatsoever on the Purchaser or
its Affiliates under any Antitrust Law or statute, rule, regulation, executive
order, decree, order or other legal restraint governing competition,
monopolies or restrictive trade practices (clauses (A), (B) and (C),
collectively, the "Remedies").

(ii) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, nothing herein shall
permit or require the Purchaser or the Seller Parties to (A) litigate with any
Governmental Entity or other Person in connection with this Agreement or the
Transactions, or (B) pay any consideration, relinquish any right or agree to
any modifications of existing Contracts or entry into new Contracts (other
than the payment of customary filing and application fees) in connection with
obtaining any waivers, consents, approvals from Governmental Entities or
other Persons in connection with this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or
the Transactions.

 

(iii) The Purchaser shall, on behalf of the parties, control and lead all
communications and strategy relating to the Antitrust Filings under the
Antitrust Laws ( _provided_ _,_ that the Purchaser acts in good faith and the
Seller Parties are not constrained from complying with applicable Laws).

 

6.7 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Seller Parties or the Purchaser, as
the case may be, shall give prompt notice to the other party of: (a) the
occurrence of any event that is reasonably likely to cause any representation
or warranty of the Seller Parties or the Purchaser, respectively and as the
case may be, contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate at or
prior to the Closing such that the conditions to Closing set forth in _Section
7.2(a)(i)_ or _Section 7.3(a)(i)_, as the case may be, cannot be satisfied,
or (b) any failure of the Seller Parties or the Purchaser, as the case may
be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by it hereunder such that the conditions to closing
set forth in _Section 7.2(a)(ii)_ or _Section 7.3(a)(ii)_, as the case may
be, cannot be satisfied; _provided_ , that the delivery of any notice or the
making of any disclosure pursuant to this _Section 6.7_ shall not prevent the
Purchaser or the Seller Parties, as applicable, from terminating
this Agreement pursuant to the applicable provisions of _Section 10.1_.

 



52

    

6.8 _Consents; Notices_ _; Indebtedness_. Subject to _Section 6.6_ relating
to the Antitrust Filings and Antitrust Laws, during the Pre-Closing Period,
each of the Company and its Affiliates shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain all necessary consents, waivers and approvals of, and
deliver all necessary notices to, any parties to any Contract as are required
thereunder in connection with the Share Purchase or for any such Contracts to
remain in full force and effect (including to obtain waivers of any
termination rights that are triggered as a result of entering into this
Agreement or the Closing), all of which are required to be listed in _Section
3.4_ of the Disclosure Schedule, so as to preserve all rights of, and benefits
to, the Company under such Contract from and after the Closing (the "Required
Consents"). Such consents, waivers and approvals shall be in a form reasonably
acceptable to the Purchaser. Any Liabilities of any kind on the part of the
Company that arise in connection with the performance by the Company of this
_Section 6.8_ shall be included as Transaction Expenses (whether matured or
unmatured and whether or not yet due and payable). Prior to or concurrent with
the Closing, the Company shall repay and extinguish all Indebtedness of the
types included in clauses (a), (c), (d), (e), (f), (j) and (k) (and clause (m)
solely to the extent relating to the foregoing) of the definition of
Indebtedness (the "Funded Indebtedness"), in each case without any further
Liability to the Company, the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, and, in the
case of Funded Indebtedness to be repaid and extinguished at the Closing,
shall deliver, at least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date,
UCC-3 termination statements, intellectual property assignment terminations
and executed payoff letters or final invoices, as applicable, from each
lender, creditor, noteholder or other counterparty to which such Funded
Indebtedness is owing (whether or not then due and payable), in each case (a)
that sets forth the amount to be paid on or prior to the Closing Date,
together with wire transfer instructions, (b) evidencing that the payment of
such amount would result in the full repayment, satisfaction, release, and
discharge of all current and future obligations of the Company (and, in the
case of hedging, swap or similar agreements, the complete unwind and
settlement of such arrangements) in respect of such item and of all current
and future Liens relating to such item and (c) contemplating the delivery of
UCC-3 termination statements, mortgage releases and other Lien releases that
when filed or recorded, as the case may be, will be sufficient to release any
and all Liens relating to such item. The Company shall arrange for delivery of
all such recorded UCC-3 termination statements, mortgage releases and other
Lien releases, if any, at the Closing.

 

6.9 _Continuing Employees_. All employees of the Company, other than the
Signing Employees (collectively, the "Offered Employees"), will be offered
continued employment on an at-will basis by or with the Purchaser or one of
its Subsidiaries (including the Company) (the offering entity, the
"Employer"), with (a) base salary or base hourly rate and (b) participation
in cash incentive compensation programs (including commissions), which, in the
aggregate, will be substantially similar to those of provided to similarly
situated United States employees of Purchaser in similar functions and
positions. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause
all Offered Employees to accept employment with the Employer prior to the
Closing by executing and delivering their New Hire Documents to the Purchaser,
such New Hire Documents to be effective as of the Closing. The Offered
Employees who accept employment with the Employer and execute and deliver
their New Hire Documents shall be referred to herein as "Continuing
Employees." Unless otherwise agreed by the Stockholder and the Purchaser, the
Company shall, immediately prior to the Closing, terminate any Offered
Employee who does not accept employment with the Employer prior to the
Closing. Continuing Employees shall be eligible to participate in the health,
welfare and other benefit programs of the Company (other than the 401(k) Plan,
which will be the Purchasers plan) unless otherwise provided for in the New
Hire Documents (it being understood that equity incentive plans are not
considered employee benefits for this purpose). Service with the Company will
be included for purposes of determining the vacation or paid-time off accrual
rate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this  _Section
6.9_ shall (i) be treated as an amendment of any particular employee benefit
plan, program, policy, agreement or arrangement, (ii) give any third party,
including any Offered Employee, any Continuing Employee, any former employee
of the Company or any beneficiary representative thereof, any right to enforce
the provisions of this _Section 6.9_ or (iii) operate to duplicate any
benefit provided to any Continuing Employee or the funding of any
such benefit. Nothing contained in this Agreement (x)

 



53

    

 confers (or is intended to confer) upon any Offered Employee, any Continuing
Employee or any other Person any right to continued employment after the
Closing or (y) prevents (or is intended to prevent) the Purchaser or any of
its Affiliates from amending, modifying or terminating any employee benefit
plan, program, policy, agreement or arrangement at any time.

 

6.10 _Termination of Section 401(k) and Section 125 Plans_. Effective as of
no later than the day immediately preceding the Closing Date, each of the
Company and any ERISA Affiliate shall terminate any and all Company Employee
Plans intended to include a Code Section 401(k) arrangement (each, a "401(k)
Plan") and any and all Company Employee Plans intended to meet the
requirements of Code Section 125 (each a "125 Plan") (unless the Purchaser
provides written notice to the Company that any or all such 401(k) Plans
and/or 125 Plans shall not be terminated). Unless the Purchaser provides such
written notice to the Company, no later than five (5) Business Days prior to
the Closing Date, the Company shall provide the Purchaser with evidence that
each 401(k) Plan and each 125 Plan has been terminated (effective as of no
later than the day immediately preceding the Closing Date) pursuant to
resolutions of the Board of Directors of the Company, or such ERISA Affiliate,
as the case may be. The form and substance of such resolutions shall be
subject to review and approval of the Purchaser, which approval shall not
unreasonably be withheld. The Company also shall take such other actions in
furtherance of terminating each 401(k) Plan and each 125 Plan as the Purchaser
may reasonably require. Employees of the Company with outstanding participant
loan balances under any 401(k) Plan shall be permitted to roll over their plan
loans to Purchasers 401(k) plan after the Closing as part of any qualifying
rollover distribution. Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate shall
place any participant loan in default under any 401(k) Plan, provided that
each employee of the Company apply for a distribution and rollover of his or
her 401(k) Plan in a timely manner so that rollovers can be made prior to the
end of the grace period for the repayment of the loan. In the event that
termination of a 401(k) Plan would reasonably be anticipated to trigger
liquidation charges, surrender charges or other fees (other than
administrative expenses in the ordinary course) then such charges and/or fees
shall be included in Transaction Expenses of the Company and shall be the
responsibility of the Company, and the Company shall take such actions as are
necessary to reasonably estimate the amount of such charges and/or fees and
provide such estimate in writing to the Purchaser no later than five (5)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date.

 

6.11 _Indemnification of Officers and Directors_.

 

(a) Prior to Closing Date, the Company shall purchase and fully pay the
premium (or include the premium payable as a Transaction Expense if not paid
prior to the Closing) for directors and officers fiduciary liability run-off
insurance (i.e. the Companys executive risk policy) which shall provide run-
off coverage for six (6) years following the Closing Date, which shall by its
terms survive the Closing, having limits, terms and conditions no less
favorable than the terms of such insurance policy currently maintained by the
Company and the Company shall to cause such insurance to be bound not later
than the Closing Date.

(b) The indemnification provisions applicable to directors, officers and
employees of the Company as set forth in the Charter Documents as of the date
hereof are incorporated herein by reference as if set forth herein in full.
The Purchaser agrees that all rights to indemnification or exculpation
existing in favor of, and all limitations on the personal liability of, each
present and former director and officer of the Company (the "DandO Indemnified
Parties") provided for therein shall continue for the full duration of the
statute of limitations or six (6) years, whichever is shorter (or during the
continuation of any claim which was asserted during such time period). Nothing
set forth herein shall require the maintenance or continuation of any
provision of the organizational documents of the Company by the Purchaser or
any of its successors, and it is intended that this _Section 6.11(b)_ is a
full and complete alternative in lieu thereof.

(c) The obligations under this _Section 6.11_ shall not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to adversely affect the Stockholder without the
consent of the Stockholder (it being expressly agreed that the DandO Indemnified
Parties to whom this _Section 6.11_ applies shall be third party
beneficiaries of this _Section 6.11_ and shall be entitled to enforce the
covenants contained herein).

6.12 _Release_. Effective for all purposes as of the Closing, the
Stockholder acknowledges and agrees, on behalf of himself and each of his
Affiliates, heirs, successors, assigns and agents (each, a "Releasor"), that
the Stockholder, on behalf of himself and the other Releasors, hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally releases the Purchaser and its Affiliates
(including the Company), and their respective Affiliates, successors and
assigns, present or former directors, officers, employees, and agents, from
any and all charges, complaints, claims, liabilities, obligations, promises,
agreements, controversies, damages or causes of action, suits, rights,
demands, costs, losses, debts and expenses (including attorneys fees and
costs incurred) of any nature whatsoever, known or unknown, suspected or
unsuspected, existing or prospective, relating to the Stockholders investment
in, ownership of any securities in, any rights to proceeds upon the sale of,
any rights or assets of, or employment by, the Company
(collectively, "Claims"); _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing release
shall not cover Claims (a) arising from rights of the Stockholder under this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements or (b) for accrued wages payable
in the ordinary course of business in the current payroll cycle
(collectively, "Excluded Claims"). Such released Claims include (except as
otherwise excluded as an Excluded Claim), to the maximum extent permitted by
applicable Laws, any and all Claims: (i) relating to or arising out of such
employment, the end of such employment and/or the terms and conditions of such
employment; (ii) of or for employment discrimination, harassment or
retaliation under any local, state or federal law or ordinance, including
without limitation Title VII or the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, the
Civil Rights Act of 1991, as amended the Equal Pay Act of 1963, as amended, or
the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended; (iii) under the
Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, as amended, or under similar state or
local law; (iv) under the federal Worker Adjustment Retraining and
Notification Act or any similar state or local law; (v) under the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (excluding claims for
accrued, vested benefits under any pension or welfare benefit plan, subject to
the terms of the applicable plan and applicable Law); (vi) under any other
federal, state or local statute, law, rule or regulation of the applicable
jurisdiction; (vii) for wages (excluding accrued wages payable in the ordinary
course of business in the current payroll cycle), bonuses, incentive
compensation, stock, options or other equity-based incentives, severance,
vacation pay or any other compensation or benefits; (viii) under or for
violation of any public policy or Contract (express or implied); (ix) for any
tort, or otherwise arising under common law; (x) arising under any policies,
practices or procedures of the Company; (xi) any and all Claims for wrongful
or constructive discharge, breach of Contract (express or implied), infliction
of emotional distress, defamation; and (xii) any and all Claims for costs,
fees, or other expenses, including attorneys fees incurred in these matters.
The Stockholder represents and acknowledges that he has read this release and
understands its terms and has been given an opportunity to ask questions of
the Companys representatives, and to consult with independent legal counsel
of his own choosing. The Stockholder further represents that in signing this
release he does not rely, and has not relied, on any representation or
statement not set forth in this release made by any representative of the
Purchaser or anyone else with regard to the subject matter, basis or effect of
this release or otherwise. The Stockholder hereby acknowledges and agrees
that neither the release provided hereunder nor the furnishing of the
consideration for the release given hereunder will be deemed or construed at
any time to be an admission by any released party or Releasor of any improper
or unlawful conduct. The Stockholder hereby irrevocably covenants to refrain
from, directly or indirectly, asserting any claim, or commencing, instituting
or causing to be commenced, any action, proceeding, charge, complaint, or
investigation of any kind against any of the released parties, in any forum
whatsoever (including any administrative agency), that is based upon any claim
purported to be released hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything
to the contrary in this release, it is understood and agreed that the release
given herein does not prohibit any Releasor from filing an administrative
charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or similar equal
employment opportunity/anti-discrimination administrative agency (federal,
state or local). The Stockholder, however, waives any right to monetary or
other recovery in connection with any such charge and/or in the event any such
federal, state or local administrative agency pursues

 



55

    

 any claims on the Stockholders behalf or otherwise in connection with any
such charge or relating to the Stockholders employment with the Company or
any successor or assign. This release may be pleaded by any released party as
a full and complete defense regarding any matter purported to be released
hereby and may be used as the basis for an injunction against any action at
law or equity instituted or maintained against them regarding such matter in
violation of this Agreement. In the event any claim is brought or maintained
by a Releasor against any released party in violation of this Agreement, the
Stockholder shall be responsible for all costs and expenses,
including reasonable attorneys fees, incurred by the released parties in
defending same. The Stockholder expressly acknowledges that the release
contained herein applies to all Claims, regardless of whether such Claims are
known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, existing or prospective, and
include Claims which, if known by the releasing party, might materially affect
its decision to enter into this _Section 6.12_ (other than the Excluded
Claims). The Stockholder has considered and taken into account the possible
existence of such Claims in determining to execute and deliver this Agreement.

6.13 _Transaction Bonus Pool_. During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company may
establish a transaction bonus pool for certain employees of the Company (the
"Transaction Bonus Pool"), which amount shall be inclusive of the aggregate
Anniversary Transaction Bonus that may become payable and any related
employer payroll taxes. The payment of any portion of the Transaction Bonus
Pool to any such employee shall be contingent upon the occurrence of the
Closing and such employee executing and delivering a bonus agreement (which
shall include a release) in a form reasonably acceptable to the Purchaser and
entering into New Hire Documents prior to the Closing (any such employee, a
"Transaction Bonus Pool Participant"). The portion of the Transaction Bonus
Pool payable to a Transaction Bonus Pool Participant (with respect to such
Transaction Bonus Pool Participant, the "Transaction Payment Allocation") (a)
shall not exceed the estimated amount provided by the Stockholder to the
Purchaser prior to the date hereof, and (b) will be paid as follows: (i) [***]
of such Transaction Payment Allocation shall be paid by the Company at or
promptly following the Closing; and (ii) the remaining [***] of such
Transaction Payment Allocation (the "Anniversary Transaction Bonus") shall be
paid by the Purchaser (or the Company) as provided for in _Schedule 2.1(f)_.
The Stockholder shall provide a schedule of the Transaction Payment
Allocation payable to each Transaction Bonus Pool Participant no later than
ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing. The Transaction Bonus Pool (and
any related employer payroll taxes) shall be deemed to be
Transaction Expenses.

6.14 _Financing; Cooperation_.

 

(a) The Purchaser shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to arrange and
consummate a Financing during the Pre-Closing Period. In the event that such
Financing is a Debt Financing, the Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable
efforts in a timely and diligent manner to (i) maintain in full force and
effect the Financing Commitments, (ii) negotiate and enter into definitive
agreements with respect to the Financing on the terms and conditions contained
in the Financing Commitments ("Financing Agreements"), (iii) comply with and
satisfy all terms, covenants and conditions set forth in the Financing
Commitments and any Financing Agreements such that the Financing will be able
to be consummated at the Closing, (iv) enforce its rights under the Financing
Commitments, and (v) consummate the Financing at the Closing. The Purchaser
will furnish true, correct, and complete copies of any and all Financing
Agreements (provided that any fee letter may be redacted) to the Seller
Parties promptly upon their execution if prior to the Closing Date. The
Purchaser shall keep the Seller Parties reasonably informed as to the status
of its efforts to arrange the Financing, but nothing contained in this
_Section 6.14(a)_ shall limit the Purchasers ability to finance the
Transaction in a manner determined in its sole discretion.

(b) During the Pre-Closing Period, the Seller Parties shall provide, and the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its officers,
employees, representatives and advisors to provide, to the Purchaser customary
cooperation and assistance that is reasonably requested by the Purchaser in
connection with the Financing; _provided_ , that the Seller Parties shall not
be required to provide cooperation under this _Section 6.14_ that: (a)
unreasonably interferes with the ongoing business of

 



56

    

 the Company, or (b) except as provided in clauses (iv), (v) and (vi) below,
requires the Seller Parties or the Companys directors, officers, managers or
employees to execute or enter into, or perform any agreement, document or
instrument with respect to the Financing that is not contingent upon the
Closing or that would be effective prior to the Closing. Such cooperation by
the Seller Parties shall include, at the reasonable request of the Purchaser,
(i) assisting with the drafting and preparation of customary credit documents
(including the schedules related thereto) and facilitating the grant of a
security interest (and perfection thereof) in property of the Company
(including, delivery of stock certificates, if any) as may be reasonably
requested by the Purchaser ( _provided_ , that no obligation of the Seller
Parties under any such agreement, pledge or grant shall be effective until
the Closing), (ii) at least ten (10) Business Days prior to Closing,
providing to the Purchaser information with respect to the Seller Parties
required by regulatory authorities under applicable "know your customer" and
anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including the PATRIOT Act, or
that is otherwise reasonably required in connection with the Financing (e.g.
form W-9s, certificates of incorporation and bylaws), (iii) making the
Companys executive officers, senior management, representatives and advisors
reasonably available during regular business hours to assist Purchaser with
the consummation of the Financing, (iv) providing customary authorization
letters to the prospective lenders authorizing the distribution of
information to other prospective lenders, (v) entering into customary
engagement letters with the Companys accounting advisors to prepare any
requested financial statements of the Company ( _provided_ , that any such
engagement letter is in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the
Purchaser), (vi) furnishing to the Purchaser as promptly as practicable with
the Company Financing Information, and (vii) obtaining customary pay-
off letters for Funded Indebtedness and Lien release documents with respect
to Indebtedness from the existing creditors and/or lienholders of the Company.

 

6.15 _Reimbursement of Audit Expenses_. The Purchaser shall, upon the written
request of the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable accounting
and other advisors fees) incurred by the Company in connection with the
preparation of the Company Financing Information in clauses (i) and (iii) of
the definition of Company Financing Information and the cooperation provided
for in _Section 6.14_ (collectively, the "Audit Costs"). The parties
acknowledge and agree that as of the date hereof, the Audit Costs are zero.

6.16 _Non-Competition/Non-Solicitation_.

 

(a) The Stockholder, is his individual capacity or through any of his
Affiliates shall not, directly or indirectly, for a period of four (4) years
after the Closing Date, engage (whether as owner, employee, operator, manager,
consultant or otherwise) anywhere in the world in any business that competes
with the business of the Company, the Purchaser or any of their
respective Affiliates. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Stockholder and his
Affiliates shall not be prohibited by this _Section 6.16(a)_ from acquiring
or owning less than one percent (1%) of the outstanding voting power of any
publicly traded company on a passive basis.

(b) The Stockholder and his Affiliates shall not, nor shall he permit any of
his Affiliates to, directly or indirectly, for a period of four (4) years
after the Closing Date, (i) other than for the benefit of the Company or the
Purchaser, solicit, call upon, divert, take away, attempt to induce, or accept
or conduct any business from or with, any customer, supplier, agent or
distributor of the Company, the Purchaser or any of their respective
Affiliates, or cause any such customer, supplier, agent or distributor to
terminate or adversely affect or materially reduce their
business relationship with the Company, the Purchaser or any of their
respective Affiliates, or (ii) contact, solicit or approach for the purpose of
offering employment to, or hire (whether as an employee, consultant, agent,
independent contractor or otherwise), any employee employed or full-time
consultant engaged by the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including the
Company) during the one (1) year period preceding such contact, solicitation
or approach ( _provided_ , that the foregoing clause shall not prohibit the
Stockholder or his Affiliates from making a general solicitation not targeting
any such employee or consultant).

 



57

    

(c) The Stockholder, for himself and on behalf of his Affiliates, agrees that
the scope of the restrictive provisions set forth in this _Section 6.16_ are
reasonable with respect to subject matter, time and scope and that the
provisions contained in this _Section 6.16_ are a material inducement to the
Purchasers entering into this Agreement and but for the provisions contained
in this _Section 6.16_, the Purchaser would not have entered into this
Agreement. In the event that any court determines that the subject matter,
duration or geographic scope, or all of the foregoing, is unreasonable and
that such provision is to that extent unenforceable, the Purchaser and the
Stockholder, for itself or himself and on behalf of each of his or its
Affiliates, agree that the provision shall remain in full force and effect
for the greatest time period and for the broadest subject matter and in the
greatest area, as the case may be, that would not render it unenforceable. It
is specifically understood and agreed that any breach of the provisions of
this _Section 6.16_ by the Stockholder or any of his Affiliates will result
in irreparable injury to the Purchaser, that the remedy at law alone will be
an inadequate remedy for such breach and that, in addition to any
other remedy it may have, the Purchaser shall be entitled to enforce the
specific performance of this _Section 6.16_ by the Stockholder and his
Affiliates through both temporary and permanent injunctive relief without the
necessity of proving actual damages and without posting a bond, but without
limitation of the Purchasers right to damages and any and all other remedies
available to the Purchaser, it being understood that injunctive relief is in
addition to, and not in lieu of, such other remedies. Should Stockholder
breach _Section 6.16(a)_ or _6.16(b)_ above, the term of the restrictions set
forth in _Section 6.16(a)_ or _6.16(b)_ , as applicable, shall be tolled by
the duration of such breach. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties hereto
acknowledge and agree that the restrictions set forth in this _Section 6.16_
are independent of and in addition to any restrictions set forth in the
Signing Hire Documents and/or any other Contract between the Purchaser or any
of its Affiliates (including the Company), on the one hand, and the
Stockholder, on the other hand (including the remainder of this Agreement).
The Stockholder acknowledges and agrees that he has received, or is
receiving, substantial consideration in connection with the Transactions. No
breach by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates of any contractual or other
obligations it or they have to the Stockholder shall constitute a defense, or
a limitation of, the enforcement of this _Section 6.16_ against the
Stockholder. If the Stockholder violates this _Section 6.16_, in addition to
all other remedies available to the Purchaser at law, in equity, and under
contract, the Stockholder agrees that the Stockholder shall pay the
Purchasers costs of enforcement of this _Section 6.16_, including reasonable
attorneys fees and expenses.

 

6.17 _State Takeover Statutes_. In the event that any "fair price,"
"moratorium," "control share acquisition," or other anti-takeover statute or
regulation or any anti-takeover provision of the Charter Documents is or
becomes prior to the Closing, or at the Closing will be, applicable to the
Company, shares of Company Stock or any Transaction, the Company, at the
direction of the Board of Directors of the Company, shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to ensure that the Transactions may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement, and otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or
regulation on this Agreement and the Transactions.

8.3 _Straddle Periods_. For purposes of this Agreement, in order to
apportion appropriately any Taxes relating to a Straddle Period, the portion
of any Taxes that are allocable to the portion of the Straddle Period ending
on and including the Closing Date shall be (a) in the case of income Taxes and
all other Taxes that are not imposed on a periodic basis, the amount that
would be payable if the taxable year or period ended on the Closing Date based
on an interim closing of the books (and for such purpose, the Tax period of
any controlled foreign corporation, partnership or other pass-through entity
in which the Company holds a beneficial interest shall be deemed to terminate
at such time) and (b) in the case of any Taxes that are imposed on a periodic
basis, the amount of such Taxes for the relevant period multiplied by a
fraction the numerator of which shall be the number of days from the beginning
of the period up to and including the Closing Date and the denominator of
which shall be the number of days in the entire period. For the avoidance of
doubt, exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual
basis (including depreciation and amortization deductions) shall be allocated
between the period ending on the Closing Date and the period after the
Closing Date in proportion to the number of days in each period by an interim
closing of the books as of the Closing, other than with respect to any
property placed into service after the Closing.

 

8.4 _Tax Cooperation_. The Purchaser, the Company and the Stockholder shall
cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other
parties hereto, in connection with the filing, preparation and review of Tax
Returns, and any Tax audits, Tax proceedings or other Tax-related claims
(including claims under this Agreement). Such cooperation shall include
providing records and information that are reasonably relevant to any such
matters and in their possession (or if not in their possession, if reasonably
able to obtain), making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information, and explaining any materials provided
pursuant to this _Section 8.4_. The Purchaser, the Company and the
Stockholder shall not destroy or dispose of any Tax workpapers, schedules or
other materials and documents in their possession or under their control
supporting Tax Returns of the Company for Pre-Closing Tax Periods until the
seventh (7th) anniversary of the Closing Date.

 

8.5 _Transfer Taxes_. All sales, use, transfer, value added, goods and
services, gross receipts, excise, conveyance and documentary, stamp,
recording, registration, conveyance and similar Taxes incurred in connection
with the Transactions pursuant to this Agreement, including penalties and
interest ("Transfer Taxes") shall be borne fifty percent (50%) by
the Purchaser and fifty percent (50%) by the Stockholder. The Purchaser shall
timely file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to
all such Transfer Taxes and the Stockholder shall join in the execution of any
such Tax Returns to the extent required by applicable Law.

(viii) those matters set forth on  _Schedule 9.2(a)(viii)_; and/or

(ix) any Pre-Closing Taxes.

 

(b) Subject to the provisions of this _Article IX_ , from and after the

from and against, and shall compensate and reimburse the Stockholder for, all

arising under, in connection with or as a result of:

 

(i) any breach (or an allegation that would amount to a breach in the case of
a third party claim) of a representation or warranty made by the Purchaser in
_Article V_ of this Agreement or any certificate delivered by the Purchaser to
the Seller Parties in connection with the Closing;

 

(ii) any failure (or an allegation that would amount to a failure in the case
of a third party claim) by the Purchaser to perform or comply with any
covenant or agreement applicable to the Purchaser contained in this Agreement,
(for the avoidance of doubt, including the Purchasers obligations pursuant to
_Section 2.5(d))_; or

 

(iii) any fraud, or any Willful Breach of any provision of this Agreement or
any such certificate, to the extent committed as of or prior to the Closing,

inaccuracy or breach of (other than with respect to _Section 3.7(b)_,
_Section 3.12(c)_, the second sentence of _Section 3.12(l)_, _Section
3.21(f)_ or _Section 3.21(l)_), and the amount of Losses suffered by an
Indemnified Party as a result of, any breach or inaccuracy of any

Effect, or any other materiality qualifications or limitations shall be deemed
to be made or given without such qualification or limitation.

 

(d) The Stockholder shall not have any right of contribution, indemnification
or right of advancement from the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates with
respect to any Loss claimed by a Purchaser Indemnified Party.

(e) The Company and the Stockholder have agreed that the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties rights to indemnification, compensation and reimbursement
contained in this _Article IX_ relating to the representations, warranties,
covenants, indemnities and obligations of the Company and/or the Stockholder
are part of the basis of the bargain contemplated by this Agreement; and such
representations, warranties, covenants, indemnities and obligations, and the
rights and remedies that may be exercised by the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties with respect thereto, shall not be waived, limited or

 



64

    

 otherwise affected by or as a result of (and the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties shall be deemed to have relied upon such representations, warranties,
covenants or obligations notwithstanding) any knowledge on the part of any of
the Purchaser Indemnified Parties or any of their representatives (regardless
of whether obtained through any investigation by any Purchaser Indemnified
Parties or any representative of any Purchaser Indemnified Parties or through
disclosure by the Company or any other Person, and regardless of whether such
knowledge was obtained before or after the execution and delivery of this
Agreement) or by reason of the fact that a Purchaser Indemnified Party or
any of its representatives knew or should have known that any representation
or warranty is or might be inaccurate or untrue. The Purchaser has agreed that
the Stockholders rights to indemnification, compensation and reimbursement
contained in this _Article IX_ relating to the representations, warranties,
covenants, indemnities and obligations of the Purchaser are part of the basis
of the bargain contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(f) This _Article IX_ shall constitute the exclusive remedy after the Closing

of the matters specified in _Section 9.2(a)_, _provided_ , that
notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement
shall limit the rights or remedies of the Purchaser or any other Purchaser
Indemnified Party (i) in the case of fraud or Willful Breach (including
pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)(iii)_ or _Section 9.2(b)(iii)_), (ii)
Transaction Expenses or Indebtedness as described in  _Section 9.2(a)(vii)_,
(iii) against a signatory to an Ancillary Agreement for matters relating to
such Ancillary Agreement (other than a Certificate), (iv) with respect to
specific performance, injunctive and other equitable relief, (v) claims
relating to Related Party Transactions, or (vi) for breaches of any covenant
to be performed following the Closing, or (y) as a result of breaches of the
matters specified in _Section 9.2(b)_,  _provided_ , that notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement shall limit the
rights or remedies of the Stockholder (i) in the case of fraud or Willful
Breach (including pursuant to  _Section 9.2(a)(iii)_ or _Section
9.2(b)(iii)_), (ii) against a signatory to an Ancillary Agreement for matters
relating to such Ancillary Agreement (other than a certificate delivered by
the Purchaser to the Seller Parties in connection with the Closing), (iii)
with respect to specific performance, injunctive and other equitable relief,
or (iv) for breaches of any covenant to be performed following the Closing.
Without limiting the foregoing, the provisions of this _Article IX_ will not
prevent or limit a cause of action under _Section 6.16_ to obtain an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of covenants contained in this
Agreement.

 

9.3 _Maximum Payments; Remedy_.

 

(a) The Purchaser Indemnified Parties, on the one hand, or the Stockholder, on
the other hand (each, an "Indemnified Party"), shall not be entitled to any
recovery resulting from _Section 9.2(a)(i)_ or _Section 9.2(b)(i)_,
respectively, until such time (if at all) as the total amount of all Losses
that have been suffered or incurred by any one or more of such Indemnified
Parties with respect to such matters exceeds $250,000 in the aggregate; and in
such event, the Purchaser Indemnified Parties or the Stockholder, as the case
may be, shall, subject to the limitations set forth in the
remaining subsections of this _Section 9.3_, be entitled to be indemnified
against and compensated and reimbursed to the extent all Losses from the first
Dollar thereof; _provided_ , that the limitations set forth in this  _Section
9.3(a)_ shall not apply to any indemnification claims relating to (i) any
breach (or an allegation that would amount to a breach in the case of a third
party claim) of any representation or warranty that involves fraud or Willful
Breach (including pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)(iii)_ or _Section
9.2(b)(iii)_) or (ii) any breach (or an allegation that would amount to a
breach in the case of a third party claim of the Special Representations
and the Fundamental Representations.

(b) The maximum amount that the Purchaser Indemnified Parties may recover from
the Stockholder under  _Section 9.2(a)(i)_, absent fraud or Willful Breach,
shall be limited to the Indemnification Escrow Amount; _provided_ , that (i)
for any breach (or an allegation that would amount to a breach in the case of
a third party claim) of the Special Representations, the maximum amount that
the Purchaser Indemnified Parties, may recover from the Stockholder shall be
limited to [***] (the "Special Representation Cap"), and (ii) in the case of
any breach (or an allegation that would amount to a breach in the case of a
third party claim) of the Seller Party Fundamental Representations, the
maximum amount

 



65

    

 that the Purchaser Indemnified Parties may recover from the Stockholder
shall be limited to [***] (the "Indemnifying Stockholder Proceeds"). Absent
fraud or Willful Breach by the Company, the Stockholder or any of their
respective authorized representatives (including pursuant to _Section
9.2(a)(iii)_), the maximum amount that the Purchaser Indemnified Parties may
recover from the Stockholder under  _Section 9.2(a)_ shall be limited to the
Indemnifying Stockholder Proceeds. The attributed dollar value of any
Purchaser Common Stock returned by the Stockholder in connection with any
claim for indemnification hereunder (including the number of shares
recoverable by the Purchaser Indemnified Party) shall be equal to the
Purchaser Common Stock Price; _provided_ , that amounts recoverable from the
Stockholder shall be paid in cash in accordance with this _Article IX_ to the
extent of the cash Purchase Price prior to any recovery of any Purchaser
Common Stock. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary,
nothing herein shall limit the recovery amount against the Stockholder, or
remedies available to a Purchaser Indemnified Party, for fraud or Willful
Breach by the Company, the Stockholder or any of their respective authorized
representatives (including pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)(iii)_).

 

(c) Except for fraud or Willful Breach committed by the Purchaser or any of
its authorized representatives, the maximum amount that the Stockholder may
recover under _Section 9.2(b)(i)_ shall be limited to the Indemnification
Escrow Amount; _provided_ , that in the case of any breach (or an allegation
that would amount to a breach in the case of a third party claim) of the
Purchaser Fundamental Representations and claims under _Section 9.2(b)(ii)_,
the maximum aggregate amount that the Stockholder may recover from the
Purchaser shall be limited to the aggregate Indemnifying Stockholder
Proceeds. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, nothing
herein shall limit the recovery amount against the Purchaser, or remedies
available to the Stockholder, for fraud or Willful Breach by the Purchaser or
any of its authorized representatives (including pursuant to _Section
9.2(b)(iii)_).

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, (i) if and solely to the extent the amount of
a Loss is recovered by an Indemnified Party through the actual payment of a
Payable Claim to such Indemnified Party, the same amount of such Loss may not
be recovered again by such Indemnified Party by reason of such Loss
being subject to indemnification under more than one provision of this
Agreement and (ii) if and solely to the extent that a Loss in connection with
an Indemnifiable Matter was expressly taken into account in connection with
calculations of the Estimated Working Capital Statement pursuant to _Section
2.3_, the same amount of such Loss may not be recovered under this _Article
IX_ , but, in the case of the immediately preceding clauses (i) and (ii), the
amount, if any, of Loss that exceeds the amount already recovered under
clause (i) or already taken into account under clause (ii) shall be
recoverable on and subject to the terms and conditions of this _Article IX_.

 

(e) The Purchaser Indemnified Parties right to indemnification pursuant to
this _Article IX_ on account of any Losses will be reduced by all insurance
of the Company or other third party indemnification or contribution proceeds
actually received by the Company in respect of those Losses (other than the
RandW Insurance Policy, except as set forth in  _Section 9.4(a)_), net of
applicable costs and expenses involved in seeking such recovery (including
increases in premiums relating thereto). The applicable Purchaser Indemnified
Parties shall remit to the Stockholder, for the benefit of the Stockholder,
any such insurance or other third party proceeds that are paid to such
Purchaser Indemnified Parties with respect to such Losses for which such
Purchaser Indemnified Parties have been previously indemnified pursuant to
this  _Article IX_.

9.4 _Claims for Indemnification; Resolution of Conflicts_.

 

(a) _Recovery under R andW Insurance._ The Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to pursue recovery for Losses under the
RandW Insurance Policy; _provided_ , that, no such actions need to be taken
prior to the making of an indemnification claim or recovering Losses
hereunder; and _provided_ , _further_ , that in no event shall any Purchaser
Indemnified Party be required to contest any denial of coverage issued by any
insurance carrier or to otherwise initiate

 



66

    

 a lawsuit against any insurance carrier or alternative source of coverage
relating to Losses. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisos in this _Section
9.4(a)_, such commercially reasonable efforts will require the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties to pursue recovery under the RandW Insurance Policy for any
breach (or an allegation that would amount to a breach in the case of a third
party claim) of the Special Representations for one year from the submission
of a claim notice under the RandW Insurance Policy prior to recovering directly
from the Stockholder unless the applicable Losses are not recoverable
thereunder on its face on account of restrictions, limitations, retention, or
exclusions in the RandW Insurance Policy; _provided_ , that nothing in this
sentence shall prevent the delivery of an Officers Certificate relating
thereto or recovery from the Indemnification Escrow Fund or the WC
Escrow Fund. If the Purchaser Indemnified Parties receive any payment for
Losses under the RandW Insurance Policy with respect to any Special
Representation or any Seller Party Fundamental Representation after the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties have recovered such Losses directly from the
Stockholder in excess of the Indemnification Escrow Amount or the WC Escrow
Fund, the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall reimburse the Stockholder the
lesser of (i) the amount of any such recovery under the RandW Insurance Policy
and (ii) the amount of such Losses previously recovered by Purchaser
Indemnified Parties directly from the Stockholder, which payment shall be net
of any reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs reasonably incurred in
asserting such claims and collecting such proceeds or payments, as applicable,
under the RandW Insurance Policy; _provided_ , that any Losses so reimbursed
shall not count against the Special Representation Cap or the
Indemnifying Stockholder Proceeds for purposes of the indemnification
limitations hereunder, as applicable. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event
shall any recovery under the RandW Insurance Policy, the WC Escrow Fund or the
Indemnification Escrow Fund result in a reduction of the Special
Representation Cap or the Indemnifying Stockholder Proceeds for purposes of
the indemnification limitations hereunder.

 

(b) _Making a Claim for Indemnification; Officer s Certificate_. The
Stockholder or a Purchaser Indemnified Party may seek recovery of Losses
pursuant to this _Article IX_ by delivering to the Purchaser or the
Stockholder, as applicable, an Officers Certificate in respect of such claim.
The date of such delivery of an Officers Certificate is referred to
herein as the "Claim Date" of such Officers Certificate (and the claims for
indemnification contained therein). For purposes hereof, "Officers
Certificate" means a certificate signed by any authorized representative of
an Indemnified Party (or, in the case of an Indemnified Party who is an
individual, signed by such individual) stating that an Indemnified Party has
paid, sustained, incurred, or accrued, or reasonably anticipates that it will
have to pay, sustain, incur or accrue Losses and including, to the extent
reasonably practicable, a non-binding, preliminary estimate of the amounts of
such Losses; _provided_ , that the Officers Certificate need only specify
such information to the knowledge of such officer or such Indemnified Party
as of the Claim Date, shall not limit any of the rights or remedies of any
Indemnified Party, and may be updated and amended from time to time by the
Indemnified Party by delivering an updated or amended Officers Certificate
to the Stockholder or the Purchaser, as applicable.

(c) _Objecting to a Claim for Indemnification_.

(i) The Stockholder or the Purchaser, as applicable, may object, in whole or
in part, to a claim for indemnification set forth in an Officers Certificate
by delivering to the Indemnified Party seeking indemnification a written
statement of objection to the claim made in the Officers Certificate (an
"Objection Notice");  _provided_ , that, to be effective, such Objection
Notice must (A) be delivered to the Indemnified Party pursuant to _Section
11.1_ prior to 5:00 p.m. New York time on the thirtieth (30th) day following
the Claim Date of the Officers Certificate (such deadline, the "Objection
Deadline" for such Officers Certificate and the claims for indemnification
contained therein) and (B) set forth in reasonable detail the nature of the
objections to the claim in respect of which the objection is made.

(ii) To the extent the Stockholder or Purchaser, as applicable, does not
object in writing (as provided in _Section 9.4(c)(i)_) to the claims
contained in an Officers Certificate prior to the Objection Deadline for such
Officers Certificate, such failure to so object shall be an 

 



67

    

 irrevocable acknowledgment by the Stockholder or the Purchaser, as
applicable, that the Indemnified Party is entitled to the full amount of the
claims for Losses set forth in such Officers Certificate (and such
entitlement shall be conclusively and irrefutably established) with respect to
the applicable Indemnifying Parties (any such claim, an "Unobjected Claim").
Within thirty (30) days of a claim becoming an Unobjected Claim, the
Indemnifying Parties shall make the applicable payment to such Indemnified
Party, subject to _Sections 9.4(f)_ and _9.5_.

 

(d) _Resolution of Conflicts_. In case the Stockholder or the Purchaser, as
applicable, timely delivers an Objection Notice in accordance with _Section
9.4(c)_ hereof, the Stockholder or the Purchaser, as applicable, and the
applicable Indemnified Parties shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the
rights of the respective parties with respect to each of such claims. If the
Stockholder or the Purchaser, as applicable, and the Indemnified Parties reach
an agreement, a memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be prepared and
signed by all applicable parties (any claims covered by such an
agreement, "Settled Claims"). Any amounts required to be paid as a result of
a Settled Claim shall be paid by the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified
Parties pursuant to the Settled Claim within thirty (30) days of the
applicable claim becoming a Settled Claim, subject to _Sections 9.4(f)_ and
_9.5_. If the Stockholder or the Purchaser, as applicable, and the Indemnified
Parties are unable to reach an agreement, the matter specified in the
Objection Notice shall be resolved pursuant _to Section 11.8_ (any claims
resolved pursuant thereto, "Resolved Claims").

(e) _Payable and Unresolved Claims_. A "Payable Claim" means a claim for
indemnification of Losses under this _Article IX_ , to the extent that such
claim has not yet been satisfied (including by release to the Purchaser
Indemnified Party of cash from the Indemnification Escrow Fund or the WC
Escrow Fund), that is (i) a Resolved Claim, (ii) a Settled Claim, or (iii) an
Unobjected Claim. An "Unresolved Claim" means any claim for indemnification
of Losses under this _Article IX_ specified in any Officers Certificate
delivered pursuant to _Section 9.4(b)_, to the extent that such claim is not
a Payable Claim and has not been satisfied (including by release to
the Indemnified Party of cash from the Indemnification Escrow Fund or the WC
Escrow Fund).

(f) _Escrow Amount; Recovery of Losses_.

 

(i) Subject to _Sections 9.4(a)_ , _9.4(c)_ and _9.4(d)_ above, by virtue of
this Agreement and as partial security for the indemnity obligations provided
for in _Sections 9.2(a)_ hereof, subject to the terms of this Agreement and
the other limitations set forth in this _Article IX_ , the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties shall have the right, and shall be required, in the
manner provided in this _Section 9.4(f)_ and _Section 9.5(b)_, to recover
the amount of any Losses with respect to which the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties are entitled to indemnification under  _Section 9.2(a)_:

(A) first, by the release from the Indemnification Escrow Fund until the
Indemnification Escrow Fund has been exhausted (or, in the case of a Sales
Tax Liability, until the WC Escrow Fund has been exhausted);

 

(B) second, under the RandW Insurance Policy (solely with respect to _Sections
9.2(a)(i)_ , _9.2(a)(iii)_ , and  _9.2(a)(ix)_ and, to the extent coverage is
available, under the terms thereof, _provided_ , that if coverage is
unavailable as a result of the Purchasers failure to maintain the RandW
Insurance Policy during the term of the RandW Insurance Policy, the Purchaser
may not, following the termination of the RandW Insurance Policy as a result of
such failure, make any claim for Losses against the Stockholder for any breach
(or an allegation that would amount to a breach in the case of a third party
claim) of any Special Representation for amounts in excess of the
Indemnification Escrow Fund unless and until such Losses exceed the amount of
coverage that would have been provided had the RandW Insurance Policy been
in place, subject to the other limitations of this _Article IX_ , and then
only the amount of such excess); and

 



68

    

(C) third, from the Stockholder directly; _provided_ , _however_ , with
respect to any breach (or an allegation that would amount to a breach in the
case of a third party claim) of any Seller Party Fundamental Representation,
if the Retention Amount under the RandW Insurance Policy is not fully satisfied
after the Indemnification Escrow Fund is exhausted, the Stockholder shall
indemnify the Purchaser Indemnified Parties for the remaining amount of the
Retention Amount under the RandW Insurance Policy.

 

Nothing in this _Section 9.4_ shall prevent any Purchaser Indemnified Party
from pursuing a claim for indemnification against the Stockholder
simultaneously with his, her or its pursuit of a claim under the RandW Insurance
Policy, _provided_ , that no Purchaser Indemnified Party may pursue a claim
against the Stockholder for (x) breaches (or allegations that would amount to
breaches in the case of a third party claim) of the General Representations
for amounts in the aggregate in excess of the Indemnification Escrow Amount,
except in the case of the Stockholders fraud or Willful Breach, or (y)
for breaches of the Special Representations until the Indemnification Escrow
Amount has been exhausted and, if applicable, the one year period set forth in
_Section 9.4(a)_ has expired, except in each case of the Stockholders fraud
or Willful Breach.

(ii) At the Escrow Release Time, if and to the extent the value of the
Indemnification Escrow Fund exceeds the aggregate amount of Unresolved Claims
(taking into account and without duplication of any reserves covered by
_Section 9.4(f)(iii)_), then the amount of such excess shall be paid to the
Stockholder. From and after the Escrow Release Time until such time as the
Indemnification Escrow Fund has been fully depleted pursuant to _Section
9.4(f)(i)_ the Purchaser shall promptly deliver to the Stockholder a notice,
as each Unresolved Claim (whether or not such Unresolved Claim existed on the
Escrow Release Time) becomes resolved as either a Payable Claim or a claim
that is not a Payable Claim, of such resolution and either (A) if and to the
extent such Unresolved Claim has been resolved as a Payable Claim,
the Purchaser shall specify the amount of such Payable Claim, and payment of
such amount shall be made to the Indemnified Parties from the Indemnification
Escrow Fund, and (B) if and to the extent such Unresolved Claim has been
resolved as not a Payable Claim, the Purchaser shall specify the amount, if
any, corresponding to the amount by which such portion of such Unresolved
Claim exceeds the aggregate amount of the remaining Unresolved Claims
(including Unresolved Claims that did not exist on the Escrow Release Time).

(iii) At the WC Escrow Release Time, if and to the extent the value of the WC
Escrow Fund exceeds the aggregate amount of Unresolved Claims for Sales Tax
Liabilities, then the amount of such excess shall be paid to the Stockholder.
From and after the WC Escrow Release Time until such time as the WC Escrow
Fund has been fully depleted pursuant to _Section 9.4(f)(i)_ the Purchaser
shall promptly deliver to the Stockholder a notice, as each such Unresolved
Claim (whether or not such Unresolved Claim existed on the WC Escrow Release
Time) becomes resolved as either a Payable Claim or a claim that is not a
Payable Claim, of such resolution and either (A) if and to the extent such
Unresolved Claim has been resolved as a Payable Claim, the Purchaser shall
specify the amount of such Payable Claim, and payment of such amount shall be
made to the Indemnified Parties from the WC Escrow Fund, and (B) if and to the
extent such Unresolved Claim has been resolved as not a Payable Claim, the
Purchaser shall specify the amount, if any, corresponding to the amount by
which such portion of such Unresolved Claim exceeds the aggregate amount of
the remaining Unresolved Claims (including Unresolved Claims that did not
exist on the WC Escrow Release Time).

 



69

    

(iv) Any claim for Losses relating to a Sales Tax Liability may, at
the Purchasers sole option, be recovered from the WC Escrow Fund; _provided_
, that the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall be required to use commercially
reasonable efforts, consistent with _Section 9.4(a)_, to seek recovery of
the amount of any Losses with respect to which the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties are entitled to indemnification for a Sales Tax Liability first from
the RandW Insurance Policy to the extent such Sales Tax Liability is covered by
the RandW Insurance Policy, and then, until the WC Escrow Release Time, by the
release from the WC Escrow Fund (and, at its sole option, the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties may seek recovery under the Indemnification Escrow Fund
prior to recovering such amount from the Stockholder directly).

9.5 _Escrow Arrangements_.

 

(a) _Escrow Fund_. At the Closing, the Purchaser will deposit the Escrow
Amount with the Escrow Agent, without any act of the Seller Parties, such
deposit of the Escrow Amount to constitute an escrow fund to be governed by
the terms set forth in the Escrow Agreement.

 

(b) _Satisfaction of Claims_.

 

(i) If payment is to be made to a Purchaser Indemnified Party from the
Indemnification Escrow Fund or the WC Escrow Fund pursuant to _Section
9.4(f)_, the Purchaser and the Stockholder shall promptly deliver joint
written instructions to the Escrow Agent directing the Escrow Agent to release
from the Indemnification Escrow Fund or the WC Escrow Fund, as applicable, to
the applicable Purchaser Indemnified Party the amount of cash so payable, plus
a pro rata portion (based on the amount of such reduction of the
Indemnification Escrow Fund or the WC Escrow Fund relative to the amount of
cash in the Indemnification Escrow Fund or the WC Escrow Fund as of
immediately before such release) of all amounts in the Indemnification Escrow
Fund that exceeds the Indemnification Escrow Amount or the WC Escrow Fund in
excess of the WC Escrow Amount as of immediately before such release (i.e.,
earnings (including interest and dividends) on the Indemnification Escrow
Amount or WC Escrow Amount and on such earnings in accordance with the Escrow
Agreement).

 

(ii) If payment is to be made to the Stockholder from the Indemnification
Escrow Fund or the WC Escrow Fund pursuant to  _Section 9.4(f)_, the
Purchaser and the Stockholder shall promptly deliver joint written
instructions to the Escrow Agent directing the Escrow Agent to release to the
Stockholder the amount of cash so payable plus a pro rata portion (based on
the amount of such reduction of the Indemnification Escrow Fund or the WC
Escrow Fund relative to the amount of cash exceeds the Indemnification Escrow
Amount or the WC Escrow Fund in excess of the WC Escrow Amount as of
immediately before such release (i.e., earnings (including interest and
dividends) on the Indemnification Escrow Amount or WC Escrow Amount and on any
such earnings in accordance with the Escrow Agreement).

 

9.6 _Third Party Claims_. If the Purchaser becomes aware of a third party
claim (a "Third Party Claim") which the Purchaser reasonably believes may
result in a claim for indemnification by a Purchaser Indemnified Party
pursuant to this _Article IX_ (except for claims with respect to
indemnification pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)(ix)_, which shall be governed by
_Section 8.2_), the Purchaser shall notify the Stockholder promptly of such
claim, and the Stockholder shall be entitled, at his expense, to participate
in, but not to determine or conduct, the defense of such Third Party Claim.
If there is a Third Party Claim that, if adversely determined, would give rise
to a right of recovery for Losses under the Agreement, then any amounts
incurred by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties in defense or settlement of such
Third Party Claim, regardless of the outcome of such claim, shall be deemed
Losses under the Agreement. The Purchaser shall have the right in its sole
discretion to conduct the defense of, and to settle, any such claim and the
Stockholder shall not have a right of approval or consent with respect to any
such Third Party Claim; _provided_ , that except with the consent of the
Stockholder (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), no settlement of any such Third Party Claim with third party
claimants shall be determinative of the amount of Losses relating to such
matter or otherwise admissible in any proceeding or used in any way to resolve
any dispute with respect to the amount of Losses.

 



70

    

If the Stockholder becomes aware of a third party claim (a "Company Third
Party Claim") which he reasonably believes may result in a claim for
indemnification by the Stockholder pursuant to this _Article IX,_ the
Stockholder shall notify the Purchaser promptly of such claim, and the
Stockholder shall be entitled, at his expense, to participate in, but not to
determine or conduct, the defense of such Company Third Party Claim. The
Purchaser shall have the right in its sole discretion to conduct the defense
of, and to settle, any such claim and the Stockholder shall not have a right
of approval or consent with respect to any such Company Third Party Claim;
_provided_ , that except with the consent of the Stockholder (such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), no settlement of any
such Company Third Party Claim with third party claimants shall be
determinative of the amount of Losses relating to such matter or otherwise
admissible in any proceeding or used in any way to resolve any dispute with
respect to the amount of Losses.

9.7 _Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. Any indemnification payments
pursuant to this _Article IX_ shall be treated as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price by the parties for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by
Law.

benefit of the Seller Parties are incapable of being satisfied on or before

provided in _Section 10.1_, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and
there shall be no Liability on the part of any party hereto, or their

condition, or a waiver of any other term or condition of this Agreement. No

singular number shall include the plural, and vice versa; (b) reference to
any gender includes each other gender; (c) reference to any agreement,
document or instrument means such agreement, document or instrument as amended
or modified and in effect from time to time in accordance with the
terms thereof; (d) "include" and "including," and variations thereof, shall
not be deemed to be terms of limitation, but rather shall be deemed to be
followed by the words "without limitation"; (e) all references in this
Agreement to "Schedules," "Sections," "Annexes" and "Exhibits" are intended to
refer to Schedules, Sections, Annexes and Exhibits to this Agreement, except
as otherwise indicated; (f) the table of contents and headings in this
Agreement are for convenience of reference only, shall not be deemed to be a
part of this Agreement, and shall not be referred to in connection with the
construction or interpretation of this Agreement; (g) "or" is used in the
inclusive sense of "and/or"; (h) with respect to the determination of any
period of time,

 



73

    

 "from" means "from and including" and "to" means "to but excluding"; (i)
"hereunder," "hereof," "hereto," and words of similar import shall be deemed
references to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular Article,
Section or other provision hereof; and (j) "shall" and "will" shall have the
same meaning hereunder.

 

11.4 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the parties and delivered to the other party, it being understood that all
parties need not sign the same counterpart. Until and unless each party
has received a counterpart hereof signed by the other party hereto, this
Agreement shall have no effect and no party shall have any right or obligation
hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or written agreement or other
communication). Any signature page delivered electronically or by facsimile
(including transmission by Portable Document Format or other fixed image form)
shall be binding to the same extent as an original signature page.

 

11.5 _Entire Agreement; Assignment_. This Agreement, the exhibits and annexes
hereto, the Disclosure Schedule, the other schedules, the NDA and the
Ancillary Agreements: (a) constitute the entire agreement among the parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements
and understandings both written and oral (including any letter of intent,
term sheet or related discussions), among the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof, and (b) shall not be assigned by operation of law or
otherwise, except that the Purchaser may assign its rights and delegate its
obligations hereunder (i) after the Closing, in connection with a sale of the
Purchaser or a sale of all or substantially all of its assets, (ii) to one or

11.6 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement or the application
thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement will continue
in full force and effect and the application of such provision to other
Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as reasonably to effect the
intent of the parties hereto. The parties further agree to replace such void
or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable
provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business
and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

 

11.7 _Other Remedies_. Except as otherwise set forth herein, any and all
remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative
with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or
equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not
preclude the exercise of any other remedy. Without prejudice to remedies at
law, the parties shall be entitled to specific performance or other equitable
relief, including injunctive relief, in the event of a breach or threatened
breach of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall any
Seller Party be entitled to, or to cause Purchaser to, seek the remedy of
specific performance of this Agreement against any Lender, solely in their
respective capacities as lenders or arrangers in connection with the Debt
Financing.

 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, (i) the
Company, the Stockholder and their respective subsidiaries, Affiliates,
directors, officers, employees, agents, partners, managers, members or
stockholders shall not have any rights or claims against any Lender, in any
way relating to this Agreement or any of the Transactions, or in respect of
any, or in respect of any oral representations made or alleged to have been
made in connection herewith or therewith, including any dispute arising out of
or relating in any way to the Financing Commitments or the performance thereof
or the financings contemplated thereby, whether at law or equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise and (ii) no Lender shall have any liability
(whether in contract, in tort or otherwise) to the Company, the Stockholder
and their respective subsidiaries, Affiliates, directors, officers,
employees, agents, partners, managers, members or stockholders for any
obligations or liabilities of any party hereto under this Agreement or for

 



74

    

 any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby or in respect of any oral representations made
or alleged to have been made in connection herewith or therewith, including
any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Financing Commitments
or the performance thereof or the financings contemplated thereby, whether at
law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise.

 

11.8 _Arbitration; Submission to Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process_.

 

(a) Except for a determination of the Final Working Capital Statement, the
Allocation Schedule, which shall be resolved exclusively by the Accountant
pursuant to _Section 2.3(b)(ii)_, and the Tax Adjustment Payment, which shall
be resolved exclusively pursuant to _Section 2.5(d)_, all disputes, claims,
or controversies arising out of or relating to the Agreement, the Ancillary
Agreements (other than as expressly set forth therein) or any other agreement
or document executed and delivered pursuant to the Agreement (other than as
expressly set forth therein) or the negotiation, breach, validity or
performance hereof and thereof or the Transactions, including claims of fraud
and including as well the determination of the scope or applicability of this
agreement to arbitrate, shall be resolved solely and exclusively by binding
arbitration administered by JAMS in New York, New York, before a single
arbitrator (the "Arbitrator"). Except as modified in this Section, the
arbitration shall be administered pursuant to JAMSs Comprehensive Rules and
Procedures. The parties further agree that this arbitration shall apply
equally to requests for temporary, preliminary or permanent injunctive relief,
except that in the case of temporary or preliminary injunctive relief any
party may proceed in court without prior arbitration for the purpose of
avoiding immediate and irreparable harm or to enforce its rights under
_Section 6.2_, _Section 6.12_ or _Section 6.16_.

 

(b) The parties covenant and agree that the arbitration hearing shall commence
within sixty (60) days of the date on which a written demand for arbitration
is filed by any party hereto (the "Filing Date"). The hearing shall be no more
than five (5) Business Days. In connection with the arbitration, the
Arbitrator shall have the power to order the production of documents by each
party and any third-party witnesses. In addition, each party may take up to
three (3) depositions as of right, with each deposition limited to eight (8)
hours, excluding breaks, and the Arbitrator may grant additional depositions
upon good cause shown. For purposes of determining the number of depositions
as of right, multiple petitioners or multiple respondents shall each
respectively be deemed one party. The Arbitrator shall not have the power to
order the answering of interrogatories or the response to requests for
admission. The Arbitrators award shall be made and delivered within sixty
(60) days of the closing of the evidentiary hearing on the merits (the
"Hearing") or within sixty (60) days of service of post-Hearing briefs, if
the arbitrator directs service of such briefs, shall be binding and final as
between the parties, and a judgment may be entered upon the award in any court
having jurisdiction thereof. The Arbitrators decision shall set forth a
reasoned basis for any award of damages or finding of liability. The parties
covenant and agree that the arbitration shall conclude within six (6) months
of the Filing Date, and the Arbitrator shall be provided notice of such six-
month limit (and agreed to abide by it) prior to his or her appointment as
Arbitrator.

 

(c) The parties shall maintain the confidential nature of the arbitration
proceeding and any award thereunder, including the Hearing, except as may be
necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, or
except as may be necessary in connection with a court application for a
preliminary remedy, a judicial challenge to an award or its enforcement, or
unless otherwise required by Law, judicial decision or applicable securities
laws or under applicable stock exchange rules.

(d) The parties will (i) bear their own attorneys fees, costs and expenses
in connection with the arbitration, and (ii) share equally in the fees and
expenses charged by the Arbitrator; _provided_ , that the prevailing party
shall be awarded its share of the Arbitrators fees and expenses and all
other costs and expenses, including attorneys, consultants and experts
fees; _provided_ , _further_ , that any party unsuccessfully refusing to
comply with the award or an order of the Arbitrator shall be liable for costs
and expenses, including attorneys, consultants and experts fees, incurred
by the other party in

 



75

    

 enforcing the award or order. If the Arbitrator determines a party to be the
prevailing party under circumstances where the prevailing party obtained
relief on some but not all of the claims and counterclaims, the Arbitrator
may award the prevailing party an appropriate percentage of the costs and
expenses incurred by the prevailing party.

 

(e) Subject in all cases to the foregoing, each of the parties hereto
irrevocably consents to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state or
federal courts located within New York, New York, in connection with any
matter based upon, arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the matters
contemplated herein, agrees that process may be served upon them in any
manner authorized by the laws of the State of New York for such Persons and
waives and covenants not to assert or plead any objection which they might
otherwise have to such jurisdiction, venue and such process. Each party agrees
not to commence any legal proceedings related hereto except in such courts.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, each
of the parties hereto agrees that it will not bring or support any person in
any action, suit, proceeding, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-
party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether
in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any Lender in any way relating
to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including, but not limited to, any dispute arising out of or relating in any
way to the Financing Commitments or the performance thereof or the financings
contemplated thereby, in any forum other than the federal and New York state
courts located in the Borough of Manhattan within the City of New York.

 

11.9 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the Laws
that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws
thereof; provided, that notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the parties
hereto agrees that except as specifically set forth in the Financing
Commitments, all claims or causes of action (whether at law, in equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise) against any of the Lenders in any way relating
to the Financing Commitments or the performance thereof or the financings
contemplated thereby, shall be exclusively governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the internal laws of the State of New York, without giving
effect to principles or rules or conflict of laws to the extent such
principles or rules would require or permit the application of laws of
another jurisdiction.

11.10 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY AND ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM
(WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY HERETO IN NEGOTIATION,
ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE OR ENFORCEMENT HEREOF (INCLUDING ANY LITIGATION
IN AGAINST ANY OF THE LENDERS IN ANY WAY RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED
TO, ANY DISPUTE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING IN ANY WAY TO THE FINANCING
COMMITMENTS OR THE PERFORMANCE THEREOF OR THE DEBT FINANCINGS CONTEMPLATED
THEREBY).

11.11 _Rules of Construction_. The parties hereto agree that they have been
represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement
and, therefore, waive the application of any Law, regulation, holding or rule
of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document
will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or document.

11.12 _No Third Party Beneficiary_. Notwithstanding anything contained in
this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement, expressed or
implied, is intended to confer on any Person other than the parties hereto or
their respective successors and assigns any rights, remedies, or Liabilities
under or by reason of this Agreement except that (i) _Article IX_ shall also
be for the benefit of the Indemnified Parties, (ii) _Section 6.11_, from and
after (and subject to the occurrence of) the Closing, shall be for the
benefit of the DandO Indemnified Parties, (iii) _Section 6.12_ shall also be
for the benefit of the Affiliates of the Purchaser (which shall include, from
and after the Closing, the Company), and (iv) _Section 11.15_ shall

 



76

    

 also be for the benefit of the Seller Law Firm. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Lenders shall be express third party beneficiaries with respect
to, and shall have the right to enforce their interests under, _Sections
10.3_ , _11.7_ , _11.8(f)_ , _11.9_ , _11.10_ , _11.12_ , and _11.16_.

11.13  _Tax Advice_. Other than as expressly set forth in this Agreement, no
party to this Agreement makes any representations or warranties to any other
party regarding the Tax treatment of the Transactions pursuant to this
Agreement or any of the Tax consequences to any other party of this Agreement
or the Transactions. Each party to this Agreement acknowledges that it is
relying solely on its own Tax advisors in connection with this Agreement and
the Transactions.

 

11.14 _Disclosure Schedule_. The Disclosure Schedule shall be arranged in
separate parts corresponding to the numbered and lettered sections and
subsections contained in this Agreement, and the information disclosed in any
numbered or lettered part shall be deemed to relate to and to qualify only the
particular representation or warranty of any Seller Party set forth in
the corresponding numbered or lettered section or subsection of this
Agreement, except to the extent that (a) such information is explicitly cross-
referenced in another part of the Disclosure Schedule, or (b) it is readily
apparent on the face of the disclosure (without reference to any document
referred to therein) that such information qualifies another representation
and warranty of any Seller Party in this Agreement. Nothing in the Disclosure
Schedule shall be deemed adequate to disclose an exception to a
representation or warranty of any Seller Party made in this Agreement, unless
the applicable part of the Disclosure Schedule identifies the exception with
reasonable particularity and describes the relevant facts in reasonable
detail. The mere listing of a document or other item in, or attachment of a
copy thereof to, the Disclosure Schedule will not be deemed adequate to
disclose an exception to a representation or warranty made in this Agreement
(unless the representation or warranty pertains directly to the existence of
the document or other item itself).

11.15 _Conflict Waiver; Attorney-Client Privilege_.

(a) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges and agrees, on its own behalf and
on behalf of its directors, members, managers, partners, officers, employees,
and Affiliates, that:

(i) Sherman Wells Sylvester and Stamelman LLP (the "Seller Law Firm") has acted
as counsel to the Seller Parties in connection with the negotiation,
preparation, execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Ancillary
Agreements, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby. The Purchaser agrees, and shall cause the Company, following the
Closing, to agree, that such representation and any prior representation of
the Company by the Seller Law Firm shall not preclude the Seller Law
Firm from serving as counsel to the Stockholder in connection with any
litigation, claim or obligation arising out of or relating to this Agreement,
the Ancillary Agreements, or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

 

(ii) The Purchaser shall not, and shall, after the Closing, cause the Company
not to, seek or have Seller Law Firm disqualified from any such
representation of the Stockholder based upon the prior representation of the
Company by Seller Law Firm. The Company hereby consents thereto and waives any
conflict of interest arising from such prior representation. Each of
the parties acknowledges that such consent and waiver is voluntary, that it
has been carefully considered, and that the parties have consulted with
counsel or have been advised they should do so in connection herewith. The
covenants, consent and waiver contained in this _Section 11.15_ shall not be
deemed exclusive of any other rights to which the Seller Law Firm is entitled
whether pursuant to Law, contract or otherwise.

 

(b) All communications between the Stockholder and the Seller Law Firm and any
pre-Closing communications between the Company and the Seller Law Firm, in
each case relating to the negotiation, preparation, execution, and delivery of
this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements, and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby (the "Privileged Communications") shall be
deemed to be attorney-client privileged and the expectation of client
confidence relating thereto shall

 belong solely to the Stockholder, and shall not pass to or be claimed by the
Purchaser or the Company. Accordingly, the Purchaser and the Company shall not
have access to any Privileged Communications or to the files of Seller Law
Firm relating to such engagement from and after Closing except as permitted by
the Stockholder. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, from and
after the Closing, (i) the Stockholder (and not the Purchaser or the Company)
shall be the sole holder of the attorney-client privilege with respect to such
engagement, and neither of the Purchaser or the Company shall be a holder
thereof, (ii) to the extent that files of Seller Law Firm in respect of such
engagement constitute property of the client, only the Stockholder (and not
the Purchaser or the Company) shall hold such property rights, and (iii)
Seller Law Firm shall have no duty whatsoever to reveal or disclose any
such Privileged Communications or files to the Purchaser or the Company by
reason of any attorney-client relationship between Seller Law Firm and the
Company or otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a
dispute arises between the Purchaser or its Affiliates (including the
Company), on the one hand, and a third party other than the Stockholder, on
the other hand, the Purchaser and its Affiliates (including the Company) may
assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure of confidential
communications to such third party; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither
Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates (including the Company) may waive such
privilege without the prior written consent of the Stockholder, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed. In the event that
the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including the Company) is legally
required by any judgment, writ, decree, compliance agreement, injunction,
order, award, or other legally binding determination of any Governmental
Entity, arbitrator or self-regulatory organization or otherwise legally
required to access or obtain a copy of all or a portion of the Privileged
Communications or such files, then the Purchaser shall promptly notify the
Stockholder in writing of such requirement and the Stockholder shall deliver
the required information within the time period required, _provided_ that the
Stockholder may seek a protective order with respect to such information.

(c) This Section is intended for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by,
Seller Law Firm. This Section shall be irrevocable, and no term of this
Section may be amended, waived or modified without the prior written consent
of Seller Law Firm.

 

11.16 _Lenders_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, except for the assertion by the Purchaser of its rights set forth
in the Financing Commitments, (a) neither the Purchaser, any Seller Party nor
any of their respective Affiliates, equityholders, members, officers,
directors, employees and representatives, nor any Person claiming by,
through or under any such Person, shall have any rights or claims against any
Lender in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the Transactions or in
respect of any oral representations made or alleged to have been made in
connection herewith or therewith, including any dispute arising out of or
relating in any way to the Financing Commitments or the performance thereof or
the Debt Financings contemplated thereby, whether at law or equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise and (b) no Lender shall have any liability
(whether in contract, in tort or otherwise) to the Purchaser, any Seller Party
or any of their respective Affiliates, equityholders, members, officers,
directors, employees and representatives, or any Person claiming by, through
or under any such Person for any obligations or liabilities of any party
hereto under this Agreement or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by
reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby or in respect of
any oral representations made or alleged to have been made in connection
herewith or therewith, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any
way to the Financing Commitments or the performance thereof or the financings
contemplated thereby, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise.
