  Exhibit A |  | Form of Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ ") dated as of November 2,
2014, among LABORATORY CORPORATION OF AMERICA HOLDINGS, a Delaware
corporation (" _Parent_ "), NEON MERGER SUB INC., a Delaware corporation and a
wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent (" _Sub_ "), and COVANCE INC., a
Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ ").

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of each of the Company and Sub has unanimously
approved and declared advisable and resolved to recommend to its respective
stockholders the adoption of, and the Board of Directors of Parent has
approved, this Agreement and the merger of Sub with and into the Company (the
" _Merger_ "), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, whereby each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Company (" _Company Common Stock_ "), other than
(a) shares of Company Common Stock directly owned by the Company, as treasury
stock, or by Parent or Sub, (b) shares of Company Common Stock owned directly
by any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company or of Parent (other than Sub),
(c) the Appraisal Shares and (d) shares of Rollover Restricted Stock (as
defined in Section 8.03), will be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration; and

 

WHEREAS, Parent, Sub and the Company desire to make certain representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Merger and also
to prescribe various conditions to the Merger.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, and subject
to the conditions set forth herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

_The Merger_

 

SECTION 1.01. _The Merger._ Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law
of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), Sub shall be merged with and into
the Company at the Effective Time. Following the Effective Time, the separate
corporate existence of Sub shall cease, and the Company shall continue as the
surviving corporation in the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") and as a
wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent.

 

SECTION 1.02. _Closing._ The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will
take place at 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the second business day
after satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by Law) waiver of all of the
conditions set forth in Article VI (other than those conditions that by their
terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or
(to the extent permitted by Law) waiver of those conditions), at the offices
of Cravath, Swaine and Moore LLP, Worldwide Plaza, 825 Eighth Avenue, New York,
New York 10019, unless another time, date or place is agreed to in writing by
Parent and the Company. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to in
this Agreement as the " _Closing Date_ ". SECTION 1.03. _Effective Time._ Subject to the provisions of this Agreement,
as promptly as practicable on the Closing Date, Parent, Sub and the Company
shall file a certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") in such
form as is required by, and executed and acknowledged in accordance with, the
relevant provisions of the DGCL and shall make all other filings and
recordings required under the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at such
date and time as the Certificate of Merger is filed with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the DGCL or at such
subsequent date and time as Parent and the Company shall agree and specify in
the Certificate of Merger. The date and time at which the Merger becomes
effective is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Effective Time_ ".

SECTION 1.04. _Effects of the Merger._ The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in applicable provisions of the DGCL and this Agreement. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time, all the rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the
Company and Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts,
liabilities and duties of the Company and Sub shall become the debts,
liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

 

SECTION 1.05. _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws._ The certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended at the
Effective Time to be the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Sub as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (except as to the name of the
Surviving Corporation, which shall be Covance Inc.) until thereafter changed
or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law. The form of such amended
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation is attached hereto
as Exhibit A.

 

SECTION 1.06. _Directors._ The directors of Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation until
their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified or
until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

 

SECTION 1.07. _Officers._ The officers of Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation, until
their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified or
until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

 

ARTICLE II

_Effect of the Merger on the Capital Stock of the_

_Constituent Corporations; Exchange Fund;_

 

 _Company Equity Awards_

 

SECTION 2.01. _Effect on Capital Stock._ At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Sub or
the holder of any shares of Company Common Stock or any shares of capital
stock of Parent or Sub:

(a) _Capital Stock of Sub._ Each share of capital stock of Sub issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 



2 (b) _Cancelation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock._ Each share of
Company Common Stock that is directly owned by the Company, as treasury
stock, or by Parent or Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall
be delivered in exchange therefor.

 

(c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock._ Each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (including
shares of Company Restricted Stock that become vested pursuant to Section
2.03(b), but excluding shares of Rollover Restricted Stock described in
Section 2.03(e), shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 2.01(b),
and, except as provided in Section 2.01(d), the Appraisal Shares) shall be
converted into the right to receive (i) $75.76 in cash, without interest (the
" _Cash Consideration_ "), and (ii) 0.2686 validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable shares of Parent Common Stock (the " _Stock Consideration_ "
and, together with the Cash Consideration, the " _Merger Consideration_ "). At
the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer
be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist,
and each holder of a certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented any such shares of Company Common Stock (each, a " _Certificate_
") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the Merger Consideration and any declared dividends with a record date
prior to the Effective Time that remain unpaid at the Effective Time and that
are due to such holder and cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable
pursuant to Section 2.02(i), without interest, in each case to be issued or
paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of the applicable Certificate
in accordance with Section 2.02(b).

(d) _Appraisal Rights._ Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, shares (the " _Appraisal Shares_ ") of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held
by any holder who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such
shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the provisions of
Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Section 262_") shall not be converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c), but
instead such holder shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such
shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262\. At the Effective
Time, the Appraisal Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of
Appraisal Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the right to receive any dividends in accordance with Section 2.02(c) and the
right to receive the fair value of such Appraisal Shares in accordance with
the provisions of Section 262\. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such
holder fails to perfect or otherwise waives, withdraws or loses the right to
appraisal under Section 262 or a court of competent jurisdiction determines
that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262, then
the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holders Appraisal
Shares under Section 262 shall cease and such Appraisal Shares shall be
deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time into, and shall have
become, the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section
2.01(c), without any interest thereon. The Company shall give prompt notice
to Parent of any demands for appraisal of any shares of

 



3  Company Common Stock, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments
served pursuant to the DGCL received by the Company, and Parent shall have the
right to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not,
without the prior written consent of Parent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed), voluntarily make any payment with respect
to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do or commit
to do any of the foregoing.

(e) _Adjustments to Merger Consideration._ The Merger Consideration and any
payment contemplated by Section 2.03 shall be adjusted to reflect
appropriately the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock
dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities of a
Subsidiary of the Company or of securities convertible into Company Common
Stock and any dividend or distribution of securities of a Subsidiary of Parent
or of securities convertible into Parent Common Stock), reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other
like change with respect to Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock with a
record date occurring on or after the date hereof and prior to the
Effective Time.

SECTION 2.02. _Exchange Fund._ (a) _Exchange Agent._ Prior to the Closing
Date, Parent shall appoint a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to
the Company to act as exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the
payment of the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Article II and, in
connection therewith, shall enter into an agreement with the Exchange Agent
in a form reasonably acceptable to the Company. At or prior to the Effective
Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
deposit, with the Exchange Agent (i) that number of whole uncertificated or
certificated shares representing the number of shares of Parent Common Stock
sufficient to pay the aggregate Stock Consideration pursuant to Section
2.01(c), (ii) cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate
Cash Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01(c) and (iii) cash in an amount
sufficient to make all requisite payments of cash in lieu of fractional shares
pursuant to Section 2.02(i). In addition, Parent shall deposit with the
Exchange Agent, as necessary from time to time on or after the Effective
Time, an amount in cash sufficient to pay any dividends or other distributions
payable pursuant to Section 2.02(c) or 2.02(j). The shares of Parent Common
Stock and cash deposited with the Exchange Agent are referred to in this
Agreement as the " _Exchange Fund_ ".

(b) _Exchange Procedures._ As promptly as practicable after the Effective
Time, but in any event within two business days thereafter, Parent shall cause
the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate (i) a
letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper
delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and which shall otherwise
be in customary form) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Each
holder of record of a Certificate shall, upon surrender to the Exchange Agent
of such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided
in Section 2.02(g)), together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed,
and such other customary documents as may reasonably be required by the
Exchange Agent, be entitled to receive in exchange therefor cash in the amount
equal to the Cash Consideration that such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to Section 2.01(c) and this Article II, that number of whole shares
of Parent Common Stock representing the Stock Consideration that such holder
has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.01(c) and this Article II,
cash in lieu of any fractional

 



4  shares of Parent Common Stock such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to
Section 2.02(i) and any dividends or other distributions such holder is
entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.02(c) or 2.02(j), and the
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock which is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, payment of the Merger Consideration may be
made to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so
surrendered is registered if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or
otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person requesting such
payment shall pay any fiduciary or surety bonds or any transfer or other
similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to
a person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to
the reasonable satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not
applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.02(b), each
Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive upon such surrender cash in the amount equal to the
Cash Consideration that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to
Section 2.01(c) and this Article II, that number of whole shares of Parent
Common Stock representing the Stock Consideration that such holder has the
right to receive pursuant to Section 2.01(c) and this Article II, cash in lieu
of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock such holder is entitled to
receive pursuant to Section 2.02(i) and any dividends or other distributions
such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.02(c) or 2.02(j). No
interest shall be paid or will accrue on any consideration payable to holders
of Certificates pursuant to the provisions of this Article II.

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock._ The Merger
Consideration, any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to
Section 2.02(j) and cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable pursuant to
Section 2.02(i) paid in accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be
deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the
shares of Company Common Stock canceled pursuant to Section 2.01(c) and any
related Certificates, _subject_ , _however_ , to the Surviving Corporations
obligation to pay all declared dividends with a record date prior to the
Effective Time that remain unpaid at the Effective Time. At the close of
business on the day on which the Effective Time occurs, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(d) _Termination of the Exchange Fund._ Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investment thereof) that remains undistributed
for six (6) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon
demand, and any holders of the Certificates who have not theretofore complied
with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent and the Surviving
Corporation for, and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall remain liable
for, payment of their claims for the Merger Consideration (and any dividends
or other distributions payable with respect thereto pursuant to Section
2.02(j) and cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable with respect
thereto pursuant to Section 2.02(i)), in each case without any interest
thereon, pursuant to the provisions of this Article II.

 

(e) _No Liability._ None of Parent, Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of
any shares of Parent Common Stock, cash, dividends or other distributions from
the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official in compliance with any
applicable state, Federal or other abandoned property, escheat or 

 



5  similar Law. If any Certificate has not been surrendered prior to the date
on which the related Merger Consideration (and any dividends or other
distributions payable with respect thereto pursuant to Section 2.02(j) and
cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable with respect thereto pursuant to
Section 2.02(i)) would escheat to or become the property of any Governmental
Entity, any such Merger Consideration (and any dividends or other
distributions payable with respect thereto pursuant to Section 2.02(j) and
cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable with respect thereto pursuant to
Section 2.02(i)) shall, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, immediately prior to such time become the property of Parent, free and
clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

 

(f) _Investment of Exchange Fund._ The Exchange Agent shall invest the cash in
the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that such
investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of
America or any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith
and credit of the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations
rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and
Poors Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank
repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital
exceeding $1,000,000,000 (based on the most recent financial statements of
such bank that are then publicly available) and, in any such case,
no instrument or investment shall have a maturity exceeding three months. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid solely
to Parent. To the extent there are losses with respect to such investments, or
the Exchange Fund diminishes for other reasons below the level required to
fully satisfy all of the payment obligations to be made in cash by the
Exchange Agent hereunder, Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to promptly replace or restore the cash in the Exchange Fund so
that the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient for
the Exchange Agent to fully satisfy such cash payment obligations. Nothing
contained herein and no investment losses resulting from investment of the
Exchange Fund shall diminish the rights of any former holder of Company Common
Stock or holder of Certificates to receive the Merger Consideration as
provided herein.

 

(g) _Lost Certificates._ If any Certificate has been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Parent, the posting by such person of a bond or surety in such reasonable
amount as Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, together with the submission of
a duly executed letter of transmittal and such other customary documents as
may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the Exchange Agent shall
deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
applicable Merger Consideration and any dividends or other distributions
payable with respect thereto pursuant to Section 2.02(j) and cash in lieu of
any fractional shares payable with respect thereto pursuant to Section
2.02(i) with respect thereto.

(h) _Withholding Rights._ Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
shares of Company Common Stock or Company Restricted Stock or any holder of a
Company Stock Option, Company RSU or Company Deferred Stock Unit, such
amounts as Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent are
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any
provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To

 



6  the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate
taxing authority by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock, a holder
of shares of Company Restricted Stock or a holder of the Company Stock Option,
Company RSU or Company Deferred Stock Unit, as the case may be, in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent.

(i) _No Fractional Shares._ No certificates or scrip representing fractional
shares or book-entry credit of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the
surrender for exchange of Certificates or upon the conversion of shares of
Company Common Stock, no dividends or other distributions of Parent shall
relate to such fractional share interests and such fractional share interests
shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a stockholder
of Parent. Each former holder of Company Common Stock who otherwise would
have been entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock shall
receive in lieu thereof cash (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (A) the fractional share interest to which
such holder (after taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock
formerly represented by all Certificates surrendered by such holder that)
would otherwise be entitled by (B) Average Parent Stock Price. The parties
hereto acknowledge that payment of the cash consideration in lieu of issuing
fractional shares is not separately bargained-for consideration but merely
represents a mechanical rounding off for purposes of avoiding the expense and
inconvenience to Parent that would otherwise be caused by the issuance of
fractional shares. " _Average Parent Stock Price_ " means the average of the
volume weighted averages of the trading prices of Parent Common Stock on the
New York Stock Exchange (as reported by Bloomberg L.P. or, if not reported
therein, in another authoritative source mutually selected by the parties) on
each of the ten (10) consecutive trading days ending on (and including) the
trading day that is three (3) trading days prior to the date of the Effective
Time.

(j) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares of Parent Common Stock._
No dividends or other distributions with respect to shares of Parent Common
Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder
of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent Common
Stock that the holder thereof has the right to receive upon the surrender
thereof, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 2.02(i), in each
case until the holder of such Certificate shall have surrendered such
Certificate in accordance with this Article II. Following the surrender of any
Certificate, there shall be paid to the record holder of the certificate
representing shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor,
without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of dividends
or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore
paid with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock and the amount of
any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of Parent Common Stock to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(i) and (ii) at the
appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with
a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a
payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such shares
of Parent Common Stock.

 



7 SECTION 2.03. _Company Equity Awards._ As soon as reasonably practicable
following the date of this Agreement, the Board of Directors of the Company
(or, if appropriate, any committee administering any Company Stock Plan) shall
adopt such resolutions and take such other actions as may be required to
provide that:

 

(a) at the Effective Time, each unexercised Company Stock Option that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not vested or
exercisable, shall be canceled, with the holder of such Company Stock Option
becoming entitled to receive an amount in cash equal to (i) the excess, if
any, of (A) the sum of (1) the Stock Consideration multiplied by the Average
Parent Stock Price plus (2) the Cash Consideration (such sum, the " _Per Share
Option Equivalent Amount_ ") over (B) the exercise price per share of Company
Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option, multiplied by (ii) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock that remain subject to such Company
Stock Option (each such amount, an " _Option Amount_ "); and the Option
Amounts shall be paid as promptly as practicable following, but in no event
later than ten business days after, the Effective Time, without interest, and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to make such payments in
accordance with the Companys payroll procedures; _provided_ , that any
Company Stock Option that has an exercise price per share of Company Common
Stock that is greater than or equal to the Per Share Option Equivalent Amount
shall be cancelled for no consideration;

 

(b) at the Effective Time, with respect to each award of Company Restricted
Stock (other than any award of Rollover Restricted Stock) that is then
outstanding, a number of shares of Company Restricted Stock equal to the sum
of (1) the number of shares of Company Restricted Stock that have been issued

Parent Stock Price, multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of Rollover
Restricted Stock that constitute such award of Rollover Restricted Stock,
rounded up to the nearest whole share, on the same terms and conditions as

prior to the Effective Time (each, a " _Substituted Restricted Stock_ "),
subject to the same terms and conditions (including vesting) as were
applicable to such award of Rollover Restricted Stock immediately prior to the
Effective Time;  _provided_ that, in the event that the foregoing treatment
of Rollover Restricted Stock would cause a vote of the stockholders of Parent
to be required under the rules and regulations of the New York Stock Exchange
in order for Parent and Sub to consummate the Transactions, then,
notwithstanding the foregoing, each award of Rollover Restricted Stock that is
outstanding at the Effective Time will be canceled in exchange for an award

Effect. The Company has made available to Parent prior to the execution of
this Agreement a true and complete copy of the Restated Certificate of
Incorporation of the Company (the " _Company Certificate of Incorporation_ ")
and the Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Company (the " _Company Bylaws_ ")

paid, nonassessable and not subject to preemptive rights, and are wholly
owned, directly or indirectly, by the Company free and clear of all pledges,

occupational pension scheme or otherwise become liable to pay any debt, or has
entered into an arrangement which might be construed as a compromise or a

discussions or negotiations with the person making such Takeover Proposal
regarding such Takeover Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company
(x) will not, and will not allow its Subsidiaries or its or their
Representatives to, disclose any non-public information to such person without
first entering into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with such person,
and (y) will concurrently provide (and in any event within 24 hours) to
Parent any non-public information concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries
to be provided to such other person which was not previously provided to
Parent.

 

The term " _Superior Proposal_ " means any unsolicited, bona fide Takeover
Proposal (with the percentages set forth in the definition thereof changed
from 15% to 50%) made in writing after the date of this Agreement that the
Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith is reasonably
likely to be consummated and that is on terms which the Board of Directors of
the Company determines in good faith, if consummated, would result in a
transaction more favorable to the stockholders of the Company from a financial
point of view than the Merger, taking into account all financial, legal,
regulatory, financing, certainty and timing of consummation and other aspects
of such proposal and of this Agreement (including any changes to the financial
and other terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent to the Company prior to
the expiration of the applicable periods referred to in Section 4.02(d) below
in response to such proposal or otherwise).

 



44 (d) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof
shall (i)(A) withdraw (or modify or qualify in a manner adverse to Parent),
or publicly propose to withdraw (or modify or qualify in a manner adverse to
Parent), the Company Board Recommendation or (B) recommend the approval or
adoption of, or approve or adopt, declare advisable or publicly propose to
recommend, approve, adopt or declare advisable, any Takeover Proposal (any
action described in this clause (i) being referred to as an " _Adverse
Recommendation Change_ ") or (ii) approve or recommend, or publicly propose
to approve or recommend, or cause or permit the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to execute or enter into any Acquisition Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else in this Agreement to the
contrary, at any time prior to (but not after) obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval and subject to compliance with Section 5.06(b) and this
Section 4.02, (x) the Board of Directors of the Company may effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change if the Board of Directors of the Company determines in
good faith after consultation with and receiving advice of its outside counsel
and financial advisor that the failure to effect such Adverse Recommendation
Change would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of
the Company under applicable Law or (y) the Company may terminate this
Agreement in accordance with Section 7.01(f) and concurrent with such
termination cause the Company to enter into an Acquisition Agreement
providing for a Superior Proposal (a " _Superior Proposal Termination_ ");
_provided_ , that no Adverse Recommendation Change or Superior Proposal
Termination may be made until after at least five business days following
Parents receipt of written notice from the Company advising Parent that the
Board of Directors of the Company intends to take such action and the basis
therefor, including in the case of an Adverse Recommendation Change not
related to a Superior Proposal the circumstances thereof. After providing such
notice and prior to effecting such Adverse Recommendation Change or Superior
Proposal Termination, (I) the Company shall, during such five business day
period, negotiate in good faith with Parent and its Representatives with
respect to any revisions to the terms of the transaction contemplated by this
Agreement proposed by Parent, (II) in determining whether to make an
Adverse Recommendation Change or effect a Superior Proposal Termination, the
Board of Directors of the Company shall take into account any changes to the
terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent and any other information provided
by Parent in response to such notice during such five business day period and
(III) following the end of such five business day period, the Board of
Directors of the Company or any committee thereof determines that the Superior
Proposal would continue to be a Superior Proposal or, in the case of an
Adverse Recommendation Change that does not involve a Superior Proposal, that
the failure to effect such Adverse Recommendation Change would continue to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company
under applicable Law. Any amendment to the financial terms or other material
terms of any Takeover Proposal will be deemed to be a new Takeover Proposal
for purposes of this Section 4.02(d), including with respect to the
notice period referred to in this Section 4.02(d), except that the five
business day period shall be two business days for such purposes.

 

(e) From the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, the Company
shall not terminate, amend, modify or waive any provision of
any confidentiality, "standstill" or similar agreement to which the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries is a party and shall enforce, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law, the provisions of any such agreement,
including by seeking injunctions to prevent any breaches of such agreements
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions thereof. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company shall be
permitted to fail to enforce any provision of any

 



45  confidentiality, "standstill" or similar obligation of any person if the
Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation
with and receiving advice from its outside legal counsel, that the failure to
take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the
Companys stockholders under applicable Law; _provided_ , that the Company
promptly advises Parent that it is taking such action and the identity of the
party or parties with respect to which it is taking such action; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the foregoing shall not restrict the Company from permitting
a person to orally request the waiver of a "standstill" or similar obligation
to the extent necessary to avoid violating fiduciary duties under applicable
Law.

(f) Nothing contained in this Section 4.02 or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prohibit the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to its stockholders
a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9, Rule 14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a) of
Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any
disclosure to its stockholders if the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith (after consultation with and receiving advice of its
outside counsel) that failure to do so would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties to stockholders under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_
, that (x) clause (ii) of this Section 4.02(f) shall not be deemed to permit
the Board of Directors of the Company to make an Adverse Recommendation Change
or take any of the actions referred to in clause (ii) of Section
4.02(d) except, in each case, to the extent permitted by Section 4.02(d) and
(y) in any disclosure made pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) of this Section
4.02(f) (other than any disclosure made in connection with an
Adverse Recommendation Change permitted by Section 4.02(d)), the Board of
Directors of the Company shall expressly publicly reaffirm the Company Board
Recommendation, and any failure to do so shall be deemed an Adverse
Recommendation Change for all purposes of this Agreement.

(g) The violation of any of the provisions of this Section 4.02 by any of the
Companys Subsidiaries or any of its or such Subsidiaries respective
Representatives shall constitute a breach of this Agreement by the Company.

 

ARTICLE V

_Additional Agreements_

SECTION 5.01. _Preparation of the Proxy Statement; Company Stockholders 
Meeting_. (a) As promptly as practicable after the execution of this
Agreement, (i) the Company shall prepare (with Parents reasonable
cooperation) and file with the SEC a proxy statement (such proxy statement, as
amended or supplemented from time to time, the " _Proxy Statement_ ") to be
sent to the stockholders of the Company relating to the meeting of the
Companys stockholders (the " _Company Stockholders  Meeting_") to be held to
consider adoption of this Agreement and (ii) Parent shall prepare (with the
Companys reasonable cooperation) and file with the SEC a registration
statement on Form S-4 (as amended or supplemented from time to time, the "
_Form S-4_"), in which the Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus,
in connection with the registration under the Securities Act of the Parent
Common Stock to be issued in the Merger. Each of Parent and the Company shall
use its reasonable best efforts to have the Form S-4 declared effective under
the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing (including by
responding to comments of the SEC). Prior to the effective date of the Form
S-4, the Company and Parent shall also use their respective reasonable best
efforts to

 



46  satisfy all necessary state securities Laws or "blue sky" notice
requirements in connection with the Merger and to consummate the Transactions
and will pay all expenses incident thereto. Each of Parent and the Company
shall furnish all information concerning such person and its Affiliates as may
be reasonably requested by the other and shall otherwise reasonably assist and
cooperate with the other in connection with any such action and the
preparation, filing and distribution of the Form S-4 and the Proxy Statement,
including the resolution of any comments in respect thereof received from the
SEC. As promptly as practicable after the Form S-4 shall have become
effective, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Proxy Statement to be mailed to its stockholders. No filing of, or amendment
or supplement to, the Form S-4 will be made by Parent, and no filing of, or
amendment or supplement to, the Proxy Statement will made by the Company, in
each case without providing the other party a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment thereon. If at any time prior to receipt of the Company
Stockholder Approval any information relating to the Company or Parent, or
any of their respective Affiliates, directors or officers, should be
discovered by the Company or Parent which is required to be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to either the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement, so
that either such document would not include any misstatement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the
extent required by Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company.
Parent shall notify the Company promptly of the time when the Form S-4 has
become effective or any supplement or amendment to the Form S-4 has been
filed, and of the issuance of any stop order or suspension of the
qualification of the Parent Common Stock issuable in connection with the
Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction. The Company and Parent shall
notify each other promptly of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or
the staff of the SEC and of any request by the SEC or the staff of the SEC
for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or the Form S-4 or for
additional information and shall supply each other with copies of all
correspondence between it or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and
the SEC or the staff of the SEC, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy
Statement, the Form S-4 or the Merger. The Company and Parent will cause the
Form S-4 to comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable
provisions of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.

(b) The Company shall, subject to applicable Law, the Company Certificate of
Incorporation, the Company Bylaws and the rules of New York Stock Exchange,
(i) as promptly as practicable (and in no event more than 45 days after the
Form S-4 becomes effective), establish a record date for, duly call and give
notice of the Company Stockholders Meeting, and (ii) as promptly as
practicable convene and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting and submit this
Agreement to its stockholders for adoption, for the purpose of obtaining the
Company Stockholder Approval. Subject to the ability of the Board of Directors
of the Company to make an Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to Section
4.02(d), the Company shall (i) make the Company Board Recommendation and
include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement and (ii) use reasonable
best efforts to obtain from its stockholders the Company Stockholder Approval
in favor of the adoption of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, if on a date preceding the date on which
or the date on which the Company Stockholders Meeting is scheduled, the
Company reasonably believes that (A) it is necessary to postpone or adjourn
the Company Stockholders Meeting to ensure that any

 



47  required supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to the
stockholders of the Company within a reasonable amount of time in advance of
the Companys Stockholders Meeting or (B) (1) it will not receive proxies
sufficient to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval, whether or not a quorum
is present or (2) it will not have sufficient shares of Company Common Stock
represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary
to conduct the business of the Company Stockholders Meeting, the Company may
postpone or adjourn, or make one or more successive postponements or
adjournments of, the Company Stockholders Meeting, as long as, in the case
of any postponement or adjournment under clause (B) of this sentence, the date
of the Company Stockholders Meeting is not postponed or adjourned more than
an aggregate of 15 calendar days. In the event that during the three business
days prior to the date that the Company Stockholders Meeting is then
scheduled to be held, the Company delivers a notice of an intent to make an
Adverse Recommendation Change or Superior Proposal Termination (including in
connection with an amendment pursuant to the last sentence of Section
4.02(d)), Parent may direct the Company to postpone the Company Stockholders
Meeting for up to three business days and the Company shall promptly, and
in any event no later than the next business day, postpone the Company
Stockholders Meeting in accordance with Parents direction, subject to the
Companys right to postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting for a longer
period pursuant to the preceding sentence.

(c) Notwithstanding any Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company shall
nonetheless submit this Agreement to the Companys stockholders for adoption
at the Company Stockholders Meeting unless this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with Article VII prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting.

 

SECTION 5.02. _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. (a) From and after the
date of this Agreement until the Effective Time and upon reasonable notice,
(i) the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, (A) provide to
Parent and Parents Representatives access at reasonable times to the
officers, employees, agents, properties, offices and other facilities of the
Company and its Subsidiaries and to the books and records thereof and (B)
furnish to Parent such information concerning the business, properties,
contracts, assets, liabilities, capital stock, personnel and other aspects
of the Company and its Subsidiaries as Parent or its Representatives may
reasonably request, and (ii) Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to, (A) provide to the Company and the Companys Representatives access at
reasonable times upon prior notice to the officers, employees, agents,
properties, offices and other facilities of Parent and its Subsidiaries and to
the books and records thereof (so long as such access does not unreasonably
interfere with the operations of Parent) and (B) furnish to the Company such
information concerning the business, properties, Contracts, assets,
liabilities, personnel and other aspects of Parent and its Subsidiaries as the
Company or its Representatives may reasonably request, in the case of the
foregoing clauses (A) and (B) to the extent reasonably related to the
prospective value of Parent Common Stock or to Parents ability to consummate
the Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that no investigation pursuant to
this Section 5.02 shall be deemed to modify any representation or warranty
made by the Company or Parent; _provided_ , _further_ , that neither Parent
nor the Company shall be required pursuant to this Section 5.02 to disclose
any information to the extent that (x) in the reasonable good faith judgment
of such party, any applicable Law requires such party or its Subsidiaries to
restrict or prohibit access to any such properties or information, (y) in the
reasonable good faith judgment of such party, the information is subject to
confidentiality obligations to a third party or (z) disclosure of any such

 



48  information or document would result in the loss of attorney-client
privilege; _provided_ , _further_ , that with respect to clauses (x) through
(z) of this Section 5.02, Parent or the Company, as applicable, shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to (I) obtain the required consent of any such
third party to provide such inspection or disclosure, (II) develop an
alternative to providing such information so as to address such matters that
is reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company and (III) in the case of
clauses (x) and (z), utilize the procedures of a joint defense agreement or
implement such other techniques if the parties determine that doing so would
reasonably permit the disclosure of such information without violating
applicable Law or jeopardizing such privilege.

 

(b) To the extent that any of the information or material furnished pursuant
to this Section 5.02 or otherwise in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement may include material subject to the attorney-client privilege, work
product doctrine or any other applicable privilege concerning pending or
threatened legal proceedings or governmental investigations, the parties
understand and agree that they have a commonality of interest with respect to
such matters and it is their desire, intention and mutual understanding that
the sharing of such material is not intended to, and shall not, waive or
diminish in any way the confidentiality of such material or its continued
protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other
applicable privilege. All such information that is entitled to protection
under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other
applicable privilege shall remain entitled to such protection under these
privileges, this Agreement, and under the joint defense doctrine. All
information obtained by the parties hereto pursuant to this Section
5.02 shall be kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality
Agreement.

SECTION 5.03. _Reasonable Best Efforts_. (a) Upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties hereto agrees
to use its reasonable best efforts to, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to use reasonable best efforts to, take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the
other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable,
the Transactions, including using reasonable best efforts to accomplish the
following: (i) the taking of all acts necessary to cause the conditions to
Closing to be satisfied as promptly as practicable, (ii) the taking of all
actions necessary to comply with all orders, decrees and requests imposed by
Governmental Entities in connection with the Transactions, (iii) the obtaining
of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents, authorizations,
orders and approvals from Governmental Entities and the making of all
necessary registrations, declarations and filings (including filings under the
HSR Act or foreign antitrust or competition Law) applicable to the
Transactions and other registrations, declarations and filings with, or
notices to, Governmental Entities, (iv) the obtaining of consents, approvals
and waivers from third parties reasonably requested by Parent to be obtained
in connection with the Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no
event shall any of the parties hereto or any of their respective Affiliates be
required to (and in no event shall the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
without Parents prior written approval) make any payment to such third
parties or concede anything of value in any case prior to the Effective Time
in order to obtain any such consent, approval or waiver from any such third
parties, (v) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments
necessary to consummate the Transactions and to fully carry out the purposes
of this Agreement and (vi) as promptly as reasonably practicable following the
receipt thereof, responding to any formal or informal request for additional 

 



49  information or documentary material received by the Company, Parent or any
of their respective Affiliates from any Governmental Entity in connection with
the Transactions. In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, each
of Parent and the Company and their respective Boards of Directors shall (A)
take all action necessary to ensure that no Takeover Law is or becomes
applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other Merger
Transactions and (B) if any Takeover Law becomes applicable to this Agreement,
the Merger or any of the other Merger Transactions, take all action necessary
to ensure that the Merger and the other Merger Transactions may
be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation
on this Agreement, the Merger and the other Merger Transactions. No party
hereto shall voluntarily extend any waiting period under the HSR Act or
foreign antitrust or competition Law (collectively, " _Antitrust Laws_ ") or
enter into any agreement with any Governmental Entity to delay or not to
consummate the Transactions except with the prior written consent of the
other parties hereto (such consents not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed
and which reasonableness shall be determined in light of each partys
obligation to use reasonable best efforts to do all things necessary, proper
or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner
practicable, the Transactions).

(b) The Company and its Subsidiaries shall reasonably cooperate with Parent,
to the extent the Company can reasonably do so without material disruption of
its ordinary course business operations consistent with past practice, in
determining a tax efficient way to distribute or otherwise transfer cash or
other assets from the Company Foreign Subsidiaries to the United States
following the Closing, including (i) determining the tax cost of such
transfers and the various alternatives for such distributions or transfers,
and (ii) preparing documentation in advance of the Closing in order to be
prepared to execute such transfers as promptly as practicable after the
Closing. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7.01, Parent
shall reimburse the Company for the Companys reasonable out-of-pocket costs
incurred under this Section 5.03(b).

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
nothing in this Agreement will require or obligate Parent or any of its
Affiliates to (and in no event shall any representation, warranty or covenant
of Parent contained in this Agreement be breached or deemed breached as a
result of the failure of Parent to): (i) agree to or otherwise become subject
to any limitations on (A) the right of Parent to control or operate its
business (including the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries after the
Effective Time) or assets (including the assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries after the Effective Time), or (B) the right of Parent to
exercise full rights of ownership of its business (including the business of
the Company and its Subsidiaries after the Effective Time) or assets
(including the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries after the Effective
Time), or (ii) agree or be required to sell or otherwise dispose of, hold
(through the establishment of a trust or otherwise), or divest itself of all
or any portion of the business, assets or operations of Parent or any of its
Affiliates or the business, assets or operations of the Company or its
Subsidiaries after the Effective Time (any such action referred to in clause
(i) or (ii), a " _Burdensome Condition_ "). Subject to the preceding
sentence, each of Parent and the Company shall defend through litigation on
the merits any claim asserted in court or administrative or other tribunal by
any Governmental Entity acting pursuant to applicable Antitrust Laws in order
to avoid entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any decree, order or
judgment (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that would prevent the

 



50  Closing prior to the Outside Date. With respect to any Governmental Entity
in connection with the Transactions, neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries
shall, without Parents prior written consent in Parents sole discretion,
discuss or commit to any divestiture transaction, or discuss or commit to
alter any of their businesses or commercial practices in any way, or otherwise
take or commit to take any action that limits Parents freedom of action with
respect to, or Parents ability to retain any of the businesses, product or
service lines or assets of, the Company or its Subsidiaries after the
Effective Time, or otherwise limits Parents ability to receive the full
benefits of this Agreement and the Transactions.

(d) Neither Parent nor the Company shall, nor shall it permit any of its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates to, acquire or agree to acquire any business,
person or division thereof, or otherwise acquire or agree to acquire any
assets, if the entering into of a definitive agreement relating to such
acquisition or the consummation of such acquisition would reasonably be
expected to result in (i) the failure to obtain or materially impair or delay
the obtaining of the expiration or termination of the waiting period in
respect of the Transactions under any applicable Law, (ii) the entry, the
commencement of litigation seeking the entry, or failure to effect the
dissolution, in each case, of any injunction, temporary restraining order or
other order that would prevent or materially impair or delay the consummation
of the Transactions or (iii) failure to obtain or materially impair or delay
the obtaining of all waivers, authorizations, consents, orders and approvals
of Governmental Entities necessary for the consummation of the Transactions.

(e) None of the parties to this Agreement shall agree to participate in any
substantive meeting, telephone call or discussion with any Governmental
Entity in respect of any filings, investigation (including any settlement of
the investigation), litigation or other inquiry unless it consults with the
other party in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental
Entity, gives the other parties the opportunity to attend and participate at
such meeting, telephone call or discussion. The parties to this Agreement
shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, provide each other with
copies of all correspondence, filings or communications between them or any
of their respective Representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental
Entity or members of its staff, on the other hand, with respect to this
Agreement and the Transactions;  _provided_ , _however_ , that materials may
be redacted (i) to remove references concerning the valuation of the Company
and its Subsidiaries; (ii) as necessary to comply with contractual
arrangements or applicable Laws; and (iii) as necessary to address reasonable
attorney-client or other privilege or confidentiality concerns.

SECTION 5.04.  _Benefit Plans_ _._ (a) Following the Effective Time and until
the first anniversary of the Closing Date, Parent shall provide, or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, the individuals who are employed
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately before the Effective
Time (the " _Company Employees_ ") and who continue employment during such
time period with (i) annual base compensation and annual target cash incentive
amounts that are no less in the aggregate than the annual base compensation
and annual target cash incentive amounts provided to such Company Employees
immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) severance benefits that are no
less favorable than the severance benefits provided to such Company Employees
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (iii) employee pension and welfare
benefits (excluding benefits under any defined benefit pension plan) that are
substantially comparable in the aggregate to the employee pension and welfare
benefits (excluding benefits under any defined benefit pension plan) provided
to such Company Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 



51 (b) No provision of this Agreement shall be construed (i) as a guarantee of
continued employment of any Company Employee, (ii) to prohibit Parent or the
Surviving Corporation from having the right to terminate the employment of any
Company Employee, (iii) to prevent the amendment, modification or termination
of any Company Benefit Plan after the Closing (in each case in accordance
with the terms of the applicable Company Benefit Plan) or (iv) as an amendment
or modification of the terms of any Company Benefit Plan.

 

(c) With respect to all plans maintained by Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or their respective Subsidiaries in which the Company Employees are eligible
to participate after the Closing Date (including any vacation, paid time-off
and severance plans, but excluding any plan frozen to new participants or any
defined benefit pension plan or any plan providing for post-retirement
medical benefits), for purposes of determining eligibility to participate,
level of benefits, vesting, each Company Employees service with the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries (as well as service with any predecessor employer
of the Company or any such Subsidiary, to the extent service with the
predecessor employer is recognized by the Company or such Subsidiary) shall be
treated as service with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, in each case, to the extent such service would have
been recognized by the Company or its Subsidiaries under analogous Company
Benefit Plans prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that such
service need not be recognized (i) to the extent that such recognition would
result in any duplication of benefits for the same period of service, (ii) for
purposes of determining eligibility to receive discretionary contributions
under Parents Employees Savings Plan and (iii) for determining eligibility
under the Parent ESPP.

(d) Without limiting the generality of Section 5.04(a), Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be waived any pre-existing
condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting
periods under any welfare benefit plan maintained by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries in which Company
Employees (and their eligible dependents) will be eligible to participate from
and after the Effective Time, except to the extent that such pre-existing
condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting
periods would not have been satisfied or waived under the comparable Company
Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall recognize,
or use commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be recognized, the dollar
amount of all co-payments, deductibles and similar expenses incurred by each
Company Employee (and his or her eligible dependents) during the calendar year
in which the Effective Time occurs for purposes of satisfying such years
deductible and co-payment limitations under the relevant welfare benefit plans
in which they will be eligible to participate from and after the Effective
Time.

 

(e) If requested by Parent at least five (5) business days prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall terminate any and all Company Benefit Plans
intended to qualify under Section 401(k) of the Code, effective not later than
the business day immediately preceding the Effective Time. In the event that
Parent requests that such 401(k) plan(s) be terminated, the Company
shall provide Parent with the evidence that such 401(k) plan(s) have been
terminated pursuant to resolution of the Board of Directors of the Company
(the form and substance of

 



52  which shall be subject to review and approval by Parent) not later than two
(2) business day(s) immediately preceding the Effective Time. To the extent
that such Company 401(k) plans are terminated, Parent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to permit the roll-over of participant account balances
under such 401(k) plans(s) to a benefit plan maintained by Parent intended to
qualify under Section 401(k) of the Code, in accordance with applicable law,
as soon as practicable following the Effective Time.

(f) For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, for purposes of any Company Benefit Plan set forth in Section
3.01(l)(vi) of the Company Disclosure Letter containing a definition of
"change in control" or "change of control", the Closing shall be deemed to
constitute a "change in control" or "change of control" (except as would
result in the imposition of "additional Taxes" under Code Section 409A).

 

(g) Prior to the Closing, (i) the Company and its Subsidiaries shall comply
with any Law or other legal requirement (whether statutory or pursuant to any
written agreement with, or the constitution of, any works council or other
employee body), to consult with any Company Employees, a relevant trade union,
works council or any other employee representatives in connection with
the Transactions and (ii) the Company and Parent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to provide any relevant, required information to, and
undertake any required consultation with, representatives of Company Employees
in a timely manner.

 

(h) Prior to Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall take all action
necessary to ensure the U.K. Pensions Regulator is notified of the Merger in
accordance with Section 69 of the U.K. Pensions Act 2004, and shall respond in
a timely manner to all requests of the U.K. Pensions Regulator, and shall keep
Parent advised of the status of such discussions and correspondence. 

(i) The provisions of this Section 5.04 are solely for the benefit of the
parties to this Agreement, and no other person (including any Company
Employee or any beneficiary or dependent thereof) shall be regarded for any
purpose as a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement, and no provision of
this Section 5.04 shall create such rights in any such persons.

 

SECTION 5.05. _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance._ (a) All rights to
indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and rights to advancement of
expenses relating thereto now existing in favor of any person who is or prior
to the Effective Time becomes, or has been at any time prior to the date
of this Agreement, a director, officer, employee or agent (including as a
fiduciary with respect to a Company Benefit Plan) of the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective predecessors as provided in the
Company Certificate of Incorporation, the Company Bylaws, the organizational
documents of any Subsidiary of the Company or any indemnification agreement
set forth in Section 5.05(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter, between a
director, officer, employee or agent (including as a fiduciary with respect
to a Company Benefit Plan) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (in each case, as in effect on the date
hereof) shall survive the Merger and shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect any right
thereunder of any such director, officer, employee or agent.

 



53 (b) Without limiting Section 5.05(a) or any rights of any director or officer
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
predecessors (each, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") pursuant to any
indemnification agreement, from and after the Effective Time, in the event of
any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (a
" _Claim_ "), whether civil, criminal or administrative, based in whole or in
part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact
that the Indemnified Party is or was a director (including in a capacity as a
member of any board committee) or officer of the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective predecessors or (ii) this Agreement or
any of the Transactions, whether in any case asserted or arising before or
after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, jointly
and severally, indemnify and hold harmless, as and to the fullest extent
permitted by Law, each such Indemnified Party against any losses,
claims, damages, liabilities, costs, expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any claim,
suit, proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified Party to the fullest
extent permitted by Law upon receipt of any undertaking required by
applicable Law), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement of or in
connection with any such threatened or actual Claim. None of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any
judgment in any threatened or actual Claim for which indemnification would
reasonably be expected to be sought by an Indemnified Party hereunder, unless
such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release
of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such Claim or
such Indemnified Party otherwise consents in writing to such settlement,
compromise or consent. Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cooperate
with an Indemnified Party in the defense of any matter for which such
Indemnified Party could seek indemnification hereunder. Parents and the
Surviving Corporations obligations under this Section 5.05(b) shall continue
in full force and effect for a period of six years from the Effective Time;
_provided_ , _however_ , that all rights to indemnification in respect of any
Claim asserted or made within such period shall continue until the final
disposition of such Claim.

 

(c) The Company may (or, at the request of Parent, shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to) obtain, at or prior to the Effective Time, prepaid (or
"tail") directors and officers liability insurance policies in respect of
acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time for six years
from the Effective Time, covering each Indemnified Party on terms with
respect to such coverage and amounts no less favorable than those of such
policies in effect on the date of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, without the prior written consent of Parent, the Company may not expend
therefor in excess of 300% of the amount (the " _Annual Amount_ ") paid by
the Company for coverage for the most recently completed 12-month period prior
to the date of this Agreement (such amount, equal to 300% of the annual
amount, the " _D andO Tail Premium Cap_"). In the event the Company does not
obtain such "tail" insurance policies, then, for a period of six years from
the Effective Time, Parent shall maintain in effect the Companys current
directors and officers liability insurance policies in respect of acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, covering each
Indemnified Party on terms with respect to such coverage and amounts no less
favorable than those of such policies in effect on the date of this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (i) Parent may substitute therefor policies of a
reputable and financially sound insurance company containing terms, including
with respect to coverage and amounts, no less favorable to any Indemnified
Party and (ii) in satisfying its obligation under this Section 5.05(c), Parent
shall not be obligated to pay for coverage for any 12-month period aggregate
premiums for insurance in excess of the DandO Tail Premium Cap, it being
understood and agreed that Parent shall nevertheless be obligated to provide
such coverage as may be obtained for the Annual Amount.

 



54 (d) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or a substantial
portion of its properties and other assets to any person, or if Parent
dissolves the Surviving Corporation, then, and in each such case, Parent shall
cause proper provision to be made so that the applicable successors and
assigns or transferees expressly assume the obligations set forth in this
Section 5.05.

(e) The provisions of this Section 5.05 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and will be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and his
or her representatives, and are in addition to, and not in substitution for,
any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such person may
have by Contract or otherwise. The obligations of the Parent and the
Surviving Corporation under this Section 5.05 will not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Party without
the written consent of such Indemnified Party.

 

SECTION 5.06. _Fees and Expenses_. (a) Except as provided in Sections 5.06(b),
5.06(c) and 5.08(b), all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring such fees
or expenses, whether or not the Transactions are consummated.

 

(b) In the event that:

(i) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 7.01(f);

(ii) (A) after the date of this Agreement, a Takeover Proposal shall have
been made to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, a Takeover Proposal shall
have been made directly to the stockholders of the Company generally, any
person shall have publicly announced an intention (whether or
not conditional) to make a Takeover Proposal or a Takeover Proposal shall
have otherwise become publicly known, (B) thereafter, this Agreement is
terminated (1) by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 7.01(b)(iii), (2)
by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 7.01(b)(i) (but only if the
Company Stockholders Meeting has not been held by the Outside Date) or (3) by
Parent pursuant to Section 7.01(c) due to the Company having breached or
failed to perform its covenants or agreements set forth in (I) Section 4.02
of this Agreement or (II) any other provision of this Agreement, but only, in
the case of clause (II), if the breach or failure to perform that gave rise to
Parents right of termination thereunder occurred when such Takeover Proposal
was pending and not withdrawn; _provided_ , _however_ , that for purposes of
the foregoing clause (II) a Takeover Proposal shall not be deemed to have
been "withdrawn" by a person if, within 12 months after any such termination,
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries enters into a definitive agreement
providing for, or the Company Board or the Company approves, recommends to its
stockholders or does not oppose, a Takeover Proposal made by or on behalf of
such person or any of its Affiliates or any such Takeover Proposal is
consummated, and (C) within 12 months after such termination, the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries enters into a definitive agreement to consummate or
consummates any Takeover Proposal; or

(iii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 7.01(e);

 



55 then, in each case, the Company shall pay Parent or its designee(s) an
aggregate fee equal to the Company Termination Fee by wire transfer of same-
day funds (1) in the case of a payment required by clause (i) above, on the
date of termination of this Agreement, (2) in the case of a payment required
by clause (ii) above, on the earlier of the date of entry into a definitive
agreement or the date of consummation referred to in clause (ii)(C) and (3) in
the case of a payment required by clause (iii) above, within three business
days of the date of termination of this Agreement, it being understood that
in no event shall the Company be required to pay the Company Termination Fee
on more than one occasion. For purposes of Section 5.06(b)(ii)(C) only, the
term "Takeover Proposal" shall have the meaning assigned to such term in
Section 4.02(a), except that all references to 15% therein shall be deemed to
be references to 50%.

 

(c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by (i) either Parent or the
Company pursuant to Section 7.01(b)(iii), (ii) either Parent or the Company
pursuant to Section 7.01(b)(i) (but only if the Company Stockholders Meeting
has not been held by the Outside Date), or (iii) by Parent pursuant to Section
7.01(c), then, in each case, the Company shall promptly, and in no event
later than two days after being notified of such by Parent, pay to Parent, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds, the Expense Reimbursement. As
used in this Agreement, " _Expense Reimbursement_ " means an amount equal to
all of the documented out-of-pocket expenses, including those of the Exchange
Agent and its Representatives, incurred by Parent or Sub in connection with
this Agreement and the Transactions up to a maximum of $30,000,000, in the
event such expenses are paid in connection with a termination pursuant to
Section 7.01(b)(iii) and $50,000,000 in all other cases. In the event any
Company Termination Fee is payable after the time the Company pays any
Expense Reimbursement pursuant to this Section 5.06(c), the amount of the
Company Termination Fee payable by the Company shall be reduced by such
Expense Reimbursement amount actually paid to Parent. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, the payment of the Company Termination Fee to Parent
or its designee(s) is Parent and Subs sole and exclusive remedy against the
Company and its Affiliates, and their respective stockholders and
Representatives, for any loss, cost, liability or expense relating to or
arising out of this Agreement, any agreement entered into in connection
herewith, or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

 

(d) If (i) the Company or Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section
7.01(b)(i) or Section 7.01(b)(ii) or (ii) the Company terminates this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01(d) because of a failure by Parent to comply
with its obligations under Section 5.03(c) and, in each of (i) and (ii), at
the time of such termination, any of the conditions set forth in Sections
6.01(b), 6.01(c) or 6.02(c) shall not have been satisfied, and, in addition,
in the case of a termination under Section 7.01(b)(ii), at the time of
termination, a Governmental Entity shall have enacted such Restraint with
respect to any Antitrust Law, and in each of (i) and (ii), at the time of such
termination, all other conditions to the Closing set forth in Sections 6.01,
6.02 and 6.03 shall have been satisfied or waived (other than
those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing but
which conditions would be satisfied or would be capable of being satisfied if
the Closing Date were the date of such termination), then Parent shall pay the
Company a termination fee equal to $305,000,000 (the " _Parent Termination
Fee_ ") by wire transfer of immediately available funds, concurrently with
such termination (in the case of a

 



56  termination by Parent) or within two business days of a request therefor by
the Company following such termination (in the case of a termination by the
Company). The Company agrees that in no event shall the Company be entitled
to receive more than one Parent Termination Fee. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, if the Parent Termination Fee is paid to the Company
or its designee(s) pursuant to this Section 5.06(d), payment of such Parent
Termination Fee is the Companys sole and exclusive remedy against Parent and
Sub and their Affiliates, and their respective stockholders and
Representatives, for any loss, cost, liability or expense relating to
or arising out of this Agreement, any agreement entered into in connection
herewith, or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

(e) The Company and Parent acknowledge and agree that the agreements
contained in this Section 5.06 are an integral part of the Transactions, and
that, without these agreements, the parties would not have entered into this
Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay any amount due
pursuant to Section 5.06(b) or 5.06(c), or Parent fails promptly to pay any
amount due pursuant to Section 5.06(d), and, in order to obtain such payment,
Parent or the Company commences a suit that results in a judgment against the
Company for the payment set forth in Section 5.06(b) or 5.06(c) or any portion
thereof, or a judgment against Parent for the amount set forth in Section
5.06(d) or any portion thereof, the Company shall pay to Parent, or Parent
shall pay to the Company, as applicable, the other partys costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such
suit, together with interest on the amount of such amount from the date such
payment was required to be made until the date of payment at the prime rate as
published in _The Wall Street Journal_ in effect on the date such payment was
required to be made.

 

SECTION 5.07. _Public Announcements._ The parties agree that the initial press
release to be issued with respect to the Transactions shall be in the form
heretofore agreed to by the parties. From the date of such announcement
through the Closing Date, and so long as this Agreement is in effect, none of
the Company, Parent or Sub shall issue or cause the publication of any
public press release or other public announcement concerning the Transactions
without the prior consultation and consent of the other parties hereto (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except as may be
required by applicable Law, court process or the rules and regulations of any
national securities exchange or national securities quotation system and
except for any matters referred to in Section 4.02.

 

SECTION 5.08. _Financing._ (a) (i) Each of Parent and Sub shall use reasonable
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause
to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable, to consummate and
obtain the Debt Financing on or prior to the Closing Date on the terms and
subject only to the conditions contained in the Debt Financing Commitment (or
with other terms and conditions agreed by Parent and the Financing Sources,
subject to the restrictions on amendments of the Debt Financing Commitment set
forth below), including using its reasonable best efforts to (A)
negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect to the Debt
Financing on the terms and subject only to the conditions contained in the
Debt Financing Commitment (or with other terms and conditions agreed by Parent
and the Financing Sources, subject to the restrictions on amendments of the
Debt Financing Commitment set forth below), (B) satisfy (or obtain the waiver
of), and cause its Affiliates to satisfy (or obtain the waiver of), on a
timely basis all conditions, and comply with all obligations applicable to
Parent or Sub, contained in the Debt Financing Commitment or the definitive

 



57  agreements related to the Debt Financing Commitment that are within the
control of the Parent or Sub or any of its or their Affiliates or (C) maintain
in effect the Debt Financing Commitment. If all conditions to the Debt
Financing have been satisfied and the conditions to Parents and Subs
obligation to consummate the Merger have been satisfied or (to the extent
permitted by Law) waived, each of Parent and Sub shall use their reasonable
best efforts to cause the financial institutions providing the Debt Financing
to fund the Debt Financing on the Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt and
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.08, Parent
acknowledges and agrees that its obligations to consummate the Transactions on
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein is not conditioned
upon the availability or consummation of the Debt Financing, the availability
of any replacement commitments or receipt of the proceeds therefrom, and its
obligations under this Agreement include its obligation to take such actions
as may be necessary to have at Closing the cash resources to consummate
the Transactions at the Closing.

(ii) Neither Parent nor Sub shall agree to or permit any amendment, supplement
or other modification of, or waive any of its rights under, the Debt
Financing Commitment without the Companys prior written consent that (A)
modifies or adds conditions or contingencies to the availability of the Debt
Financing relative to those contained in the Debt Financing Commitment in a
manner that would reasonably be expected to (x) materially delay the Closing
or materially impair the funding of the Debt Financing at the Closing or (y)
make the timely funding of the Debt Financing or satisfaction of the
conditions to obtaining the Debt Financing materially less likely to occur,
(B) would otherwise reasonably be expected to materially impair or materially
delay the funding of the Debt Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to
the Debt Financing) on the Closing Date or the Closing, (C) materially and
adversely impacts the ability of Parent or Sub to enforce its rights against
the other parties to the Debt Financing Commitment or the
definitive agreements related to the Debt Financing or (D) reduces the
aggregate amount of the Debt Financing set forth in the Debt Financing
Commitment, in each case as of the date of this Agreement (including by
changing the amount of fees to be paid or original issue discount) by an
amount that would reasonably be expected to materially delay the Closing or
materially impair the funding of the Debt Financing at the Closing; _provided_
, _however_ , that in the case of clause (D), to the extent that the
aggregate amount of the Debt Financing is reduced pursuant to the terms of the
Debt Financing Commitment by virtue of (1) obtaining alternative committed
financing, such alternative financing shall comply with the requirements set
forth in clauses (A)  (C) of this sentence, and (2) the funding of
alternative financing or obtaining proceeds from non-ordinary course asset
sales or other dispositions of property, or incurrence of debt or issuances
of equity, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, the proceeds
thereof in a segregated account and shall not use any such proceeds for any
purpose other than to satisfy Parents obligations under this Agreement at the
Closing;  _provided_ _further_ that notwithstanding clauses (A)  (D), Parent
or Sub may amend, restate, modify or supplement the Debt Financing Commitment
to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, underwriters, syndication
agents, lenders or similar entities that have not executed the Debt Financing
Commitment as of the date hereof, to provide for the assignment and
reallocation of a portion of the debt financing commitments contained therein
and to grant customary approval rights to such additional arrangers and other
entities in connection with such appointments, in each case, as expressly set
forth in the Debt Financing Commitment. Parent shall promptly deliver to the
Company copies of any amendment, modification or waiver to or under the Debt
Financing Commitment or the definitive agreements relating to the Debt
Financing.

 



58 (iii) Parent shall keep the Company informed on a current basis and in
reasonable detail of the status of the Debt Financing and provide to the
Company copies of the material definitive documents for the Debt Financing
(subject to customary redaction with respect to fees). Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Parent shall, promptly after obtaining knowledge
thereof, give the Company written notice of any (A) material breach or default
by any party to the Debt Financing Commitment and any definitive document
related to the Debt Financing, (B) actual or written threat of withdrawal,
repudiation or termination of the Debt Financing Commitment or the definitive
documents relating to the Debt Financing, (C) material dispute or disagreement
between or among any parties to the Debt Financing Commitment or any
definitive document related to the Debt Financing; _provided_ , that neither
Parent nor any of its Affiliates shall be under any obligation to disclose any
information that is subject to attorney client or similar privilege to the
extent such privilege is asserted in good faith or (D) occurrence of an event
or development that could reasonably be expected to adversely impact the
ability of Parent or Sub to obtain all or any portion of the Debt Financing
contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitment (or if at any time for any
other reason Parent or Sub believes that it will not be able to obtain all or
any portion of the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Financing
Commitment.

 

(iv) If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and
conditions contained in the Debt Financing Commitment, Parent and Sub shall
use their reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain in replacement
thereof, and negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect to,
alternative financing from alternative sources in an amount sufficient to
consummate the Transactions as promptly as practicable following the
occurrence of such event. Neither Parent nor Sub shall enter into such
replacement debt financing commitment without the consent of the Company if
(i) the terms of the new debt financing commitment, taken as a whole, are
materially less favorable to Parent than the existing Debt Financing
Commitment (taking into account any "market flex" provisions thereof) or (ii)
the terms thereof would be reasonably expected to materially impair or delay
the availability of the Debt Financing. Parent shall deliver to the Company
true and complete copies of all Contracts or other arrangements (including
Redacted Fee Letters) pursuant to which any such alternative source shall
have committed to provide any portion of the Debt Financing. For purposes of
this Section 5.08, references to the "Debt Financing" shall include the
financing contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitment as permitted to
be amended, modified or replaced by this Section 5.08 and references to the
"Debt Financing Commitment" shall include such documents as permitted to be
amended, modified or replaced by this Section 5.08.

 

(b) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall provide, and cause its
Subsidiaries to provide, and shall request that its Representatives provide,
to Parent and Sub, in each case at Parents sole expense, such cooperation as
is reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the arrangement of the
Debt Financing (or any replacement, amended, modified or alternative
financing permitted by this Section 5.08). Such cooperation shall include, at
the reasonable request of Parent made in a timely fashion:

(i) reasonable cooperation with customary marketing and diligence efforts of
Parent for all or any portion of the Debt Financing, including assistance in
preparation for and participation in a reasonable number of meetings,
presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions, drafting sessions and
sessions with rating agencies, in each case, upon reasonable notice and at
mutually agreeable dates and times;

 



59 (ii) providing reasonable assistance with the preparation of customary ratings
agency presentations, road show materials, bank information memoranda, bank
syndication materials, confidential information memoranda and similar
customary marketing materials (which may incorporate, by reference, periodic
and current reports filed by the Company with the SEC) in connection with the
marketing and syndication of Debt Financing (as set forth in the Debt
Financing Commitment as in effect on the date of this Agreement) or in
connection with a customary bank syndication process and offering of debt
securities of the type described in the Debt Financing Commitment;

(iii) using reasonable best efforts to furnish Parent, within a reasonable
amount of time following Parents reasonable request, with financial and other
information available to the Company relating to the Company and its
Subsidiaries to the extent required to consummate the Debt Financing in
accordance with the terms of the Debt Financing Commitment as in effect on the
date of this Agreement or in connection with a customary offering of debt
securities of the type described in the Debt Financing Commitment, and
providing reasonable assistance to the Parents preparation of pro forma
financial information and projections required to consummate the Debt
Financing in accordance with the terms of the Debt Financing Commitment as in
effect on the date of this Agreement or in connection with a customary
offering of debt securities of the type described in the Debt Financing
Commitment;

(iv) using reasonable best efforts to furnish Parent at least five business
days prior to the Closing Date, with all documentation and other information
reasonably requested by the financial institutions party to the Debt Financing
Commitment related to the Company and its Subsidiaries as and solely to the
extent required by any Governmental Entity with respect to the Debt Financing
under applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering rules and
regulations, including the PATRIOT Act; and

 

(v) requesting that the Companys independent accountants participate in
accounting due diligence sessions and cooperate with the Debt Financing (as
set forth in the Debt Financing Commitment as in effect on the date of this
Agreement) consistent with their customary practice, including requesting that
they provide customary comfort letters (including "negative
assurance" comfort) to the extent required in connection with the marketing
and syndication of the Debt Financing (as set forth in the Debt Financing
Commitment as in effect on the date of this Agreement) or as are customarily
required in an underwritten offering of debt securities;

(vi) arrange for a customary payoff letter (in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to Parent) to be delivered at or prior to Closing relating to the
payoff and termination of the Credit Agreement, duly executed by the
administrative agent, and setting forth all amounts necessary to be paid in
order to fully pay off all of the amounts outstanding under the Credit
Agreement, and providing that, upon such payment, such indebtedness will be
extinguished and all Liens relating thereto will be released (the " _Payoff
Letter_ "); and

 



60 (vii) unless the Existing Senior Notes are fully prepaid and retired at or
prior to the Effective Time, arrange for the delivery at or prior to the
Closing by each "Subsidiary Guarantor" under any "Subsidiary Guaranty" (as
such terms are defined in the Note Purchase Agreement) outstanding as of the
Closing of a written reaffirmation as required under Section 10.2(b)(2) of
the Note Purchase Agreement.

(c) Parent shall promptly, upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company
for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including
attorneys fees) incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and their
respective Representatives in connection with the Debt Financing, including
the cooperation of the Company and its Subsidiaries and Representatives
contemplated by this Section 5.08, and shall indemnify and hold harmless the
Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives from
and against any and all losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses suffered
or incurred by any of them in connection with the arrangement of the Debt
Financing and any information used in connection therewith, except with
respect to any historical financial statements provided by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries and except to the extent such losses, damages, claims,
costs or expenses arose out of or resulted from the fraud, willful misconduct,
gross negligence or intentional misrepresentation of any such indemnified
party. All information obtained by the parties hereto pursuant to this Section
5.08 shall be kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality
Agreement.

 

(d) The Company hereby consents to the use of its trademarks and logos in
connection with the marketing of the Debt Financing;  _provided_ , that such
trademarks and logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended to or
reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or the reputation or goodwill of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

SECTION 5.09. _Treatment of Existing Senior Notes._ (a) At Parents request
the Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, use its
reasonable best efforts to commence at Parents expense a tender offer to
purchase, and any related consent solicitation with respect to, the Existing
Senior Notes on such terms and conditions as specified by Parent and in
compliance with all applicable terms and conditions of the Note Purchase
Agreement (collectively, the " _Debt Offer_ "); provided that (i) Parent shall
have provided the Company with drafts and the final form of the offer to
purchase, related letter of transmittal and other related documents
(collectively, the " _Offer Documents_ "), (ii) the Debt Offer need not
commence prior to the later of (A) ten (10) business days after the date the
Form S-4 is filed with the SEC and (B) the date the staff of the SEC indicates
to Parent that it has no further comments to the Form S-4, (iii) the closing
of the Debt Offer shall be conditioned on the Closing and shall otherwise
comply with all applicable Laws and SEC rules and regulations. The terms and
conditions specified by Parent for the Debt Offer shall be only such terms and
conditions as are customarily included in offers to purchase debt securities
similar to the Existing Senior Notes and in similar situations and shall
otherwise be in compliance with all applicable Laws and the terms and
conditions of the Note Purchase Agreement. Nothing in this Section 5.09 or in
any other provision of this Agreement shall require the Company to purchase,
or accept for purchase, any Existing Senior

 



61  Notes tendered or otherwise submitted for payment prior to the Effective
Time. Parent and Sub shall, and shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts to cause their respective Representatives to, provide cooperation
reasonably requested by the Company in connection with the Debt Offer.

(b) Subject to Section 5.09(c) and Section 5.09(d), if requested by Parent,
in lieu of commencing a Debt Offer for the Existing Senior Notes (or in
addition thereto) pursuant to Section 5.09(a), the Company shall (i) use its
reasonable best efforts to seek the consent of the required number of holders
of the Existing Senior Notes to permit an optional redemption of the Existing
Senior Notes to be conditioned on the occurrence of the Closing and (ii) in
the event such consent is obtained, issue a timely notice of optional
redemption (the " _Redemption Notice_ ") ten days prior to the anticipated
Closing Date for all of the outstanding principal amount of the Existing
Senior Notes pursuant to the requisite provisions of the Note Purchase
Agreement, and shall redeem such Existing Senior Notes at the Closing in
accordance with the terms of the Note Purchase Agreement (the " _Debt
Redemption_ "). Parent and Sub shall, and shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts to cause their respective representatives to, provide
cooperation reasonably requested by the Company in connection with the Debt
Redemption.

 

(c) The Company shall, to the extent requested, keep Parent reasonably
informed regarding the status, results and timing of the Debt Offer. The
Offer Documents (including all amendments or supplements thereto) and all
mailings to the holders of the Existing Senior Notes in connection with the
Debt Offer shall be subject to the prior review of, and comment by, the
Company and its Representatives, and shall be reasonably acceptable to them.
If, at any time prior to the completion of the Debt Offer, the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, or Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, on
the other hand, becomes aware of any information that should be set forth in
an amendment or supplement to the Offer Documents, so that the Offer Documents
shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading, the party that discovers such information shall use reasonable
best efforts to promptly notify the other party, and an appropriate amendment
or supplement prepared by Parent describing such information shall be
disseminated by or on behalf of the Company or its Subsidiaries to the holders
of the Existing Senior Notes. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Section 5.09(c)), the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to, comply with the applicable requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange
Act and any other Law to the extent applicable in connection with the Debt
Offers, and such compliance will not be deemed a breach hereof (and, for the
avoidance of doubt, the Company shall not be required to effect the Debt Offer
in violation thereof).

 

(d) In connection with any Debt Offer, Parent may select one or more dealer
managers, information agents, depositaries and other agents, in each case as
shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company, to provide assistance in
connection therewith and the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to, enter into customary agreements with such parties so selected; provided
that neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to

anniversary of date of Agreement (the " _Outside Date_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 7.01(b)(i) shall not be available to any party if the failure of such

Company Stockholders Meeting, as adjourned or postponed from time to time;

(c) by Parent, if the Company shall have breached any of its representations

rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section 6.02(a) or 6.02(b) and
(ii) is incapable of being cured prior to the Outside Date; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Parent shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement

breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
hereunder;

(d) by the Company, if Parent or Sub shall have breached any of its
representations or warranties or failed to perform any of its covenants or
agreements set forth in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i)

_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not have the right to

then in material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants
or agreements hereunder;

 



66 (e) by Parent, in the event that (i) the Board of Directors of the Company

tender or exchange offer) that has not been withdrawn (provided that Parent
may make any such request only once in any 15-day period, which 15-day period
is exclusive of the five business day period by the end of which the Company
is required to reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation pursuant to this
clause (iii)); and

(f) by the Company, at any time prior to (but not after) obtaining the
Company Stockholder Approval if (i) the Board of Directors of the Company
authorizes the Company, subject to complying with the terms of Section 4.02,
to enter into an Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal,
(ii) concurrently with the termination of this Agreement the Company, subject
to complying with the terms of Section 4.02, enters into an Acquisition

Section 5.02(b), Section 5.06, the indemnification and reimbursement
obligations pursuant to Section 5.08(c) and Section 5.09(e), this Section 7.02

shall be the Companys sole and exclusive remedy against the Financing Sources
for any loss, cost, liability or expense relating to or arising out of this
Agreement, any agreement entered into in connection herewith, or
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby; _provided_ , _however_ that
(a) subject to Section 5.06, nothing herein shall relieve the Company, Parent
or Sub from liability for any willful and material breach of any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement (it being understood that the failure of Parent or the Company to
effect the Closing when required under the terms of the Agreement shall
constitute a willful and material breach), and the aggrieved party will be
entitled to all rights and remedies available at law or in equity, including
in the case of a breach by Parent or Sub, liability to the Company for
damages, determined taking into account all relevant factors including,
without duplication, the loss of the benefit of the Merger to the Company and
the lost stockholder premium and any benefit to Parent or its stockholders
arising from such breach and (b) the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive
such termination in accordance with its terms.

SECTION 7.03. _Amendment._ This Agreement may be amended by the parties
hereto at any time before or after receipt of the Company Stockholder
Approval; _provided_ , _however_ , that after such approval has been obtained,

and _provided_ _further_ that no amendment to Section 8.13 or this Section
7.03 that

 



67  in any way affects the rights of the Financing Sources shall be effective

amendments. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto.

any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties, (b) to the extent

warranties contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto or
(c) subject to the proviso to the first sentence of Section 7.03 and to the
extent permitted by Law, waive compliance with any of the agreements or
conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any party to this
Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall
not constitute a waiver of such rights.

integral part of the Transactions and without that right, neither the Company
nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement. It is accordingly agreed
that, the Company and Parent shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement without proof of
actual damages. The parties hereto further agree not to assert that a remedy
of specific enforcement by the Company or Parent is unenforceable, invalid,
contrary to Law or

 



77  inequitable for any reason, and not to assert that a remedy of monetary
damages would provide an adequate remedy or that the Company or Parent
otherwise have an adequate remedy at law. The parties hereto acknowledge and
agree that either the Company or Parent seeking an injunction or injunctions
to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this Section 8.10 shall

suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
Transactions in (i) the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or (ii) the
United States District Court located in the State of Delaware and waives any
claim that such suit or proceeding has been brought in an inconvenient forum.

or in any other manner provided in Law or in equity. Notwithstanding the

appellate courts thereof) and (II) solely for purposes of any such action,
cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim referred to in clause
(I), this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
internal laws and judicial decisions of the State of New York applicable to
agreements executed and performed entirely within such state, regardless of
the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts
of laws thereof.

RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE
AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (B) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS
CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVER, (C) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVER
VOLUNTARILY AND (D) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG
OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVER AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 8.11.

 



78 SECTION 8.12. _Severability._ If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Upon such determination that any
term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced,
the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so
as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law in an acceptable manner to the end
that the Transactions are fulfilled to the extent possible.

SECTION 8.13. _Provisions Related to the Financing Sources._ Notwithstanding
any provision of this Agreement, the Company agrees on its behalf and on
behalf of its Affiliates that neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates
shall have any claim or seek to enforce this Agreement against any Financing
Source or any lender participating in the Debt Financing, and that none of the
Financing Sources shall have any liability or obligation to Company or its
Affiliates relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
herein (including the Debt Financing). Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, (a) no amendment or modification to this Section
8.13 (or amendment or modification with respect to any related definitions
as they affect this Section 8.13) shall be effective without the prior
written consent of each Financing Source and (b) Section 7.02, Section 7.03,
Section 8.10, Section 8.11 and this Section 8.13 are intended to benefit and
may be enforced by the Financing Sources and shall be binding on all
successors and assigns of Company.
