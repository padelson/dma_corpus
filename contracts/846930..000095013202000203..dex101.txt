convey, assign, transfer and deliver, or cause to be sold, conveyed, assigned,

Liabilities, PSC shall pay to the Seller an amount of cash equal to Two Hundred
Five Million Dollars ($205,000,000) (subject to any adjustments to the Purchase
Price contemplated by this Article I, the "Purchase Price").

               (b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the
Purchase Price shall be determined as of Closing Date in accordance with the
following steps, subject to additional adjustment, post-Closing, pursuant to the
post-Closing procedures that are specifically contained in this Article I:

                    (i)   start with the Base Purchase Price, derived as
     follows: the "Base Purchase Price" shall mean the amount of $205,000,000,
     subject to reduction to the extent that any of the Excludable Operations
     (as defined in Section 1.3) are excluded from the transaction in accordance
     with the provisions of Section 1.3;

                    (ii)  adjust the Base Purchase Price in the manner
     contemplated by Section 1.4 and Exhibit 1.4, subject to all limitations on
     any such adjustments contained in Section 1.4 and Exhibit 1.4, and subject
     to any adjustments to the Target Amounts (as defined in Section 1.3)
     contemplated by Section 1.3, to determine the Adjusted Purchase Price (the
     "Adjusted Purchase Price"); and

                    (iii) further adjust the resulting Adjusted Purchase Price
     by the Working Capital Adjustment (as defined in Section 1.5), as
     contemplated by Section 1.5, subject to all limitations on any such
     adjustments contained in that Section 1.5 to determine the Final Purchase
     Price (the "Final Purchase Price").

          Section 1.3  Excludable Operations. In accordance with the following
procedure, the Base Purchase Price shall be reduced, as applicable.

               (a) The parties agree that the Seller may elect, by delivering a
written notice to the Buyer, no later than forty-five (45) calendar days from
the date hereof, to treat any of the following assets of the Company as Excluded
Assets (as defined in Section 6.3): (i) those assets of the Seller, Utility,
Development, Reynolds or any Company Subsidiary associated with or related to
the Company's operations in Hawaii (the "Hawaii Operations"), (ii) those assets
of the Seller, Utility, Development, Reynolds or any Company Subsidiary
associated with or related to the Company's operations in Connecticut and New
York (the "Northeast Operations"), (iii) those assets of the Seller, Utility,
Development, Reynolds or any Company Subsidiary associated with or related to
the Company's operations in New Jersey (the "New Jersey Operations"), or (iv)
those assets of the Seller, Utility, Development, Reynolds or any Company
Subsidiary associated with or related to the

                                        3

<PAGE>

Company's operations in Kentucky (the "Kentucky Operations"). Following any such
election, the Hawaii Operations and/or the Northeast Operations and/or the New
Jersey Operations and/or the Kentucky Operations, as the case may be, shall be
listed on Section 6.3 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule and shall be treated,
for all purposes under this Agreement, as Excluded Assets.

               (b) As used in this Agreement, the term "Excludable Operations"
means the Hawaii Operations, the Northeast Operations, the New Jersey Operations
and the Kentucky Operations. The Seller's election to treat any one or more of
the above referenced Excludable Operations as Excluded Assets will result in a
reduction to the Base Purchase Price equal to such amounts for such Excludable
Operations as PSC and the Seller may mutually agree.

               (c) In the event that the Seller elects to treat one or more of
the above-referenced Excludable Operations as Excluded Assets, then each of the
target amounts that are taken into consideration in determining the Adjusted
Purchase Price as contemplated by Section 1.4 (collectively, the "Target
Amounts"), including those in respect of Customer Connections (as defined in
Exhibit 1.4), Rate Base (as defined in Exhibit 1.4), ConOps Revenue (as defined
in Exhibit 1.4), and Rate Initiatives (as defined in Exhibit 1.4), shall be
reduced to the extent of and so as to reflect the effects of any election made
by the Seller to treat any of the Excluded Operations as Excluded Assets
pursuant to Section 1.3, as contemplated by Schedules 1.4(a), (b), (c) and (d)
of Exhibit 1.4. For example, the total target Rate Base is $240,000,000 and the
target Customer Connection number at October 31, 2003 is 145,615, as shown on
Schedule 1.4(b) and 1.4(a) of Exhibit 1.4, respectively. In the event that the
Hawaii Operations are elected by Seller to be treated as an Excluded Asset, then
the targets would need to be adjusted accordingly. Specifically, based on this
example, the total Rate Base target would be reduced by $6,925,000 consistent
with the amount attributable to the Hawaii Operations resulting in a revised
target Rate Base of $233,075,000 instead of $240,000,000. Similarly, assuming a
Closing on October 31, 2003, the total Customer Connection target would be
reduced by the 513 connections projected to be attributable to the Hawaii
Operations as of that date resulting in a revised Customer Connection target of
145,102 instead of the total 145,615. The new target numbers (reflecting the
exclusion of the Hawaii Operations) would then be used to determine the Adjusted
Purchase Price as contemplated by Section 1.4.

               (d) In the event that a Condemnation Proceeding results in a
governmental taking or settlement in lieu thereof of all or part of one or more
of the Company's Investor Owned Utility (IOU) systems, then the Target Amounts
shall be reduced to reflect the effects of any such governmental taking or
settlement in such manner as the parties may mutually agree or such amount as is
determined pursuant to this Section 1.3(d). No later than thirty (30) calendar
days following any such

                                        4

governmental taking or settlement, the Seller shall deliver to PSC the Seller's
proposed adjustments to the Target Amounts as a result of such government taking
or settlement. Following the delivery of such notice, if the Seller and PSC are
unable to agree within thirty (30) calendar days following PSC's receipt of the
Seller's proposed adjustment in respect thereof, the Seller and the Buyer shall
appoint a nationally recognized accounting firm mutually acceptable to each of
the Seller and the Buyer, which shall, at the Seller's and the Buyer's joint
expense, review the governmental taking or settlement and all adjustments to the
Target Amounts proposed in respect thereof and make a final determination with
respect to such adjustment within thirty (30) calendar days of such appointment.
The Seller and the Buyer agree to cooperate with such accounting firm and
provide it with such information as it reasonably requests to enable it to make
such determination. The finding of such accounting firm shall be binding on the
parties hereto.

          Section 1.4  Purchase Price Adjustment. The Base Purchase Price (as
adjusted by Section 1.3) shall be adjusted using the individual Target Amounts
as described in Exhibit 1.4 to establish the Adjusted Purchase Price, provided,
however, that in no event shall the sum of these Target Amounts in determining
the Adjusted Purchase Price pursuant to this Section 1.4 cause the Base Purchase
Price to be reduced by an amount greater than $25,000,000 or to be increased by
an amount greater than $10,000,000. For the avoidance of doubt, if the
cumulative adjustments resulting from this Section 1.4 would result in reducing
the Base Purchase Price by an amount that is greater than $25 million, the
Adjusted Purchase Price shall equal the Base Purchase Price less $25 million;
and if the cumulative adjustments contemplated by this Section 1.4 would result
in increasing the Base Purchase Price by an amount that is greater than $10
million, then the Adjusted Purchase Price shall equal the Base Purchase Price
plus $10 million. In addition, the Parties recognize and agree that the Working
Capital Adjustment contemplated by Section 1.5 is separate and apart from the
adjustments contemplated by this Section 1.4 and, as such, is neither increased
nor decreased or affected in any way by the limitations on adjustments contained
in this Section 1.4

               (a) At least ten (10) calendar days prior to the Closing Date,
the Seller shall prepare and deliver to the Buyer in good faith its estimate of
the Adjusted Purchase Price, if any (the "Estimated Adjusted Purchase Price")
showing the individual and cumulative effect of all adjustments contemplated by
this Section 1.4 for Buyer's review and comment. At the Closing, the Purchase
Price shall be adjusted to reflect the Estimated Adjusted Purchase Price,
subject to further adjustment post-Closing as contemplated by Section 1.4(b).

               (b) Within thirty (30) calendar days following the Closing Date
(or if on the Closing Date the Company shall not yet have received a Final Order
approving the Planned Rate Initiative (as defined in Exhibit 1.4) that is not
yet

                                        5

<PAGE>

filed on the date of this Agreement and that is budgeted to exceed 10% of the
Target Amount for Rate Initiatives, then within thirty (30) calendar days
following the date that such Final Order is received but in no event later than
April 10, 2004), the Seller shall prepare and deliver to the Buyer in good faith
a Final Closing Statement setting forth the Adjusted Purchase Price as finally
determined by the Seller in accordance with this Section 1.4 (the "Final Closing
Statement"). For purposes of the Final Closing Statement, the Planned Rate
Initiative that is not yet filed on the date of this Agreement and that is
budgeted to exceed 10% of the Target Amount for Rate Initiatives that has
received a Final Order after the Closing Date but prior to March 30, 2004 (a
"Post-Closing Rate Initiative") shall be treated for purposes of determining
"Adjustment #4 regarding Rate Initiatives" as contemplated on Exhibit 1.4 as if
such Planned Rate Initiative had occurred prior to Closing. Within fifteen (15)
calendar days following the Buyer's receipt of the Final Closing Statement, the
Buyer may object in good faith to the Adjusted Purchase Price in writing. In the
event of any such objection, the Buyer and the Seller shall attempt to resolve
their differences by negotiation. If such parties are unable to do so within
thirty (30) calendar days following Seller's receipt of the Buyer's objection,
the Seller and the Buyer shall appoint a nationally recognized accounting firm
mutually acceptable to each of the Seller and the Buyer, which shall, at the
Seller's and the Buyer's joint expense, review the Final Closing Statement and
determine the Adjusted Purchase Price within thirty (30) calendar days of such
appointment. The Seller and the Buyer agree to cooperate with such accounting
firm and provide it with such information as it reasonably requests to enable it
to make such determination. The finding of such accounting firm shall be binding
on the parties hereto. Upon determination by agreement of the Seller and the
Buyer or by binding determination of said accounting firm of the Adjusted
Purchase Price, (i) if the Adjusted Purchase Price exceeds the Estimated
Adjusted Purchase Price (such excess amount, the "Deficiency"), the Buyer shall
pay to the Seller the Deficiency, or (ii) if the Estimated Adjusted Purchase
Price exceeds the Adjusted Purchase Price (such excess amount, the "Excess"),
the Seller shall pay to the Buyer the Excess. Any portion of any Deficiency or
Excess owed hereunder shall be paid to the Party or Parties owed the same by the
Party or Parties owing the same by wire transfer in immediately available funds
to an account designated by the Party or Parties owed the same no later than
five (5) business days following the determination by agreement of the Seller
and the Buyer or by binding determination of said accounting firm of the
Adjusted Purchase Price, and such excess or deficiency payment shall be
accompanied by an additional payment of interest, calculated with a 4% annual
interest rate from the date of Closing to the date of payment under this
provision (except that any amount payable resulting from the Post-Closing Rate
Initiative shall be disregarded for purposes of calculating such interest
payment).

          Section 1.5  Working Capital Adjustment. The Adjusted Purchase Price
shall be adjusted to determine the Final Purchase Price, as contemplated by this

                                        6

<PAGE>

Section 1.5, provided, however, that in no event, shall the increase in the
Adjusted Purchase Price resulting from any adjustment contemplated by this
Section 1.5 exceed the amount of $10,000,000, and provided, further, that for
the purposes of calculating current assets as contemplated by Section 1.5(a),
the Company's unbilled revenues entitled to be considered in any such
calculation shall not exceed the amount of $3,000,000. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Buyer shall waive the foregoing cap on unbilled revenues if, and
to the extent that, the Seller has been impacted by documented billing delays
that have prohibited certain unbilled revenues from being billed to customers in
a timely fashion consistent with past practice.

               (a) The Adjusted Purchase Price shall be adjusted by an amount of
dollars, positive or negative, as the case may be, equal to the net amount of
(i) the aggregate amount of the current liabilities of the Company (incurred in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice), including, but
not limited to, accounts payable owed by the Company to any unaffiliated third
party as of the Closing Date, excluding any accrued Taxes that are to be paid by
the Seller pursuant to this Agreement, and (ii) the aggregate amount of current
assets of the Company (incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice), including, but not limited to, accounts receivable owed by
any unaffiliated third party as of the Closing Date, but excluding any monies
held in escrow pursuant to Section 7.16 (such net amount, the "Working Capital
Adjustment"). At least ten (10) calendar days prior to the Closing Date, the
Seller shall prepare and deliver to the Buyer in good faith its estimate of the
Working Capital Adjustment, if any (the "Estimated Working Capital Adjustment")
showing the individual and cumulative effect of all adjustments contemplated by
this Section 1.5 for Buyer's review and comment. At the Closing, the Adjusted
Purchase Price shall be adjusted to reflect the Estimated Working Capital
Adjustment, subject to further adjustment post-Closing as contemplated by
Section 1.5(b).

               (b) Within thirty (30) calendar days following the Closing Date,
the Seller shall prepare and deliver to the Buyer in good faith a final closing
statement setting forth the Working Capital Adjustment in accordance with this
Section (the "Final Working Capital Closing Statement"). Within thirty (30)
calendar days following the Buyer's receipt of the Final Working Capital Closing
Statement, the Buyer may object in good faith to the Working Capital Adjustment
in writing. In the event of any such objection, the Buyer and the Seller shall
attempt to resolve their differences by negotiation. If such parties are unable
to do so within thirty (30) calendar days following Seller's receipt of the
Buyer's objection, the Seller and the Buyer shall appoint a nationally
recognized accounting firm mutually acceptable to each of the Seller and the
Buyer, which shall, at the Seller's and the Buyer's joint expense, review the
Final Working Capital Closing Statement and determine the Working Capital
Adjustment, if any, within thirty (30) calendar days

                                        7

of such appointment. The Seller and the Buyer agree to cooperate with such
accounting firm and provide it with such information as it reasonably requests
to enable it to make such determination. The finding of such accounting firm
shall be binding on the parties hereto. Upon determination by agreement of the
Seller and the Buyer or by binding determination of said accounting firm of the
Working Capital Adjustment, (i) if the Working Capital Adjustment exceeds the
Estimated Working Capital Adjustment (such excess amount, the "Working Capital
Deficiency"), the Buyer shall pay to the Seller the Working Capital Deficiency,
or (ii) if the Estimated Working Capital Adjustment exceeds the Working Capital
Adjustment (such excess amount, the "Working Capital Excess"), the Seller shall
pay to the Buyer the Working Capital Excess. Any portion of any Working Capital
Deficiency or Working Capital Excess owed hereunder shall be paid to the Party
or Parties owed the same by the Party or Parties owing the same by wire transfer
in immediately available funds to an account designated by the Party or Parties
owed the same no later than five (5) business days following the determination
by agreement of the Seller and the Buyer or by binding determination of said
accounting firm of the Working Capital Adjustment, and such payment shall be
accompanied by an additional payment of interest, calculated with a 4% annual
interest rate from the date of Closing to the date of payment under this
provision.

records of the Company, comply in all material respects with applicable
accounting requirements, have been prepared in accordance with United States
generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") applied on a consistent basis
during the period involved (except as may be stated in the notes thereto) and

Financial Statements, the Company has no liabilities or obligations of any
nature whatsoever (whether known, unknown, absolute, accrued, contingent or
otherwise) which are not fully reflected or reserved against in such Company

consistent with past practice and this Agreement and are, therefore, not
required by GAAP to be so reflected or reserved against in such Company
Financial Statements. As used in this Agreement, the term "Company Financial
Statements" shall mean the consolidated balance sheet of the Company as at
December 31, 2001 (the "December 31, 2001 Balance Sheet") and as at June 30,

to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

meaning of Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974,
as amended ("ERISA")), in each case, that is sponsored, maintained or
contributed to or required to be contributed to by the Company, the Seller, DQE

or Section 414 of the Code or to which the Company, the Seller, DQE or an ERISA

any indemnification agreement.

     potentially in violation of any applicable Environmental Law or otherwise
     may be liable under any applicable Environmental Law, which violation or
     liability is unresolved or unlikely to be resolved in the ordinary course
     of business and the failure to resolve such violation in the ordinary
     course of business is having as of the date hereof, or is reasonably likely
     to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

     to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

                    (v)   None of the real property currently owned, occupied,

Reynolds, and the Company Subsidiaries, have good and marketable title to all of

of the property affected thereby or which would not have a Company Material
Adverse Effect; and, to the knowledge of the Seller, all leases pursuant to
which the Seller, Utility, Development or Reynolds, or any Company Subsidiary,
lease from others material amounts of real or personal property are in good
standing, valid and effective in accordance with their respective terms and
there is not, to the knowledge of the Seller, under any of such leases, any
existing default or event of default (or event which with notice or lapse of
time, or both, would constitute a default), except when the lack of such good
standing, validity and effectiveness or the existence of such default would not
have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

               (a) Except as set forth in Section 3.18(a) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule, to the Seller's knowledge, neither the Seller (in respect

have been fully performed or satisfied, have expired or are otherwise no longer
in effect and binding and except for those that are not likely to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

               (b) Except as set forth in Section 3.18(b) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule, to the Seller's knowledge, neither the Seller (in respect
of the Company), Utility, Development, Reynolds nor any Company Subsidiary has

federal and state drinking water standards except for such failures which are
not having as of the date hereof, and are not reasonably likely to have, a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

the representations and warranties contained in this Article III, neither the

                                       28

<PAGE>

designated on such Section of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, by agreement of
the Parties, as Excepted Liabilities.

          Section 4.3 Limitations on Indemnification.

               (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, the Parties' obligations pursuant to this Article IV are, and at all
times shall be, subject to the limitations set forth in this Section 4.3. The
Parties shall not be required to indemnify, defend or hold harmless any Buyer
Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee, as the case may be, until the aggregate amount
of the Buyer Indemnifiable Losses or Seller Indemnifiable Losses, as the case
may be, exceeds the Indemnity Basket (as defined in Section 4.3(b)), following
which the indemnifying Party shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Buyer
Indemnitees or the Seller Indemnitees, as the case may be, only to the extent
that the Buyer Indemnifiable Losses or the Seller Indemnifiable Losses, as the
case may be, exceed the Indemnity Basket. In addition, the Seller's and DQE's
liability, taken together, for Buyer Indemnifiable Losses and the Buyer's
liability for Seller Indemnifiable Losses, in either case, as contemplated by
this Article IV shall in no event exceed an aggregate amount of dollars equal to
the Indemnity Cap (as defined in Section 4.3(b)); provided, however, that in
determining whether the Seller's and DQE's liability for a particular Buyer
Indemnifiable Loss or the Buyer's liability for a particular Seller
Indemnifiable Loss, in either case, pursuant to this Article IV is limited by
the Indemnity Cap, the Parties shall refer to the Indemnity Cap that is or was
in effect on the date that the Buyer Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee, as the
case may be, delivered a written notice of such Buyer Indemnifiable Loss or
Seller Indemnifiable Loss, as the case may be, to the Seller as contemplated by
Section 4.4 hereof.

               (b) As used in this Agreement, (i) the term "Indemnity Basket"
shall mean $250,000, and (ii) the term "Indemnity Cap" shall mean $15,000,000;
provided, however, that on the first (1st) anniversary of the Closing Date, the
Indemnity Cap shall be reduced to, and shall thereafter mean, $7,500,000; and
provided further, that on the second (2nd) anniversary of the Closing Date, the
Indemnity Cap shall be reduced to, and shall thereafter mean, zero, unless the
Indemnity Period has been extended until the third (3rd) anniversary of the
Closing Date, pursuant to Section 4.2(a), in which case the Indemnity Cap shall
continue to mean $7,500,000 until the third (3rd) anniversary of the Closing
Date, upon which it shall be reduced to, and shall thereafter mean, zero.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the
Seller's and DQE's liability for the following Buyer Indemnifiable Losses shall
not be limited by the Indemnity Cap: Buyer Indemnifiable Losses relating to (i)
any litigation, existing or threatened, that is required to be set forth in
Sections 3.7, 3.8(a), 3.8(b), 3.9(i) or 3.10 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule,
(ii) Excluded Assets, (iii) any and all liabilities and obligations of the
Seller or the Subsidiaries of the Seller (other than any liabilities or
obligations

                                       29

<PAGE>

of the Seller (in respect of the Company), Utility, Development, Reynolds or any
Company Subsidiary or any of the Integrated Assets or Integrated Liabilities),
(iv) indemnity obligations of the Parties in respect of Taxes, as set forth in
Section 4.5, (v) indemnity obligations of the Seller and DQE in respect of
certain litigation as set forth in Section 4.6, (vi) indemnity obligations of
the Seller and DQE in respect of Environmental Law, as set forth in Section 4.7,
and (vii) any fraud committed by DQE, the Seller, the Company or any Company
Subsidiary (provided that the foregoing reference to the Company or any Company
Subsidiary refers to fraud committed prior to the Closing Date); in addition,
the Buyer's liability for the following Seller Indemnifiable Losses shall not be
limited by the Indemnity Cap: Seller Indemnifiable Losses relating to (i)
indemnity obligations of the Parties in respect of Taxes, as set forth in
Section 4.5, (ii) any breach or violation of any Environmental Law by PSC,
Acquisition, any Buyer Subsidiary designated by PSC pursuant to Section 1.1, the
Company or any Company Subsidiary on or after the Closing Date, and (iii) any
fraud committed by PSC, Acquisition, any Buyer Subsidiary designated by PSC
pursuant to Section 1.1, the Company or any Company Subsidiary (provided that
the foregoing reference to the Company or any Company Subsidiary refers to fraud
committed on or after the Closing Date).

               (c) For the avoidance of doubt, if at any time during the
Indemnity Period, the amount of the Seller's and DQE's aggregate liability for
Buyer Indemnifiable Losses, taking into account all liability for Buyer
Indemnifiable Losses incurred by the Seller and DQE since the Closing Date
(other than those Buyer Indemnifiable Losses that are not limited by the
Indemnity Cap as contemplated by Section 4.3(b)), equals the applicable
Indemnity Cap, then the Seller shall have no further obligation whatsoever to
indemnify, defend or hold harmless any Buyer Indemnitee in respect of any Buyer
Indemnifiable Losses that are subject to the Indemnity Cap; similarly, if at any
time during the Indemnity Period, the amount of PSC's aggregate liability for
Seller Indemnifiable Losses, taking into account all liability for Seller
Indemnifiable Losses incurred by PSC since the Closing Date (other than those
Seller Indemnifiable Losses that are not limited by the Indemnity Cap as
contemplated by Section 4.3(b)), equals the applicable Indemnity Cap, then PSC
shall have no further obligation whatsoever to indemnify, defend or hold
harmless any Seller Indemnitee in respect of any Seller Indemnifiable Losses
that are subject to the Indemnity Cap.

               (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, any Buyer Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to mitigate all losses, damages and the like relating to a
claim under these indemnification provisions, including availing itself of any
defenses, limitations, rights of contribution, claims against third Persons and
other rights at law or equity. The Buyer Indemnitee's or Seller Indemnitee's, as
the case may be, commercially reasonable efforts shall include the reasonable
expenditure of money

                                       30

<PAGE>

to mitigate or otherwise reduce or eliminate any loss or expenses for which
indemnification would otherwise be due, and the indemnifying Party shall, to the
extent that Buyer Indemnifiable Losses or Seller Indemnifiable Losses, as the
case may be, exceed the Indemnity Basket, reimburse the Buyer Indemnitee or
Seller Indemnitee, as the case may be, for its reasonable expenditures (except
for any portion of the wages, salary, benefits, overhead or other costs
attributable to Buyer Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee, as the case may be, and
its officers, directors, employees and agents) in undertaking the mitigation and
shall, to such extent, take such expenses into account in calculating the
aggregate amount of the Seller's and DQE's liability for the Buyer Indemnifiable
Losses or the Buyer liability for the Seller Indemnifiable Losses, as the case
may be. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
any Buyer Indemnifiable Loss or Seller Indemnifiable Loss shall be net of (i)
the dollar amount of any insurance or other proceeds actually received by the
Buyer Indemnitee or any of its affiliates with respect to the Buyer
Indemnifiable Loss or by the Seller or DQE or any of their affiliates with
respect to the Seller Indemnifiable Loss, and (ii) income tax benefits to the
Buyer Indemnitee, to the extent realized by the Buyer Indemnitee, or to the
Seller Indemnitee, to the extent recognized by the Seller Indemnitee. Any Person
seeking indemnity hereunder shall use commercially reasonable efforts to seek
coverage (including both costs of defense and indemnity) under applicable
insurance policies with respect to any such Buyer Indemnifiable Loss or Seller
Indemnifiable Loss, as the case may be.

               (e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, (i) except to the extent otherwise provided in Article IX, the rights
and remedies of the Parties under this Article IV are exclusive and in lieu of
any and all other rights and remedies which the Parties may have under this
Agreement for monetary relief with respect to (A) any breach by the Parties of
their respective representations and warranties and (B) the Indemnified
Liabilities, and (ii) no Party (nor any Buyer Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee)
shall be entitled to recover from any other Party for any liabilities, damages,
obligations, payments, losses, costs, or expenses under this Agreement any
amount in excess of the actual compensatory damages, court costs and reasonable
attorneys' and other advisor fees suffered by such Party (or Buyer Indemnitee or
Seller Indemnitee, as the case may be). Each Party waives any right to recover
incidental, special, exemplary and consequential damages arising in connection
with or with respect to this Agreement.

          Section 4.4  Defense of Claims.

               (a)  (i)   If any Buyer Indemnitee receives notice of the
     assertion or commencement of any claim, action or proceeding made or
     brought by any Person who is not a Party or an affiliate of a Party (a
     "Third Party Claim") with respect to which indemnification is to be sought
     from the

                                       31

<PAGE>

     Seller and DQE, the Buyer Indemnitee shall give the Seller and DQE
     reasonably prompt written notice thereof, but in any event such notice
     shall not be given later than twenty (20) calendar days after the Buyer
     Indemnitee's receipt of written notice of such Third Party Claim. Such
     written notice shall describe the nature of the Third Party Claim in
     reasonable detail and shall indicate the estimated amount, if practicable,
     of the Buyer Indemnifiable Loss that has been or may be sustained by the
     Buyer Indemnitee. The Seller and DQE will have the right to participate in
     or, by giving written notice to the Buyer Indemnitee, to elect to assume
     the defense of any Third Party Claim by the Seller's own counsel, the cost
     for which shall be borne by the Seller and DQE to the extent that Buyer
     Indemnifiable Losses exceed the Indemnity Basket and shall, to such extent,
     be taken into account in calculating the aggregate amount of the Seller's
     and DQE's liability for Buyer Indemnifiable Losses under the Indemnity Cap.
     The Buyer Indemnitee shall cooperate in good faith in such defense at such
     Buyer Indemnitee's own expense. If the Seller and DQE elect not to assume
     the defense of any Third Party Claim, the Buyer Indemnitee may compromise
     or settle such Third Party Claim over the objection of the Seller and DQE,
     which settlement or compromise shall conclusively establish the Seller's
     and DQE's liability pursuant to this Agreement.

                    (ii)  If any Seller Indemnitee receives notice of the
     assertion or commencement of a Third Party Claim with respect to which
     indemnification is to be sought from the Buyer, the Seller Indemnitee shall
     give the Buyer reasonably prompt written notice thereof, but in any event
     such notice shall not be given later than twenty (20) calendar days after
     the Seller Indemnitee's receipt of written notice of such Third Party
     Claim. Such written notice shall describe the nature of the Third Party
     Claim in reasonable detail and shall indicate the estimated amount, if
     practicable, of the Seller Indemnifiable Loss that has been or may be
     sustained by the Seller Indemnitee. The Buyer will have the right to
     participate in or, by giving written notice to the Seller Indemnitee, to
     elect to assume the defense of any Third Party Claim by the Buyer's own
     counsel, the cost for which shall be borne by the Buyer to the extent that
     Seller Indemnifiable Losses exceed the Indemnity Basket and shall, to such
     extent, be taken into account in calculating the aggregate amount of the
     Buyer's liability for Seller Indemnifiable Losses under the Indemnity Cap.
     The Seller Indemnitee shall cooperate in good faith in such defense at such
     Seller Indemnitee's own expense. If the Buyer elects not to assume the
     defense of any Third Party Claim, the Seller Indemnitee may compromise or
     settle such Third Party Claim over the objection of the Buyer, which
     settlement or compromise shall

                                       32

<PAGE>

     conclusively establish the Buyer's liability pursuant to this Agreement.

               (b)  (i)   If, after a Buyer Indemnitee provides written notice
     to the Seller and DQE of any Third Party Claims, the Buyer Indemnitee
     receives written notice from the Seller or DQE that the Seller or DQE has
     elected to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim, the Seller and DQE
     will not be liable for any legal expenses subsequently incurred by the
     Buyer Indemnitee in connection with the defense thereof. Without the prior
     written consent of the Buyer Indemnitee, the Seller and DQE shall not enter
     into any settlement of any Third Party Claim that would lead to liability
     or create any financial or other obligation on the part of the Buyer
     Indemnitee for which the Buyer Indemnitee is not entitled to
     indemnification hereunder. If a firm offer is made to settle a Third Party
     Claim without leading to liability or the creation of a financial or other
     obligation on the part of the Buyer Indemnitee for which the Buyer
     Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification hereunder and the Seller and
     DQE desire to accept and agree to such offer, the Seller and DQE shall give
     written notice to the Buyer Indemnitee to that effect. If the Buyer
     Indemnitee fails to consent to such firm offer within ten (10) calendar
     days after its receipt of such notice, the Seller and DQE shall be relieved
     of their obligations to defend such Third Party Claim and the Buyer
     Indemnitee may contest or defend such Third Party Claim. In such event, the
     maximum liability of the Seller and DQE as to such Third Party Claim will
     be the amount of such settlement offer plus reasonable costs and expenses
     paid or incurred by the Buyer Indemnitee up to the date of said notice, at
     all time subject to the additional limitations on the Seller's and DQE's
     liability contained in this Article IV.

                    (ii)  If, after a Seller Indemnitee provides written notice
     to the Buyer of any Third Party Claims, the Seller Indemnitee receives
     written notice from the Buyer that the Buyer has elected to assume the
     defense of such Third Party Claim, the Buyer will not be liable for any
     legal expenses subsequently incurred by the Seller Indemnitee in connection
     with the defense thereof. Without the prior written consent of the Seller
     Indemnitee, the Buyer shall not enter into any settlement of any Third
     Party Claim that would lead to liability or create any financial or other
     obligation on the part of the Seller Indemnitee for which the Seller
     Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification hereunder. If a firm offer is
     made to settle a Third Party Claim without leading to liability or the
     creation of a financial or other obligation on the part of the Seller
     Indemnitee for which the Seller Indemnitee is not entitled to
     indemnification hereunder and the Buyer desires to accept and agree to such
     offer, the Buyer shall give written notice to the Seller Indemnitee to that
     effect. If the Seller Indemnitee fails to consent to

                                       33

<PAGE>

     such firm offer within ten (10) calendar days after its receipt of such
     notice, the Buyer shall be relieved of its obligation to defend such Third
     Party Claim and the Seller Indemnitee may contest or defend such Third
     Party Claim. In such event, the maximum liability of the Buyer as to such
     Third Party Claim will be the amount of such settlement offer plus
     reasonable costs and expenses paid or incurred by the Seller Indemnitee up
     to the date of said notice, at all time subject to the additional
     limitations on the Buyer's liability contained in this Article IV.

               (c)  (i)   Any claim that does not result from a Third Party
     Claim (a "Direct Claim") by a Buyer Indemnitee on account of a Buyer
     Indemnifiable Loss shall be asserted by giving the Seller and DQE
     reasonably prompt written notice thereof, stating the nature of such claim
     in reasonable detail and indicating the estimated amount, if practicable,
     but in any event such notice shall not be given later than twenty (20)
     calendar days after the Buyer Indemnitee becomes aware of such Direct
     Claim, and the Seller and DQE shall have a period of thirty (30) calendar
     days from receipt of such notice within which to respond to such Direct
     Claim. If the Seller or DQE does not respond within such thirty (30)
     calendar day period, the Seller and DQE shall be deemed to have accepted
     such claim. If the Seller and DQE reject such claim, the Buyer Indemnitee
     will be free to seek enforcement of its right to indemnification under this
     Agreement.

                    (ii)  Any Direct Claim by a Seller Indemnitee on account of
     a Seller Indemnifiable Loss shall be asserted by giving the Buyer
     reasonably prompt written notice thereof, stating the nature of such claim
     in reasonable detail and indicating the estimated amount, if practicable,
     but in any event such notice shall not be given later than twenty (20)
     calendar days after the Seller Indemnitee becomes aware of such Direct
     Claim, and the Buyer shall have a period of thirty (30) calendar days from
     receipt of such notice within which to respond to such Direct Claim. If the
     Buyer does not respond within such thirty (30) calendar day period, the
     Buyer shall be deemed to have accepted such claim. If the Buyer rejects
     such claim, the Seller Indemnitee will be free to seek enforcement of its
     right to indemnification under this Agreement.

               (d) If the amount of any Buyer Indemnifiable Loss or Seller
Indemnifiable Loss, as the case may be, at any time subsequent to the making of
an indemnity payment in respect thereof, is reduced by recovery, settlement or
otherwise under or pursuant to any insurance coverage, or pursuant to any claim,
recovery, settlement or payment by, from or against any other entity, the amount
of such reduction, less any costs, expenses or premiums incurred in connection
therewith (together with interest thereon from the date of payment thereof at
the

                                       34

<PAGE>

publicly announced prime rate then in effect of The Chase Manhattan Bank)
shall promptly be repaid by the Buyer Indemnitee to the Seller and DQE or by the
Seller Indemnitee to the Buyer, as the case may be.

               (e) With respect to those pending litigation matters set forth in
Schedule 3.7 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule (each a "Pending Litigation
Matter"), the Parties agree as follows: no later than the Closing Date, DQE
and/or the Seller shall identify those Pending Litigation Matters for which DQE
and/or the Seller will defend, continue to defend or assume the defense of on
and after the Closing Date (each such defense, an "Assumed Defense"). PSC and
Acquisition agree to cooperate, and to cause their Subsidiaries, officers,
directors and employees to cooperate, fully in connection therewith, including,
but not limited to, providing access to personnel and records. The Seller or DQE
shall reimburse PSC, Acquisition and their Subsidiaries for any out of pocket
expenses (e.g. travel, lodging, meals and related expenses) incurred by them in
cooperation with the Seller or DQE as contemplated by this Section 4.4(e);
provided, however, that the Seller and DQE shall not reimburse PSC, Acquisition
or their Subsidiaries, and PSC, Acquisition and their Subsidiaries shall not be
entitled to reimbursement, for any portion of the wages, salary, benefits,
overhead or other costs, attributable to the officers, directors and employees
of PSC, Acquisition or their Subsidiaries whose cooperation may be required by
this Section 4.4(e). For the avoidance of doubt, (i) the defense of any Pending
Litigation Matter, the defense of which is not assumed by the Seller or DQE as
an Assumed Defense, shall be the responsibility of PSC or Acquisition on and
after the Closing Date, subject at all times to the procedures, limitations and
other obligations in respect thereof set forth in Article IV, and (ii) the
obligations set forth in this Section 4.4(e) in no way limit or reduce the
Seller's and DQE's indemnity obligation, in respect of any Pending Litigation
Matters, whether or not any such Pending Litigation Matter has been assumed by
the Seller or DQE as an Assumed Defense.

          Section 4.5 Tax Indemnity. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement to the contrary, the Seller and DQE shall, jointly and severally,
indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Buyer Indemnitee, and PSC and
Acquisition shall, jointly and severally, indemnify, defend and hold harmless
each Seller Indemnitee from and against any and all of the liabilities of the
Seller and DQE, and PSC and Acquisition, respectively, as set forth below:

               (a) The Seller and DQE shall be liable for, shall pay to the
appropriate Tax authorities (or shall pay to Utility, Development or Reynolds,
as the case may be, as a reimbursement of Taxes paid to the appropriate Tax
authorities for a Straddle Period (as defined below) Tax Return), and shall
indemnify and hold the Buyer and the Company harmless against, all Taxes of the
Company that relate to (i) the taxable periods ending before or on the Closing
Date (other than Taxes

                                       35

<PAGE>

attributable to transactions not in the ordinary course of business occurring
after the Closing which are effectuated or initiated by the Buyer), (ii) any
taxable period that includes but does not end on the Closing Date (a "Straddle
Period"), but only to the extent that such Taxes relate to the portion of such
Straddle Period up to and including the Closing Date, and (iii) any liability
for Taxes of the consolidated group of which DQE is the common parent arising
under Treasury Regulation section 1.1502-6 (or similar provision of state, local
or foreign law). The Seller shall be entitled to all Tax refunds (including
interest) attributable to the taxable periods for which it is liable; provided,
that the Buyer shall elect under Treasury Regulation section 1.1502-21(b)(3)(ii)
(or similar provision of state, local or foreign law) to relinquish, with
respect to any net operating losses attributable to Utility, Development or
Reynolds, or any Company Subsidiary, the portion of the carryback period for
which any such corporation was a member of the consolidated group of which DQE
is the common parent.

               (b) The Buyer shall be liable for, shall pay to the appropriate
Tax authorities, and shall indemnify and hold the Seller and DQE harmless
against all Taxes of the Company that relate to (i) the taxable periods that
begin after the Closing Date (including, for this purpose, any Taxes
attributable to transactions not in the ordinary course of business occurring
after the Closing which are effectuated or initiated by the Buyer) and (ii) the
portion of any Straddle Period commencing with the first (1st) day after the
Closing Date. The Buyer shall be entitled to all Tax refunds (including
interest) attributable to the taxable periods for which it is liable.

               (c) The obligations of the Parties to indemnify each other
pursuant to this Section 4.5 shall continue until the statutory period of
limitations (taking into account any extensions or waivers thereof) for the
assessment of Taxes, covered by this Section 4.5, has expired. Any payment due
to an indemnified Party pursuant to this Section 4.5 shall be paid promptly by
the indemnifying Party upon receipt of written notice.

               (d) Neither Party shall take any action the purpose and intent of
which is to prejudice the defense of any claim subject to indemnification
hereunder or to induce a third party to assert a claim subject to
indemnification hereunder.

               (e) After the Closing, each of the Seller and the Buyer shall
notify the chief tax officer of the other Party in writing (including by
telecopier) within ten (10) calendar days of the receipt of any written notice
of any pending or threatened Audit (as defined below) which, if determined
adversely, could be grounds for indemnification under this Section 4.5 (a "Tax
Claim"); provided, however, that any failure to give such notice shall not
affect the rights of the Parties hereunder unless and to the extent such failure
materially and adversely affects the

                                       36

<PAGE>

indemnifying Party's right to participate in and defend such Tax Claim. The
Seller shall have the right at its expense to participate in and control the
conduct of any Tax Claim of or attributable to the Company relating to taxable
periods ending on or before the Closing Date and to employ counsel of its own
choice at its expense; provided, however, that the Seller shall not settle any
such Tax Claim or make or agree to any adjustment in any manner without the
consent of the Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed; and provided, further, that the Buyer shall have the
right to participate in (but not to control) such Tax Claim. If the Seller fails
to participate in any Tax Claim of the Company relating to taxable periods
ending on or before the Closing Date for which notice was provided pursuant to
this Section 4.5(e), the Buyer may defend and settle such Tax Claim in such
manner as it may deem appropriate in its sole discretion. Except as set forth
above in the first sentence of this Section 4.5(e), the Buyer shall control the
conduct of any Tax Claim of the Company relating to any taxable period ending
after the Closing Date and may defend and settle such Tax Claim in such manner
as it may deem appropriate in its sole discretion. The term "Audit" means any
audit, assessment of Taxes, reassessment of Taxes, or other examination by any
Governmental Authority or any judicial or administrative proceedings or appeal
of such proceedings.

               (f) All indemnity payments made by the Seller to the Buyer, or by
the Buyer to the Seller, pursuant to this Agreement shall, to the maximum extent
permitted under the Code (or other applicable Tax law), be treated for all Tax
purposes as adjustments to the consideration paid with respect to the Shares and
the Integrated Assets.

          Section 4.6 Certain Litigation Indemnification and Related Matters.

               (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, the Seller and DQE shall, jointly and severally, indemnify, defend and
hold harmless each Buyer Indemnitee from and against any claims that were
brought or could have been brought in (i) the litigation captioned Edward
Wallace, et al. v. AquaSource, Inc., et al. (Cause No. 2001-05987), filed in the
270th Judicial District Court of Harris County, Texas (the "Class B Stock
Litigation"), or any settlement or compromise relating thereto, (ii) the
litigation captioned AquaSource, Inc. v. JPT Financial, Inc. and Acquisition
Partners, Inc., (Cause No. 2001-31233), filed in the 270th Judicial District
Court of Harris County, Texas (the "JPT Litigation"), or any settlement or
compromise relating thereto, and (iii) any other claims involving the Seller's
Class B Common Stock, or any settlement or compromise relating thereto. In
addition, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
any right, title or interest that Utility, Development or Reynolds, or any
Company Subsidiary, may have in or to any benefit resulting from or arising out
of the Class B Stock Litigation or the JPT Litigation, including any

                                       37

<PAGE>

benefits in the nature of claims or counterclaims, payments, insurance proceeds,
settlements, awards, judgments and the like, shall be deemed to be Excluded
Assets and, as such, shall be assigned to the Seller as contemplated by Section
6.3 of this Agreement.

               (b) PSC and Acquisition acknowledge and agree that the Seller
shall be entitled exclusively to control, defend, prosecute and settle the Class
B Stock Litigation and the JPT Litigation and PSC and Acquisition agree that
each of them will, and will cause their respective Subsidiaries (including,
after the Closing Date, Utility, Development and Reynolds, and the Company
Subsidiaries) and each of their Subsidiaries' officers, directors and employees,
to cooperate fully in connection therewith, including, but not limited to,
providing access to personnel and records. The Seller shall reimburse PSC,
Acquisition and their Subsidiaries for any out-of-pocket expenses (i.e., travel,
lodging, meals and related expenses) incurred by the them in cooperating with
the Seller as contemplated by this Section 4.6(b), provided, however, that the
Seller shall not reimburse PSC, Acquisition or their Subsidiaries, and PSC,
Acquisition and their Subsidiaries shall not be entitled to reimbursement, for
any portion of the wages, salary, benefits, overhead or other costs attributable
to the officers, directors, employees and agents of PSC, Acquisition or their
Subsidiaries whose cooperation may be required by this Section 4.6(b).

          Section 4.7 Certain Indemnification in Respect of Environmental Law.

               (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the
Seller and DQE shall, jointly and severally, indemnify, defend, reimburse, and
hold harmless each Buyer Indemnitee from and against any and all Indemnifiable
Losses arising out of or resulting from any of the following: (i) any breach of
any representation or warranty made by the Seller in Section 3.11 or Section
3.19 hereof that is discovered within the Indemnity Period; (ii) any Third Party
Claim (as defined in Section 4.4) asserted prior to the tenth (10th) anniversary
of the Closing Date for any Pre-Closing Environmental Liability (as defined in
Section 4.7(b)(ii)); and (iii) any First Party Environmental Claim (as defined
in Section 4.7(b)(iv)) asserted prior to the tenth (10th) anniversary of the
Closing Date for any Pre-Closing Violation or Contamination (as defined in
Section 4.7(b)(i)). Any and all Indemnifiable Losses arising out of or resulting
from clauses (i), (ii), or (iii) above shall not be limited by the Indemnity Cap
(as defined in Section 4.3(b)), but shall be subject to the Indemnity Basket (as
defined in Section 4.3(b)).

               (b) As used in this Agreement:

                    (i)   the term "Pre-Closing Violation or Contamination"
     means any and all cost and liability (other than

                                       38

<PAGE>

     Excepted Liabilities) arising out of or related to: (A) any violation of
     any Environmental Laws by the Seller, Utility, Development, Reynolds, or
     any of the Company Subsidiaries, or any presence in the environment,
     Release, threat of Release or any exposure of either an individual or the
     environment, of or to any Hazardous Substances at or under any of the
     Properties (as defined in Section 4.7(b)(iii)), which, for any of the
     foregoing, occurred on or before or existed as of the Closing Date, and (B)
     any post-Closing Date liabilities arising from any such pre-Closing Date
     violation, presence, Release, threat of Release or exposure.

                    (ii)  the term "Pre-Closing Environmental Liability" means
     any and all cost and liability (other than Excepted Liabilities) arising
     out of or related to: (A) any presence in the environment, Release, threat
     of Release, or any exposure of either an individual or the environment, of
     or to any Hazardous Substances from, at, or under any of the Properties or
     otherwise arising in connection with the Company's current or former
     operations before the Closing Date; (B) the off-site transportation,
     storage, treatment, recycling, or Release of any Hazardous Substances
     generated or Released, before the Closing Date, by the Seller, Utility,
     Development, Reynolds, or any of the Company Subsidiaries, or any
     predecessor of such Persons; (C) any violation of any Environmental Laws by
     the Seller, Utility, Development, Reynolds, or any of the Company
     Subsidiaries at or under any of the Properties which, occurred on or before
     or existed as of the Closing Date; and (D) any post-Closing Date
     liabilities arising from any such pre-Closing Date violation or presence,
     Release, threat of Release or exposure.

                    (iii) the term "Properties" means any property currently or
     formerly owned, occupied, or leased by the Seller, Utility, Development,
     Reynolds or any Company Subsidiary.

                    (iv)  the term "First Party Environmental Claim" means any
     claim, action, or proceeding, made or brought by any Buyer Indemnitee
     asserting either liability or the potential for liability under any
     Environmental Laws.

               (c) If, after the Closing Date, PSC, Acquisition or any Buyer
Subsidiary: (i) exacerbates any Release or threatened Release of Hazardous
Substances specifically disclosed by the Seller to PSC or Acquisition existing
on or before the Closing Date (a "Pre-Existing Release") or (ii) exacerbates any
violation by the Seller, Utility, Development, Reynolds, or any of the Company
Subsidiaries

                                       39

<PAGE>

of any Environmental Laws that existed as of the Closing Date (a "Pre-Existing
Violation"), then the obligation of the Seller and DQE for any Buyer
Indemnifiable Losses in respect of any such Pre-Existing Release or Pre-Existing
Violation shall be reduced to the extent that PSC, Acquisition or any Buyer
Subsidiary exacerbated such Pre-Existing Release or Pre-Existing Violation. PSC,
Acquisition and the Buyer Subsidiaries shall not be considered to have
exacerbated a Pre-Existing Release or Pre-Existing Violation by having their
employees act, in the ordinary course of business, in the same manner that any
employees of the Seller, Utility, Development, Reynolds, or any of the Company
Subsidiaries acted in the ordinary course of business before the Closing Date
(the "Pre-Existing Actions"); provided, however, that PSC, Acquisition and the
Buyer Subsidiaries shall be considered to have exacerbated a Pre-Existing
Release or Pre-Existing Violation by their inaction or failure to modify any
Pre-Existing Actions to the extent required to comply with any applicable
Environmental Laws.

               (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, nothing in this Agreement is intended to restrict PSC, Acquisition or
any Buyer Subsidiary from fulfilling its or their obligations to take
appropriate actions as may be required by applicable Environmental Laws.

               (e) The right of any Buyer Indemnitee to indemnification under
this Section 4.7 shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any statutory
rights which such Buyer Indemnitee has or may obtain under Environmental Laws.

               (f) For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties agree that the
provisions of Section 4.3(d), Section 4.3(e), and all of Section 4.4 shall apply
to the indemnity obligations set forth in this Section 4.7, provided, however,
that for purposes of applying such provisions to this Section 4.7, (i) all
references to the Indemnity Cap contained in such provisions shall be
disregarded, and (ii) all references to Direct Claims shall be read to include
First Party Environmental Claims.

                                    ARTICLE V
                   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE BUYER

organization, has all requisite power and authority to own, lease and operate
its assets and properties to the extent owned, leased and operated and to carry
on its business as it is now being conducted and is duly qualified to do
business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the
ownership or leasing of its assets and properties makes such qualification
necessary other than in such jurisdictions where the failure to be in good
standing or be so qualified is not reasonably likely to have a Buyer Material
Adverse Effect (as defined in Section 5.1(b)).

               (b) As used in this Agreement, the term "Buyer Material Adverse
Effect" shall mean any material adverse effect on the business, assets,
financial condition or results of operations of the Buyer, taken as a whole,
totaling in each instance $1,000,000; provided, however, that the term "Buyer
Material Adverse Effect" shall not include (i) any such effect resulting from
any change in law, rule, or regulation of any Governmental Authority that
applies generally to similarly situated Persons, (ii) effects relating to or
resulting from general changes in the industries in which the Buyer operates its
assets or conducts its business, or (iii) any Permitted Financial Impact. The

delivery of this Agreement and the consummation by PSC, Acquisition and any
Buyer Subsidiary as PSC may designate pursuant to Section 1.1 of the
transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate action on the part of PSC and Acquisition. No vote of, or consent by,
the holders of any class or series of stock issued by PSC, Acquisition or any
Buyer Subsidiary is necessary to authorize the execution and delivery by PSC and
Acquisition of this Agreement or the consummation by PSC, Acquisition and any
Buyer Subsidiary as PSC may designate pursuant to Section 1.1 of the
transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by PSC and Acquisition and, assuming the due authorization, execution
and delivery hereof by the Seller and DQE, constitutes the valid and binding
obligation of PSC and Acquisition enforceable against them in accordance with
its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer,
reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general applicability relating to
or affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles.

which PSC, Acquisition or any of the Buyer Subsidiaries is a party or by which
they or any of their respective properties or assets may be bound or affected,

(v) having any applicable appeals period expire without any appeal being filed,

without the opportunity for further appeal.

materially delay or materially impair PSC's,

                                       42

          Section 5.4  Investigation by the Buyer; the Seller's Liability.
Each of PSC and Acquisition has conducted its own independent investigation,
review and analysis of the business, operations, assets, liabilities, results of
operations, financial condition, software, technology and prospects of the
Company, which investigation, review and analysis was done by PSC, Acquisition
and their affiliates and, to the extent PSC or Acquisition deemed appropriate,
by the officers, directors, employees, accountants, counsel, investment bankers,
financial advisors and other representatives (collectively, "Representatives")
of PSC. In entering into this Agreement, each of PSC and Acquisition
acknowledges that it has relied solely upon the aforementioned investigation,
review and analysis and not on any factual representations of the Seller or the
Seller's Representatives (except the specific representations and warranties of
the Seller set forth in Article III of this Agreement), and each of PSC and
Acquisition:

               (a) acknowledges that none of the Seller, Utility, Development,
Reynolds, any Company Subsidiary or any of their respective directors, officers,
shareholders, employees, affiliates, controlling Persons, agents, advisors or
Representatives makes or has made any representation or warranty, either express
or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of any of the information
(including in materials furnished in the Seller's data room, in presentations by
the Seller's management, on site visits or otherwise) provided or made available
to PSC, Acquisition or their directors, officers, employees, affiliates,
controlling Persons, advisors, agents or Representatives, and

               (b) agrees, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that none of

controlling Persons, agents, advisors or Representatives shall have any
liability or responsibility whatsoever to PSC, Acquisition or their directors,
officers, employees, affiliates, controlling Persons, agents or Representatives
on any basis (including in contract or tort, under federal or state securities
laws or otherwise) based upon any information provided or made available, or
statements made (including in materials furnished in the Seller's data room, in

                                       48

<PAGE>

withheld, conditioned or delayed:

               (a) PSC and Acquisition shall promptly provide the Seller with

any state or federal court, administrative agency, commission or other

               (b) PSC and Acquisition shall, and PSC shall cause the Buyer

and Acquisition shall promptly notify the Seller of any failure or prospective
failure to obtain any such consents or approvals and shall provide to the Seller

               (a) Upon reasonable notice, the Seller shall, and shall cause
Utility, Development and Reynolds, and each Company Subsidiary, to, afford to
the

                                       49

<PAGE>

Representatives of the Buyer reasonable access, during normal business hours
throughout the period prior to the Closing Date, to all of the Seller's (in
respect of the Company), Utility's, Development's and Reynolds', and the Company
Subsidiaries', properties, books, contracts, commitments and records (including,
but not limited to, Tax Returns) and, during such period, the Seller shall, and
shall cause Utility, Development and Reynolds, and each Company Subsidiary, to,
furnish promptly to the Buyer and its Representatives, (i) access to each
report, schedule and other document filed or received by the Seller (in respect
of the Company), Utility, Development or Reynolds, or any Company Subsidiary,
pursuant to the requirements of federal or state securities laws or filed with
or sent to any federal or state regulatory agency or commission and (ii) access
to all information concerning the Seller (in respect of the Company), the
Integrated Assets, Utility, Development or Reynolds, or any Company Subsidiary,
and its or their respective directors and officers and such other matters as may
be reasonably requested by the Buyer or its Representatives in connection with
any filings, applications or approvals required or contemplated by this
Agreement or for any other reason related to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; provided, however, that (i) any such access shall be granted
only in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the Seller's
business operations in respect of the Company or otherwise, (ii) upon being
granted such access, the Buyer shall not interfere with the Seller's business
operations in respect of the Company or otherwise, (iii) in granting any such
access the Seller, Utility, Development and Reynolds, and the Company

waiver of any legal privilege, including the attorney-client privilege, the work

granting any such access, the Seller, Utility, Development and Reynolds, and the
Company Subsidiaries, shall not be required to provide the Buyer with access to
any information which the Seller, Utility, Development or Reynolds, or any
Company Subsidiary, is under a legal or contractual obligation to withhold from
disclosure. The Buyer shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and
Representatives to, hold in strict confidence all documents and information
concerning the Seller or the Company furnished or made available to it in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in accordance
with the Confidentiality Agreement, dated January 23, 2001, entered into by and
among the Seller, DQE and the Buyer (as amended on March 19, 2002, the
"Confidentiality Agreement").

               (b) Between the date hereof and the Closing Date, the Parties
shall reasonably cooperate with one another so as to inform one another of the
condition of the Company and the status of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Toward that end, the Parties shall each appoint an officer-level
employee to serve as the head of their transition team and shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to hold regular meetings and/or conference calls
so that the members of the Seller's and the Buyer's management and transition
teams may

                                       50

<PAGE>

discuss the Company and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

          Section 7.2  Regulatory Matters.

               (a) HSR Filings. The Seller and the Buyer shall, as soon as
practicable after the date hereof, file or cause to be filed with the Federal
Trade Commission and the Department of Justice any notifications required to be
filed under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended
(the "HSR Act"), and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby. The Seller and the Buyer will
use all commercially reasonable efforts to respond on a timely basis to any
requests for additional information made by either of such agencies.

               (b) Other Regulatory Approvals. The Seller and the Buyer shall
cooperate and use all commercially reasonable efforts to promptly prepare and
file all necessary documentation, to effect all necessary applications, notices,
petitions, filings and other documents, and to use all commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain all necessary permits, consents, approvals and authorizations
of all Governmental Authorities necessary or advisable to obtain the Seller
Required Statutory Approvals and the Buyer Required Statutory Approvals;
provided, however, that the Seller and the Buyer shall cooperate and use all
commercially reasonable efforts to prepare and file any such applications,
notices, petitions, filings and other documents within sixty (60) calendar days
after the date hereof and shall thereafter cooperate to diligently prosecute all
such applications, notices, petitions, filings and other documents. To the
extent any such applications, notices, petitions, filings or other documents
require an allocation of the Purchase Price among the assets of the Company, the
Seller and the Buyer shall make any such allocation in a manner that is
consistent with any allocations made pursuant to Section 7.9 hereof. The Buyer
shall be precluded from including in any application for regulatory approval
contingencies relating to rate treatment of acquisition premiums.

          Section 7.3  Consents. The Seller and the Buyer agree to use all
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the Seller Required Consents and the
Buyer Required Consents, respectively, and to cooperate with each other in
connection with the foregoing.

          Section 7.4  Directors' and Officers' Indemnification.

               (a) Indemnification. To the fullest extent permitted by law, from
and after the Closing Date, all rights to indemnification existing immediately
prior to the Closing in favor of the current and former employees, agents,
directors or officers of the Seller, Utility, Development and Reynolds, and each
Company Subsidiary, (each, a "Company Indemnified Party" and, collectively, the
"Company

                                       51

<PAGE>

Indemnified Parties") with respect to their activities as such prior to or on
the Closing Date, as provided in the Seller's, Utility's, Development's and
Reynolds', and each Company Subsidiary's, respective articles of incorporation,
by-laws, other organizational documents or indemnification agreements in effect
on the date of such activities or otherwise in effect on the date hereof, shall
survive the Closing and shall continue in full force and effect for a period of
not less than six (6) years from the Closing Date, provided that, in the event
any claim or claims are asserted or made within such six (6) year period, all
such rights to indemnification in respect of any claim or claims shall continue
until final disposition of such claim or claims and provided further that, the
Buyer's or any Buyer Subsidiary's indemnity obligation for a particular claim
hereunder shall be reduced in respect of any Company Indemnified Party asserting
such claim to the extent of any insurance proceeds actually received by such
Company Indemnified Party in respect of such claim.

               (b) Successors. In the event that after the Closing Date,
Utility, Development or Reynolds, or any of their successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person or entity and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or
(ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
Person or entity, then and in either such case, proper provisions shall be made
so that the successors and assigns of Utility, Development or Reynolds, as the
case may be, shall assume the respective obligations of Utility, Development or
Reynolds, as the case may be, set forth in this Section 7.4.

               (c) Insurance for Pre-Closing Period. For a period of six (6)
years after the Closing Date, DQE or the Seller shall maintain policies of
directors' and officers' liability insurance for those Persons covered by such
policies maintained by the Seller (in respect of the Company), Utility,
Development or Reynolds immediately prior to the Closing in respect of
pre-Closing acts or omissions on terms no less favorable than the terms of any
such current insurance coverage.

               (d) Benefit. The provisions of this Section 7.4 are intended to
be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Company Indemnified
Party, his or her heirs and his or her representatives.

          Section 7.5  Public Announcements. The Buyer and the Seller shall
consult with each other before issuing any press release with respect to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue any such
press release or make any such written public statement without the prior
written consent of the other Party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned, provided, however, that a Party may, without the prior
written consent of the other Party, issue such press release or make such
written public statement as

                                       52

<PAGE>

the Party may determine, in good faith after consultation with counsel, is
required by law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or
rules of any national securities exchange, if it has used all commercially
reasonable efforts to consult with the other Party.

          Section 7.6  Workforce Matters.

               (a) Neither Utility, Development, Reynolds nor any Company
Subsidiary has any employees. The Buyer will make offers of employment,
effective as of the Closing, to those employees of the Seller identified by
mutual written agreement of the Seller and PSC as Affected Employees (such
individuals, the "Affected Employees") such that such Affected Employees do not
suffer an "employment loss" under the WARN Act (as defined below) as a result of
such offers. The Buyer and the Seller acknowledge that if the Buyer makes
appropriate offers to all Affected Employees, none of such Affected Employees
will suffer an "employment loss" as defined under the WARN Act. As used in this
Agreement, the term "WARN Act" shall mean the Worker Adjustment and Retraining
Notification Act. In connection with the hiring process for Affected Employees,
the Buyer shall comply with applicable laws pertaining to labor and employment,
including, without limitation, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as
amended, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, the Americans With
Disabilities Act, the Rehabilitation Act and comparable state and local laws. If
any Affected Employee is not hired by the Buyer as of the Closing or if the
Buyer or any Affected Employee terminates such Affected Employee's employment as
of or after the Closing, then the Buyer shall be responsible for any and all
severance costs for all such Affected Employees, including payments owing under
those agreements, plans or arrangements listed in Section 3.9(a) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule. As between the Seller and the Buyer, neither the Seller nor
DQE shall be obligated to provide any severance or separation pay benefits to
any Affected Employee on account of any termination of such Affected Employee's
employment on or after the Closing Date. Neither Buyer nor its affiliates shall
be responsible for providing severance benefits to any employee of Seller or its
affiliates other than benefits payable in respect of Affected Employees in
accordance with this Section 7.6(a). The Buyer shall be responsible for
providing any continuation coverage required under the Consolidated Omnibus
Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended ("COBRA"), in respect of Affected
Employees who experience a qualifying event (within the meaning of COBRA)
before, on or after the Closing Date. The Seller shall be responsible for any
notices required to be given under, or otherwise comply with, the WARN Act or
similar statutes or regulations of any jurisdiction relating to any

                                       53

<PAGE>

"plant closing" or "mass layoff" or similar triggering event ordered by the
Seller with respect to the Affected Employees prior to the Closing Date. The
Buyer shall be responsible for any notices required to be given under, or
otherwise comply with, the WARN Act or similar statutes or regulations of any
jurisdiction relating to any "plant closing" or "mass layoff" or similar
triggering event ordered by the Buyer or any Buyer Subsidiary with respect to
the Affected Employees on and after the Closing Date. For the avoidance of
doubt, for purposes here, the Parties intend for the "effective date" within the
meaning of the WARN Act to refer to and mean the Closing Date. To the extent
possible, the Buyer and the Seller agree to treat the Buyer as a "successor
employer" and the Seller or one or more of its affiliates as a "predecessor
employer" within the meaning of Sections 3121(a)(1) and 3306(b)(1) of the Code,
with respect to Affected Employees, for purposes of Taxes imposed under the
United States Federal Unemployment Tax or the United States Federal Insurance
Contributions Act.

               (b) The Buyer expressly agrees that without the Seller's consent,
(i) from the date hereof until the first (1st) anniversary of the Closing Date,
it will not directly solicit for employment or employ any employees of the
Seller who are not Affected Employees, and (ii) from the Closing Date until the
first (1st) anniversary of the Closing Date, it will cause the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries and any Buyer Subsidiaries not to directly solicit for
employment or employ any employees of the Seller who are not Affected Employees;
provided that nothing herein shall prohibit the Buyer or any of its affiliates
from placing advertisements for employment. The Seller expressly agrees that
without PSC's consent, (i) from the date hereof until the first (1st)
anniversary of the Closing Date, it will not directly solicit for employment any
of the Affected Employees or employ after the Closing Date any of the Affected
Employees actually hired by the Buyer, and (ii) from the Closing Date until the
first anniversary of the Closing Date, it will cause its affiliates to not, and
require in any agreement entered into for the sale of any of its operations that
any purchaser of such operations will not, directly solicit for employment any
of the Affected Employees or employ after the Closing Date any of the Affected
Employees actually hired by the Buyer; provided that nothing herein shall
prohibit the Seller or any of its affiliates or any purchaser of the Seller's
operations from placing advertisements for employment.

          Section 7.7  Employee Benefit Plans.

               (a) Continued Employment; Service Credit. Except as otherwise
provided herein, the Buyer shall not assume any Company Plan, nor shall there be
any transfer of assets or liabilities of any Company Plan to any plan, program
or arrangement maintained by the Buyer or any of its affiliates. If any Affected
Employee becomes a participant in any employee benefit plan, practice or policy
of the Buyer or any of its affiliates, such Affected Employee shall be given
credit under such plan for all service prior to the Closing Date with the
Company, any of its affiliates, any ERISA Affiliate or any predecessor employer
to the extent such credit was given by the Company, any of its affiliates, any
ERISA Affiliate or any predecessor employer under a Company Plan, and all
service with the Buyer or

                                       54

<PAGE>

any of its affiliates on and after the Closing Date but prior to the time such
employee becomes such a participant, for purposes of determining eligibility and
vesting and for purposes of severance and vacation. As of the Closing, the
Company and its affiliates shall cease to provide coverage and benefits for
Affected Employees and their dependents and beneficiaries under any benefit plan
maintained by the Seller or DQE or any of their respective affiliates, except as
required by applicable law.

               (b) Continuation of Agreements. Section 7.7(b) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule lists all contracts, agreements and commitments of the
Seller, Utility, Development or Reynolds, or any Company Subsidiary in effect as
of the date hereof that apply to any Affected Employee (each, a "Section 7.7(b)
Agreement"). The Buyer shall, and shall cause Utility, Development and Reynolds,
and each Company Subsidiary, to assume and honor each Section 7.7(b) Agreement
in accordance with its terms; provided, however, that this undertaking is not
intended to prevent the Seller, Utility, Development or Reynolds, or any Company
Subsidiary, from enforcing a Section 7.7(b) Agreement in accordance with its
terms, including, without limitation, any reserved right to amend, modify,
suspend, revoke or terminate the Section 7.7(b) Agreement or portion thereof.

          Section 7.8  Tax Treatment.

               (a) Neither the Seller nor the Buyer shall make or file any
election under Section 338 of the Code or any corresponding provision of state

notify the Seller in writing (the "Allocation Dispute Notice") of each disputed
item, specifying the allocation in dispute and setting forth, in reasonable
detail, the basis for such dispute within thirty (30) calendar days of the

Allocation Dispute Notice containing all disputed allocations. In the event of
such a dispute, the Buyer and the Seller shall attempt to reconcile their
differences and any resolution by them as to any disputed allocations shall be
final, binding and conclusive. If the Buyer and the Seller are unable to reach a
resolution with such effect within thirty (30) calendar days of the receipt by
the Seller of the Allocation Dispute Notice, the Buyer and the Seller shall
submit the items remaining in dispute for resolution to a nationally recognized
accounting firm, mutually acceptable to both the Seller and PSC, which shall,
within thirty (30) calendar days after submission, determine and report to the
Parties upon such remaining disputed allocations, and such report shall be
final, binding and conclusive on the Parties hereto. All costs and expenses of
the nationally recognized accounting firm relating to the disputed allocations
shall be borne equally by the Buyer and the Seller.

               (c) Upon agreement of the Parties with respect to the Adjustment

Schedule") setting forth the allocation among the Shares and the Integrated
Assets as specified in Section 7.9(a) and modified pursuant to Section 7.9(b)
shall be prepared by the Parties. Each of the Buyer and the Seller shall (i)
timely file with each relevant Tax authority all forms and Tax Returns required
to be filed in connection with the allocation set forth in the Final Allocation
Schedule (including Internal Revenue Service Form 8594), (ii) be bound by such
allocation for purposes of determining Taxes, (iii) prepare and file, and cause
their respective affiliates to prepare and file, their Tax Returns on a basis
consistent with such allocation, and (iv) not take any position, or cause their
respective affiliates to take any position, inconsistent with such allocation on
any Tax Return, in any audit or proceeding before any Tax authority or in any
report made for Tax purposes; provided, however, that, notwithstanding anything
in this Section 7.9 to the contrary, the Parties shall be permitted to take a
position inconsistent with that set forth in this Section 7.9 if required to do
so by a final and unappealable decision, judgment, decree or other order by any
court of competent jurisdiction. In the event that any of such allocations are
disputed by any Tax authority, the Seller or the Buyer, as the case may be,
receiving notice of the dispute shall promptly notify the Seller or the Buyer,
as the case may be, not receiving notice of the dispute.

7.1(a) and all of Articles IV and X shall survive the Closing.

          Section 10.2   Amendment and Modification. This Agreement may be
amended, modified and supplemented in any and all respects, but only by a
written instrument signed by each of the Parties hereto expressly stating that
such instrument is intended to amend, modify or supplement this Agreement.

          Section 10.3   Extension; Waiver. Any failure of any of the Parties to
comply with any obligation, covenant, agreement or condition herein, and any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto, and any time for the performance of any of
the obligations or other acts of a Party hereto, may be waived or extended, as
the case may be, but only pursuant to a written instrument signed by all Parties
entitled to the benefits thereof; provided, however, that any such waiver or
extension of such obligation, covenant, agreement or condition, or inaccuracy,
shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent
failure to comply therewith. The failure of any Party to this Agreement to
assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute
a waiver of such rights.

          Section 10.4   Expenses. All costs and expenses incurred in connection
with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by
the Party incurring such expenses except that the Seller and the Buyer shall
