AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER   THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (together
with all annexes, letters, schedules and exhibits hereto, this "Agreement"),
dated as of April 29, 2005, is by and among SmithKline Beecham Corporation
(doing business as GlaxoSmithKline), a Pennsylvania corporation ("Parent"),
GSK Delaware Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned direct subsidiary
of Parent ("Merger Sub") and Corixa Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the
"Company").   RECITALS   A. The Company and Merger Sub have each
determined that it is advisable, fair to and in the best interests of its
stockholders, to effect a merger (the "Merger") of Merger Sub with and into
the Company pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law (the "DGCL")
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
pursuant to which each outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.001
per share, of the Company (the "Common Shares"), each outstanding share of
Series A Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company (the
"Series A Shares") and each outstanding share of Series B Preferred Stock,
par value $0.001 per share, of the Company (the "Series B Shares" and
together with the Common Shares and the Series A Shares, the "Shares"), shall
be converted into the right to receive cash as set forth herein, all upon the
terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement.   B. The Board of
Directors of the Company (the "Company Board of Directors") has unanimously
(i) determined that this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby, taken together, are at a price and on terms that are
fair to, advisable and in the best interests of the Company and its
stockholders (the "Company Stockholders") and (ii) has adopted resolutions
approving this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including
the Merger, declaring its advisability and recommending the adoption by the
Company Stockholders of the "agreement of merger" (as such term is used in
Section 251 of the DGCL) contained in this Agreement, and the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby.   C. The Board of Directors of
Merger Sub has (i) determined that this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby, taken together, are at a price and on terms
that are fair to, advisable and in the best interests of Merger Sub and its
sole stockholder and (ii) adopted resolutions approving this Agreement and
the other transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, declaring
its advisability and recommending the adoption by its sole stockholder of the
"agreement of merger" (as such term is used in Section 251 of the DGCL)
contained in this Agreement, and the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby. The sole stockholder of Merger Sub has adopted the
"agreement of merger" (as such term is used in Section 251 of the DGCL)
contained in this Agreement.   D. Simultaneously with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, certain Company Stockholders have entered into
support agreements (the "Support Agreements"), dated as of the date hereof,
with Parent, pursuant to which, among other things, such Company Stockholders
have agreed to vote their shares in favor of the Merger and against any
competing proposals.   E. Certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement
are defined in Article IX, and Annex I includes an index of all capitalized
terms used in this Agreement.   AGREEMENT   In consideration of the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this
Agreement, the parties agree as follows:   ARTICLE I   THE MERGER  
Section 1.1 The Merger.   (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be
merged with and into the Company in accordance with the DGCL, the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue
as the Surviving Corporation under the Laws of the State of Delaware.   (b)
The Merger shall have the effects set forth in Section 259 of the DGCL and
other applicable Law. Accordingly, from and after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall have all the properties, rights,
privileges, powers, interests and franchises and subject to all restrictions,
disabilities, debts, duties and Liabilities of the Company and Merger
Sub.   Section 1.2 Closing. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the Closing will take place at 10:00 a.m., local time, as promptly
as practicable but in no event later than the second Business Day after
the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions (other than those conditions
that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
fulfillment or waiver of those conditions) set forth in Article VI (the
"Closing Date"), at the offices of Orrick, Herrington and Sutcliffe LLP, 719
Second Avenue, Suite 900, Seattle, Washington 98104, unless another time,
date or place is agreed to in writing by the parties.   Section 1.3
Effective Time. On the Closing Date and subject to the terms and conditions
hereof, the Certificate of Merger shall be delivered for filing with the
Delaware Secretary. The Merger shall become effective at the Effective Time.
If the Delaware Secretary requires any changes in the Certificate of Merger
as a condition to filing or issuing a certificate to the effect that
the Merger is effective, Merger Sub and the Company shall execute any
necessary revisions incorporating such changes, provided such changes are not
inconsistent with and do not result in any material change in the terms of
this Agreement.   Section 1.4 Conversion of the Shares. At the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent,
Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of any of the following
securities.   (a) Except as provided in Section 1.4(b), each Common Share
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding
Appraisal Shares) shall be canceled and shall by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof be converted
automatically into the right to receive $4.40 in cash, without interest (the
"Common Merger Consideration"), upon surrender of the certificate
representing such Shares as provided in Article II. Each Series A Share
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding
Appraisal Shares) shall be canceled and shall by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof be converted
automatically into the right to receive $517.65 in cash, without interest
(the "Series A Merger Consideration") upon surrender of the
certificate representing such Shares as provided in Article II. Each Series B
Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(excluding Appraisal Shares) shall be canceled and shall by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof be converted
automatically into the right to receive $172.01 in cash, without interest
(the "Series B Merger Consideration" and, together with the Common Merger
Consideration and the Series A Merger Consideration, the "Merger
Consideration") upon surrender of the certificate representing such Shares as
provided in Article II. All such Shares, when so converted, shall no longer
be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall
cease to exist, and each holder of a Certificate representing such Shares
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the Merger Consideration into which such Shares have been converted,
as provided herein.   (b) Each Share that is owned by the Company (or any
Subsidiary of the Company) as treasury stock or otherwise and each Share
owned by Parent shall be canceled and retired and cease to exist and no
payment or distribution shall be made with respect thereto.   (c) Each
share of common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.001 per
share, of the Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the only outstanding
shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.   Section 1.5
Organizational Documents.   (a) At the Effective Time, the Certificate of
Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be the Certificate of
Incorporation of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, except that such Certificate of Incorporation shall be amended to
change the name of the Surviving Corporation to "Corixa Corporation."
Thereafter, the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation may
be amended in accordance with its terms and as provided by Law.   (b) At
the Effective Time, the Bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.
Thereafter, the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation may be amended or
repealed in accordance with their terms and the Certificate of
Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and as provided by Law.  
Section 1.6 Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation. The Company
shall cause to be delivered to Parent, promptly after the date
hereof, resignations of all the directors and officers of the Company to be
effective upon the consummation of the Merger. At the Effective Time, the
directors and officers of Merger Sub shall continue in office as the
directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation, and such directors and
officers shall hold office in accordance with and subject to the Certificate
of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.   Section 1.7
Company Stock Options.   (a) At the Effective Time, each then-outstanding
Company Stock Option, including unvested Company Stock Options, shall be
cancelled, (i) in the case of a Company Stock Option having a per share
exercise price less than the Common Merger Consideration, for the right to
receive from the Surviving Corporation for each Common Share subject to such
Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time an amount
(subject to any applicable withholding tax) in cash equal to the product of
(A) the number of Common Shares subject to such Company Stock Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) the amount by which the
Common Merger Consideration exceeds the per share exercise price of
such Company Stock Option; or (ii) in the case of a Company Stock Option
having a per share exercise price equal to or greater than the Common Merger
Consideration, without the payment of cash or issuance of other securities in
respect thereof. The cancellation of a Company Stock Option as provided in
the immediately preceding sentence shall be deemed a release of any and all
rights the holder thereof had or may have had in respect of such Company
Stock Option. The Company shall take such actions as may be necessary to
accelerate all Company Stock Options that are not vested Company Stock
Options as of the Effective Time.   (b) Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall take such actions as may be necessary to give effect to the
transactions contemplated by this Section 1.7, including, but not limited to,
satisfaction of the requirements of Rule 16b-3(e) under the Exchange Act.  
(c) Except as otherwise agreed to by the parties, (i) the Company Option
Plans shall terminate as of the Effective Time and the provisions in
any other plan, program or arrangement providing for the issuance or grant of
any other interest in respect of the capital stock of the Company or any
Subsidiary thereof shall be canceled as of the Effective Time and (ii) the
Company shall ensure that following the Effective Time no participant in the
Company Option Plans or other plans, programs or arrangements shall have any
right thereunder to acquire any equity securities of the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary thereof.   (d) Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall deliver to the holders of Company Stock
Options notices, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent,
setting forth such holders\' rights pursuant to this Agreement.   Section
1.8 Company ESPPs. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all
actions necessary pursuant to the terms of the Company ESPPs to (i) shorten
each currently ongoing purchase and/or offering period under such Company
ESPP that extends beyond the Effective Time (the "Current Offerings") such
that a new purchase date for each such Current Offering shall occur prior to
the Effective Time and Common Shares shall be purchased by the Company
ESPPs participants prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) preclude the
commencement of any new purchase or offering period. The Company shall take
all actions necessary so that the Company ESPPs shall terminate immediately
prior to the earlier of (i) the Effective Time and (ii) the date upon which
the Company ESPPs terminate by their respective terms.   Section 1.9
Company Warrants. As a result of the Merger, from and after the Effective
Time each Company Warrant shall be exercisable for, during the
period specified in such Company Warrant and upon payment of such Company
Warrant\'s exercise price, only the product of (A) the Common Merger
Consideration and (B) the number of Common Shares deliverable upon exercise
of such Company Warrant as if exercised immediately prior to the Effective
Time.   Section 1.10 Appraisal Shares. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, any Appraisal Shares shall not be converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 1.4(a),
but instead such holders of Appraisal Shares shall be entitled to payment of
the fair value of such shares in accordance with the provisions of Section
262. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such holder shall fail to perfect
or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under
Section 262 or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such
holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262, then the right
of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holder\'s Appraisal Shares
under Section 262 shall cease and such Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to
have been converted at the Effective Time into, and shall have become, the
right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 1.4(a)
without interest. The Company shall serve prompt notice to Parent of any
demands for appraisal of any of the Shares, attempted withdrawals of such
demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL received by the
Company, and Parent shall have the right to participate in and direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall
not, without the prior written consent of Parent, or as otherwise required
under the DGCL, voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or
offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do or commit to do any of
the foregoing.   Section 1.11 Adjustments to Prevent Dilution.
Notwithstanding the restrictions contained in Section 5.1, in the event that
the Company changes the number of Shares, or securities convertible or
exchangeable into or exercisable for Shares, issued and outstanding prior to
the Effective Time as a result of a reclassification, stock split (including
a reverse stock split), stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization,
merger, subdivision, issuer tender or exchange offer, or other similar
transaction, the Merger Consideration shall be proportionately adjusted to
reflect such change.   ARTICLE II   EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES   Section
2.1 Paying Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint the
Paying Agent to act as paying agent for the payment of the
Merger Consideration upon surrender of the Certificates pursuant to this
Article II. After the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or cause to be
deposited with the Paying Agent on a timely basis, if and when needed for the
benefit of the Company Stockholders and for payment in accordance with this
Article II through the Paying Agent, cash in an amount sufficient to pay the
aggregate Merger Consideration (such cash being hereinafter referred to as
the "Exchange Fund"), payable pursuant to Section 1.4 in exchange for
outstanding Shares. Any income from investment of the Exchange Fund, which
shall be in accordance with the instructions of Parent, will be payable
solely to Parent.   Section 2.2 Exchange Procedures.   (a) As soon as
practicable after the Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall mail to each
holder of record of a Certificate or Certificates that, immediately prior to
the Effective Time, represented outstanding Shares subsequently converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, as set forth in Section
1.4: (A) a letter of transmittal (a "Letter of Transmittal") that (i) shall
specify that delivery shall be effected and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the
Paying Agent (or an affidavit of loss in lieu thereof, together with any bond
or indemnity agreement, as contemplated by Section 2.6) and (ii) shall be in
such form and have such other provisions as the Surviving Corporation may
reasonably specify; and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender
of the Certificates in exchange for the applicable Merger Consideration.  
(b) Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent,
together with a Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and executed, and any
other documents reasonably required by the Paying Agent or the
Surviving Corporation, (A) the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled
to receive in exchange therefor a check representing the applicable amount of
cash that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 1.4 and
(B) the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. No interest
will be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon surrender of the
Certificates. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each
such Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the applicable Merger
Consideration.   (c) In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that
is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the appropriate
amount of the Merger Consideration may be paid to a transferee if the
Certificate representing such Shares is presented to the Paying Agent
properly endorsed or accompanied by appropriate stock powers and otherwise in
proper form for transfer and accompanied by all documents reasonably required
by the Paying Agent to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that
any applicable Taxes have been paid.   Section 2.3 No Further Ownership
Rights. All Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of the
Certificates representing Shares in accordance with the terms hereof shall be
deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
such Shares and, after the Effective Time, there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the transfer books of the Surviving Corporation
of the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided
in this Article II, subject to applicable Law in the case of
Appraisal Shares.   Section 2.4 Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion
of the Exchange Fund (including any interest and other income received with
respect thereto) that remains undistributed to the former Company
Stockholders on the date 180 days after the Effective Time shall be delivered
to the Surviving Corporation upon demand, and any former holder of Shares who
has not theretofore received any applicable Merger Consideration to which
such Company Stockholder is entitled under this Article II shall thereafter
look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property,
escheat or other similar Laws) for payment of claims with respect thereto and
only as a general creditor thereof.   Section 2.5 No Liability. None of
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or Merger Sub shall be liable to any holder
of Shares for any part of the Merger Consideration delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Law. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of any such Shares one (1)
year after the Effective Time or at such earlier date as is immediately prior
to the time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become
property of, any Governmental Entity shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law or Order, become the property of the Surviving Corporation
free and clear of any claims or interest of any such holders or their
successors, assigns or personal representatives previously entitled
thereto.   Section 2.6 Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. If any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if required by and at the discretion of Parent or
the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in such
reasonable amount as Parent or the Surviving Corporation may direct, or the
execution and delivery by such Person of an indemnity agreement in such form
as Parent or the Surviving Corporation may direct, in each case as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate the appropriate amount of the Merger
Consideration.   Section 2.7 Withholding of Tax. Parent, the Surviving
Corporation, any Affiliate thereof or the Paying Agent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration otherwise payable pursuant
to this Agreement to any holder of Shares such amount as Parent, the
Surviving Corporation, any Affiliate thereof or the Paying Agent is required
to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the
Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent,
such withheld amounts shall be (a) paid over to the applicable Governmental
Entity in accordance with applicable Law or Order and (b) treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the former holder of a
Certificate in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.  
ARTICLE III   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY   Except as

and is in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize such
concept) in each jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned,
leased or operated by it or the nature of its business makes such
qualification or licensing necessary, except where the failure to be so
qualified or licensed would not reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.   (b) The copies of the Company Certificate of
Incorporation and Company Bylaws that are filed as exhibits to the Company
10-K are complete and correct copies thereof as in effect on the date hereof.

and similar Laws affecting the enforcement of creditors\' rights or remedies
in general as from time to time in effect or (ii) the exercise by courts of
equity powers.   (b) As of the date of this Agreement, each of the Company

by it to exempt this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents and the

respective directors or officers in their capacities as such, other than as

matters set forth on Section 3.7 of the Company Disclosure Letter would
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.   (b)
There is not any Order outstanding against the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or their respective businesses (i) which would reasonably
be expected to have the effect of materially restricting or materially
impairing any current or future business practice of, or acquisition of

would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.  
Section 3.8 Company Reports; Financial Statements.   (a) The Company has
timely filed all Company Reports required to be filed with the SEC on or
prior to the date hereof and will timely file all Company Reports required to
be filed with the SEC after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time.
Each Company Report has complied, or will comply as the case may be, in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act, and
the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or the Exchange Act, and
the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, as applicable, each as in
effect on the date so filed. None of the Company Reports (including any
financial statements or schedules included or incorporated by reference
therein) contained or will contain, as the case may be, when filed (and, in
the case of registration statement and proxy statements, on the dates of
effectiveness and the dates of mailing, respectively) any untrue statement
of a material fact or omitted or omits or will omit, as the case may be, to
state a material fact required to be stated or incorporated by reference
therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were or are made, not misleading. No executive
officer of the Company has failed in any respect to make the certifications
required of him or her under Section 302, 404 or 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act with respect to any Company Report. Between December 31, 2004 and the
date hereof, no event has occurred (other than the execution of this
Agreement) that requires or will require the Company to file a Form 8-K with
the SEC that has not been filed prior to the date hereof by the Company.  
(b) The Company has made available (including via the SEC\'s EDGAR system, as
applicable) to Parent all of the Company Financial Statements. All of the
Company Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with
GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods involved (except as
may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly present in all material
respects the consolidated financial position of the Company at the respective
dates thereof and the consolidated results of its operations and changes in
cash flows for the periods indicated (subject, in the case of unaudited
statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments consistent with GAAP).  
(c) The Company and its Subsidiaries have implemented and maintain a system
of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements in accordance with GAAP. The Company (i) has
implemented and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that information relating to
the Company, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, required to be
disclosed in the reports the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act,
is made known to the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer
of the Company by others within those entities, and (ii) has disclosed, based
on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to the Company\'s
outside auditors and the audit committee of the Company Board of Directors
(A) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
operation of internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule
13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to adversely
affect the Company\'s ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the
Company\'s internal controls over financial reporting. These disclosures were
made in writing by management to the Company\'s auditors and audit committee
and a copy has previously been made available to Parent. There is no reason
to believe that the Company\'s outside auditors and its chief executive
officer and chief financial officer will not be able to give
the certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and
regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act,
without qualification, when due.   (d) Since December 31, 2002, (i) neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries nor, to the Knowledge of the Company,
any director, officer, employee, auditor, accountant or representative of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries has received or otherwise had or obtained
knowledge of any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether
written or oral, regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures,
methodologies or methods of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their
respective internal accounting controls, including any material complaint,
allegation, assertion or claim that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
has engaged in improper accounting or auditing practices, and (ii) no
attorney representing the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not
employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of
a material violation of securities Laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar
violation by the Company or any of its officers, directors, employees or
agents to the Company Board of Directors or any committee thereof or to any
director or officer of the Company.   (e) There are no Liabilities of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries of any kind whatsoever, whether or not
accrued and whether or not contingent or absolute, that are material to the
Company and that are not set forth on the Company Financial Statements, other
than (i) Liabilities incurred on behalf of the Company under this Agreement
and (ii) Liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice since December 31, 2004, none of which would reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.   (f) The Company has
heretofore made available to Parent a complete and correct copy of any
amendments or modifications that have not yet been filed with the SEC to
agreements, documents or other instruments that previously had been filed by
the Company with the SEC as exhibits to the Company Reports pursuant to the
Securities Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder or the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.  
Section 3.9 Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Except as disclosed in the
Company Reports filed with the SEC prior to the date hereof or
as contemplated by this Agreement, since December 31, 2004, each of the
Company and its Subsidiaries has conducted its business only in the ordinary
course and consistent with prior practice, and there has not been (a) any
Company Material Adverse Effect, or (b) any action taken the Company or its
Subsidiaries that, if taken during the period from the date of this Agreement
through the Effective Time without the prior written approval of Parent,
would constitute a breach of Section 5.1(b)(i), (ii), (iii), (vii), (viii),
(ix), (x), (xi), (xii), (xiii), (xiv), (xv), (xvi), (xvii), (xviii), (xix) or
(xx).   Section 3.10 Taxes.   (a) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries
has timely filed and will timely file with the appropriate Governmental
Entities all Tax Returns that are required to be filed by it prior to the
Effective Time. All such Tax Returns were correct and complete in all
material respects and, in the case of Tax Returns to be filed, will be
correct and complete in all material respects. All Taxes shown on such Tax
Returns have been timely paid and, in the case of Tax Returns to be filed,
will be timely paid. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
currently is the beneficiary of any extension of time within which to file
any Tax Return. No claim has ever been made in writing by an authority in a
jurisdiction where the Company does not file Tax Returns that the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries is or may be subject to taxation in
that jurisdiction. There are no security interests or other liens on any of
the assets of the Company or its Subsidiaries that arose in connection with
any failure (or alleged failure) to pay any Tax, other than liens for Taxes
not yet due and payable.   (b) The Company and its Subsidiaries have timely
withheld and paid to the appropriate Governmental Entity all material Taxes
required to have been withheld and paid in connection with amounts paid or
owing to any employee, independent contractor, creditor, stockholder or other
Third Party.   (c) There is no dispute concerning any Tax Liability of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries raised by any Governmental Entity in
writing to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that remains unpaid, and
the Company has not received written notice of any threatened audits or
investigations relating to any Taxes nor otherwise has any Knowledge of any
material threatened audits or investigations relating to any Taxes, in each
case for which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries may become directly or
indirectly liable.   (d) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
waived any statute of limitations in respect of Taxes or agreed to, or
requested, any extension of time with respect to a Tax assessment or
deficiency.   (e) The unpaid Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries did
not, as of December 31, 2004, exceed the reserve for Tax Liability (rather
than any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences
between book and Tax income) set forth on the face of the balance sheet set
forth in the Company Financial Statements as of such date (disregarding any
notes thereto). Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred
any Tax Liability since December 31, 2004 other than a Tax Liability in the
ordinary course of business.   (f) The Company has made available to Parent
complete and accurate copies of all Tax Returns filed by the Company and any
of its Subsidiaries on or prior to the date hereof for all tax periods
beginning on or after January 1, 2002.   (g) There are no agreements

its Subsidiaries is a party.   (h) Neither the Company nor any of its

reason of Section 1445 of the Code. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has constituted either an "expatriated entity" within the
meaning of Section 7874(a)(2)(A) of the Code or a "surrogate foreign
corporation" within the meaning of Section 7874(a)(2)(B) of the Code.   (j)

to make any adjustments pursuant to Section 481(a) of the Code or any similar
provision of state, local or foreign law by reason of a change in accounting
method initiated by it or any other relevant party and, the IRS has not
proposed any such adjustment or change in accounting method in writing
nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, otherwise proposed any material
adjustment or change in accounting method, nor does the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries have any application pending with any Governmental Entity
requesting permission for any changes in accounting methods that relate to
the business or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.   (k) No

ordinary wear and tear excepted, are operated in accordance with all
applicable licenses, permits, consents and governmental authorizations, and

not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each of
the Company and each of its Subsidiaries either owns, or has valid leasehold
interests in, all tangible personal properties and assets used by it in the
conduct of its business, except where the absence of such ownership or
leasehold interest would not reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any legal obligation, absolute or contingent, to any other
Person to sell or otherwise dispose of any of its tangible personal

value thereof. There are no purchase options or rights of first refusal
outstanding with respect to any of the real properties owned by the Company.

breached or is in default in any material respect under any covenant,
agreement, term or condition contained in any lease of real property to which

Subsidiaries nor, to the best Knowledge of the Company, any third party is in
material violation of any license, sublicense or agreement described in
Section 3.17(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter. The execution and delivery

registered trademarks, service marks and copyrights held by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries are valid and are existing and there is no assertion
or claim pending challenging the validity of any Company Intellectual
Property owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. In each case where

suit, action or proceeding being threatened against the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries. To the Knowledge of the Company, neither the conduct of
the business of the Company and each Subsidiary of the Company as

patent right, industrial model, invention, service mark or copyright of any
third party. No third party has challenged in the past six (6) years or
currently is challenging the ownership by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or the validity of, any of the Company Intellectual Property

business as currently conducted. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has brought in the past six (6) years or currently is bringing
any action, suit or proceeding for infringement of the Company Intellectual

its Subsidiaries, except such as may have been commenced by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries.   (e) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries

give prompt notice to the Company, of the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of
any event the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of which is likely to (i) cause
any representation or warranty made by such party contained in this Agreement
(disregarding any materiality qualification contained therein) to be untrue
or inaccurate in any material respect if made as of any time at or prior to
the Effective Time or (ii) result in any material failure of such party to
comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement; provided, however,
that no such notification shall affect the representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements of the parties or the conditions to the obligations
of the parties under this Agreement.   (e) The Company shall (i) take all
actions necessary to ensure that no Antitakeover Law is applicable or becomes
operative with respect to the Merger, the Transaction Documents or any other
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and (ii) if any Antitakeover Law

practicable after execution of this Agreement, Parent and the Company shall
in consultation with each other prepare, and the Company shall file with the
SEC, preliminary proxy materials which shall constitute the Proxy Statement.
As promptly as practicable after comments are received from the SEC thereon
and after the furnishing by the Company and Parent of all information
required to be contained therein, Parent and the Company shall, in
consultation with each other, prepare and the Company shall file any required
amendments to, and the definitive, Proxy Statement with the SEC. The Company
shall notify Parent promptly of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or
its staff and of any request by the SEC or its staff for amendments
or supplements to the Proxy Statement or for additional information and
shall consult with Parent regarding, and supply Parent with copies of,
all correspondence between the Company or any of its Representatives, on the
one hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the
Proxy Statement.   (b) The Company shall furnish Parent with all
information concerning the Company and the holders of its capital stock and
shall take such other action as Parent may reasonably request in connection
with the payment of the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section
2.1(a). If at any time prior to the Effective Time any event or circumstance
relating to the Company, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries,

should be set forth in a supplement to the Proxy Statement, such party shall
promptly inform the other thereof and the Company shall promptly prepare and

Meeting.   (a) The Company, acting through the Company Board of Directors,
shall take all actions in accordance with applicable law, the Company
Certificate of Incorporation, the Company Bylaws and the rules of Nasdaq to
promptly and duly call, give notice of, convene and hold as promptly as
practicable the Company Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of considering
and voting upon the adoption of the "agreement of merger" (as such term is
used in Section 251 of the DGCL) contained in this Agreement. Subject to
Section 5.6(c), to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, (i) the
Company Board of Directors shall recommend adoption of the "agreement of
merger" (as such term is used in Section 251 of the DGCL) contained in this
Agreement and approval of the Merger by the Company Stockholders and include
such recommendation in the Proxy Statement and (ii) neither the Company Board
of Directors nor any committee thereof shall withdraw or modify, or propose
or resolve to withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent, the
recommendation of the Company Board of Directors that the
Company Stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of the "agreement of
merger" (as such term is used in Section 251 of the DGCL) contained in this
Agreement and approval of the Merger. Unless this Agreement has been duly
terminated in accordance with the terms herein (including payment of any
termination fees payable under Article VII), the Company shall, subject to
the right of the Company Board of Directors to modify its recommendation in a
manner adverse to Parent under certain circumstances as specified in Section
5.6(c), take all lawful action to solicit from the Company Stockholders
proxies in favor of the proposal to adopt the "agreement of merger" (as such
term is used in Section 251 of the DGCL) contained in this Agreement and
approve the Merger and shall take all other action necessary or advisable to
secure the vote or consent of the Company Stockholders that are required by
the rules of Nasdaq or the DGCL. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, the Company, after consultation with Parent, may
adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting to the extent necessary
to ensure that any legally required supplement or amendment to the Proxy
Statement is provided to the Company Stockholders or, if as of the time for
which the Company Stockholders Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth
in the Proxy Statement), there are insufficient shares of Company Common
Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum
necessary to conduct the business of the Company Stockholders Meeting.  
(b) At or prior to the Closing, the Company shall deliver to Parent
a certificate of its Corporate Secretary setting forth the voting results
from the Company Stockholders Meeting.   Section 5.6 No Solicitation of
Transactions.   (a) The Company shall, and shall cause its Affiliates,
Representatives and any other agents to immediately cease any discussions,
negotiations or communications with any party or parties with respect to any
Competing Transaction.   (b) The Company shall not, nor shall it authorize
or permit any Affiliate or Representative of the Company or its Subsidiaries
to, (i) solicit, initiate, intentionally encourage, participate in or
otherwise facilitate, directly or indirectly, any inquiries relating to, or
the submission of, any Competing Transaction or (ii) directly or indirectly
solicit, initiate, intentionally encourage, participate in or otherwise
facilitate any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Third
Party any information or data with respect to or provide access to the
properties, offices, books, records, officers, directors or employees of, or
take any other action to knowingly, directly or indirectly, solicit,
initiate, intentionally encourage, participate in or otherwise facilitate the
making of any proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to
lead to, any Competing Transaction. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, it is understood that any violation of any of the restrictions set
forth in this Section 5.6 by any Representative or Affiliate of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section 5.6
by the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, prior to obtaining the
Company Required Vote, (i) the Company has complied with this Section 5.6,
and (ii) the Company Board of Directors reasonably determines in good faith
that a Competing Transaction constitutes or would reasonably be expected to
lead to a Superior Competing Transaction, then, to the extent required by the
fiduciary obligations of the Company Board of Directors, as determined in
good faith by a majority thereof after consultation with the Company\'s
outside counsel, the Company may, subject to the Company\'s providing prior
written notice to Parent of its decision to take such action and compliance
by the Company with Section 5.6(d), furnish information with respect to the
Company to, and participate in discussions and negotiations directly
or through its Representatives with, such Third Party, subject to a
confidentiality agreement not materially less favorable to the Company than
the Confidentiality Agreement, provided, that all such information not
theretofor provided to Parent is provided to Parent prior to or as soon as
reasonable practicable after it is provided to such Third Party.   (c)
Neither the Company Board of Directors nor any committee thereof shall (i)
withdraw or modify, or propose or resolve to withdraw or modify, in a manner
adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the approval and recommendation by
the Company Board of Directors of the Merger, this Agreement and the
"agreement of merger" (as such term is used in Section 251 of the DGCL)
contained herein, the Transaction Documents, the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby and the actions taken in connection herewith and
therewith, (ii) approve or recommend, or propose or resolve to approve or
recommend, any Competing Transaction, (iii) approve or recommend, or propose
or resolve to approve or recommend, or execute or enter into, any Acquisition
Agreement, (iv) approve or recommend, or propose or resolve to approve or
recommend, or execute or enter into, any agreement (written or oral)
requiring it to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Merger, this
Agreement, any Transaction Document or the transactions contemplated hereby
or thereby, (v) take any action necessary to render the provisions of any
Antitakeover Law inapplicable to any Competing Transaction, or (vi) propose
or agree to do any of the foregoing constituting or related to, or that is
intended to or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any
Competing Transaction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to obtaining the
Company Required Vote, in response to a Superior Competing Transaction that
was not solicited, initiated, intentionally encouraged, participated in or
otherwise facilitated by the Company in breach of Section 5.6(b), the Company
Board of Directors may, if it determines in good faith (after consultation
with the Company\'s outside legal counsel) that the failure to do so would
result in a breach of the fiduciary duties of the Company Board of Directors
to the Company Stockholders under applicable Law or Order, (1) modify, or
propose or resolve to modify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub,
the approvals and recommendations of the Company Board of Directors of the
Merger, or the transactions contemplated hereby or by the Transaction
Documents, or (2) terminate the Agreement in accordance with Section 7.1(d),
but in each case only (y) at a time that is after the fifth (5th) Business
Day following Parent\'s receipt of written notice advising Parent that the
Company Board of Directors is prepared to take such action (during which
period the Company shall negotiate in good faith with Parent concerning any
New Parent Proposal), specifying therein all of the terms and conditions of
such Superior Competing Transaction, and identifying the Person or group
making such Superior Competing Transaction and (z) if, after the end of such
five (5) Business Day period, the Company Board of Directors determines in
good faith (after consultation with the Company\'s outside legal counsel and
financial advisor) that such proposed transaction continues to be a Superior
Competing Transaction, after taking into account any New Parent Proposal. The
Company shall not during the term of this Agreement release any Third Party
from, or agree to amend or waive any provision of any confidentiality
agreement, and the Company shall take all reasonable best efforts to enforce,
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws, each confidentiality
agreement entered into pursuant to this Section 5.6 and any other
confidentiality agreement to which the Company is or becomes a party.   (d)
In addition to the obligations set forth in Sections 5.6(a), (b) and (c), the
Company shall advise Parent orally and, if requested by Parent, in writing of
(i) any Competing Transaction or any offer, proposal or inquiry with respect
to or which could reasonably be expected to lead to any Competing Transaction
received by any officer or director of the Company or, to the Knowledge of
the Company, other Representative of the Company, (ii) the terms and
conditions of such Competing Transaction (including a copy of any
written proposal) and (iii) the identity of the Person or group making the
offer, proposal or inquiry for any such Competing Transaction immediately
(but in any event within thirty-six (36) hours) following receipt by the
Company or any officer or director of the Company or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, any other Representative of the Company of such Competing
Transaction offer, proposal or inquiry. If the Company or its Subsidiaries or
any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives participates in
substantive discussions or any negotiations with, or provides material
information in connection with any such Competing Transaction, the Company
shall keep Parent advised on a current basis of any developments with respect
thereto. The Company agrees to notify Parent immediately if the Company Board
of Directors determines that a Competing Transaction is not a Superior
Competing Transaction.   (e) Nothing contained in this Section 5.6 or any
other provision hereof shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board of
Directors from taking and disclosing to the Company Stockholders pursuant to
Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act a position with
respect to a tender or exchange offer by a Third Party that is consistent
with its obligations hereunder; provided, however, that neither the Company
nor the Company Board of Directors may either, except as provided by Section
5.6(c), (i) modify, or propose publicly to modify, in a manner adverse to
Parent and Merger Sub, the approvals or recommendations of the Company Board
of Directors of the Merger or this Agreement and the "agreement of merger"
(as such term is used in Section 251 of the DGCL) contained herein, or (ii)
approve or recommend a Competing Transaction, or propose publicly to approve
or recommend a Competing Transaction.   (f) Nothing in this Section 5.6
shall permit the Company to terminate this Agreement (except as expressly
provided in Article VII).   Section 5.7 Public Announcements. The Company
and Parent shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or
otherwise making any public statements with respect to this Agreement or any
of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents and shall not
issue any such press release or make any such public statement without the
prior consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed; provided, however, that a party may, without the prior
consent of the other party, issue such press release or make such public
statement as may be required by Law or Order or the applicable rules of
Nasdaq or any listing agreement if it has used its commercially reasonable
efforts to consult with the other party and to obtain such party\'s consent
but has been unable to do so prior to the time such press release or public
statement is so required to be issued or made.   Section 5.8 Litigation.
Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agrees to use its commercially
reasonable efforts to defend any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether
judicial or administrative, challenging, or seeking damages or other relief
as a result of, the Merger, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
by the Transaction Documents, including seeking to have any Order adversely
affecting the ability of the parties to consummate the
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents entered by any court
or other Governmental Entity promptly vacated or reversed. Without limiting
the foregoing, the Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate
in the defense or settlement of any stockholder litigation against the
Company and/or any of its directors relating to the transactions contemplated
by the Transaction Documents or the Merger; and no such settlement shall be
agreed to without Parent\'s consent, which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld.   Section 5.9 Employee Benefit Matters.   (a) From and after the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to honor and
provide for payment of all accrued obligations and benefits under all Company
Benefit Plans set forth, and identified as such, in the Company Disclosure
Letter (including, without limitation, employment or severance agreements
between the Company and Persons who are or had been employees of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries at or prior to the Effective Time), all in
accordance with their respective terms.   (b) For at least one year after
the Effective Time, Parent will offer, or cause the Surviving Corporation to
offer Company Employees compensation opportunities and employee benefits that
are comparable in value in the aggregate with the compensation and employee
benefits (exclusive of any such compensation and benefits consisting of or
based on any equity securities of the Company, including under the Company
Stock Option Plans and the Company ESPPs) provided under the Company Benefit
Plans to the Company Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time in the
ordinary course and not in contemplation of the transactions contemplated by
this agreement. Company Employees shall receive credit for past service with
the Company for purposes of accrual of vacation time and for purposes of
eligibility for participation and vesting under Parent Benefit Plans in which
such Company Employees are permitted, at the discretion of the Parent, to
participate other than for purposes of determining eligibility for
participation under any retiree medical plan or defined benefit plan of
the Parent.   (c) All actively-at-work or similar limitations, eligibility
waiting periods and evidence of insurability requirements under any Parent
Benefit Plan that is a group health plan shall be waived with respect to such
Company Employees and their eligible dependents, in each case, to the same
extent as service with the Company or its Subsidiaries was taken into account
under the comparable Company Benefit Plan, and credit shall be provided for
any co-payments, deductibles and offsets (or similar payments) made under
Company Benefit Plans for the applicable plan year prior to the Effective
Time for purposes of satisfying any applicable deductible, out-of-pocket or
similar requirements under any Parent Benefit Plans in which they become
eligible to participate after the Effective Time.   (d) Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, from and after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation will have sole discretion over the hiring,
promotion, retention, firing and other terms and conditions of the employment
of employees of the Surviving Corporation. Except as otherwise provided in
this Section 5.9, nothing herein shall prevent Parent or the Surviving
Corporation from amending or terminating any Company Benefit Plan in
accordance with its terms.   (e) The Company and its Subsidiaries will
consult with Parent with respect to any communication (written, electronic or
oral) intended to be broadly circulated, or available generally, to any of
Company Employees relating to the transactions contemplated hereby and the
form and substance of any such communication shall be subject to approval by
Parent, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.  
Section 5.10 Directors\' and Officers\' Indemnification and Insurance.   (a)
From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify
and hold harmless all past and present officers and directors of the Company
to the same extent and in the same manner such persons are indemnified as of
the date of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to any
indemnification agreements between the Company and its directors and officers
as of the date hereof, the DGCL, the Company Certificate of Incorporation and
the Company Bylaws for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time, and Parent shall guarantee such performance by the Surviving
Corporation. The Certificate of Incorporation and the Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation will contain provisions with respect to exculpation and
indemnification that are at least as favorable to the indemnified parties as
those contained in the Company Certificate of Incorporation and the Company
Bylaws as in effect on the date hereof, which provisions will not be amended,
repealed or otherwise modified for a period of not less than six years from
the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of individuals who, immediately prior to the Effective Time, were
directors, officers, employees or agents of the Company, unless such a
modification is required by Law.   (b) For a period of six years from the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain in
effect (or Parent may instead elect to maintain pursuant to Parent\'s policy
or policies) for the benefit of the Company\'s current directors and officers
an insurance and indemnification policy that provides coverage for acts or
omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time that is substantially
equivalent to the Company\'s existing policy on terms with respect to
coverage in the aggregate no less favorable than those of such policy in
effect on the date hereof, or, if substantially equivalent insurance coverage
is unavailable, the best available coverage; provided, however, that the
Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay an annual premium for such
insurance in excess of 200% of the last annual premiums paid prior to the
date hereof (which premiums the Company has disclosed to Parent), but in such
case shall purchase as much coverage as possible for such amount.   (c) This
Section 5.10 shall survive the consummation of the Merger, is intended to
benefit the Company, the Surviving Corporation and each indemnified party,
shall be binding on all successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation
and Parent, and shall be enforceable by the indemnified parties.
The provisions of this Section 5.10 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and will be enforceable by, each indemnified party, his or her heirs, and his
or her representatives and are in addition to, and not in substitution for,
any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person may
have by contract or otherwise.   Section 5.11 Montana Facility Expansion.
The Company shall use its best efforts to proceed in a timely manner with the
Montana Expansion, including authorizing (and incurring the reasonable
expenses related to) the preparation and completion of each of the
preliminary and final designs for the Montana Expansion, and ordering
supplies and equipment at such time as is reasonably believed to be necessary
to avoid delays in the Montana Expansion. Parent and the Company shall
cooperate to obtain all consents and approvals reasonably believed to be
necessary in connection with the Montana Expansion, including applying for
and obtaining the preliminary permit to begin construction of the Montana
Expansion. Following execution of this Agreement, the parties shall establish
a committee consisting of two representatives of each of the Company and
Parent, which will meet regularly (but in any event no less than weekly)
by telephone or in person to discuss and update the Parent representatives on
the status of the Montana expansion, including all matters related to its
design, development, construction and approval. The Company shall not take
any action that would reasonably be expected to result in any material delay
or change in the Montana Expansion, without the prior written approval of
Parent, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.   ARTICLE VI

SERVICE   This notice is being provided by Corixa Corporation, a
Delaware corporation (the "Company") pursuant to the requirements of Treasury
Regulation Section 1.897-2(H)(2).   The Company is located at 1900 9th
Avenue, Seattle, Washington, 98101. The Company\'s Taxpayer Identification
Number is 91-1654367.   The attached Notice of Non-U.S. Real Property
Holding Corporation Status was not requested by a foreign interest holder.
Rather, it was requested by SmithKline Beecham Corporation, a Pennsylvania

capital stock of the Company. Parent is located at 2301 Renaissance Boulevard
(Mailcode RN0220), King of Prussia, PA 19406 2772. Parent\'s Taxpayer
Identification Number is [51-0374608][Confirm].   The interests in question
(shares of the Company stock to be received by Parent pursuant to an
Agreement and Plan of Merger) are not U.S. Real Property Interests.   Under
penalties of perjury, I declare that I have examined this notice and the
attachment hereto and to the best of my knowledge and belief they are true,
correct and complete, and I further declare that I have authority to
sign this document on behalf of the Company.      CORIXA

receive shares of the Company\'s capital stock in exchange for the merger
consideration provided for in the Agreement and Plan of Merger .   Section
1445 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), provides
that a transferee of a U.S. Real Property Interest must withhold tax if the
transferor is not a U.S. person. In order to confirm that Parent, as
transferee, is not required to withhold tax upon the receipt of the capital
stock of the Company in exchange for the merger consideration,
the undersigned, in his capacity as Chief Executive Officer of the
Company:  1. The capital stock of the Company outstanding immediately prior
to the  merger does not constitute a U.S. Real Property Interest as that
term  is defined in Section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii) of the Code.  2. The assertion
in Paragraph 1 above is based on a determination by the  Company that the
Company is not and has not been a U.S. Real Property  Holding Corporation, as
that term is defined in Section 897(c)(2) of  the Code at any time during the
five-year period preceding the date of  this Notice.  3. The Company is not
a foreign corporation, foreign partnership, foreign  trust or foreign estate
(as those terms are defined in the Code and the  related regulations).  4.
The Company\'s U.S. employer identification number is 91-1654367.  5. The
Company is not a disregarded entity as defined in Section 
1.1445-2(b)(2)(iii) of the Treasury Regulations. 6. The Company\'s  office
address is 1900 9th Avenue, Seattle, Washington 98101. 7. The  Company will

notice is delivered to Parent.   This notice is made in accordance with the
requirements of Treasury Regulation Sections 1.897-2(h) and 1.1445-2(c)(3).
The Company understands that any false statement contained herein could be
punished by fine, imprisonment or both.        Under penalties of
perjury I declare that I have examined this notice and to the best of my
knowledge and belief it is true, correct and complete, and I further declare
that I have authority to sign this notice on behalf of the Company.
