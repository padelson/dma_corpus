The "Purchase Price" shall be an amount in cash equal to the Base Price: (i)

Time (without giving effect to the Closing), exceeds Target Working Capital;
(v) minus the aggregate amount of Indebtedness of the Group Companies, as of
the Reference Time; (vi) minus the amount, if any, by which the aggregate
amount of Quasi-Indebtedness, as of the Reference Time, exceeds Target Quasi-

2.3.3

|

Not less than three Business Days following the Conditions Satisfaction Date,
Seller shall prepare and deliver to Buyer on the basis of, and as determined
in accordance with, the Accounting Principles: (i) its estimate of Cash as of
the Reference Time ("Estimated Cash"); (ii) its estimate of Working Capital,
as of the Reference Time (without giving effect to the Closing) ("Estimated
Working Capital"); (iii) its estimate of the aggregate amount of Indebtedness
of the Group Companies, as of the Reference Time ("Estimated Indebtedness"),
(iv) its estimate of the aggregate amount of Quasi-Indebtedness of the Group
Companies, as of the Reference Time ("Estimated Quasi-Indebtedness"), (v) its
estimate of Transaction Expenses as of the Reference Time ("Estimated 

 Transaction Expenses") and, based thereon: (vi) its calculation of the
Estimated Purchase Price (the "Estimated Statement"). Within two Business Days
after such delivery, if Buyer has any objections to Seller's calculation of
the Estimated Purchase Price, Buyer shall provide a detailed written statement
of its objections to Seller. The Parties shall use their respective good faith
efforts to resolve any dispute regarding the calculation of the Estimated
Purchase Price as promptly as practicable. In case Seller and Buyer do not
reach an agreement until the date falling two Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, then Seller's calculation of Estimated Cash, Estimated Working
Capital, Estimated Indebtedness, Estimated Quasi-Indebtedness, Estimated
Transaction Expenses and the Estimated Purchase Price shall be conclusive for
purposes of closing the transactions contemplated hereby, and will only be
subject to the post Closing adjustment set forth in Section 2.4.

| 
---|--- 

2.3.4

|

Between the date hereof and the Closing Date, the Parties shall cooperate in
good faith to agree on an allocation of the Base Price (on a percentage basis)
between the US Shares and the Lux Shares (such agreement, as documented by the
Parties, the "Master Allocation Statement"). The Final Purchase Price shall be
allocated to the US Shares and the Lux Shares in a manner consistent with the
Master Allocation Statement (taking into account appropriate adjustments for
the location of Cash, Working Capital, Indebtedness, Quasi Indebtedness and
Transaction Expenses). Within 30 days after the determination of the Final
Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.4, Seller shall deliver to Buyer a
schedule (the "Final Allocation Statement") allocating the Final Purchase
Price between the US Shares and the Lux Shares in a manner reasonably
consistent with the allocation percentages shown in Section 2.3.4 of the
Disclosure Schedule unless otherwise mutually agreed by Buyer and Seller. Any
other adjustment to the Final Purchase Price under this Agreement (including
pursuant to Article 9) shall be allocated between the US Shares and the Lux
Shares in a manner consistent with the allocation set forth on the Final
Allocation Statement unless otherwise mutually agreed by Buyer and Seller. If
an alternative allocation is otherwise mutually agreed by Buyer and Seller,
the Final Allocation Statement shall be adjusted accordingly. Buyer and Seller
shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, file all Tax Returns
(including amended returns and claims for refunds) (absent a final
determination that an alternative allocation is required by applicable Law)
and information reports in a manner consistent with the Master Allocation
Statement, and shall not take any position inconsistent with this Section
2.3.4 in the course of any Tax audit by any Taxing Authority relating to any
Tax Returns (including amended returns claims for refunds). Seller, on the one
hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, each agree to notify the other in writing
promptly upon receipt of notice of any pending or threatened Tax audit or
assessment challenging the Master Allocation Statement.

Buyer will prepare and deliver to Seller on the basis of, and as determined in
accordance with, the same principles used to prepare the Estimated Statement,
as promptly as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date, and in any
event no later than 60 days following the Closing Date: (i) its calculation of
Cash as of the Reference Time; (ii) its calculation of Working Capital, as of
the Reference Time (without giving effect to the Closing), (iii) its
calculation of the aggregate amount of Indebtedness of the Group Companies, as
of the Reference Time, (iv) its calculation of the aggregate amount of Quasi-
Indebtedness of the Group Companies, as of the Reference Time, (v) its
calculation of Transaction Expenses as of the Reference Time and (vi) based
thereon, its calculation of the Purchase Price (the "Closing Statement"),
together with supporting documentation and papers reasonably necessary for
Seller to understand and evaluate the Closing Statement. 

| 
---|--- 

2.4.2

|

If Seller disagrees with Buyer's calculation of the Purchase Price delivered
pursuant to Section 2.4.1, Seller may, within 30 days after receipt of the
Closing Statement, send a notice to Buyer (the "Objection Notice") disagreeing
with such calculation and which specifies Seller's calculation of the Purchase
Price and in reasonable detail Seller's grounds for such disagreement. Any
Objection Notice of disagreement shall specify those items or amounts as to
which Seller disagrees, and Seller shall be deemed to have agreed with all
other items and amounts contained in the Closing Statement and calculation of
the Purchase Price delivered pursuant to Section 2.4.1. 

| 
---|--- 

2.4.3

|

If an Objection Notice is sent pursuant to Section 2.4.2, Buyer and Seller
shall, during the 15 days following delivery of the Objection Notice, use
their reasonable best efforts to reach agreement on the disputed items or
amounts in order to determine, as may be required, the amount of the Purchase
Price. If Buyer and Seller are unable to reach such agreement during such
period, they shall promptly thereafter cause the members of the national
office of KPMG or such other Person mutually agreed in writing by the Parties
(the "Accounting Firm"), promptly to review this Agreement and the disputed
items or amounts for the purpose of calculating the Purchase Price. In making
such calculation, the Accounting Firm shall consider only those items or
amounts in the Closing Statement or Buyer's calculation of the Purchase Price
as to which Seller has disagreed. The Accounting Firm shall deliver to Buyer
and Seller, as promptly as practicable but in any event within 30 days
following the date on which the dispute is referred to the Accounting Firm, a
report setting forth such calculation and reasonably detailed explanation of
each required adjustment, including the basis thereof; provided that the
Accounting Firm's decision for each disputed item shall be in the range of
values assigned to each such item in the Closing Statement and Objection
Notice. 

| 
---|--- 

2.4.4

|

The Accounting Firm's determination shall be final and binding upon Seller and
Buyer absent manifest error, shall be deemed a final arbitration award that is 

 binding on Buyer and Seller, and neither Buyer nor Seller shall seek further
recourse to courts or other tribunals, other than to enforce such report. The
fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne by Buyer or Seller in
inverse proportion as each may prevail on the matters resolved by the
Accounting Firm, which allocation will also be determined by the Accounting
Firm and included in its written report.

| 
---|--- 

2.4.5

|

The "Final Purchase Price" shall be: (i) as stated in the Closing Statement,
if Seller fails to deliver a notice of disagreement in accordance with Section
2.4.2, (ii) if Seller delivers a notice of disagreement in accordance with
Section 2.4.2, (A) the Purchase Price mutually agreed to by Buyer and Seller
pursuant to Section 2.4.3, or (B) in the absence of such agreement, the
Purchase Price determined by the Accounting Firm pursuant to Section 2.4.3. 

| 
---|--- 

2.4.6

|

One Business Day after the Final Purchase Price has been determined pursuant
to this Section 2.4, Buyer, if the Final Purchase Price exceeds the Estimated
Purchase Price, or Seller, if the Estimated Purchase Price exceeds the Final
Purchase Price, shall deliver to such other Party, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account specified by the recipient, a cash
amount equal to the sum of the amount of such excess. The amount of any
payment to be made pursuant to this Section 2.4.6 shall bear interest from and
including the Closing Date to but excluding the date of payment at a rate per
annum equal to the U.S. prime rate as published in the Wall Street Journal,
Eastern Edition in effect from time to time during the period from the Closing
Date to the date of payment. Such interest shall be payable at the same time
as the payment to which it relates and shall be calculated daily on the basis
of a year of 365 days and the actual number of days elapsed.

No Withholding

---|--- 

2.5.1

|

Buyer shall make all payments under this Agreement free and clear of all
deductions and withholdings in respect of Taxes, unless such deduction or
withholding is required by applicable Law. Any amount deducted and withheld by
Buyer, and paid to the applicable Taxing Authority, shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person subject to such
deduction and withholding unless such deduction or withholding (i) is required
by applicable Law in effect on the date hereof as applied to the facts as
contemplated by this Agreement as of the date hereof or (ii) would not have
applied but for Buyer's assignment of this Agreement in whole or in part to an
Affiliate. If any deduction or withholding described in clauses (i) or (ii) of
the preceding sentence is required by applicable Law, the amount payable under
this Agreement that is subject to such deduction or withholding shall be
increased as necessary to ensure that, after all required deductions or
withholdings for Taxes are made (including deductions and withholdings
applicable to any increases to any amount payable under this Section 2.5),
Seller receives the amount it would have received had no such deductions or
withholdings been made. 

 |

Each of Buyer and Seller shall (A) promptly notify the other Party upon
becoming aware that Buyer is or may be required by applicable Law to deduct or
withhold from any amount payable to Seller under this Agreement, which notice

withholding and the applicable rate thereof, and (B) use reasonable best
efforts to cooperate with the other Party to minimize or eliminate the amount

Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to avoid or eliminate each
and every impediment under the HSR Act or any Foreign Competition Law that may
be asserted by any Governmental Authority or private party with respect to
this Agreement so as to make effective as promptly as practicable (and in any
event prior to the Longstop Date) the transactions contemplated herein and to
avoid any suit or proceeding, which would otherwise have the effect of
preventing or delaying the Closing beyond the Longstop Date. The steps
involved in the preceding sentence shall include, without limitation: (i)
subject to the Longstop Date, defending through litigation on the merits,
including appeals, any claim asserted in any court or other proceeding by any

soon as reasonably possible, and in any event before the Longstop Date, (B) to
avoid the entry of, or to have vacated, lifted, dissolved, reversed or
overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent, that is in effect in any legal proceeding and that
prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the transactions contemplated
herein or (C) to effect the expiration or termination of any waiting period,
which would otherwise have the effect of preventing or delaying the Closing
beyond the Longstop Date. At the request of Buyer, the Group Companies shall
agree to take any action with respect to the Group Companies in the two
preceding sentences, provided that any such action is conditioned upon (and
shall not be completed prior to) the consummation of the transactions
contemplated herein. Buyer shall not, and shall cause each of its Affiliates
not to, take any action which is intended to or which would reasonably be
expected to adversely affect the ability of any of the Parties hereto from
obtaining (or cause delay in obtaining) any necessary approvals of any
Governmental Authority required for the transactions contemplated herein, from
performing its covenants and agreements under this Agreement, or from
consummating the transactions contemplated herein. Seller and each Company
shall, and shall cause their Subsidiaries to, cooperate with Buyer in
exchanging such information, supplying such assistance and executing such
documents as may be requested by Buyer in connection with the filings and
other actions contemplated by this Section 5.5.4.

From the date hereof until the Closing Date, except with Seller's consent,
Buyer shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, take any action,

or any Foreign Competition Law necessary for the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

executing (or permitting any Affiliate to execute) any Restructuring Document,
Seller shall provide Buyer with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment
thereon. Seller shall provide copies to Buyer of each executed final
Restructuring Document on or prior to the Closing. Between the date of this
Agreement and the Closing Date, Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates
to, use its reasonable best efforts to effect, or cause to be effected, all
actions, and to do and cause to be done, all things necessary proper or
advisable (subject to applicable Laws) to consummate and render effective the
Restructuring Plan in accordance with applicable Law prior to the Closing
Date, including, without limitation, the preparation and filing or delivery of
filings, notices, petitions, statements, registrations, submissions of
information applications and other documents and obtaining of all regulatory
approvals necessary to consummate the Restructuring Plan, and Seller shall not
make any changes to the Restructuring Plan or any Restructuring Document that

5.10

|

Non-Competition; Non-Solicitation 

| 
---|--- 

5.10.1

|

From and after the Closing Date and until the third anniversary thereof,
Seller shall not, and Seller shall cause its Affiliates existing as of the
Closing Date (which for the avoidance of doubt includes the Identified
Affiliate) and its Subsidiaries not to, directly or indirectly, engage or
participate in any Competing Business or own any interest in, manage, control,
lend to or otherwise finance (other than ordinary trade terms), or participate
in the ownership, management, control or financing of, or loan to, any Person
engaged in any Competing Business, or provide consulting services to any
Person engaged in any Competing Business. 

| 
---|---

|

Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit or in
any way limit Seller or its Affiliates from: 

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

being or becoming (a) a passive owner of not more than 5% of the capital
stock, voting stock or other equity interest of any Person engaged in a
Competing Business or (b) subject, from and after the Closing Date and until
the third anniversary thereof, to compliance with Section 5.10.3, acquiring,
owning or operating, or conducting or engaging in any activity through, or
entering into any agreement related to the foregoing with respect to, a
Designated Company; 

| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

owning, operating, conducting or engaging in any manner in any businesses or
activities as conducted or engaged in by Seller or its Affiliates (other than
the Group Companies) as of the date of this Agreement, including the Excluded
Businesses and all activities of National Beef Packing Company LLC and its
Subsidiaries; or 

| 
---|--- 

(iii)

|

owning and operating, conducting or engaging in the Korean Business from and
after the date on which Seller has purchased Buyer's equity interests in McKey
Korea LLC pursuant to Section 5.12 in substantially the same manner as the
Korean Business was operated, conducted and engaged in during the twelve
months ending on June 30, 2017. 

| 
---|--- 

5.10.3

|

As soon as reasonably practicable prior to Seller or any of its Affiliates
existing as of the Closing Date (which for the avoidance of doubt includes the
Identified Affiliate) or its Subsidiaries (the "Designated Business
Purchaser") executing any binding agreement with respect to the acquisition of
more than 5% of the capital stock, voting stock or other equity interest of a
Designated Company pursuant to Section 5.10.2(i)(b) (a "Designated
Acquisition"), Seller shall deliver notice of such Designated Acquisition to
Buyer, and Buyer shall (unless waived 

 by Buyer in writing) have the right to participate in such Designated
Acquisition on equal terms with Seller, in which case Buyer and Seller shall
negotiate in good faith the terms and conditions upon which the parties shall
jointly pursue such Designated Acquisition. If (i) Buyer notifies Seller of
its intention to not pursue the Designated Acquisition with Designated
Business Purchaser or (ii) Buyer and Seller do not reach an agreement within
30 days on terms and conditions pursuant to which they shall jointly pursue
such Designated Acquisition, then Designated Business Purchaser shall be
allowed to proceed alone with the Designated Acquisition.

| 
---|--- 

5.10.4

|

In the event that Designated Business Purchaser completes a Designated
Acquisition without Buyer, then from and after the Closing Date and until the
third anniversary thereof, 

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

Seller shall, within 30 days from closing of the Designated Acquisition,
deliver notice to Buyer of such event and shall cause the Designated Business
Purchaser to comply with the Section 5.10.3. 

| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

Within 30 days of receipt of such notice, Buyer may request the Designated
Business Purchaser to offer to Buyer the opportunity to purchase those
portions of the Designated Business located within any Restricted Territory
that constitute a Competing Business for that Restricted Territory (an
"Overlapping Operation") and Designated Business Purchaser shall provide Buyer
with reasonable information as it has available regarding the nature of the
Overlapping Operation (subject to appropriate confidentiality being agreed and
any competitive or privilege concern on the sharing of information). 

| 
---|--- 

(iii)

|

Each of Buyer and Designated Business Purchaser shall, within 30 days of
delivery by Buyer of the request set forth in paragraph (ii) above, deliver to
each other its good faith estimate of the fair market value (the "Fair Value")
of the Overlapping Operation as of the closing date of the Designated
Acquisition. 

| 
---|--- 

(iv)

|

If the higher of the estimated Fair Values as determined by the parties is
equal to or less than 110% of the lower of the estimated Fair Values as
determined by the parties, then the Fair Value shall be finally determined to
be equal to (i) (x) the higher estimate plus (y) the lower estimate divided by
(ii) two. 

| 
---|--- 

(v)

|

If the higher of the estimated Fair Values as determined by the parties is
greater than 110% of the lower of the estimated Fair Values as determined by
the parties, then the parties shall jointly designate an investment bank that
has not provided substantial services to Buyer or Seller in the previous 3
years (the "Resolving Firm") to determine its estimate of the Fair Value, such
estimate of Fair Value to be delivered by the Resolving Firm to the parties no
later than 30 days after such Resolving Firm's engagement. 

 | 
---|--- 

(vi)

|

If the Resolving Firm's estimate of Fair Value is equal to or between the
estimate of Fair Values made by the initial valuation of the parties, then the
Resolving Firm's estimate of the Fair Value shall be the finally determined
Fair Value. If the Resolving Firm's estimate of Fair Value is not between the
initial estimate of Fair Values made by the parties, then the finally
determined Fair Value shall be equal to (1) (x) the Resolving Firm's estimate
of Fair Value plus (y) the initial estimate of Fair Value by the party whose
estimate was closest to the Fair Value determined by the Resolving Firm
divided by two. 

| 
---|--- 

(vii)

|

The determination of estimated Fair Value as set forth above shall be final
and binding on all parties. In making their determination, each of the parties
and the Resolving Firm shall rely solely on written submissions made by Buyer
and Designated Business Purchaser. 

| 
---|--- 

(viii)

|

Upon determination of the Fair Value, the sale of the Overlapping Operation
shall proceed subject to any necessary regulatory approvals and neither Seller
nor its Affiliates (including the Designated Business Purchaser) shall be
required to make any representations or warranties with respect to the
Overlapping Operation other than (i) with respect to its ownership and (ii)
any representations and warranties as to Designated Business Purchaser's
period of ownership that are similar to the representations and warranties
Designated Business Purchaser received from the seller in the Designated
Acquisition with respect to the Designated Company, adjusted appropriately to
reflect the size and scope of the Overlapping Operation relative to the
Designated Company. 

| 
---|--- 

5.10.5

|

Without limiting any other remedy available to Buyer hereunder or under
applicable Law, in the event Seller or any of its Affiliates, directly or
indirectly, acquires any company or business that includes a Competing
Business in the Restricted Territory (other than a Designated Company which is
addressed solely by Section 5.10.2(i)(b)), Buyer may, within 30 days of
closing of such acquisition, require Seller or such of its Affiliates to sell
the portion of such company or business that represents a Competing Business
to Buyer at a price equal to the Resale Price, subject to the same terms and
conditions set forth in the agreement for the acquisition of such company or
business (in each case, adjusted appropriately to reflect the size and scope
of such Competing Business relative to such company or business). "Resale
Price" means the purchase price paid by Seller or any of its Affiliates for
such company or business, multiplied by a fraction equal to (i) the EBITDA of
such Competing Business, divided by (ii) the EBITDA of such company or
business. 

| 
---|--- 

5.10.6

|

From and after the Closing Date and until the third anniversary thereof,
Seller shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, directly or
indirectly, solicit for employment or hire any employee of any Group Company
(other than (a) the Retained Employees, (b) employees of the Excluded Business
or (c) from and 

 after the date on which Seller has purchased Buyer's equity interests in McKey
Korea LLC pursuant to Section 5.12, employees of the Korean Business) who is
at the time of such solicitation, or was within the three months preceding
such solicitation or hiring, an employee of any Group Company; provided that
nothing in this Agreement shall (i) prohibit or restrict Seller or any of its
Affiliates from conducting general searches for employees through general
advertisements or other general postings via other media of employment
opportunities or listings, employment search firms, job fairs or other similar
means which are not specifically targeted at such employees or (ii) apply to
any employee whose employment is terminated by Buyer or any of its Affiliates
(including any Group Company).

| 
---|--- 

5.10.7

|

If any provision contained in this Section 5.10 shall for any reason be held
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality
or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions of this Section
5.10, but this Section 5.10 shall be construed as if such invalid, illegal or
unenforceable provision had never been contained herein. It is the intention
of the Parties that if any of the restrictions or covenants contained herein
is held to cover a geographic area or to be for a length of time which is not
permitted by applicable Law, or in any way construed to be too broad or to any
extent invalid, such provision shall not be construed to be null, void and of
no effect, but to the extent such provision would be valid or enforceable
under applicable Law, a court of competent jurisdiction shall construe and
interpret or reform this Section 5.10 to provide for a covenant having the
maximum enforceable geographic area, time period and other provisions (not
greater than those contained herein) as shall be valid and enforceable under
such applicable Law.

---|--- 

5.11

Intercompany Accounts and Related Party Agreements 

All intercompany accounts between Seller or its Affiliates (other than any
Group Company), on the one hand, and any Group Company, on the other hand, as
of the Closing shall be settled and paid in full in cash prior to the Closing,
in such a manner as would not result in any post-Closing liabilities for any
Group Company. All Related Party Agreements shall be terminated prior to the
Closing, in such a manner as would not result in any post-Closing liabilities
for any Group Company.

5.12

Korean Business 

Following the Closing, Buyer shall (i) conduct the business and operations of
the Korean Business in good faith and (ii) use its reasonable best efforts to
cause the Korean Business to achieve sales volume of 16,000 metric tons per
annum on reasonable commercially viable terms (measured by reference to the
historical margins of the Korean Business during the twelve-month period prior
to June 30, 2017) by the date that is seven months after the Closing Date (the
"Sales Measurement Period"). If, notwithstanding such efforts, the Korean
Business has not achieved such sales volume on or before the expiration of the
Sales Measurement Period, Buyer shall have the right to, within five days
after expiration of the Sales Measurement Period, sell to Seller and, if Buyer
exercises such right, Seller

 will be required to buy or cause its Affiliates to buy from Buyer, Buyer's
equity interests in McKey Korea LLC at a price of $60,000,000, subject to the
same terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement (including (a) price
adjustment for Indebtedness, Quasi-Indebtedness, Cash and Working Capital and
(b) representations, warranties and indemnities, in each case as to Buyer's
period of ownership and in each case adjusted appropriately to reflect the
size and scope of the Korean Business relative to the Business).

Transition Planning 

Each of Seller and Buyer shall, and shall cause their Affiliates to, act in
good faith and reasonably consult with each other to the extent permitted by
applicable Law between the date hereof and the Closing Date to define the
steps to transition of ownership of the Group Companies and control of the
operations of the Business. If reasonably necessary for the operation of the
Excluded Business following the Closing (as determined jointly by Seller and
Buyer, acting in good faith), at Closing the parties shall execute, and Buyer
shall cause the Group Companies to execute, a transition services agreement
(to be mutually agreed by Seller and Buyer, acting in good faith) pursuant to
which the Group Companies shall provide customary transition services to
Seller and its Affiliates.

| 
---|---

Financing Cooperation 

Subject to Section 11.1.2, prior to the Closing, Seller shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to, and to cause the Group Companies to use
their respective commercially reasonable efforts to, cooperate with Buyer, as
reasonably requested by Buyer, in its efforts to consummate any Financing,
including (i) obtaining customary payoff letters and Lien terminations to the
extent necessary to allow the extinguishing of existing Indebtedness of the
Group Companies and the release of any Liens securing such Indebtedness, and
(ii) to the extent available and allowed by applicable Law, providing
customary financial statements and other information of the Group Companies as
Buyer shall reasonably request in order to consummate such Financing
(including the information set forth on Section 5.14 of the Disclosure
Schedule), but Seller shall not be required to perform an audit of the Group
Companies' financial statements or conduct a reconciliation or restatement
thereof or require its external auditors to provide comfort thereupon.

Other Offers 

Seller, its Affiliates, the Group Companies and the officers, directors,
employees and other agents of Seller, its Affiliates, and the Group Companies,
will not, directly or indirectly, (i) take any action to solicit, initiate or
encourage an Acquisition Proposal or (ii) engage in negotiations with, or
disclose any nonpublic information relating to Seller or any Group Company or

Buyer agrees that, during the period commencing at the Closing and ending on
the first anniversary of Closing (or such longer period as required under
applicable laws) each employee, other than an employee whose terms and
conditions of employment are governed by the terms of a Collective Bargaining
Agreement, who is employed by any of the Group Companies as of immediately
prior to the Closing Date and whose employment continues with any of the Group
Companies (or Buyer or any of its Affiliates) from the Closing Date (each, a
"Continuing Employee") will continue while so employed to be provided with
base salary or wage rate, target annual cash incentive compensation
opportunity and employee benefits (other than any long-term incentive
compensation, equity-based compensation, defined benefit pension benefits and
retiree medical benefits or, except as provided in Section 7.1.6, any
severance or separation pay or benefits) that are comparable in the aggregate
to those currently provided by the Group Companies to such Continuing Employee

Buyer shall cause any employee benefit plans in which the Continuing Employees
are eligible to participate in to take into account for purposes of
eligibility, vesting and benefit accrual thereunder, except to the extent it
would result in a duplication of benefits, service credited to employees of
the Group Companies as if such service were with Buyer, to the same extent
such service was credited under a Group Companies Benefit Plan. Buyer shall,
and shall cause the Group Companies to, honor all employment or severance
agreements entered into by the Group Companies prior to the date hereof.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall obligate Buyer,
the Group Companies or any of their Affiliates to: (a) maintain any particular

credit each employee with all deductible payments and other out-of-pocket
payments paid by such employee under the Group Companies Benefit Plans that
provide medical benefits prior to the Closing Date during the year in which

Notwithstanding the general provisions of Section 7.1.1, until at least one
year following the Closing Date, Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates
to, provide each Continuing Employee with severance benefits that are no less
favorable than: those that would be provided to such employee under the
severance plan or program applicable to such employee immediately prior to the
Closing Date;. For purposes of calculating each of the above severance
amounts, the employee shall be deemed to have years of service commencing with
his or her original hire date with the Group Companies and ending on his or
her date of termination of employment with Buyer or the Group Companies. 

| 
---|--- 

7.1.7

|

Buyer shall, to the extent taken into account on a dollar-for-dollar basis in
the calculation of the Final Purchase Price, recognize and honor any earned
and unused paid time off and/or vacation time as of the Closing Date for the
benefit of the employees. 

| 
---|--- 

7.1.8

|

The parties agree to cooperate in good faith to determine whether any
notification may be required under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining
Notification Act and any applicable state or local equivalent (collectively,
the "WARN Act") as a result of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. On or as soon as practicable following the Closing Date, Seller
shall deliver to Buyer a true and complete list of all Persons who suffered
employment losses (as defined in the WARN Act) by all Service Providers
occurring within 90 days of the Closing Date. Buyer will be responsible for
providing any notification that may be required under the WARN Act after the
Closing Date with respect to any Continuing Employees or otherwise resulting
by reason of any employment losses on or after the Closing Date. Seller will
be responsible for providing any notification that may be required under the
WARN Act on or prior to the Closing Date, taking into account only employment
losses prior to the Closing Date.

consummated pursuant hereto by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on May 17, 2019

materially comply with any of the agreements, covenants or conditions hereof
to be performed or complied with by such Party prior to Closing; provided,
however, that (i) if the condition set forth in Section 6.1.1 is the only

Section 5.4), in each case permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and such
order shall have become final and non-appealable unless the issuance or
failure to lift such order shall be due to the failure of the terminating

covenants or conditions hereof to be performed or complied with by such Party
prior to Closing; 

| 
---|--- 

8.1.4

|

Effect of Termination 

| 
---|--- 

8.2.1

|

In the event of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to the provisions
of Section 8.1, this Agreement shall become void and have no effect, without
any liability to any Person in respect hereof or of the transactions
contemplated hereby on the part of any Party hereto or any of its Affiliates
or Representatives, except as specified in this Section 8.2 and Sections 5.2,
11.1, 11.2, 11.11, 11.12, 11.13, 11.14, 11.15, 11.16, 11.18 and 11.19 and
except for any liability resulting from such Party's breach of this Agreement;
provided that no such termination (or any provision of this Agreement) shall
relieve any Party from liability for any damages for a knowing and intentional
breach of this Agreement or fraud. If the transactions contemplated hereby are
terminated as provided herein: 

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

Buyer shall return to Seller or destroy the documents and other materials
received from Seller and its Affiliates and Representatives relating to the
transactions contemplated hereby, in accordance with the Confidentiality
Agreement; and 

| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

all confidential information received by Buyer and its Affiliates and
Representatives with respect to Seller, its Affiliates and the Business shall
otherwise be treated in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement, which
shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms
notwithstanding the termination of this Agreement. 

| 
---|--- 

8.2.2

|

In the event this Agreement is properly terminated by a Party pursuant to
Section 8.1.2, and the condition set forth in Section 6.1.3 (BNDES Consent) is
the only condition not satisfied or waived prior to such termination (other
than conditions that must be satisfied at Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of such conditions), then Seller agrees that, for a
period of six months following such termination, it shall not sell nor enter
into an agreement to sell the majority of the Shares or substantially all of
the assets of the Group Companies to any Person or Group (within the meaning
of Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), except in connection
with a public offering of securities of Seller, any Group Company or their
Affiliates.

8.3.1

|

In the event that (x) all of the conditions set forth in Sections 6.1 and 6.2,
other than the conditions set forth in Section 6.1.1 with respect to the HSR
Act, have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that are by
their nature to be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing) and (y) this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to Sections 8.1.2 or 8.1.3 as a result of the
failure to (i) secure expiration or termination of the applicable waiting
period and any extensions thereof under the HSR Act or (ii) lift any order
pursuant to Section 7 of the Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914, as amended, 15
U.S.C. § 18, permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, Buyer shall pay, or
cause to be paid, to Seller an amount equal to $50,000,000 

 (the "Termination Fee"), such payment to be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by Seller within ten
Business Days after demand by Seller. For the avoidance of doubt, the
Termination Fee shall not be paid in the event this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to Sections 8.1.2 or 8.1.3 as a result of the denial of an approval
or clearance under any Foreign Competition Law.

| 
---|--- 

8.3.2

|

The Parties acknowledge and agree that: (i) the fees and other provisions of
this Section 8.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; (ii) the Termination Fee shall constitute liquidated damages for
any and all losses or damages suffered or incurred by Seller in connection
with the matter forming the basis of such termination, and Seller shall not be
entitled to bring or maintain any other claim, action or proceeding against
Buyer arising out of such matter; and (iii) without these agreements, the
Parties would not enter into this Agreement. 

| 
---|--- 

8.3.3

|

If Buyer fails to pay the Termination Fee when due, Buyer shall also pay to
Seller all of Seller's and the Group Companies' reasonable costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys' fees) in connection with any final, non-
appealable action in which Buyer prevails to collect the Termination Fee and
such other amounts.

Certain Limitations 

| 
---|--- 

9.3.1

|

Seller shall not be required to indemnify Buyer Indemnitees with respect to
any claim for indemnification pursuant to Section 9.1.1 (excluding any such
claim with respect to a breach of any Seller Fundamental Representation with
respect to which the limits set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) shall not
apply): (i) for any Loss (or Losses relating to the same facts and
circumstances) if the amount of such Loss is less than $100,000 (a "De Minimis
Loss"); (ii) unless and until the aggregate amount of all such Losses
(excluding any De Minimis Loss) exceeds the Deductible Amount, in which case
Seller shall only be responsible for the amount of such Losses in excess of
the Deductible Amount; provided that the aggregate liability of Seller to
Buyer Indemnitees under Section 9.1.1 (excluding liability with respect to any
breach of any Seller Fundamental Representation) shall in no event exceed the
Warranty Cap. The aggregate liability of Seller to Buyer Indemnitees under
Section 9.1 shall in no event exceed the Cap. 

| 
---|--- 

9.3.2

|

Buyer shall not be required to indemnify Seller Indemnitees with respect to
any claim for indemnification pursuant to Section 9.2.1 (excluding any such
claim with respect to a breach of any Buyer Fundamental Representation with
respect to which the limits set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) shall not
apply): (i) for any De Minimis Loss; and (ii) unless and until the aggregate
amount of all such Losses (excluding any De Minimis Loss) exceeds the
Deductible Amount, in which case Buyer shall only be responsible for the
amount of such Losses in excess of the Deductible Amount; provided that the
aggregate liability of Buyer to Seller under Section 9.2.1 

 (excluding liability with respect to any Buyer Fundamental Representation)
shall in no event exceed the Warranty Cap. The aggregate liability of Buyer to
Seller Indemnitees under Section 9.2 shall in no event exceed the Cap.

| 
---|--- 

9.3.3

|

Buyer shall not be entitled to indemnification for those portions of any
Losses: (i) other than in connection with Section 9.1.3, reserved or accrued
on the financial statements or master book referred to in Section 3.7 in a
manner that permits reasonable determination as to the portion of such Loss
reserved or accrued; (ii) that have arisen as a result of any act or omission
by Buyer or any of its Affiliates or Representatives on or after the Closing
Date (including resulting from any change in their respective accounting
principles, practices or methodologies and any Losses arising from any breach
of its obligations under this Agreement), provided that the foregoing shall
not preclude indemnification under Section 9.1.3 except to the extent that any
Covered Taxes that would otherwise have been indemnifiable thereunder result
from an action of Buyer that caused Taxes (other than Taxes described in
clause (viii) of the definition of Covered Taxes) that otherwise would have
been in respect of a tax period beginning after the Closing Date (or the
portion of the Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Date) to be a
Covered Tax (except if such action, in Buyers' reasonable discretion, was
required by applicable Law); or (iii) that were taken into account (a) in
respect of Taxes, in the calculation of Quasi-Indebtedness or Working Capital
for purposes of determining the Final Purchase Price (except to the extent
resulting from a breach of Section 5.1.1(e)) or (b) in respect of any other
amount, in any adjustment to the Final Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.4.
For the avoidance of doubt, no Indemnified Party shall be compensated more
than once for the same Loss. 

| 
---|--- 

9.3.4

|

Buyer shall not be entitled to indemnification with respect to any Loss
arising out of or relating to any Environmental Law to the extent that such
Loss: (i) is discovered or identified as a result of any invasive
environmental investigation or sampling of soil or groundwater at any Real
Property conducted by or on behalf of Buyer or its Affiliates after the
Closing Date, unless such investigation or sampling was (i) required by a
Governmental Authority or pursuant to an applicable Environmental Law or
Environmental Permit, or unless such invasive investigation or sampling was
agreed to in writing by Seller; (ii) necessary to respond to a third party
claim or a substantial risk to human health or the environment; (iii)
performed in connection with any construction, maintenance or repair of any
Real Property conducted for a bona fide business purposes; or (iv) otherwise
agreed to in writing by Seller. 

| 
---|--- 

9.3.5

|

For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer may not avoid the limitations on liability
set forth in this Agreement by seeking damages for breach of contract, tort or
pursuant to any other theory of liability, other than fraud. 

| 
---|--- 

9.3.6

|

Except for fraud, the rights to indemnification provided for in this Article 9
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Buyer or Seller, as the case may be,
after the Closing for any breaches of or inaccuracy of any representation,
warranty, 

 covenant or agreement of Seller or Buyer, respectively, herein or any other
breach of or claim under this Agreement.

| 
---|--- 

9.3.7

|

No Buyer Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee shall be entitled to double recovery
for any Loss. In calculating amounts payable to any Buyer Indemnitee or any
Seller Indemnitee hereunder, the amount of any indemnified Loss shall be
determined without duplication of any other Loss that has been actually
recovered on a dollar-for-dollar basis pursuant to an indemnification claim
hereunder with respect to a breach of or inaccuracy in any other
representation or warranty, covenant or agreement or the reimbursement
provisions of Article 10\. Notwithstanding any other provision to the
contrary, to the extent items were taken into account in the calculation of
the Final Purchase Price, such items shall not be subject to any claim by any
Buyer Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee for indemnification pursuant to this
Article 9. 

| 
---|--- 

9.3.8

|

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Buyer Indemnitees
shall not be entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 9.1.1 for any
amounts with respect to Taxes or Losses attributable to Taxes other than as a
result of a breach of the representations and warranties set forth in Section
3.18.10, Section 3.18.13 or Section 3.18.14. 

| 
---|--- 

9.4

|

Payment Adjustments 

| 
---|--- 

9.4.1

|

Any indemnity payment made by Seller to Buyer Indemnitees, on the one hand, or
by Buyer to Seller Indemnitees, on the other hand, pursuant to this Article 9
in respect of any claim shall be reduced by an amount equal to (x) any
insurance proceeds actually received by the Indemnified Party from any third
party insurer or third party contractual indemnification or contribution
provisions in respect of such claim minus (y) any out-of-pocket expenses and
reasonable attorneys' fees relating to the recovery of such proceeds
(including any Taxes imposed on such proceeds); provided that Buyer shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to recover such insurance proceeds in
connection with making a claim under this Article 9\. It is the intention of
the Parties that no insurer or third party shall be entitled to any benefit or
right it would not be entitled to receive in the absence of this paragraph. 

| 
---|--- 

9.4.2

|

Any payment made by Seller to Buyer Indemnitees on the one hand, or by Buyer
to Seller Indemnitees on the other hand, pursuant to this Article 9 in respect
of any claim, shall be computed net of any Tax benefit actually realized by
the Indemnified Party as a result of the payment or accrual of such Losses in
or prior to the taxable year in which the Losses are paid or accrued, or in
the succeeding three taxable years. 

| 
---|--- 

9.4.3

|

The Parties agree that, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law,
any indemnification payments made pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated
for all Tax purposes as an adjustment to the Final Purchase Price. 

 | 
---|--- 

9.5

|

Indemnification Procedures 

| 
---|--- 

9.5.1

|

In the event of any Litigation asserted by a third party (other than any Tax
Claim) (a "Third-Party Claim") against a Party entitled to indemnification
under this Article 9 (the "Indemnified Party"), notice shall be given by the
Indemnified Party to the Party required to provide indemnification (the
"Indemnifying Party") promptly after such Indemnified Party has actual
knowledge of such Third-Party Claim. Such notice shall (taking into account
the information then available to the Indemnified Party): (i) specify in
reasonable detail the basis on which indemnification is being asserted; (ii)
provide a reasonable estimate (to the extent then known) of the amount of the
Losses asserted therein; (iii) specify the provision or provisions of this
Agreement under which such Losses are asserted; and (iv) include copies of all
notices and documents (including court papers) served on or received by the
Indemnified Party from such third party. The failure to so notify the
Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations
hereunder, except to the extent such failure would materially and adversely
prejudice the Indemnifying Party. 

| 
---|--- 

9.5.2

|

Upon receipt of such notice pursuant to Section 9.5.1, the Indemnifying Party
may elect to participate in such Third-Party Claim and to assume the defense
of such Third-Party Claim, at the expense of the Indemnifying Party, by
written notice to the Indemnified Party within 20 days after the Indemnified
Party has provided notice of the Third-Party Claim; provided, further, that
the Indemnified Party may participate in such defense assumed by the
Indemnified Party at such Indemnified Party's expense; provided, further, that
in such event the Indemnifying Party shall pay the fees and expenses of any
separate counsel retained by the Indemnified Party if representation of both
the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party by the same counsel would
create a conflict of interest. Notwithstanding the foregoing and subject to
Section 9.5.7, the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume or
maintain control of the defense of any Third-Party Claim and shall pay the
fees and expenses of counsel retained by the Indemnified Party with respect to
such Third-Party Claim if (i) the Third-Party Claim relates to or arises in
connection with any criminal proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or
investigation, (ii) the Third-Party Claim seeks as its primary relief an
injunction or equitable relief against the Indemnified Party or any of its
Affiliates, or (iii) the Indemnifying Party has failed or is failing to
prosecute or defend vigorously the Third-Party Claim in any material respect.
If the Indemnifying Party shall assume the control of the defense of any
Third-Party Claim in accordance with the provisions of this Section 9.5.2,
except with the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, no Indemnifying Party, in the
defense of any such Third-Party Claim, shall consent to entry of any judgment
or enter into any settlement that provides for injunctive or other non-
monetary relief affecting the Indemnified Party or that does not expressly
unconditionally release the Indemnified Party and its Affiliates from all
liabilities with respect to such Third-Party Claim. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, 

 in the event that the Indemnified Party shall in good faith determine that the
Indemnified Party may have available to it one or more defenses or
counterclaims that are inconsistent with one or more of those that may be
available to the Indemnifying Party in respect of such Third-Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party shall have the right, but not the obligation, at all times
to take over and assume control over the defense, settlement, negotiations or
Litigation relating to any such Third-Party Claim; provided that if the
Indemnified Party does so take over and assume control, the Indemnified Party
shall not settle such Third-Party Claim without the prior written consent of
the Indemnifying Party, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed.

| 
---|--- 

9.5.3

|

In all cases, the Parties shall cooperate in the defense of any Third-Party
Claim subject to this Article 9 and the records of each, to the extent
permissible by applicable Law, third-party contractual obligations and without
resulting in the loss of any attorney-client privilege, shall be available to
the other upon the other's reasonable request with respect to such defense.
The Party controlling the defense of such Third-Party Claim shall keep the
other Party reasonably advised of the status of such Third-Party Claim and the
defense thereof and shall consider in good faith any reasonable
recommendations made by the non-controlling Party with respect thereto. 

| 
---|--- 

9.5.4

|

Promptly after an Indemnified Party has actual knowledge that it sustained any
Losses not involving a Third-Party Claim that such Indemnified Party believes
gives rise to a claim for indemnification hereunder, such Indemnified Party
shall, if it intends to make a claim with respect thereto against an
Indemnifying Party, deliver notice of such claim to the Indemnifying Party in
accordance with Section 9.5.1. The failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party
shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder, except
to the extent such failure would materially and adversely prejudice the
Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified
Party within 30 days after its receipt of such notice that the Indemnifying
Party disputes its liability to the Indemnified Party, such claim specified by
the Indemnified Party in such notice shall be conclusively deemed a liability
of the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnifying Party shall pay the amount of
such claim to the Indemnified Party promptly after demand therefor or, in the
case of any notice in which the amount of the claim (or any portion thereof)
is estimated, on such later date on which such amount (or such portion) is
finally determined. If the Indemnifying Party has timely disputed its
liability with respect to such claim as provided above, the Indemnifying Party
and the Indemnified Party shall proceed in good faith to negotiate a
resolution of such dispute, and if not resolved through such negotiations,
such dispute shall be resolved by litigation in an appropriate court of
competent jurisdiction in accordance with Section 11.13. 

| 
---|--- 

9.5.5

|

If the Indemnified Party receives any payment from an Indemnifying Party in
respect of any Losses pursuant to this Article 9 and the Indemnified Party
could have recovered all or any portion of such Losses from any third party (a
"Potential 

 Contributor") based on the underlying claim asserted against the Indemnifying
Party, the Indemnified Party shall assign such of its rights to proceed
against the Potential Contributor to the extent necessary to permit the
Indemnifying Party to recover from the Potential Contributor the amount of
such payment.

| 
---|--- 

9.5.6

|

The Parties shall reasonably cooperate with each other with respect to
resolving any claim or liability with respect to which one Party is obligated
to indemnify the other Party hereunder, including by using commercially
reasonable efforts to mitigate or resolve any such claim or liability. 

| 
---|--- 

9.5.7

|

This Section 9.5.7 shall only apply for so long as the Seller or its
Affiliates has not repurchased Buyer's equity interests in McKey Korea LLC
pursuant to Section 5.12. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, but subject to the remainder of this Section 9.5.7, (i) Seller
shall control the defense of the Specified Legal Proceedings and (ii) Seller
may, in its sole discretion, consent to entry of any judgment or enter into
any settlement of any nature in connection with the Specified Legal
Proceedings. If Seller shall control the defense of any Specified Legal
Proceeding in accordance with the provisions of this Section 9.5.7, except
with the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, Seller shall not, in
the defense of any such Specified Legal Proceeding, consent to entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement that provides for injunctive or other
non-monetary relief affecting the Indemnified Party or that does not expressly
unconditionally release the Indemnified Party and its Affiliates from all
liabilities with respect to such Specified Legal Proceeding. Buyer shall, and
shall cause the Group Companies and its and their Affiliates to, at Seller's
expense (for Buyer's out-of-pocket costs and expenses only), cooperate with
Seller and its Representatives in any and all of the Specified Legal
Proceedings and in any legal action, litigation, arbitration, mediation or
other proceeding relating to the Specified Legal Proceedings. Without
limitation to the foregoing, Buyer shall, and shall cause the Group Companies
and its and their respective Affiliates to, for so long as Seller controls the
defense of any Specified Legal Proceeding, assist Seller and its counsel in
the prosecution of the Specified Legal Proceeding in any reasonable manner as
Seller and its attorneys shall decide or direct, including (i) granting, and
causing the Group Companies to grant, such powers-of-attorney to the
Representatives of Seller to allow the defense of the Specified Legal
Proceeding vis-a-vis any Governmental Authority or third party, (ii)
executing, amending, terminating and renewing, and causing the Group Companies
to execute, amend, terminate or renew, at Seller's request in its sole
discretion, an engagement agreement (in reasonable form) with such law firm or
attorneys as may be directed by Seller, provided that Seller shall advance to
Buyer all funds for the payment of any and all costs, expenses and fees
related to such engagement, (iii) using reasonable best efforts to preserve
and provide to Seller any and all books, records and documents related to the
Specified Legal Proceedings in the Buyer's or the Group Companies' possession,
custody or control, (iv) providing access to such personnel and
Representatives of Buyer or the Group Companies as Seller or its 

 Representatives may reasonably request from time to time in connection with
the Specified Legal Proceeding and (v) using reasonable best efforts to
provide written statements, answer interrogatories, respond to document
requests, and prepare for, attend and participate in any mediation,
depositions, arbitral proceeding, and trial. For so long as Seller controls

Tax Matters

10.1

|

Tax Returns 

| 
---|--- 

10.1.1

|

Buyer shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, all Tax Returns required to be
filed by any Group Company after the Closing Date with respect to a Pre-
Closing Tax Period or a Straddle Period. Any such Tax Return shall be prepared
in a manner consistent with past practice (unless otherwise required by
applicable Law). Any such Tax Return that relates to income Taxes shall be
submitted by Buyer to Seller (together with applicable schedules and
statements) at least 30 days prior to the due date (taking into account any
extensions) of such Tax Return (or as promptly as possible after the Closing
Date, if the applicable due date is less than 30 days after the Closing Date)
for Seller's review. If Seller objects to any item on any such Tax Return, it
shall, within 10 days after delivery of such Tax Return, notify Buyer in
writing that it so objects, specifying with particularity any such item and
stating the specific factual or legal basis for any such objection. If a
notice of objection is duly delivered, Buyer and Seller shall negotiate in
good faith and use their reasonable best efforts to resolve such items. If
Buyer and Seller are unable to 

 reach such agreement within 15 days after receipt by Buyer of such notice of
objection, the disputed items shall be resolved by the Accounting Firm, and
the provisions of Section 2.4.3 shall apply to the Accounting Firm's review,
mutatis mutandis. If the Accounting Firm is unable to resolve any disputed
items before the due date for such Tax Return, the Tax Return shall be filed
as prepared by Buyer and then amended to reflect the Accounting Firm's
resolution. Seller shall promptly reimburse Buyer for any Covered Taxes shown
as due and payable on any Tax Return filed in respect of a Pre-Closing Tax
Period or Straddle Period (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not
include any Taxes that were taken into account on a dollar-for-dollar basis in
the calculation of Quasi-Indebtedness or Working Capital for purposes of
determining the Final Purchase Price). To the extent that the amount of
Covered Taxes shown as due and payable on any amended Tax Return filed
following resolution of a dispute by the Accounting Firm is less than the
amount of Covered Taxes that were shown as due and payable on the previously
filed Tax Return, Buyer shall promptly make a payment to Seller equal to the
difference (except to the extent that such Taxes that were taken into account
on a dollar-for-dollar basis in the calculation of the Quasi-Indebtedness or
Working Capital for purposes of determining the Final Purchase Price). To the
extent that the amount of Covered Taxes shown as due and payable on any
amended Tax Return filed following resolution of a dispute by the Accounting
Firm is more than the amount of Covered Taxes that were shown as due and
payable on the previously filed Tax Return, Seller shall promptly make a
payment to Buyer equal to the difference (except to the extent that such Taxes
that were taken into account on a dollar-for-dollar basis in the calculation
of the Quasi-Indebtedness or Working Capital for purposes of determining the
Final Purchase Price). For the avoidance of doubt, the preparation and filing
of any Tax Return of any Group Company that does not relate to a Pre-Closing
Tax Period or a Straddle Period shall be exclusively within the control of
Buyer and the Group Companies. For the avoidance of doubt, the reimbursement
obligations set forth in this Section 10.1.1 shall not be subject to the
limitations or procedures set forth in Article 9.

| 
---|--- 

10.1.2

|

Seller shall be entitled to all refunds (or credits in lieu of refunds) of any
Covered Taxes reimbursed by Seller under Section 10.1.1 or that Seller is
responsible for under Article 9 (other than any refunds (or credits in lieu of
refunds) resulting from the carry back of any Tax asset attributable to a
taxable year or period beginning after the Closing Date (or the portion of any
Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Date)), except to the extent that
such refund (or credit in lieu thereof) was taken into account on a dollar-
for-dollar basis in the calculation of Quasi-Indebtedness or Working Capital
for purposes of determining the Final Purchase Price. Buyer shall pay (or
shall cause to be paid) to Seller the amount of any such refund or credit
(including interest paid thereon), net of any out-of-pocket costs and expenses
(including any Taxes imposed on the refund or credit), within five days of
Buyer's receipt of the refund or the application of such refund or credit
against Taxes otherwise payable. 

 | 
---|--- 

10.2

|

Amended Returns 

Except as required by applicable Law or upon a final determination of a Tax
Claim, neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall file any amended Tax
Returns for a Pre-Closing Tax Period of any of the Group Companies.

| 
---|--- 

10.3

|

Allocation of Tax Liability 

| 
---|--- 

10.3.1

|

To the extent permitted or required by applicable Law, the taxable year of
each of the Group Companies that includes the Closing Date shall be treated as
closing on (and including) the Closing Date. 

| 
---|--- 

10.3.2

|

For purposes of this Agreement, any liability for Taxes attributable to a
Straddle Period shall be apportioned between the portion of such period ending
on the Closing Date and the portion beginning on the day after the Closing
Date: (i) in the case of any Taxes determined on a periodic basis (such as
real or personal property Taxes), by apportioning such Taxes on a per diem
basis, and (ii) in the case of all other Taxes (such as income Taxes), as if
the taxable period ended as of the end of the day on the Closing Date. Any
credits relating to a Straddle Period shall be taken into account as though
the relevant taxable period ended on the Closing Date; provided that (A) the
taxable year of any Subsidiary or former Subsidiary of a Company that is a
"controlled foreign corporation" (as defined in the Code) shall be deemed to
have closed on the Closing Date, including for purposes of computing any
inclusion under sections 951 and 951A of the Code and (B) exemptions,
allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis (including
depreciation and amortization deductions) shall be allocated between the
period ending on the Closing Date and the period beginning after the Closing
Date in proportion to the number of days in each period. All determinations
necessary to give effect to the foregoing allocations shall be made in a
manner consistent with past practice.

Buyer shall make, or cause to be made, an election under section 338(g) of the
Code with respect to the acquisition of each of the Lux Company, McKey

this Agreement and Buyer will be permitted to make an election under section
338 of the Code with respect to the transfer of all other Group Companies tax
resident outside of the United States pursuant to this Agreement. Buyer agrees
that an election under section 338 of the Code shall not be made with respect
to any of the Group Companies that are tax resident within the United States. 

| 
---|--- 

10.4.2

|

Buyer shall not make any other elections with respect to any of the Group
Companies that would be effective with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period
or the portion of any Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date
without Seller's prior written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed; provided that Seller shall be entitled to withhold
consent if any proposed election will or is likely to increase Seller's
obligations to indemnify the Buyer 

 Indemnitees under Section 9.1.3 or otherwise result in adverse Tax
consequences to Seller, in each case, as reasonably determined by Seller.

| 
---|--- 

10.5

Section 965 of the Code 

Each eligible Group Company shall make and not revoke (or have made and not
revoked) the election described in Section 965(h) of the Code.

|

Tax Cooperation 

| 
---|--- 

10.6.1

|

Each of Seller and its Affiliates, on one hand, and Buyer and its Affiliates,
on the other, shall provide the other with such information and records and
make such of its officers, directors, employees and agents available as may
reasonably be requested by such other Party in connection with the preparation
of any Tax Return or any audit or other proceeding that relates to the Group
Companies. 

| 
---|--- 

10.6.2

|

Buyer and Seller further agree %4. to retain all books and records with
respect to Tax matters pertinent to any Group Company relating to any
Pre‑Closing Tax Period or any Straddle Period until the expiration of any
applicable statute of limitations, and to abide by all record retention
agreements entered into with any Taxing Authority for all periods required by
such Taxing Authority, and %4. to use commercially reasonable efforts to
provide the other Party with at least 30 days' prior written notice before
destroying any such books and records, during which period the Party receiving
the notice can elect to take possession, at its own expense, of such books and
records. 

| 
---|--- 

10.7

|

Transfer Taxes 

All Transfer Taxes other than Recoverable Transfer Taxes incurred in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be borne
50% by Buyer and 50% by Seller. All Recoverable Transfer Taxes incurred in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be borne
by the party entitled to the recovery of such Recoverable Transfer Taxes. For
the avoidance of doubt, Seller shall bear 100% of all Transfer Taxes imposed
with respect to any transactions occurring prior to the Closing Date
(including any Transfer Taxes incurred to effect the Restructuring Plan). The
Party required by applicable Law to file any Tax Return in respect of any
Transfer Taxes described in this Section 10.7 and pay such Transfer Taxes
shall timely prepare and file such Tax Return and pay such Transfer Taxes when
due in compliance with applicable Law. The non-paying Party shall promptly
reimburse the paying Party for its 50% share of any such Transfer Taxes paid.
If required by applicable Law, the Parties will join in the execution of any
such Tax Returns and other documentation. Buyer and Seller shall cooperate in
good faith to establish any available exemption or reduction in applicable

Tax Contests 

| 
---|--- 

10.8.1

|

If any claim or demand for Taxes in respect of which Seller would be required
to indemnify any Buyer Indemnitee under Section 9.1.3 is asserted in writing
against Buyer (a "Tax Claim"), Buyer shall promptly notify Seller of such Tax
Claim in writing after receipt thereof, and shall give Seller such information
with respect thereto as Seller may reasonably request; provided that the
failure of Buyer to give notice as required in this Section shall not relieve
Seller of its obligations under Section 9.1, except to the extent that such
failure materially prejudiced Seller's defense of such Tax Claim. 

| 
---|--- 

10.8.2

|

Seller shall have the right to participate in and shall be entitled to, at its
own expense, control and appoint lead counsel for, the defense of any claim,
suit, action, litigation or proceeding (including any Tax audit) relating to a
Tax Claim (a "Tax Controversy") that relates solely to Taxes in respect of
which Seller would be required to indemnify a Buyer Indemnitee under Section
9.1.3; provided that Seller shall not settle such a Tax Controversy without
Buyer's prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) (it being understood that, without limitation, it
would be unreasonable for Buyer to withhold consent if such settlement is not
reasonably expected to adversely impact any taxable period of Buyer or any of
its Affiliates after the Closing Date). If Seller assumes control of such
defense, Seller shall keep Buyer reasonably informed regarding the status of
such Tax Controversy and Buyer shall have the right (but not the duty) to
participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own expense,
separate from the counsel employed by Seller. Buyer shall keep Seller
reasonably informed regarding the status of any Tax Controversy described in
this Section 10.8.2 that is controlled by Buyer. Buyer shall control any Tax
Controversy that relates in part, but not solely, to Taxes in respect of which
Seller would be required to indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees under Section
9.1.3; provided that Seller shall have the right, at its own expense, to
participate in the conduct of such a Tax Controversy and to employ counsel, at
its own expense, separate from the counsel employed by Buyer, and Buyer shall
not settle such a Tax Controversy without Seller's prior written consent (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the procedures
relating to claims for indemnification under Section 9.1.3 shall be governed
exclusively by this Section 10.8 and not by the provisions in Section 9.5.

10.9

|

Termination of Existing Tax Sharing Agreements 

Any and all existing Tax Sharing Agreements binding upon the Group Companies
(other than a Tax Sharing Agreement solely between or among the Group
Companies) shall be terminated with respect to the Group Companies as of, or
prior to, the Closing Date. After such date, none of the Group Companies,
Seller or any of its Affiliates or any of their respective Representatives
shall have any further rights or liabilities thereunder.

Buyer, on the other hand, shall bear their respective expenses, costs and fees
(including attorneys', and auditors' and financing commitment fees) in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (including Seller with
respect to the Restructuring Plan), including the preparation, execution and
delivery of this Agreement and compliance herewith, whether or not the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby shall be consummated; provided

required by the HSR Act and the Foreign Competition Laws and any other filings

11.1.2

|

Buyer shall promptly upon request of Seller or the Group Companies, reimburse
Seller, its Affiliates or the Group Companies (as applicable) in full for all

and auditors fees and expenses) incurred by Seller, its Affiliates and/or the
Group Companies for, all cooperation requested by Buyer in connection with the
activities set forth in Section 5.4.3 and Section 5.14. Buyer shall indemnify
and hold harmless, the Seller Indemnitees and the Group Companies, from and
against any and all liabilities or losses suffered or incurred by them in
connection with the activities set forth in Section 5.4.3 and Section 5.14 and
any information utilized in connection therewith, except in the event such
liabilities or losses arose out of or result from fraud. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) nothing in Section 5.4.3 and
Section 5.14 will require any cooperation to the extent the same (A)
unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of Seller, its Affiliates
or the Group Companies, (B) cause any conditions to the Closing set forth in
Article 6 to not be satisfied or otherwise cause any breach of this Agreement
or (C) reasonably be expected to conflict with, violate, breach or otherwise
contravene (1) any Organizational Documents of Seller, its Affiliates any of
the Group Companies, (2) any Law and/or (3) any Material Contract and (ii)
none of Seller, its Affiliates, the Group Companies or their respective
Representatives shall be required to execute, deliver or enter into, or
perform any agreement, document or instrument, including any definitive
financing document, with respect to any activities set forth in Section 5.4.3
and Section 5.14 or adopt resolutions approving the agreements, documents
and/or instruments pursuant to which any financing or title insurance is
obtained or pledge any collateral with respect to any financing the
effectiveness of which is not contingent upon the Closing.

Entire Agreement

and understandings, both written and oral, between the Parties and their
respective Affiliates and Representatives with respect to the subject matter
hereof and thereof (including the Confidential Information Package, with
respect to the Group Companies and any supplements thereto).

| 
---|--- 

11.4

|

Certain Limitations 

It is the explicit intent and understanding of each of the Parties that no
Party nor any of its Affiliates or Representatives is making any
representation or warranty whatsoever, oral or written, express or implied,
other than those set forth in Articles 3 and 4, and no Party is relying on any
statement, representation or warranty, oral or written, express or implied,
made by the other Party or such other Party's Affiliates or Representatives
(including with respect to any estimates, projections, forecasts, budgets or
other forward-looking information delivered or made available to Buyer or its
Representatives) except for the representations and warranties set forth in
such Articles. EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE SPECIFICALLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT,
THE PARTIES EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTY OR REPRESENTATION (IMPLIED OR
OTHERWISE), AT EQUITY, COMMON LAW, BY STATUTE OR OTHERWISE, AS TO CONDITION,
MERCHANTABILITY OR SUITABILITY AS TO ANY OF THE ASSETS OF THE GROUP COMPANIES
AND, EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE SPECIFICALLY SET FORTH IN THIS

 AGREEMENT, IT IS UNDERSTOOD AND AGREED THAT BUYER TAKES THE ASSETS, PLANTS,
INVENTORIES, AGREEMENTS, PROCEEDINGS OR EQUIPMENTS OF THE GROUP COMPANIES "AS
IS" AND "WHERE IS". The Parties agree that this is an arm's-length transaction
in which the Parties' undertakings and obligations are limited to the
performance of their obligations under this Agreement. Buyer acknowledges that
it is a sophisticated investor, that it has undertaken a full investigation of
the Group Companies and that it has only a contractual relationship with
Seller, based solely on the terms of this Agreement, and that there is no
special relationship of trust or reliance between Buyer and Seller. The
documents that have been made available to Buyer or its Representatives in the
Data Room or by e-mail, or delivered to Buyer's legal counsel on one or more
CD-ROMs or other flash drives by 7:00 p.m. (New York time) on August 16, 2018,
shall be deemed disclosed and delivered pursuant to this Agreement. Nothing in
this Section 11.4 shall be deemed to constitute a waiver of fraud.

| 
---|--- 

11.5

|

Schedules 

The disclosure of any matter in a particular Section of the Disclosure
Schedule shall be deemed to be disclosed with respect to (i) the
representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of Seller that
are contained in the corresponding Section of this Agreement and (ii) any
other representations and warranties of Seller contained in this Agreement,
but only if the relevance of that reference as a disclosure for purposes of
such representations and warranties would be reasonably apparent to a
reasonable person who has read that reference and such representations and
warranties, but shall expressly not be deemed to constitute an admission by
Seller or Buyer, or to otherwise imply, that any such matter is material for
the purposes of this Agreement. The disclosure of any matter in the Disclosure
Schedule is not to be treated as constituting or implying any representation,
warranty, assurance or undertaking by Seller not expressly set forth in the
Agreement, nor to be treated as adding to or extending the scope of any of
Seller's representations or warranties in the Agreement. Unless this Agreement
specifically provides otherwise, neither the specification of any dollar
amount in any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement nor the
inclusion of any specific item or matter in any section of the Disclosure
Schedule is intended to imply that such amount, or higher or lower amounts, or
the item or matter so included or other items or matters, are or are not
material, and no Party shall use the fact that such amount, item or matter has
been set forth in any section of the Disclosure Schedule in any dispute or
controversy between the Parties as to whether any amount, item or matter not
described herein or included in any Schedule is or is not material or is or is
not in the Ordinary Course of Business, in each case for purposes of this
Agreement. Seller may, from time to time prior to or at the Closing, by notice
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, supplement or amend any
Disclosure Schedule, including one or more supplements or amendments to
correct any item or matter which would constitute a breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or obligation contained herein. No such
supplemental or amended Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to supplement or
amend any representation or warranty for purposes of Section 6.2.1 or Article
9, provided that, if Seller shall, as to any such supplement or amendment
delivered no later than five Business Days prior to Closing (an "Excusing
Disclosure"), acknowledge that

 Buyer's obligation to close is thereby excused under Section 6.2.1, and Buyer
still elects to consummate the Closing, then such Excusing Disclosure shall be
deemed to supplement or amend the applicable representations and warranties
for all purposes under this Agreement.

11.6

|

Amendment; Waivers 

No amendment, modification or discharge of this Agreement and no waiver
hereunder shall be valid or binding unless set forth in writing and duly
executed by the Party against whom enforcement of the amendment, modification,
discharge or waiver is sought. Any such waiver shall constitute a waiver only
with respect to the specific matter described in such writing and shall in no
way impair the rights of the Party granting such waiver in any other respect
or at any other time. Neither the waiver by any of the Parties of a breach of
or a default under any of the provisions of this Agreement, nor the failure by
any of the Parties, on one or more occasions, to enforce any of the provisions
of this Agreement or to exercise any right or privilege hereunder, shall be
construed as a waiver of any other breach or default of a similar nature, or
as a waiver of any of such provisions, rights or privileges hereunder. The
rights and remedies herein provided are cumulative and are not exclusive of
any rights or remedies that any Party may otherwise have at law or in equity.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 11.6, no amendment or
modification to any of this sentence of this Section 11.6, the proviso in
Section 11.11, Section 11.13, Section 11.16.1 and/or Section 11.19 that is
materially adverse to any Financing Sources shall become effective without the
prior written consent of the materially adversely affected Financing Sources.

---|--- 

11.7

|

Severability 

If any provision of this Agreement, including any phrase, sentence, clause,
Section or subsection is inoperative or unenforceable for any reason, such
circumstances shall not have the effect of rendering the provision in question
inoperative or unenforceable in any other case or circumstance, or of
rendering any other provision or provisions herein contained invalid,
inoperative, or unenforceable to any extent whatsoever. If any provision of
this Agreement shall be adjudged to be excessively broad as to duration,
geographical scope, activity or subject, the parties intend that such
provision shall be deemed modified to the minimum degree necessary to make
such provision valid and enforceable under applicable Law and that such
modified provision shall thereafter be enforced to the fullest extent
possible.

|

11.8

|

Counterparts 

This Agreement may be executed in several counterparts (including by
facsimile, ".pdf" or other electronic transmission), each of which shall be

Binding Effect 

 This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties
and their respective heirs, successors and permitted assigns.

|

11.10

|

Assignment 

This Agreement shall not be assignable or otherwise transferable by any party
without the prior written consent of the other parties; except that Buyer may,
without such consent, assign its rights and obligations, in whole or in part,
under this Agreement to one or more of its wholly-owned Subsidiaries; provided
that no assignment shall relieve Buyer of any liability or obligation
hereunder.

| 
---|--- 

11.11

|

No Third-Party Beneficiaries 

Nothing in this Agreement shall confer any rights upon any Person other than
the Parties and their respective heirs, successors and permitted assigns;
provided, that the last sentence of Section 11.6, this proviso of this Section
11.11, Section 11.13, Section 11.16.1 and Section 11.19, in each case,
pertaining to the Financing Sources, are intended to be for the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable by, the Financing Sources.

11.12

|

Construction; Cooperation 

The parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this
Agreement. If an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises,
this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties and no
presumption or burden of proof will arise favoring or disfavoring any party
because of the authorship of any provision of this Agreement.

11.13

Governing Law 

This Agreement (including any claim, suit, action or proceeding, whether in
law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any
Financing Sources (in their capacities as such) arising out of, or relating
to, this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby, any Financing or the
performance of services thereunder or related thereto) shall be governed in
all respects by the laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to
the conflict of laws rules thereof to the extent such rules would require or
permit the application of the laws of another jurisdiction. Except as set
forth in Section 2.4.3, the parties hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York and the Federal courts of
the United States of America located in the State, City and County of New
York, and hereby waive, and agree not to assert, as a defense in any action,
suit or proceeding for the interpretation or enforcement hereof or pertaining
to any Financing (including any legal proceeding against any Financing
Source), that it is not subject thereto or that such action, suit or
proceeding may not be brought or is not maintainable in said courts or that
the venue thereof may not be appropriate or that this Agreement, any of such
document or any agreements pertaining to any Financing may not be enforced in
or by said courts, and the parties irrevocably agree that all claims with
respect to such action or proceeding shall be heard and determined in such a
New York State or Federal court. The parties hereby consent to and grant any
such court jurisdiction over the person of such parties and over the subject
matter of any such dispute and agree that mailing of process

 or other papers in connection with any such action or proceeding in the manner
provided in Section 11.2, or in such other manner as may be permitted by
applicable Law, shall be valid and sufficient service thereof. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, and any and all matters
or disputes under this Agreement with respect to IFRS compliance shall be
finally determined by the members of the national office of Grant Thornton LLP
that have not previously worked for Seller, Buyer or any of their respective
Affiliates (including any Group Companies).

Specific Performance 

| 
---|--- 

11.14.1

|

The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of
the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that money damages or legal
remedies would not be an adequate remedy for any such damages. Therefore, it
is accordingly agreed that, in addition to any other remedy at law or in
equity, prior to the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section
8.1, each party shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
or restrain any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement by any other
party and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement,
to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with,
the covenants and obligations of any other party, in any court of competent
jurisdiction, and appropriate injunctive relief shall be granted in connection
therewith. Any party seeking an injunction, a decree or order of specific
performance or other equitable remedy shall not be required to provide any
bond or other security in connection therewith and any such remedy shall be in
addition to and not in substitution for any other remedy to which such party
is entitled at law or in equity. If any party brings any action to enforce
specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof by any other
party, the party bringing such action may unilaterally extend the Longstop
Date (notwithstanding the termination provisions of Section 8.1.2), so long as
the party bringing such action is actively seeking a court order for an
injunction or injunctions or to specifically enforce the terms and provisions
of this Agreement. Each party hereto agrees that it will not oppose the
granting of an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief on
the basis that: (i) the other party has an adequate remedy at law; or (ii) an
award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at
law or in equity. 

| 
---|--- 

11.14.2

|

Each of the parties hereto hereby waives: (i) any defenses in any action for
specific performance, including the defense that a remedy at Law would be
adequate; and (ii) any requirement under any Law to post a bond or other
security as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.

Legal Representation 

Buyer hereby agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of its directors,
members, partners, officers, employees and Affiliates, and each of their
respective successors and assigns (all

 such parties, the "Waiving Parties"), that Linklaters LLP may represent Seller
in the event Seller so requests, in each case in connection with any dispute,
litigation, claim, proceeding or obligation arising out of or relating to this
Agreement (any such representation, the "Post-Closing Representation"), and
Buyer on behalf of itself and the Waiving Parties hereby consents thereto and
irrevocably waives (and will not assert) any conflict of interest or any
objection arising therefrom or relating thereto. Each of Buyer and the Group
Companies, for itself and the Waiving Parties, hereby irrevocably acknowledges
and agrees that all communications between Seller and any of its Affiliates
(the "Seller Group") and their counsel, including Linklaters LLP, made in
connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery and
performance under, or any dispute or proceeding arising out of or relating to,
this Agreement, any agreements contemplated by this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated herein, or any matter relating to any of the
foregoing, are privileged communications between the Seller Group and such
counsel and none of Buyer, the Group Companies or any of the Waiving Parties,
nor any Person purporting to act on behalf of or through Buyer or the Group
Companies or any of the Waiving Parties, will seek to obtain the same by any
process. From and after the Closing, each of Buyer and the Group Companies, on
behalf of itself and the Waiving Parties, waives and will not assert any
attorney-client privilege with respect to any communication between Linklaters
LLP, on the one hand, and the Group Companies or any Person in the Seller
Group, on the other hand, occurring during the representation in connection
with the negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery of this Agreement
and the other agreements contemplated hereby and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated herein in connection with any Post-Closing
Representation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) in the event that a dispute
arises between the Group Companies, on the one hand, and a third party other
than Seller, on the other hand, the Group Companies may assert the attorney-
client privilege with respect to privileged communications to prevent
disclosure of confidential communications to such third party and (ii) subject
to and without waiver of the foregoing, and for the avoidance of doubt, each
of the Parties to this Agreement hereby agrees that any pre-Closing attorney-
client privilege and other privilege or immunity attaching to any
communication, advice or materials pertaining to the Group Companies that
would be relevant to Buyer after the Closing, but not related to the
negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery and closing under this Agreement
and consummation of the transactions contemplated herein (or any dispute
related thereto), belong to and shall be controlled by the Group Companies.

Marfrig Guarantee 

|

11.18.1

|

Marfrig irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees to Buyer the due and
punctual payment and performance of the obligations of Seller hereunder (the
"Marfrig Guaranteed Obligations"). If, for any reason whatsoever, Seller fails
or is unable to duly, punctually and fully pay or perform any of the Marfrig
Guaranteed Obligations, Marfrig will forthwith pay or perform, or cause to be
paid or performed, such Marfrig Guaranteed Obligations. Marfrig hereby waives
diligence, presentment, demand of payment, filing objections with a court, any
right to require proceeding first against Seller, any right to require the
prior disposition of the assets of Seller to meet its obligations, notice,
protest and all demands whatsoever. This is a guarantee of payment and
performance and not solely collectability, and is in no way conditioned or
contingent upon any attempts to collect or upon any other condition or
contingency. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Section 11.18, (i) to the extent that Seller is relieved from the Marfrig
Guaranteed Obligations by satisfaction thereof or pursuant to any mutual
written agreement between Buyer and Seller, Marfrig shall be similarly
relieved of such Marfrig Guaranteed Obligations and (ii) Marfrig shall be
permitted to assert any defenses to the exercise of the guaranty in this
Section 11.18 by Buyer available to Seller in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the Agreement in connection with the Marfrig Guaranteed
Obligations (for the avoidance of doubt, except for any defense arising by
operation of any bankruptcy, insolvency, disability, dissolution,
receivership, reorganization or similar Law or by reason of lack of limited
partnership, corporate or other power of Seller, lack of capacity, lack of
authority or any other disability to the enforceability or validity of, or
defense based on the unenforceability or invalidity of, the obligations
against Seller, or other defenses expressly waived hereby or thereby). 

|

Marfrig hereby represents and warrants to Buyer that: (i) Marfrig is a legal
entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of
its jurisdiction of organization; (ii) Marfrig has full corporate power and
authority and has taken all corporate action necessary in order to execute,
deliver and perform its obligations under this Agreement subject to the BNDES
Consent; (iii) this Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Marfrig
and is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Marfrig, enforceable against
it in accordance with its terms, in each case, subject to the BNDES Consent,
except as such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium and other
applicable Law of general application relating to or affecting creditors'
rights and to general principles of equity; (iv) the execution, delivery and
performance by Marfrig of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, do not and will not conflict with,
contravene, 

 result in a violation or breach of or default under (with or without the
giving of notice or the lapse of time or both) or result in the creation of
any Lien upon the assets of Marfrig, or give rise to any right of termination,
cancellation or acceleration of any right or obligation of Marfrig or to a
loss of any benefit to which Marfrig is entitled, or require the Consent of or
other action by any Person (which has not already been validly obtained or
validly taken in accordance with applicable Law), under (a) any applicable
