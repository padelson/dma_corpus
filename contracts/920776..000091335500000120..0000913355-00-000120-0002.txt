                          AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER
                          ----------------------------

     THIS  AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this  "Agreement")  is dated as of July
17, 2000 by and among ERP OPERATING  LIMITED  PARTNERSHIP,  an Illinois  limited
partnership  ("ERP"),  GROVE PROPERTY  TRUST, a Maryland real estate  investment
trust  ("Grove"),  and GROVE  OPERATING,  L.P., a Delaware  limited  partnership
("Grove OP").

                                R E C I T A L S:
                                ----------------

     WHEREAS,  the  General  Partner of ERP and the Board of Trust  Managers  of
Grove (the  "Grove  Board"),  the sole  general  partner of Grove OP,  have each
approved the  acquisition  of the business and assets of Grove by ERP, with such
acquisition  being effected by the  transactions  described  herein,  including,
without  limitation,  the Partnership Merger and Company Merger (each as defined
below and collectively referred to as the "Mergers");

     WHEREAS,  ERP shall form a single member Delaware limited liability company
("New LLC"),  which in turn shall form a second single member  Delaware  limited
liability company ("New LLC2");

     WHEREAS,  the General  Partner of ERP and the Grove Board have approved (i)
the merger of New LLC2 with and into  Grove OP (the  "Partnership  Merger")  and
(ii)  immediately  following the  Partnership  Merger,  the merger (the "Company

company to be formed by ERP ("New LLC3"),  all upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein;

     WHEREAS,  Grove has received a fairness opinion relating to the Mergers, as
more fully described herein;

     WHEREAS,  the Grove Board has: (i) determined that the  consideration to be
paid for each outstanding unit of limited partnership interest in Grove OP (each
an  "Grove  LP  Unit")  in the  Partnership  Merger  is fair to and in the  best
interests of the limited  partners of Grove OP (the  "Limited  Partners");  (ii)
determined  that the  consideration  to be paid for each issued and  outstanding
share of beneficial interest, $.01 par value per share, of Grove (each a "Share"
or  "Grove  Common  Share")  in the  Company  Merger  is fair to and in the best
interests of the  shareholders  of Grove;  and (iii) approved this Agreement and
the transactions  contemplated hereby,  declared their advisability and resolved
to  recommend  approval and adoption of this  Agreement by the  shareholders  of
Grove and Limited Partners; and

     WHEREAS,  ERP,  Grove and Grove OP desire to make certain  representations,
warranties and agreements in connection with the Mergers.

     NOW,  THEREFORE,   in  consideration  of  the  premises,   and  the  mutual
representations,  warranties,  covenants and agreements  contained  herein,  the
parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

                                   THE MERGERS
                                   -----------

     1.1  THE PARTNERSHIP MERGER. Prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time

a.m.  local time on the date to be specified by the parties,  which  (subject to

waiver of the  conditions  set forth in Article 6 by the party  entitled  to the

               the LLC Act and DRULPA, with the Office of the Secretary of State
               of Delaware (the "Delaware Secretary"),  and shall make all other
               filings and recordings required under the LLC Act and DRULPA. The
               Partnership  Merger  shall  become  effective  (the  "Partnership
               Merger   Effective   Time")  upon   filing  of  the   Partnership
               Certificate of Merger. Unless otherwise agreed, the parties shall
               cause  the  Partnership  Merger  Effective  Time to  occur on the
               Closing Date.

          (b)  Immediately  following the Partnership Merger Effective Time, New
               LLC3 and  Grove  shall  execute  and file  Articles  of Merger in
               substantially  the  form  attached  hereto  as  Exhibit  "B" (the
               "Company Articles of Merger"),  executed in accordance with Title
               8 and Title 4A,  with the State  Department  of  Assessments  and
               Taxation of Maryland (the "Maryland Department"),  and shall make

<PAGE>


               shall become effective (the "Company Merger  Effective  Time") at
               such  time as shall  be  specified  in the  Company  Articles  of
               Merger.  Unless  otherwise  agreed,  the parties  shall cause the
               Company Merger Effective Time to occur on the Closing Date.

     1.5  EFFECT OF  COMPANY  MERGER ON  OPERATING  AGREEMENT  OF NEW LLC3.  The
Operating  Agreement  of New LLC3 shall  continue in full force and effect after
the Company Merger Effective Time until amended in accordance with Delaware law.

     1.6 EFFECT OF PARTNERSHIP MERGER ON AGREEMENT OF LIMITED  PARTNERSHIP.  The
Agreement  of  Limited  Partnership  of Grove  OP,  as  amended  (the  "Grove OP
Agreement"),  shall  continue  in full  force and effect  after the  Partnership
Merger  Effective  Time until  further  amended in  accordance  with  applicable
Delaware  law.

     1.7  EFFECT OF  PARTNERSHIP  MERGER ON GROVE LP UNITS.  At the  Partnership
Merger  Effective  Time,  by virtue of the  Partnership  Merger and  without any
action  on the  part  of  ERP,  Grove,  Grove  OP or the  holders  of any of the
following securities:

          (a)  CONVERSION  OF GROVE LP  UNITS.  Each  Grove LP Unit  issued  and
outstanding   immediately  prior  to  the  Partnership   Merger  Effective  Time
(excluding any Grove LP Units to be canceled  pursuant to Section  1.7(b)) shall
be canceled and  converted  into the right to receive,  subject to the terms and
condition of this Agreement, at the election of the Limited Partner holding such
Grove LP Unit made  pursuant to Section  1.9(c),  either (i) $17.00 per Grove LP
Unit (the "Partnership Cash Merger Consideration") payable to the holder thereof
in cash,  without interest thereon,  less any required  withholding of taxes, or
(ii) 0.3696  units  ("ERP  Units") of limited  partnership  interest in ERP (the
"Partnership Unit Merger  Consideration" and, together with the Partnership Cash
Merger Consideration, the "Partnership Merger Consideration"). If, from the date
hereof until the Partnership  Merger  Effective Time, ERP (i) pays a dividend or
makes a distribution on ERP Units in ERP Units,  (ii) subdivides the outstanding
ERP Units into a greater number of ERP Units or (iii)  combines the  outstanding
ERP Units  into a smaller  number of ERP  Units,  the  Partnership  Unit  Merger
Consideration  shall be  adjusted  to reflect  the  proportionate  change in the
number of outstanding  ERP Units. It is the intention of the parties hereto that
the payment of the Partnership Cash Merger  Consideration  shall be treated as a
purchase  by ERP of the Grove LP Units of each  Limited  Partner  who  elects to
receive the Partnership Cash Merger Consideration  pursuant to Proposed Treasury
Regulation ss.1.708-1(c)(3).

          (b)  CANCELLATION.  Each Grove LP Unit held by Grove OP and each Grove
LP Unit owned by ERP or any direct or indirect wholly-owned  subsidiary of Grove
or ERP  immediately  prior to the  Partnership  Merger  Effective Time shall, by
virtue of the  Partnership  Merger  and  without  any  action on the part of the
holder thereof, cease to be outstanding, be canceled and retired without payment
of any consideration therefor and cease to exist.

          (c)  CONVERSION  OF INTERESTS IN NEW LLC2. At the  Partnership  Merger
Effective Time, each interest in New LLC2 shall be automatically  converted into
one Grove LP Unit.


                                       3
<PAGE>


          (d)  CONVERSION  OF  GENERAL  PARTNER  INTEREST.  Each unit of general
partnership  interest in Grove OP shall be unaffected by the Partnership Merger.

          (e) FUTURE CONTINGENT VALUE DISTRIBUTIONS.  The right of any person to
receive  Grove LP Units at any time in the future  with  respect  to  Contingent
Earnout Rights, as defined and contemplated in that certain Agreement,  dated as
of April 22, 1998, as amended by that certain Amendment to Conveyance Agreement,
dated as of August 31, 1998 (the "McNeil Conveyance  Agreement"),  involving the
acquisition  by Grove  Corporation  of  certain  properties  owned by 22 limited
partnerships  affiliated with Alexander H. McNeil,  shall convert into the right
to receive that number of ERP Units calculated in accordance with and subject to
all of the other  terms and  conditions  contemplated  in the McNeil  Conveyance
Agreement;  provided,  however,  that any reference in such  agreements to Grove
Shares  shall be deemed  to refer to  common  shares  ("EQR  Common")  of Equity
Residential  Properties  Trust, a Maryland real estate investment trust ("EQR"),
as traded on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (the "NYSE").

     1.8 EFFECT OF COMPANY  MERGER ON SHARES.  At the Company  Merger  Effective
Time, by virtue of the Company Merger and without any action on the part of ERP,
Grove, Grove OP or the holders of any of the following securities:

     (a)  CONVERSION OF SHARES.  Each Share issued and  outstanding  immediately
          prior to the Company Merger Effective Time (excluding any Shares to be
          canceled  pursuant to Section 1.8(b)) shall be cancelled and converted
          into the right to receive, subject to the terms and conditions of this
          Agreement,  $17.00  per Share  (the  "Company  Merger  Consideration")
          payable to the holder thereof in cash, without interest thereon,  upon
          the surrender of the  certificate  formerly  representing  such Share,
          less  any  required   withholding   of  taxes.   The  Company   Merger
          Consideration  shall be payable in cash  without  interest  thereon in
          accordance  with Section 1.9 as soon as practicable  after the Deposit
          Date,  as defined  herein.

     (B)  CANCELLATION.  Each Share held in the treasury of Grove and each Share
          owned by ERP or any  direct or  indirect  wholly-owned  subsidiary  of
          Grove,  Grove  OP or  ERP  immediately  prior  to the  Company  Merger
          Effective Time shall,  by virtue of the Company Merger and without any
          action on the part of the holder thereof, cease to be outstanding,  be
          canceled and retired without payment of any consideration therefor and
          cease to exist.

     (C)  STOCK OPTIONS.  Except as specifically set forth in Section 5.7(c), at
          the Company Merger Effective Time, each outstanding  option (an "Grove
          Option") to purchase  Shares granted under or pursuant to any employee
          stock option plan or agreement entered into by Grove with any employee
          of Grove or any  subsidiary  thereof  or any  other  person  listed on
          Schedule  2.3 of the Grove  Disclosure  Letter (as defined  herein) or
          otherwise  existing  (the  "Grove  Stock  Option  Plans"),   shall  be
          cancelled and the holder  thereof shall be entitled to receive in cash
          (the  "Total  Option  Amount")  an amount,  if any,  (less  applicable
          withholding  taxes)  equal to the product of: (i) the number of Shares
          previously  subject to such Grove Option,  whether vested or unvested,
          multiplied by; (ii) the excess, if any, of the amount of


                                       4
<PAGE>


          the Company  Merger  Consideration  over the exercise  price per Share
          previously  subject to such Grove  Option,  payable not later than the
          Trading Day immediately following the Company Merger Effective Time.

     1.9 RECEIPT OF CONSIDERATION.

          (a) PAYMENT AGENT.  Prior to the Partnership  Merger Effective Time, a
bank or trust company reasonably  acceptable to Grove shall be designated by ERP
to act as agent in  connection  with the  Mergers to receive  the funds to which
holders of Shares and Grove LP Units shall become entitled  pursuant to Sections
1.7 and 1.8 (the "Paying Agent").

          (b) PROCEDURES FOR RECEIPT OF COMPANY MERGER  CONSIDERATION.  Promptly
after the Company Merger Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall cause to be
mailed to each holder of record,  as of the Company Merger  Effective Time, of a
certificate or  certificates  (the  "Certificates")  that,  prior to the Company
Merger Effective Time,  represented  Shares, a form of letter of transmittal and
instructions  for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates for payment
of the Company Merger  Consideration  therefor.  Upon the surrender of each such
Certificate  formerly   representing  Shares,   together  with  such  letter  of
transmittal,  duly  completed  and  validly  executed  in  accordance  with  the
instructions  thereto,  the Paying  Agent shall pay the holder of record of such
Certificate the Company Merger Consideration  multiplied by the number of Shares
formerly  represented  by such  Certificate,  in  exchange  therefor,  and  such
Certificate  shall  forthwith be canceled.  Until so surrendered  and exchanged,
each such Certificate  (other than Shares held by ERP or Grove, or any direct or
indirect  subsidiary  thereof) shall  represent  solely the right to receive the
Company Merger Consideration. No interest shall be paid or accrue on the Company
Merger Consideration.

          (c) PROCEDURES FOR RECEIPT OF PARTNERSHIP MERGER CONSIDERATION.

          (i) All elections by Limited  Partners to receive the Partnership Cash
Merger Consideration or Partnership Unit Merger Consideration shall be made on a
form  furnished by ERP for that purpose (a "Form of  Election")  and  reasonably
satisfactory to Grove. Each Limited Partner may only make an election to receive
all  Partnership   Cash  Merger   Consideration   or  Partnership   Unit  Merger
Consideration in exchange for all of its Grove LP Units.

          (ii)  Together with the  Prospectus  (as defined  herein),  ERP or the
Paying  Agent shall mail a Form of Election to record  holders of Grove LP Units
as of the record date for the Grove OP Partners  Meeting (as defined below) (the
"Record Date").  Elections  shall be made by Limited  Partners by delivering the
Form of Election to the Paying Agent,  as indicated in the Form of Election.  To
be  effective,  a Form  of  Election  must be  properly  completed,  signed  and
submitted  to the  Paying  Agent by 5:00 p.m.  (New York City  time) on the last
Trading  Day (as  defined  below)  prior  to the date of the  Grove OP  Partners
Meeting  or such other  time and date as ERP and Grove may  mutually  agree (the
"Election  Deadline").  ERP will have the  discretion,  which it may delegate in
whole or in part to the Paying  Agent,  to determine  whether  Forms of Election
have been properly  completed,  signed and submitted or revoked and to disregard
immaterial defects in Forms of Election.  The good faith decision of ERP (or the
Paying Agent) in such matters shall be conclusive  and binding.  Neither ERP nor
the Paying Agent will be under any obligation to notify any person of any defect
in a Form of Election submitted to the


                                       5
<PAGE>


Paying Agent. The Paying Agent shall also make all computations  contemplated by
Section  1.7  and  this  Section  1.9(c)  and all  such  computations  shall  be
conclusive and binding on the Limited Partners in the absence of manifest error.
Any Form of Election may be changed or revoked  prior to the Election  Deadline.
For purposes hereof, if a Limited Partner (i) does not submit a Form of Election
which is received by the Paying Agent prior to the Election Deadline  (including
a Limited  Partner who submits and then  revokes his or her Form of Election and
does not  resubmit a Form of  Election  which is timely  received  by the Paying
Agent) or (ii) submits a Form of Election  which is defective in any manner such
that the Paying Agent cannot reasonably determine the election preference of the
Limited  Partner  submitting  such Form of Election,  then such Limited  Partner
shall be deemed for all purposes of this  Agreement  to have validly  elected to
receive the Partnership Cash Merger  Consideration  with respect to the Grove LP
Units held by such Limited Partner.  Except as specifically  provided in Section
5.13, any Persons (as defined herein)  acquiring Grove LP Units after the Record
Date  shall  be  entitled  to  receive  only  that  form of  Partnership  Merger
Consideration  previously  validly  elected by the  transferor  of such Grove LP
Units or, to the extent no such valid  election was made by such  transferor  in
accordance with this Section 1.9, the Partnership Cash Merger Consideration.

          (iii)  Following  the  Partnership  Merger  Effective  Time, a Limited
Partner  shall be  entitled  to receive  the amount of  Partnership  Cash Merger
Consideration or Partnership Unit Merger  Consideration,  as the case may be, as
calculated in accordance  with Section 1.7. The Paying Agent shall  promptly pay
to each Limited Partner any Partnership Cash Merger  Consideration to which such
Limited  Partner is entitled  pursuant to this Section 1.9. No interest shall be
paid or accrue on the Partnership Cash Merger Consideration. With respect to any
Partnership Unit Merger  Consideration to which such Limited Partner is entitled
pursuant to this Section 1.9, ERP shall  promptly  mail to such Limited  Partner
the documentation  necessary to reflect such Limited Partner's ownership of that
number of ERP Units calculated  pursuant to this Section 1.9 including,  without
limitation,  a signature  page to the Fifth  Amended and  Restated  Agreement of
Limited  Partnership of ERP dated as of August 1, 1998 (the "ERP Agreement") for
execution by such Limited Partner,  which execution shall be a condition to such
Limited  Partner's  receipt of ERP Units.  Notwithstanding  any other  provision
hereof,  no  fractional  ERP  Units  shall  be  issued  in  connection  with the
Partnership Merger.  Instead,  each Limited Partner having a fractional interest
arising  upon the  conversion  of such  Limited  Partner's  Grove  LP Units  for
Partnership Unit Merger  Consideration  shall be paid an amount in cash equal to
the Closing Price (as hereinafter  defined) multiplied by the fraction of an ERP
Unit to which such Limited Partner would otherwise be entitled.  For purposes of
this Section 1.9,  "Closing  Price" shall mean the  unweighted  average  closing
price of a share of EQR Common (as reported in the NYSE Composite  Tape) for the
five (5) Trading Days  immediately  preceding the Partnership  Merger  Effective
Time,  and "Trading Day" shall mean any day on which EQR Common is traded on the
NYSE and reported on its Composite  Tape.

          (d) CONSIDERATION. Within three (3) Trading Days after the Partnership
Merger Effective Time (the "Deposit Date"),  ERP or the Surviving  Company shall
deposit,  or cause to be  deposited,  in trust  with the Paying  Agent,  (i) the
amount of Company  Merger  Consideration  to which  holders  of Shares  shall be
entitled at the Company Merger  Effective Time pursuant to Section 1.8(a) hereof
and (ii) the amount of Partnership Cash Merger Consideration to which holders of
Grove LP Units  shall be  entitled  at the  Partnership  Merger  Effective  Time
pursuant to Section 1.7(a) hereof (the "Total Cash Consideration").


                                       6
<PAGE>


          (e)   INVESTMENT   OF  TOTAL  CASH   CONSIDERATION.   The  Total  Cash
Consideration  shall be  invested  by the  Paying  Agent,  as  directed  by ERP,
provided such investments  shall be limited to direct  obligations of the United
States of America, obligations for which the full faith and credit of the United
States of  America  is pledged to  provide  for the  payment  of  principal  and
interest,  commercial  paper rated of the highest  quality by Moody's  Investors
Service,  Inc. and Standard & Poor's  Corporation,  or  certificates  of deposit
issued by a commercial bank having at least $10,000,000,000 in assets; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that the Total Cash Consideration shall be readily available to satisfy
all obligations to pay the Company Merger Consideration and the Partnership Cash
Merger Consideration in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

          (f)  TERMINATION OF DUTIES.  Promptly  following the date which is one
(1) year after the  Company  Merger  Effective  Time,  ERP will cause the Paying
Agent  to  deliver  to the  Surviving  Company  all cash  and  documents  in its
possession relating to the funds deposited on the Deposit Date described in this
Agreement,  and the Paying  Agent's  duties  relating  thereto shall  terminate.
Thereafter,  each  holder of a  Certificate  formerly  representing  a Share may
surrender such Certificate to ERP and (subject to applicable abandoned property,
escheat  and  similar  laws)  receive in exchange  therefor  the Company  Merger
Consideration, as calculated in accordance with this Section 1.9.

          (g) NO  LIABILITY.  None of ERP,  Grove or Grove OP shall be liable to
any holder of Shares or Grove LP Units for any Company Merger  Consideration  or
Partnership Merger Consideration  delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

          (h) WITHHOLDING  RIGHTS.  ERP or the Paying Agent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the Company Merger  Consideration or Partnership Merger
Consideration   otherwise  payable  pursuant  to  or  in  connection  with  this
Agreement,  or any other  payment or debt  cancellation  made  pursuant  to this
Agreement, to any holder of Shares or Grove LP Units, such amounts as ERP or the
Paying  Agent is required to deduct and  withhold  with respect to the making of
such payment  under the Internal  Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"),
or any provision of state,  local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts
are so withheld  by ERP or the Paying  Agent,  such  withheld  amounts  shall be
treated for all purposes of this  Agreement as having been paid to the holder of
the  Shares or Grove LP  Units,  as the case may be, in  respect  of which  such
deduction and withholding was made by ERP or the Paying Agent.

     1.10  TRANSFER  BOOKS.  At the Company  Merger  Effective  Time,  the stock
transfer  books of  Grove  shall  be  closed,  and  there  shall  be no  further
registration of transfers of Shares thereafter on the records of Grove.

     1.11 NO FURTHER OWNERSHIP RIGHTS IN SHARES.

          (a) The Company Merger Consideration  delivered upon the surrender for
exchange of Shares in  accordance  with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have
been issued in full  satisfaction of all rights  pertaining to such Shares,  and
there  shall be no  further  registration  of  transfers  on the  records of the
Surviving  Company of Shares  which were  outstanding  immediately  prior to the
Company Merger Effective Time. If, after the Company Merger


                                       7
<PAGE>


Effective  Time,  Certificates  are presented to the  Surviving  Company for any
reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article 1.

          (b) The Partnership Merger Consideration delivered upon the conversion
of Grove LP Units in  accordance  with the terms  hereof shall be deemed to have
been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Grove LP Units
and there shall be no further  registration  of  transfers on the records of the
Surviving Partnership of Grove LP Units which were outstanding immediately prior
to the Partnership Merger Effective Time.

     1.12  ADJUSTMENT TO MERGER  CONSIDERATION.  Notwithstanding  Section 1.7 or
Section 1.8, the Partnership Cash Merger Consideration,  Partnership Unit Merger
Consideration and Company Merger  Consideration shall be subject to reduction as
a result of any Closing Agreement Costs (as defined in Section 6.2) as follows:

          (a) The Partnership Cash Merger  Consideration  and the Company Merger
Consideration  shall each be reduced by an amount equal to the Closing Agreement
Costs,  if any, up to an aggregate  of $3.5  million,  divided by the  aggregate
number of Grove LP Units and Grove Shares cancelled and converted in the Mergers
in  exchange  for  the  Partnership  Merger   Consideration  or  Company  Merger
Consideration,  as the case may be (the "Reduction Amount");  provided, however,
that  the  Partnership  Cash  Merger   Consideration   and  the  Company  Merger
Consideration, when adjusted pursuant to this Section 1.12(a), shall be adjusted
to the nearest full cent,  with any fractional cent equal to .5 being rounded to
the next highest full cent.

          (b) If the  Partnership  Cash Merger  Consideration  shall be adjusted
pursuant to Section 1.12(a),  the Partnership Unit Merger Consideration shall be
equal that number of ERP Units  determined by dividing (i) the Partnership  Cash
Merger Consideration, as adjusted pursuant to (a) above, by (ii) $46.00.

                                   ARTICLE 2
                                   ---------

              REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF GROVE AND GROVE OP
              ----------------------------------------------------

     Except as set forth in the letter of even date herewith signed by the Chief
Financial Officer of Grove in his capacity as such and delivered to ERP prior to
the  execution  hereof  (the  "Grove  Disclosure  Letter"),  Grove  and Grove OP
represent and warrant to ERP as follows:

     2.1 ORGANIZATION, STANDING AND POWER OF GROVE AND GROVE OP.

          (a) Grove is a real estate investment trust duly organized and validly
existing  under  the laws of  Maryland  and has the  requisite  trust  power and
authority  to  carry  on its  business  as now  being  conducted.  Grove is duly
qualified or licensed to do business as a foreign  trust and is in good standing
in each  jurisdiction  in which the nature of its  business or the  ownership or
leasing of its properties makes such qualification or licensing necessary, other
than in such  jurisdictions  where the failure to be so  qualified  or licensed,
individually  or in the aggregate,  would not have a material  adverse effect on
the business,  properties,  assets, financial condition or results of operations
of Grove and the  Grove  Subsidiaries  (as  defined  below)  taken as a whole (a
"Grove Material Adverse Effect"). Schedule 2.1 to the Grove Disclosure Letter


                                       8

          (b) Grove OP is a limited  partnership  duly formed,  validly existing
and in good  standing  under  the  laws of the  State of  Delaware,  and has the
requisite  partnership power and authority to carry on its business as now being
conducted.  Grove OP is duly  qualified  or licensed to do business as a foreign
limited  partnership  and is in good standing in each  jurisdiction in which the
nature of its business or the ownership or leasing of its properties  makes such
qualification or licensing necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where the
failure to be so qualified or licensed,  individually or in the aggregate, would
not have a Grove Material  Adverse Effect.  Schedule 2.1 to the Grove Disclosure
Letter sets forth each  jurisdiction  in which Grove OP is qualified or licensed
to do  business,  as well as all  assumed  names  under  which Grove OP conducts
business in such jurisdictions.

     2.2  GROVE  SUBSIDIARIES.   Except  as  otherwise  provided  in  the  Grove

As used in this  Agreement,  "Subsidiary"  of any Person means any  corporation,
partnership,  limited liability company,  joint venture or other legal entity of
which  such  Person  (either  directly  or  through  or  together  with  another
Subsidiary  of such  Person)  owns any of the  capital  stock  or  other  equity
interests of such corporation,  partnership,  limited liability  company,  joint
venture or other legal entity.  As used herein,  "Person"  means an  individual,
corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, association,
trust, unincorporated organization or any


                                       9
<PAGE>


other legal entity.  Without  limiting the  foregoing,  for all purposes of this
Agreement, Grove OP shall be considered a Subsidiary of Grove.

          (b) All  the  outstanding  shares  of  capital  stock  of  each  Grove
Subsidiary that is a corporation have been validly issued and are (A) fully paid
and  nonassessable,  (B) owned by Grove or by another Grove Subsidiary,  and (C)

venture, limited liability company or trust which are owned by Grove, by another
Grove  Subsidiary  or by Grove and another Grove  Subsidiary  are owned free and
clear  of all  Liens.  Each  Grove  Subsidiary  that  is a  corporation  is duly
incorporated  and  validly  existing  under  the  laws  of its  jurisdiction  of
incorporation  and has the requisite  corporate  power and authority to carry on
its  business  as now  being  conducted,  and each  Grove  Subsidiary  that is a
partnership,  limited  liability  company or trust is duly organized and validly
existing  under  the  laws  of its  jurisdiction  of  organization  and  has the
requisite  power and authority to carry on its business as now being  conducted.
Each Grove  Subsidiary  is duly  qualified or licensed to do business  and, with
respect to each Grove  Subsidiary that is a corporation,  is in good standing in
each  jurisdiction  in which the  nature of its  business  or the  ownership  or
leasing of its properties makes such qualification or licensing necessary, other
than in such  jurisdictions  where the failure to be so  qualified  or licensed,
individually  or in the  aggregate,  would  not  have a Grove  Material  Adverse
Effect. True and correct copies of the articles or certificate of incorporation,
articles of  organization,  bylaws,  partnership  agreements,  joint venture and
operating  agreements  or  similar   organizational   documents  of  each  Grove
Subsidiary,  as  amended  to the date of this  Agreement,  have been  previously

Affiliate  (as  defined  herein)  of Grove or any  Grove  Subsidiary  (excluding
individuals,  Grove  Corporation  and Grove  Subsidiaries),  the legal  form and

"Affiliate"  shall  have the same  meaning  as such term is  defined in Rule 405
promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act").

          (d)  The  process  by  which  Grove  merged,  converted  or  otherwise
restructured certain Grove Subsidiaries in October 1999 and December 1999 which,
prior to such dates,  were not  wholly-owned  (directly or indirectly) by Grove,
into  single  member  limited  liability  companies  wholly-owned  (directly  or
indirectly) by Grove or Grove OP (the "Consolidation") conformed in all respects
with all applicable laws and  regulations.  Prior to the date hereof,  Grove has
delivered  to ERP true and correct  copies of all  documents  pertaining  to the
Consolidation.

          (e) Schedule 2.2 to the Grove Disclosure  Letter sets forth all of the
assets and liabilities as of June 30, 2000 of the Grove Subsidiaries  subject to
the Retail Sale Agreement (as defined below).

interest  of Grove  consist of (i)  34,000,000  Grove  Common  Shares,  of which

<PAGE>


Grove  Disclosure  Letter  sets forth the name of each  Limited  Partner and the

Disclosure  Letter.  Except as provided in the Grove OP Agreement or in Schedule
2.3 to the Grove Disclosure  Letter,  Grove OP has not issued or granted or is a
party to any  outstanding  commitments of any kind relating to, or any presently
effective  agreements or understandings with respect to, the issuance or sale of

exchangeable into interests in Grove OP or Grove, except as contemplated by this
Agreement.

          (e) Except as set forth in this  Section 2.3 or in Schedule 2.3 of the
Grove  Disclosure  Letter,  as of  the  date  of  this  Agreement  there  are no
outstanding  securities,   options,   warrants,   calls,  rights,   commitments,
agreements, arrangements or undertakings of any kind to which Grove or any Grove
Subsidiary is a party or by which such entity is bound,  obligating Grove or any
Grove Subsidiary to issue, deliver or sell, or cause to be issued,  delivered or

          (f)  Except  as set  forth in  Schedule  2.3 of the  Grove  Disclosure
Letter,  all dividends or distributions on Grove Shares and Grove LP Units which
have been  authorized or declared  prior to the date of this Agreement have been
paid in full.

     2.4 OTHER INTERESTS AND SALE  OBLIGATIONS.  Except as set forth in Schedule
2.2  or  2.4 of the  Grove  Disclosure  Letter,  neither  Grove  nor  any  Grove
Subsidiary  owns  directly or  indirectly  any interest or  investment  (whether
equity or debt) in any  corporation,  partnership,  limited  liability  company,
joint venture,  business  trust or entity (other than  investments in short-term
investment  securities)  or has any  right or  obligation  (whether  current  or
contingent) to acquire such an interest. With respect to such interests,  except
as set forth in Schedule 2.2 or 2.4 to the Grove  Disclosure  Letter,  Grove and
each such Grove  Subsidiary  owns such interests  which are owned by it free and
clear of all  liens,  pledges,  security  interests,  claims,  options  or other
encumbrances.  Neither Grove nor any of the Grove  Subsidiaries  is in breach in
any material  respect of any  provision of any  agreement,  document or contract
governing  its rights in or to the  interests  owned or held by it, all of which
agreements,  documents and  contracts are (a) set forth on the Grove  Disclosure
Letter,  (b)  unmodified  except as described  therein and (c) in full force and
effect.  To the  Knowledge  of Grove (as  defined  in Section  2.26),  the other
parties to such  agreements,  documents  or  contracts  are not in any  material
breach of any of their respective  obligations under such agreements,  documents
or contracts.

     2.5 AUTHORITY; NONCONTRAVENTION; CONSENTS.

          (a) Grove and Grove OP each have the requisite  power and authority to
enter into this Agreement and,  subject (i) in Grove's case, to the  affirmative
vote of holders of at least  two-thirds of the  outstanding  Grove Common Shares
entitled to vote thereon to approve the Company  Merger (the "Grove  Shareholder
Approvals") and (ii) in Grove OP's case, to the  affirmative  vote of holders of
at least two-thirds of the outstanding Grove OP Units, including


                                       12

approve this  Agreement  and the  transactions  contemplated  hereby (the "Grove
Partner  Approvals"  and,  together with the Grove  Shareholder  Approvals,  the
"Grove  Approvals"),   to  consummate  the  transactions  contemplated  by  this
Agreement to which Grove or Grove OP is a party.  The  execution and delivery of
this Agreement by Grove and Grove OP and the  consummation by Grove and Grove OP
of the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement have been duly authorized by
all necessary  action on the part of Grove or any Grove  Subsidiary,  subject to
the Grove  Approvals.  This  Agreement  has been duly  executed and delivered by
Grove and Grove OP and  constitutes a valid and binding  obligation of Grove and
Grove OP,  enforceable  against Grove and Grove OP in accordance with its terms,

Agreement by Grove or the consummation by Grove of the transactions contemplated

          (c) For purposes of determining  compliance with the Hart-Scott-Rodino

     2.6 SEC DOCUMENTS; FINANCIAL STATEMENTS; UNDISCLOSED LIABILITIES.

          (a)  Except as  indicated  on  Schedule  2.6 to the  Grove  Disclosure
Letter, Grove has filed all required reports,  schedules,  forms, statements and
other  documents with the SEC since January 1, 1995 through the date hereof (the
"Grove SEC Documents") on a timely basis.  Schedule 2.6 of the Grove  Disclosure
Letter  contains a complete list  (without  exhibits) of all Grove SEC Documents
filed by Grove with the SEC since January 1, 1995 and on or prior to the date of
this  Agreement.  All  of  the  Grove  SEC  Documents  (other  than  preliminary
material),  as of their  respective  filing dates, or as of the date of the last
amendment  thereof (if amended after filing),  complied in all material respects
with all applicable  requirements  of the  Securities  Act, and the Exchange Act
and, in each case, the rules and regulations  promulgated  thereunder applicable
to such  Grove SEC  Documents.  None of the Grove SEC  Documents  at the time of
filing contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any
material  fact  required to be stated  therein or necessary in order to make the
statements  therein,  in light of the circumstances  under which they were made,
not  misleading,  except to the extent  such  statements  have been  modified or
superseded by later Grove SEC Documents filed on a non-confidential  basis prior
to the date of this Agreement.  The consolidated  financial  statements of Grove
included in the Grove SEC Documents complied as to form in all material respects
with applicable accounting  requirements and the published rules and regulations
of the  SEC  with  respect  thereto,  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with
accounting  principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") (except,
in the case of unaudited  statements,  as permitted by the applicable  rules and
regulations  of the SEC)  applied  on a  consistent  basis  during  the  periods
involved (except as may be indicated therein or in the notes thereto) and fairly
presented,  in  accordance  with  the  applicable  requirements  of GAAP and the
applicable  rules and  regulations  of the SEC, in all  material  respects,  the
consolidated   financial   position   of  Grove  and  the   consolidated   Grove
Subsidiaries,  taken as a whole,  as of the dates  thereof and the  consolidated
results of operations and cash flows for the periods then ended (subject, in the
case of unaudited  statements,  to normal year-end audit adjustments,  any other
adjustments  described  therein and the fact that certain  information and notes
have been condensed or omitted in accordance  with the Exchange  Act).  Schedule
2.6 of the Grove Disclosure Letter sets forth all Grove  Subsidiaries  which are
not  consolidated  for  accounting  purposes as of the date  hereof.  Except for
liabilities


                                       14
<PAGE>


and  obligations  set forth in the Grove SEC Documents or in Schedule 2.6 to the
Grove Disclosure Letter, neither Grove nor any of the Grove Subsidiaries has any
liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute,  contingent
or otherwise)  required by GAAP to be set forth on a consolidated  balance sheet
of Grove or in the notes thereto and which,  individually  or in the  aggregate,
would have a Grove Material Adverse Effect, after taking into account any assets
acquired  or  services  provided  in  connection  with  the  incurrence  of such
liabilities or obligations.

          (b) Grove has at all times been in material  compliance with the rules
and  regulations  of the American Stock  Exchange  ("AMEX").

          (c) At no time has Grove OP or any other Grove Subsidiary been subject
to the reporting requirements of Sections 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.

     2.7 ABSENCE OF CERTAIN CHANGES OR EVENTS.  Except as disclosed in the Grove
SEC Documents or Schedule 2.7 to the Grove Disclosure Letter,  since the date of
the most recent audited financial statements included in the Grove SEC Documents
(the "Grove  Financial  Statement Date") Grove and the Grove  Subsidiaries  have
conducted  their business only in the ordinary course (taking into account prior
practices,  including the  acquisition of properties and issuance of securities)
and  there  has not  been  (a) any  material  adverse  change  in the  business,
financial condition or results of operations of Grove and the Grove Subsidiaries
taken as a whole (a "Grove  Material  Adverse  Change"),  nor has there been any
occurrence  or  circumstance  that with the passage of time would  reasonably be
expected to result in a Grove Material  Adverse Change,  (b) except (i) prior to
the date hereof,  regular  quarterly  dividends or distributions (in the case of
Grove and Grove OP) not in excess of $0.18 per Grove  Common  Share and Grove OP
Unit with  customary  record and payment  dates and (ii)  subsequent to the date
hereof,  in  accordance  with  Section 5.9, any  declaration,  setting  aside or
payment  of any  dividend  or other  distribution  (whether  in  cash,  stock or
property)  with respect to any Grove  Shares and Grove OP Units,  (c) any split,
combination  or  reclassification  of any Grove  Shares or any  issuance  or the
authorization  of any issuance of any other securities in respect of, in lieu of
or in substitution  for, or giving the right to acquire by exchange or exercise,
shares of its beneficial  interest or any issuance of an ownership  interest in,
any Grove Subsidiary  except as contemplated by this Agreement,  (d) any damage,
destruction or loss, whether or not covered by insurance, that has or would have
a Grove Material  Adverse Effect,  (e) any change made prior to the date of this
Agreement in accounting  methods,  principles or practices by Grove or any Grove
Subsidiary  materially  affecting its assets,  liabilities  or business,  except
insofar as may have been  disclosed  in Grove SEC  Documents  or  required  by a
change in GAAP or (f) any amendment of any  employment,  consulting,  severance,
retention or any other agreement  between Grove and any officer or trust manager
of Grove.

     2.8  LITIGATION.  Except as disclosed in the Grove SEC Documents,  Schedule
2.8 or Schedule  2.9 to the Grove  Disclosure  Letter,  and other than  personal
injury and other  routine tort  litigation  arising from the ordinary  course of
operations of Grove and the Grove Subsidiaries (a) which are covered by adequate
insurance or (b) for which all material costs and liabilities  arising therefrom
are  reimbursable  pursuant to common area  maintenance  or similar  agreements,
there is no suit,  action or  proceeding  pending or, to the Knowledge of Grove,
threatened against or affecting Grove or any Grove Subsidiary that, individually
or in the aggregate, could


                                       15
<PAGE>


reasonably be expected to have a Grove Material Adverse Effect, nor is there any
judgment,  decree,  injunction,  rule or order  of any  Governmental  Entity  or
arbitrator  outstanding  against Grove or any Grove Subsidiary  having, or which
could  reasonably  be expected to have,  any such  effect.  Notwithstanding  the
foregoing,  (y) Schedule 2.8 to the Grove Disclosure  Letter sets forth each and
every claim involving a potential  dollar cost to Grove in excess of $50,000 and
each and every equal employment  opportunity  claim and claim relating to sexual
harassment  and/or  discrimination  pending  or,  to  the  Knowledge  of  Grove,
threatened  as of the date  hereof,  in each case with a brief  summary  of such
claim or  threatened  claim and (z) no claim is  pending  or has been made since
January 1, 1995 under any trustees', directors' or officers' liability insurance
policy maintained at any time by Grove or any of the Grove  Subsidiaries.  There
is no  suit,  action  or  proceeding  pending,  or to the  Knowledge  of  Grove,
threatened,  against Grove or any Grove  Subsidiary which  challenges,  states a
cause of action  grounded in, or seeks  damages in respect of, the  transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

     2.9 PROPERTIES.

          (a) Schedule 2.9 to the Grove  Disclosure  Letter  identifies all real
property  owned or  leased by Grove  and the  Grove  Subsidiaries  and the Grove
Subsidiary or  Subsidiaries  which owns or leases such real property (the "Grove
Properties"). Except as provided in Schedule 2.9 of the Grove Disclosure Letter,
Grove or the Grove  Subsidiary set forth on Schedule 2.2 of the Grove Disclosure
Letter owns fee simple  title to their  respective  Grove  Properties.  All such
properties are owned in each case free and clear of liens, mortgages or deeds of
trust,  claims against  title,  charges which are liens,  security  interests or
other  encumbrances  on title  securing  monetary  obligations  ("Encumbrances")
(except as provided below).  Except as set forth in Schedule 2.2,  Schedule 2.18
or  Schedule  2.9 of the  Grove  Disclosure  Letter,  no  other  Person  has any
ownership  interest  in any of the  Grove  Properties,  and any  such  ownership
interest  so  scheduled  does not  materially  detract  from the  value  of,  or
materially  interfere  with the  present  use of,  any of the  Grove  Properties
subject thereto or affected thereby. The Grove Properties are not subject to any
rights of way, written agreements,  laws,  ordinances and regulations  affecting
building  use  or   occupancy,   or   reservations   of  an  interest  in  title
(collectively,  "Property  Restrictions") or other Encumbrances,  except for (i)
Encumbrances and Property Restrictions set forth in the Grove Disclosure Letter,
(ii) Property  Restrictions  imposed or promulgated  by law or any  governmental
body or authority with respect to real property,  including zoning  regulations,
provided they do not  materially  adversely  affect the current use of any Grove
Property,  (iii)  Encumbrances and Property  Restrictions  disclosed on existing
title reports or existing  surveys (in either case copies of which title reports
and surveys have been  delivered or made available to ERP),  which  Encumbrances
and Property  Restrictions  disclosed  in Schedule  2.9 to the Grove  Disclosure
Schedule or contained in the previously  delivered title reports,  in any event,
do not materially interfere with the present use of, any of the Grove Properties
subject thereto or affected thereby (provided that Grove specifically represents
and warrants that any  Encumbrances  identified on any existing  title report as
securing any  Indebtedness,  other than the Indebtedness  identified on Schedule
2.18 of the Grove Disclosure  Letter, has been released of record since the date
of the title report in question),  (iv) real estate taxes and assessments  which
constitute a Lien but are not yet due and payable and (v) mechanics', carriers',
workmen's,  repairmen's  liens,  other  Encumbrances  and Property  Restrictions
(other than Encumbrances and Property Restrictions contained in any agreement of
the type  described in Section 2.9(j) and disclosed on Schedule 2.9 to the Grove
Disclosure Letter), if any, which, individually or in the


                                       16
<PAGE>


aggregate,  do not materially detract from the value of or materially  interfere
with the present use of any of the Grove Properties  subject thereto or affected
thereby, and do not otherwise materially impair business operations conducted by
Grove and the Grove  Subsidiaries,  taken as a whole.  Except  as  disclosed  in
Schedule  2.9 of the Grove  Disclosure  Letter,  no  portion of any of the Grove
Properties  is  located  in a flood  zone  area for  which  flood  insurance  is
available under a federally  sponsored  insurance program except for that which,
individually or in the aggregate, do not materially detract from the value of or
materially interfere with the present use of such Grove Property subject thereto
or affected  thereby.  Schedule 2.9 lists each of the Grove  Properties which is
under development as of the date of this Agreement.

          (b) Except as provided in Schedule 2.9 to the Grove Disclosure Letter,
valid policies of title insurance  (each a "Grove Title Insurance  Policy") have
been issued insuring  Grove's or the applicable  Grove  Subsidiary's  fee simple
title to the Grove  Properties,  subject only to the matters disclosed above and
on the Grove Disclosure  Letter,  and such policies are, at the date hereof,  in
full force and effect and no claim has been made against any such policy. A true
and  correct  copy of each Grove  Title  Insurance  Policy  has been  previously
delivered to ERP.

          (c) Except as provided in Schedule 2.9 to the Grove Disclosure  Letter
or in Grove's capital budget attached to the Grove Disclosure Letter (the "Grove
Capital  Budget"),  Grove has no Knowledge (i) that, any certificate,  permit or
license from any  governmental  authority  having  jurisdiction  over any of the
Grove Properties or any agreement, easement or other right which is necessary to
permit the lawful use and operation of the buildings and  improvements on any of
the Grove  Properties or which is necessary to permit the lawful current use and
operation of all  driveways,  roads and other means of egress and ingress to and
from any of the Grove  Properties has not been obtained and is not in full force
and effect,  or of any pending threat of  modification or cancellation of any of
same;  (ii) of any written  notice of any  violation  of any  federal,  state or
municipal  law,  ordinance,  order,  regulation or  requirement  materially  and
adversely  affecting  any of the Grove  Properties  issued  by any  governmental
authority;  (iii) of any  material  structural  defects  relating  to any  Grove
Property  which costs more than  $75,000 to repair;  (iv) of any Grove  Property
whose  building  systems are not in working  order in any  material  respect and
costs  more than  $75,000  to repair;  (v) of any  physical  damage to any Grove
Property in excess of $75,000 for which there is no insurance in effect covering
the  cost  of the  restoration;  (vi) of any  current  renovation  or  uninsured
restoration underway to any Grove Property the cost of which exceeds $75,000; or
(vii) of items referred to in Section 2.9(c)(iii)-(vi) which aggregate for Grove
and the Grove Subsidiaries more than $1,000,000.

          (d)  Except  as set  forth in  Schedule  2.9 to the  Grove  Disclosure
Letter, neither Grove nor any of the Grove Subsidiaries has received any written
notice to the effect  that (i) any  condemnation  or  rezoning  proceedings  are
pending or  threatened  with respect to any of the Grove  Properties or (ii) any
zoning, building or similar law, code, ordinance, order or regulation is or will
be  violated  in  any  material  respect  for  any  property  by  the  continued
maintenance,  operation or use of any buildings or other  improvements on any of
the Grove  Properties  in accordance  with current  practice or by the continued
maintenance, operation or use of the parking areas.

<PAGE>



          (e)  Except  as set  forth in  Schedule  2.9 to the  Grove  Disclosure
Letter, all of the Grove Properties are managed by Grove or a wholly-owned Grove
Subsidiary.

          (f) The rent roll for the Grove  Properties  as of April 30,  2000 has
been  previously  delivered  to ERP, and is complete and correct in all material
respects  as of the date  thereof  (the "Rent  Roll").  The Rent Roll lists each
lease with respect the Grove Properties,  identifies the leased premises,  names
all tenants,  indicates  square  footage or other  indication  of space  leased,
monthly rental, date to which paid, term of lease, date of occupancy and date of
expiration.

          (g)  Except  as set  forth in  Schedule  2.9 to the  Grove  Disclosure
Letter,  all work  required to be  performed,  payments  required to be made and
actions  required to be taken prior to the date hereof pursuant to any agreement
entered into with a  governmental  body or authority in  connection  with a site
approval,  zoning reclassification or other similar action relating to any Grove
Properties  (e.g.,  local  improvement  district,   road  improvement  district,
environmental  mitigation)  have been performed,  paid or taken, as the case may
be,  other than those where,  individually  or in the  aggregate  with any other
condition  or  omission  resulting  in  a  breach  of  the  representations  and
warranties  set forth in this Section  2.9,  the failure  would not have a Grove
Material  Adverse  Effect,  and Grove has no  Knowledge  of any  material  work,
payments or actions  that are  required  after the date hereof  pursuant to such
agreements,  except as set forth in  development  or operating  budgets for such
Grove Properties delivered to ERP prior to the date hereof.

          (h) Grove and each of the Grove  Subsidiaries have good and sufficient
title to all their  personal and  non-real  properties  and assets  reflected in
their books and records as being owned by them (including those reflected in the
consolidated  balance  sheet of Grove as of December 31,  1999,  except as since
sold or otherwise  disposed of in the  ordinary  course of  business),  free and
clear of all liens and  encumbrances,  except  such  Encumbrances  reflected  on
Schedule  2.18  or  Schedule  2.9  to  the  Grove  Disclosure  Letter  or on the
consolidated  balance  sheet of Grove as of  December  31,  1999,  and the notes
thereto,  and except for Liens for current  taxes not yet due and  payable,  and
Liens or  encumbrances  which are normal to the  business of Grove and the Grove
Subsidiaries  and are not, in the aggregate,  material in relation to the assets
of Grove on a  consolidated  basis and  except  also for such  imperfections  of
title,  easement and encumbrances,  if any, as do not materially  interfere with
the present  use of the  properties  subject  thereto or  affected  thereby,  or
otherwise materially impair the consolidated business operations of Grove.

          (i)  Except  as set  forth in  Schedule  2.9 to the  Grove  Disclosure
Letter,  no Grove  Property is  currently  under  development  or subject to any
agreement  with  respect  to  development,  and  neither  Grove  nor  any  Grove
Subsidiary shall enter into any such agreements  between the date hereof and the
Company Merger Effective Time without the prior written approval of ERP.

          (j) Schedule 2.9 to the Grove Disclosure  Letter sets forth each Grove
Property  subject to regulation by HUD, MHFA or similar  agency,  as well as any
agreements entered into between Grove and any Grove Subsidiary and such agencies
(including, without limitation, any so-called 121A excise tax agreements). Those
certain  closing  binders  delivered  to ERP by Grove  prior to the date  hereof
contain true and correct copies of all such agreements. Grove and


                                       18
<PAGE>


the Grove  Subsidiaries  have at times been in  compliance  with all  applicable
rules and regulations of, and agreements with, HUD, MHFA or similar agencies.

     2.10 ENVIRONMENTAL  MATTERS. Grove has delivered to ERP a true and complete
copy of the  environmental  reports by  third-party  consulting  firms listed on
Schedule  2.10  of  the  Grove  Disclosure  Letter  (the  "Grove   Environmental
Reports"). To Grove's Knowledge,  the Grove Environmental Reports constitute all
final environmental reports (including,  without limitation,  all final versions
of environmental investigations and testing or laboratory analysis made by or on
behalf  of Grove or any of the Grove  Subsidiaries)  with  respect  to the Grove
Properties in the possession of Grove or any Grove  Subsidiary.  With respect to
each  Grove  Property,  except for any  condition  that  individually  or in the
aggregate  would not be  reasonably  expected to have a Grove  Material  Adverse
Effect,  (a) no Hazardous  Substances (as defined below) have been used, stored,
manufactured,  treated,  processed  or  transported  to or from any  such  Grove
Property  except as necessary to the conduct of business and in compliance  with

Grove and the Grove  Subsidiaries have not received and do not reasonably expect
to receive any notice of potential  responsibility,  letter of inquiry or notice
of alleged  liability under any Environmental Law from any Person regarding such
Grove Property or the business conducted thereon,  provided,  however, that with
respect  to  any  Grove  Property  covered  by  an  Environmental   Report,  the
representation  contained in this Section 2.10 covers only that period following
the date of such  Environmental  Report.  For the  purposes of this Section 2.10
only, "Grove Properties" shall be deemed to include all property formerly owned,
operated or leased by Grove or the Grove  Subsidiaries;  solely,  however, as to

               Hazardous   Substances   into   ambient   air,   surface   water,
               groundwater,  watercourses, publicly or privately owned treatment
               works,  drains, sewer systems,  wetlands,  septic systems or onto
               land;

          (b)  the use, treatment,  storage, disposal, handling,  manufacturing,
               transportation  or  shipment  of  Hazardous  Substances;

          (d)  otherwise   relating  to   pollution   or  the   protection   the
               environment.

     "Hazardous  Substances"  shall  mean all  substances,  wastes,  pollutants,
contaminants  and  materials  regulated or defined or  designated  as hazardous,
extremely or imminently hazardous,

plan, as defined in Section 3(2) of the Employee  Retirement Income Security Act
of 1974,  as  amended  and the  rules  and  regulations  promulgated  thereunder
("ERISA")  ("Pension Plan"),  and any welfare plan as defined in Section 3(1) of
ERISA  ("Welfare  Plan")),  whether any of the  foregoing is funded,  insured or
self-funded,  written or oral,  (i)  sponsored or  maintained  by Grove or Grove
Subsidiaries  (each a  "Controlled  Group  Member") and covering any  Controlled
Group  Member's  active or former  employees (or their  beneficiaries),  (ii) to
which any Controlled  Group Member is a party or by which any  Controlled  Group
Member (or any of the rights,  properties  or assets  thereof) is bound or (iii)
with respect to which any current Controlled Group Member may otherwise have any
material  liability (whether or not such Controlled Group Member still maintains
such Employee Plan). Each Employee Plan is listed on Schedule 2.12. With respect
to the Employee Plans:

          (a)  Except as  disclosed  in the Grove SEC  Documents  or in Schedule
               2.12 to the Grove Disclosure  Letter,  no Controlled Group Member
               has  any  continuing  liability  under  any  Welfare  Plan  which
               provides for continuing  benefits or coverage for any participant
               or any  beneficiary  of a  participant  after such  participant's
               termination of  employment,  except as may be required by section
               4980B of the Code or Section 601 (ET SEQ.) of ERISA, or under any
               applicable  state law, and at the expense of the  participant  or
               the beneficiary of the participant.

          (b)  Each  Employee  Plan  complies in all material  respects with the
               applicable  requirements  of ERISA and any other  applicable  law
               governing  such Employee  Plan, and each Employee Plan has at all
               times been  properly  administered  in all  material  respects in
               accordance  with all such  requirements of law, and in accordance
               with  its  terms  and  the  terms  of any  applicable  collective
               bargaining  agreement  to the  extent  consistent  with  all such
               requirements  of law.  Each  Pension Plan which is intended to be
               qualified  is qualified  under  Section  401(a) of the Code,  has
               received  a  favorable  determination  letter  from the  Internal
               Revenue  Service  (the  "IRS")  stating  that such Plan meets the
               requirements  of  Section  401(a)  of the Code and that the trust
               associated  with such Plan is tax exempt under Section  501(a) of
               the Code and no event has occurred which would


                                       21
<PAGE>


               jeopardize  the  qualified  status  of any  such  Plan or the tax
               exempt status of any such trust under Section  401(a) and Section
               501(a) of the Code, respectively. No lawsuits, claims (other than
               routine  claims for benefits) or complaints to, or by, any person
               or governmental entity have been filed or are pending,  Grove has
               received no notice of such a lawsuit,  claim or complaint and, to
               the Knowledge of Grove,  there is no fact or  contemplated  event
               which would be expected to give rise to any such  lawsuit,  claim
               (other  than  routine  claims for  benefits)  or  complaint  with
               respect to any Employee  Plan.  Without  limiting the  foregoing,
               except as  disclosed  on  Schedule  2.12 to the Grove  Disclosure
               Letter,  the  following  are true with  respect to each  Employee
               Plan:

          (i) except for those not yet required to be filed or distributed,  all
Controlled Group Members have filed or caused to be filed every material return,
report, statement, notice, declaration and other document required by any law or
governmental agency,  federal,  state and local (including,  without limitation,
the IRS and the  Department of Labor),  with respect to each such Employee Plan,
each of such filings has been complete and accurate in all material respects and
no  Controlled  Group Member has incurred any material  liability in  connection
with  such  filings;

          (ii) except for those not yet required to be filed or distributed, all
Controlled  Group  Members  have  delivered  or caused to be  delivered to every
participant, beneficiary and other party entitled to such material, all material
plan descriptions,  returns, reports, schedules, notices, statements and similar
materials,  including, without limitation, summary plan descriptions and summary
annual reports,  as are required under Title I of ERISA,  the Code, or both, and
no  Controlled  Group Member has incurred any material  liability in  connection
with such deliveries;

          (iii) all  contributions  and payments with respect to Employee  Plans
that are  required  to be made by a  Controlled  Group  Member  with  respect to
periods ending on or before the Closing Date  (including  periods from the first
day of the current plan or policy year to the Closing  Date) have been,  or will
be, made or accrued before the Closing Date in accordance  with the  appropriate
plan document,  actuarial report,  collective  bargaining agreement or insurance
contract or arrangement or as otherwise required by ERISA or the Code;

          (iv)  with  respect  to  each  such  Employee   Plan,  to  the  extent
applicable,  Grove has delivered to ERP true and complete  copies of (A) current
plan  documents,  or any and all other documents that establish the existence of
the current plan,  trust,  arrangement,  contract,  policy or commitment and all
amendments thereto, (B) the most recent  determination  letter, if any, received
from the IRS,  (C) the three  most  recent  Form  5500  Annual  Report  (and all
schedules  and  reports  relating  thereto)  and  actuarial  reports and (D) all
related trust agreements,  insurance  contracts or other funding agreements that
implement each such Employee Plan.

          (c)  With respect to each Employee Plan,  there has not occurred,  and
               no person or entity is  contractually  bound to enter  into,  any
               "prohibited transaction" within the meaning of Section 4975(c) of
               the Code or Section 406 of ERISA, which transaction is not exempt
               under Section 4975(d) of the Code or Section 408 of ERISA.


                                       22
<PAGE>



          (d)  Except as disclosed in Schedule 2.12A, no Controlled Group Member
               has  maintained  or been  obligated to contribute to any Employee
               Plan  subject  to Code  Section  412 or Title IV of  ERISA.  With
               respect to each Employee Plan set forth on Schedule 2.12A,  Grove
               represents  that  each  such  Employee  Plan has been  completely
               terminated in accordance with all Code and ERISA requirements for
               a "standard  termination"  (as  defined in 4041(b) of ERISA),  as
               applicable on the termination date.

          (e)  Except as set  forth in  Schedule  2.12 to the  Grove  Disclosure
               Letter,  with  respect to each  Pension  Plan  maintained  by any
               Controlled Group Member,  such Plan provides the Plan Sponsor the
               authority  to amend or  terminate  the Pension  Plan at any time,
               subject to applicable requirements of ERISA and the Code.

          (f)  Except as  disclosed  on  Schedule  2.12 to the Grove  Disclosure
               Letter,   Grove  has  no  obligation  to  make  payments  to  any
               individual to offset,  in whole or in part,  any federal or state
               income taxes,  including taxes imposed pursuant to the provisions
               of Code  Sections  280G or  4999,  and  the  consummation  of the
               transactions  contemplated  by this  Agreement will not result in
               any excise tax withholding.

     2.13 EMPLOYEE  MATTERS.  Schedule 2.13 of the Grove Disclosure Letter lists
the employee handbooks of Grove and each of the Grove Subsidiaries  currently in
effect. A copy of each such employee handbook has previously been made available
to ERP.  Except as set forth in Schedule  2.13 of the Grove  Disclosure  Letter,
such handbooks fairly and accurately  summarize all material employee  policies,
vacation  policies and payroll  practices  of Grove and the Grove  Subsidiaries.
Neither Grove nor any of the Grove  Subsidiaries is a party to, or bound by, any
collective  bargaining  agreement,  contract or other agreement or understanding
with a labor  union or other  labor  organization,  nor has  Grove or any of the
Grove  Subsidiaries  agreed that any unit of their  employees is appropriate for
collective  bargaining.  No union or other labor organization has been certified
as bargaining  representative for any of Grove's employees.  To the Knowledge of
Grove there are no  organizational  efforts with  respect to the  formation of a
collective   bargaining  unit  presently  being  made  or  threatened  involving
employees of Grove or any of the Grove Subsidiaries.

     2.14 TAXES.

          (a) Each of Grove and the Grove Subsidiaries has filed all tax returns
and  reports  required  to be filed by it (after  giving  effect  to any  filing
extension  properly granted by a Governmental  Entity having authority to do so)
and has paid (or Grove has paid on its  behalf)  all  Taxes (as  defined  below)
shown or  reflected on such returns and reports as required to be paid by it and
all such tax  returns  are correct in all  material  respects  except (i) as set
forth in Schedule 2.14 to the Grove Disclosure Letter, or (ii) real estate taxes
that are being  contested  in good  faith by  appropriate  proceedings,  each as
described in Schedule 2.14 to the Grove Disclosure  Letter,  and for which Grove
or the applicable  Grove  Subsidiary  shall have set aside on its books adequate
reserves.  Except  with  respect to any Taxes which might be imposed or assessed
with respect to the matters set forth in Schedule 5.6(d) to the Grove Disclosure
Letter, the most recent audited financial  statements contained in the Grove SEC
Documents reflect an


                                       23
<PAGE>


adequate  reserve  for all  material  Taxes  payable or accrued by Grove and the
Grove Subsidiaries for all taxable periods and portions thereof through the date
of such financial  statements.  Since the Grove Financial  Statement Date, Grove
has incurred no liability for Taxes under Sections 857(b), 860(c) or 4981 of the
Code,  including,   without  limitation,  any  Tax  arising  from  a  prohibited
transaction  described in Section  857(b)(6) of the Code,  and neither Grove nor
any Grove  Subsidiary  has  incurred any  liability  for Taxes other than in the
ordinary course of business.  No deficiencies  for any Taxes have been proposed,
asserted or assessed  pursuant to a "30-day letter" or notice of deficiency sent
by the IRS, or, to the Knowledge of Grove,  except as set forth in Schedule 2.14
of the Grove Disclosure Letter, otherwise proposed, asserted or assessed against
Grove or any of the Grove  Subsidiaries.  No  waivers  of the time to assess any
such Taxes  have been  executed  by Grove or any Grove  Subsidiary  and,  to the
Knowledge of Grove,  no requests  for such waivers are pending.  As used in this
Agreement,  "Taxes" shall include all federal,  state, local and foreign income,
property,  sales,  franchise,  employment,  excise and other  taxes,  tariffs or
governmental charges of any nature whatsoever, together with penalties, interest
or additions to Tax with respect thereto.

          (b) Grove (i) has been subject to taxation as a real estate investment
trust (a "REIT") within the meaning of Section 856 of the Code  commencing  with
the taxable year beginning  January 1, 1994, and has satisfied all  requirements
to qualify as a REIT for such years, (ii) has operated,  and intends to continue
to operate,  in such a manner as to qualify as a REIT until the  Company  Merger
Effective Time and (iii) has not taken or omitted to take any action which would
reasonably  be  expected  to (A) result in any rents paid by the  tenants of the
Properties  to be excluded  from the  definition  of "rents from real  property"
under Section  856(d)(2)(C) of the Code, or (B) otherwise  result in a challenge
to its  status as a REIT,  and no such  challenge  is  pending  or,  to  Grove's
Knowledge,  threatened.  Each Grove  Subsidiary  which is a  partnership,  joint
venture or  limited  liability  company  (i) has been  since its  formation  and
continues to be treated for federal  income tax purposes as either a partnership
or ignored  as a separate  entity  and not as a  corporation  or an  association
taxable  as a  corporation,  as the case may be,  and  (ii)  has not  since  its
formation owned any assets  (including,  without  limitation,  securities)  that
would  cause  Grove  to  violate  Section  856(c)(4)  of the  Code.  Each  Grove
Subsidiary  which is a  corporation  or treated as an  association  taxable as a
corporation  has been  since  the  date of its  formation  or  January  1,  1994
(whichever is later) a qualified  REIT  subsidiary  under Section  856(i) of the
Code.  All former  Grove  Subsidiaries,  if such  entities  had  remained  Grove
Subsidiaries,  would  comply  with  this  Section  2.14.

     2.15 NO PAYMENTS TO EMPLOYEES, OFFICERS, TRUST MANAGERS OR DIRECTORS.

          (a) Set forth in  Schedule  2.15 of the Grove  Disclosure  Letter is a
true and complete list of all cash and non-cash payments,  rights to property or
other  contract  rights  which may become  payable,  accelerated  or vested as a
result of the Company Merger or Partnership  Merger ("Section 2.15 Payments") to
or in each  current  or former  employee,  officer,  trustee,  trust  manager or
director  of Grove or any Grove  Subsidiary  (each a "Section  2.15  Employee").
Except  as  described  Schedule  2.15  to the  Grove  Disclosure  Letter,  or as
otherwise  provided for in this  Agreement,  there is no employment or severance
contract, or other agreement requiring payments, cancellation of indebtedness or
other  obligation  to be made on a change of control or otherwise as a result of
the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, with
respect to any current or former employee, officer, trust manager, trustee or


                                       24
<PAGE>


director of Grove or any Grove Subsidiary.  On or prior to the date hereof, each
executive  officer  of Grove  listed on  Schedule  2.15 to the Grove  Disclosure
Letter  (each a "Grove  Executive")  has  executed  an  amendment  to such Grove
Executive's  employment  agreement  or  arrangement  with  Grove  or  any  Grove
Subsidiary in the applicable form attached to Schedule 2.15.

          (b) Schedule 2.15 to the Grove Disclosure  Schedule sets forth (i) all
payments (whether in cash, in equity securities of Grove or any Grove Subsidiary
or  otherwise)  to be made to or for the  account of  employees  of Grove or any
Grove Subsidiary  (except for wages paid in the normal course of business) which
have  been  authorized  and/or  accrued  but not paid and (ii) all  compensation
payments  which have been made to any  employees  listed on Schedule 2.15 to the
Grove  Disclosure  Letter from January 1, 2000  through July 7, 2000.  As of the
date of this  Agreement,  no  compensation  payments  have  been  made to  Grove
employees since July 6, 2000.

          (c) Any Section 2.15 Payment or arrangement  or program  providing for
Section 2.15 Payments which were authorized, adopted, approved or ratified after
June 12, 2000 have been authorized, adopted, approved or ratified by the Special
Committee,  other than the grants of certain  Grove  Options  pursuant to and in
accordance  with the 1996 Plan,  each of which is disclosed on Schedule  2.15 to
the Grove Disclosure Letter.

     2.16  BROKERS;  SCHEDULE  OF FEES AND  EXPENSES.  Except  as  disclosed  in
Schedule 2.16 to the Grove  Disclosure  Letter,  no broker,  investment  banker,
financial advisor or other person, other than Houlihan Lokey Howard & Zukin, the
fees and expenses of which have previously been disclosed to ERP, is entitled to
any broker's,  finder's,  financial advisor's or other similar fee or commission
in  connection  with  the  transactions   contemplated  hereby  or  any  pending
acquisition  or  disposition  by  Grove  or  any  Grove  Subsidiary  based  upon
arrangements made by or on behalf of Grove or any Grove  Subsidiary.  A true and
correct copy of the engagement letter for Houlihan Lokey Howard & Zukin and each
person  referred to on Schedule 2.16 has been delivered to ERP prior to the date
hereof.

     2.17 COMPLIANCE  WITH LAWS.  Except as disclosed in the Grove SEC Documents
or in Schedule  2.6 or Schedule  2.17 to the Grove  Disclosure  Letter,  neither
Grove nor any of the Grove  Subsidiaries  has  violated or failed to comply with
any statute, law, ordinance,  regulation, rule, judgment, decree or order of any
Governmental Entity applicable to its business, properties or operations, except
to the extent that such  violation  or failure  would not have a Grove  Material
Adverse Effect.

     2.18 CONTRACTS; DEBT INSTRUMENTS.

          (a) To the  Knowledge  of Grove,  except as disclosed in the Grove SEC
Documents  or in  Schedule  2.18 to the  Grove  Disclosure  Letter,  there is no
contract or agreement  that purports to limit in any material  respect the names
under or the  geographic  location  in which Grove or any Grove  Subsidiary  may
conduct its  business.  Neither  Grove nor any Grove  Subsidiary  has received a
written  notice  that Grove or any Grove  Subsidiary  is in  violation  of or in
default  under (nor to the  Knowledge  of Grove does there  exist any  condition
which upon the  passage of time or the giving of notice or both would cause such
a violation of or default  under) any material loan or credit  agreement,  note,
bond, mortgage, indenture, lease, permit, concession,  franchise, license or any
other material contract, agreement, arrangement or understanding, to


                                       25
<PAGE>


which it is a party or by which it or any of its  properties or assets is bound,
except as set forth in Schedule 2.18 to the Grove Disclosure  Letter, nor to the
Knowledge of Grove does such a violation or default  exist,  except as set forth
in  Schedule  2.18 to the Grove  Disclosure  Letter,  or to the extent that such
violation or default,  individually or in the aggregate,  would not have a Grove
Material Adverse Effect.

          (b) Schedule 2.18 to the Grove Disclosure  Letter sets forth a list of
each loan or credit  agreement,  note, bond,  mortgage,  indenture and any other
agreement and instrument  pursuant to which any Indebtedness (as defined herein)
of  Grove  or  any  Grove   Subsidiary  is   outstanding   or  may  be  incurred
(collectively,   the  "Debt  Documents"),  as  well  as,  with  respect  to  the
Indebtedness  evidenced  by  each  Debt  Document,  as  of  July  1,  2000,  the
outstanding  principal balance,  the maturity date, the applicable interest rate
(including  the method or formula for  calculating  any  interest  that is not a
fixed  percentage of the  principal  balance) and the amount of or the method or
formula  for  calculating  any Equity  Participation  (as defined  herein).  For
purposes of this Section 2.18,  "Indebtedness"  shall mean (i)  indebtedness for
borrowed money, whether secured or unsecured, (ii) obligations under conditional
sale or other title retention  agreements relating to property purchased by such
person,  (iii)  capitalized lease  obligations,  (iv) obligations under interest
rate cap, swap, collar or similar  transaction or currency hedging  transactions
(valued at the  termination  value  thereof),  (v) obligations to pay any equity
kicker or other participation in the operating cash flow, gross revenue or other
income from the real property or other asset of Grove or any Grove Subsidiary or
in the  gross,  net or excess  sale,  financing,  refinancing  or other  capital
proceeds  from any such  property or other asset  (whether or not in  connection
with  any  other  Indebtedness)  (each  an  "Equity   Participation")  and  (vi)
guarantees of any such indebtedness of any other person. Grove hereby represents
and warrants that each item of  Indebtedness  may be assumed by ERP without cost
or penalty, except as set forth in Schedule 2.18 to the Grove Disclosure Letter,
and without the consent of or requirement to obtain the approval or confirmation
as to any matter from the holder of any such  Indebtedness  or any other person.
For purposes of this Section 2.18, "assumed by ERP" shall mean that, immediately
or  after  the  giving  of  notice  or the  passage  of  time  (or  both),  such
Indebtedness will not, either automatically or upon the exercise of any right or
option of the holder of such Indebtedness or any other person, be accelerated or
become due and  payable in whole or in part as a result of the  consummation  of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including,  without limitation,
the Mergers).

          (c)  Schedule  2.18 to the Grove  Disclosure  Letter  sets  forth each
interest rate cap,  interest rate collar,  interest rate swap,  currency hedging
transaction,  and any other agreement relating to a similar transaction to which
Grove or any Grove Subsidiary is a party or an obligor with respect thereto.

          (d)  Except as set  forth in  Schedule  2.18 to the  Grove  Disclosure
Letter,  neither  Grove  nor  any of the  Grove  Subsidiaries  is  party  to any
agreement  which  would  restrict  any of  them  from  prepaying  any  of  their
Indebtedness  without  penalty or premium at any time or which  requires  any of
them to maintain  any amount of  Indebtedness  with  respect to any of the Grove
Properties.

          (e) Neither Grove nor any of the Grove  Subsidiaries is a party to any
agreement  relating to the management of any of the Grove  Properties by a party
other than Grove or any


                                       26
<PAGE>


wholly-owned Grove Subsidiary (a "Third Party"), except the agreements described
in Schedule  2.18 to the Grove  Disclosure  Letter (the "Third Party  Management
Agreements").  A true and complete copy of each Third Party Management Agreement
has previously been delivered to ERP.

          (f) None of Grove or any of the Grove  Subsidiaries  is a party to any
agreement  pursuant  to which  Grove or any Grove  Subsidiary  manages  any real

of loss for federal income tax purposes for indebtedness or other liabilities of
Grove or any Grove  Subsidiary.  A true and correct copy of each Tax  Protection
Agreement has been previously delivered to ERP.

Grove  Subsidiaries  included  in  the  Proxy  Statement  and  the  registration

                                   ---------

                      REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF ERP
                      -------------------------------------

     Except as set  forth in the  letter  of even  date  herewith  signed by the
President or an Executive Vice President of EQR, the sole general partner of ERP
("EQR"),  and  delivered  to  Grove  prior to the  execution  hereof  (the  "ERP
Disclosure  Letter"),  ERP  represents  and  warrants  to Grove  and Grove OP as
follows:

     3.1  ORGANIZATION,  STANDING AND POWER OF ERP. ERP is authorized and exists
as an  Illinois  limited  partnership  under  the laws of  Illinois  and has the
requisite  power and authority to carry on its business as now being  conducted.
ERP and its Subsidiaries (the "ERP Subsidiaries") are duly qualified or licensed
to do business and are in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature
of its  business  or the  ownership  or  leasing  of its  properties  makes such
qualification or licensing necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where the
failure to be so qualified or licensed,  individually or in the aggregate, would
not  have a  material  adverse  effect  on  the  business,  properties,  assets,
financial  condition or results of  operations  of ERP and the ERP  Subsidiaries
taken as a whole ("ERP Material Adverse  Effect").  ERP has delivered to Grove a
complete and correct copy of the ERP Agreement,  as amended or  supplemented  to
the date of this Agreement.

     3.2 CAPITAL  STRUCTURE OF ERP.  Schedule 3.2 to the ERP  Disclosure  Letter
sets forth the number of outstanding ERP Units as of June 30, 2000.

     3.3 AUTHORITY; NONCONTRAVENTION; CONSENTS.

          (a) ERP has the  requisite  power  and  authority  to enter  into this
Agreement and to consummate the  transactions  contemplated by this Agreement to
which ERP is a party.  The execution  and delivery of this  Agreement by ERP and
the  consummation by ERP of the  transactions  contemplated by this Agreement to
which ERP is a party have been duly  authorized by all  necessary  action on the
part of ERP.  This  Agreement  has been duly  executed and  delivered by ERP and
constitutes a valid and binding  obligation of ERP,  enforceable  against ERP in
accordance  with  its  terms,  subject  to  applicable  bankruptcy,  insolvency,
moratorium  or other  similar  laws  relating to  creditors'  rights and general
principles of equity.

          (b) Except as set forth in Schedule 3.3 to the ERP Disclosure  Letter,
the execution and delivery of this Agreement by ERP do not, and the consummation
of the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement by ERP and compliance by ERP
with the provisions of this Agreement will not,  conflict with, or result in any
violation  of or  default  (with or  without  notice or lapse of time,  or both)
under, or give rise to a right of  termination,  cancellation or acceleration of
any material  obligation or the loss of a material  benefit under,  or result in
the creation of any Lien upon any of the  properties or assets of ERP or any ERP
Subsidiary   under,  (i)  the  ERP  Agreement  or  the  comparable   charter  or
organizational  documents or partnership  or similar  agreement (as the case may
be) of any other ERP Subsidiary,  each as amended or supplemented to the date of
this  Agreement,  (ii) any  loan or  credit  agreement,  note,  bond,  mortgage,
indenture, reciprocal easement agreement, lease or other agreement,  instrument,
permit, concession, franchise or license to which ERP or any ERP Subsidiary is a
party or their respective properties


                                       30
<PAGE>


or assets  are bound or (iii)  subject  to the  governmental  filings  and other
matters referred to in the following sentence, any Laws applicable to ERP or any
ERP Subsidiary or their respective properties or assets, other than, in the case
of clause (ii) or (iii), any such conflicts,  violations, defaults, rights, loss
or  Liens  that  individually  or in the  aggregate  would  not (x)  have an ERP
Material  Adverse  Effect or (y) prevent the  consummation  of the  transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. No consent, approval, order or authorization of,
or registration, declaration or filing with, any Governmental Entity is required
by or with respect to ERP or any ERP Subsidiary in connection with the execution
and  delivery  of  this  Agreement  or  the  consummation  by  ERP of any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement,  except for (i) the filing with the
SEC of (x) the  Registration  Statement and (y) such reports under Section 13(a)
of the Exchange Act as may be required in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions  contemplated by this Agreement,  (ii) the acceptance for record of
the Company Articles of Merger by the Maryland Department,  (iii) the acceptance
for record of the Partnership  Certificate of Merger by the Delaware  Secretary,
(iv) such  filings as may be  required  in  connection  with the  payment of any
transfer  and gains  taxes  and (iv) such  other  consents,  approvals,  orders,
authorizations,  registrations,  declarations  and  filings  including,  without
limitation,  any consents,  approvals,  orders,  authorizations,  registrations,
declarations and filings required by HUD, MFHA or similar  agencies,  (A) as are
set forth in Schedule 3.3 to the ERP Disclosure  Letter,  (B) as may be required
under federal,  state or local  environmental laws or (C) which, if not obtained
or made,  would not prevent or delay in any material respect the consummation of
any of the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise prevent ERP
from performing its obligations  under this Agreement in any material respect or
have, individually or in the aggregate, an ERP Material Adverse Effect.

          (c) For purposes of determining  compliance  with the Hart-Scott  Act,
ERP confirms  that the conduct of its  business  does not require a filing under
the Hart-Scott Act in connection with the Mergers.

     3.4 SEC DOCUMENTS;  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS;  UNDISCLOSED LIABILITIES. ERP has
filed all required  reports,  schedules,  forms,  statements and other documents
with the SEC  since  January  1,  1995  through  the date  hereof  (the "ERP SEC
Documents").  All of the ERP SEC Documents (other than preliminary material), as
of their respective filing dates or as of the date of the last amendment thereof
(if amended after filing), complied in all material respects with all applicable
requirements  of the  Securities Act and the Exchange Act and, in each case, the
rules  and  regulations  promulgated  thereunder  applicable  to  such  ERP  SEC
Documents.  None of the ERP SEC  Documents at the time of filing  contained  any
untrue  statement  of a  material  fact or omitted  to state any  material  fact
required  to be stated  therein  or  necessary  in order to make the  statements
therein,  in  light  of the  circumstances  under  which  they  were  made,  not
misleading,  except  to  the  extent  such  statements  have  been  modified  or
superseded by later ERP SEC Documents filed on a non-confidential basis prior to
the date of this Agreement. The consolidated financial statements of ERP and the
ERP  Subsidiaries  included in the ERP SEC Documents  complied as to form in all
material  respects with  applicable  accounting  requirements  and the published
rules and  regulations  of the SEC with respect  thereto,  have been prepared in
accordance with GAAP (except, in the case of unaudited statements,  as permitted
by the  applicable  rules and  regulations  of the SEC)  applied on a consistent
basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated  therein or in the
notes  thereto)  and  fairly  presented,   in  accordance  with  the  applicable
requirements of GAAP and the applicable rules and regulations


                                       31
<PAGE>


of the SEC, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of ERP
and the ERP  Subsidiaries,  taken as a whole,  as of the dates  thereof  and the
consolidated  results of  operations  and cash flows for the periods  then ended
(subject,  in the  case  of  unaudited  statements,  to  normal  year-end  audit
adjustments,  any other adjustments  described therein and the fact that certain
information  and notes have been  condensed  or omitted in  accordance  with the
Exchange Act).  Except for  liabilities and obligations set forth in the ERP SEC
Documents or in Schedule 3.4 to the ERP Disclosure  Letter,  neither ERP nor any
ERP  Subsidiary  has any  liabilities  or  obligations  of any  nature  (whether
accrued, absolute,  contingent or otherwise) required by GAAP to be set forth on
a  consolidated  balance  sheet  of ERP  or in  the  notes  thereto  and  which,
individually  or in the aggregate,  would have an ERP Material  Adverse  Effect,
after taking into account any assets acquired or services provided in connection
with the incurrence of such liabilities or obligations.

     3.5 ABSENCE OF CERTAIN  CHANGES OR EVENTS.  Except as  disclosed in the ERP
SEC Documents or in Schedule 3.5 to the ERP Disclosure Letter, since the date of
the most recent audited financial  statements  included in the ERP SEC Documents
(the  "ERP  Financial  Statement  Date"),  ERP  and the  ERP  Subsidiaries  have
conducted  their business only in the ordinary course (taking into account prior
practices,  including the  acquisition of properties and issuance of securities)
and  there  has not  been  (a) any  material  adverse  change  in the  business,
financial  condition or results of  operations  of ERP and the ERP  Subsidiaries
taken as a whole (an "ERP  Material  Adverse  Change"),  nor has there  been any
occurrence  or  circumstance  that with the passage of time would  reasonably be
expected to result in an ERP  Material  Adverse  Change,  (b) except for regular
quarterly  distributions  (in the case of ERP) with customary record and payment
dates,  any  declaration,  setting  aside or  payment of any  dividend  or other
distribution  (whether in cash,  stock or property) with respect to any of ERP's
partnership interests,  (c) any split, combination or reclassification of any of
ERP's partnership interests, (d) any damage, destruction or loss, whether or not
covered by insurance,  that has or would have an ERP Material Adverse Effect, or
(e) any change made prior to the date of this  Agreement in accounting  methods,
principles or practices by ERP or any ERP  Subsidiary  materially  affecting its
assets,  liabilities  or business,  except insofar as may have been disclosed in
the ERP SEC Documents or required by a change in GAAP.

     3.6 LITIGATION. Except as disclosed in the ERP SEC Documents or in Schedule
3.6 to the ERP  Disclosure  Letter,  and other  than  personal  injury and other
routine tort  litigation  arising from the ordinary  course of operations of ERP
and the ERP Subsidiaries (a) which are covered by adequate insurance, or (b) for
which all material  costs and  liabilities  arising  therefrom are  reimbursable
pursuant to common area  maintenance  or similar  agreements,  there is no suit,
action or proceeding pending or, to the Knowledge of ERP,  threatened in writing
against or affecting  ERP or any ERP  Subsidiary  that,  individually  or in the
aggregate,  (i) could  reasonably  be expected to have an ERP  Material  Adverse
Effect,  nor is there any  judgment,  decree,  injunction,  rule or order of any
Governmental Entity or arbitrator  outstanding against ERP or any ERP Subsidiary
having or which could  reasonably  be expected to have any such effect,  or (ii)
could  reasonably  be  expected  to  prevent  the  consummation  of  any  of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.


                                       32

     3.7 PROPERTIES.

          (a) ERP or one of the ERP  Subsidiaries  owns fee simple title to each
of the real  properties  listed in the ERP SEC  Filings as owned by it (the "ERP
Properties"),  except  where the failure to own such title would not have an ERP
Material Adverse Effect.

          (b) The ERP Properties are not subject to any Encumbrances or Property
Restrictions  or located in a flood zone area "V" which,  individually or in the
aggregate,  would cause an ERP Material  Adverse  Effect.

          (c) Valid policies of title  insurance have been issued insuring ERP's
or the applicable ERP Subsidiary's fee simple title to the ERP Properties except
where the failure to obtain such title  insurance would not have an ERP Material
Adverse Effect.

          (d)  ERP  has  no  Knowledge  (i)  that  it has  failed  to  obtain  a
certificate,   permit  or  license  from  any   governmental   authority  having
jurisdiction over any of the ERP Properties where such failure would have an ERP
Material   Adverse  Effect,   or  of  any  pending  threat  of  modification  or
cancellation of any of the same which would have an ERP Material Adverse Effect,
(ii) of any written  notice of any violation of any federal,  state or municipal
law, ordinance,  order, rule, regulation or requirement affecting any of the ERP
Properties  issued  by any  governmental  authorities  which  would  have an ERP
Material  Adverse  Effect,  or (iii) of any structural  defects  relating to ERP
Properties,  ERP  Properties  whose  building  systems are not in working order,
physical  damage to any ERP  Property  for which there is no insurance in effect
covering  the  cost  of  restoration,   any  current   renovation  or  uninsured
restoration,  except such structural  defects,  building  systems not in working
order,  physical  damage,  renovation and  restoration  which, in the aggregate,
would not have an ERP Material Adverse Effect.

          (e) All work to be  performed,  payments  to be made and actions to be
taken by ERP or the ERP  Subsidiaries  prior to the date hereof  pursuant to any
agreement  entered into with a governmental body or authority in connection with
a site approval,  zoning  reclassification or similar action relating to any ERP
Property  (e.g.,  Local  Improvement   District,   Road  Improvement   District,
Environmental  Mitigation),  has been performed,  paid or taken, as the case may
be, except where the failure to do so would,  in the aggregate,  not have an ERP
Material Adverse Effect.

     3.8 ENVIRONMENTAL  MATTERS. None of ERP, any of the ERP Subsidiaries or, to
ERP's  Knowledge,  any other  Person has caused or  permitted  (a) the  unlawful
presence of any Hazardous  Substances on any of the ERP  Properties,  or (b) any
unlawful spills, releases, discharges or disposal of Hazardous Materials to have
occurred or be presently  occurring on or from the ERP Properties as a result of
any  construction on or operation and use of the ERP Properties,  which presence
or occurrence  would,  individually  or in the  aggregate,  have an ERP Material
Adverse Effect;  and in connection with the construction on or operation and use
of the ERP Properties, ERP and the ERP Subsidiaries have not failed to comply in
any  material  respect with all  applicable  Environmental  Laws,  except to the
extent such failure to comply,  individually or in the aggregate, would not have
an ERP Material Adverse Effect.


                                       33
<PAGE>


     3.9 TAXES.

          (a) Each of ERP and the ERP Subsidiaries has filed all tax returns and
reports  required to be filed by it (after giving effect to any filing extension
properly  granted by a  Governmental  Entity having  authority to do so) and has
paid (or ERP has paid on its  behalf)  all  Taxes  shown  or  reflected  on such
returns and  reports as  required  to be paid by it except  where the failure to
file such tax returns or reports and failure to pay such Taxes would not have an
ERP Material  Adverse  Effect.  Since the ERP Financial  Statement Date, EQR has
incurred no liability  for taxes under  Sections  857(b),  860(c) or 4981 of the
Code, including without limitation any tax arising from a prohibited transaction
described  in  Section  857(b)(6)  of the  Code,  and  neither  ERP  nor any ERP
Subsidiary  has  incurred  any  liability  for taxes other than in the  ordinary
course of business.  No deficiencies for any Taxes have been proposed,  asserted
or assessed  pursuant to a "30-day  letter" or notice of deficiency  sent by the
IRS,  or, to the  Knowledge  of ERP,  otherwise  proposed,  asserted or assessed
against ERP or any of the ERP  Subsidiaries.

          (b) EQR (i) for all  taxable  years  commencing  with  1992,  has been
subject to  taxation as a REIT within the meaning of Section 856 of the Code and
has satisfied  all  requirements  to qualify as a REIT for such years,  (ii) has
operated,  and intends to continue to operate, in such a manner as to qualify as
a REIT for the tax year ending  December  31,  2000,  and (iii) has not taken or
omitted to take any action which would  reasonably  be expected to (A) result in
any  rents  paid by  tenants  to the ERP  Properties  to be  excluded  from  the
definition of "rents from real property" under Section 856(d)(2) of the Code, or
(B)  otherwise  result in a  challenge  to EQR's  status as a REIT,  and no such
challenge is pending or, to ERP's  Knowledge,  threatened.  Each ERP  Subsidiary
which is a  partnership,  joint  venture or limited  liability  company has been
treated since its  formation and continues to be treated for federal  income tax
purposes as a partnership,  or ignored as a separate entity, as the case may be,
and not as a corporation  or as an association  taxable as a  corporation.  Each
corporation,  trust or other entity taxable as an  association  which has merged
with and into EQR had been  subject to taxation as a REIT at all times since its
initial election of REIT status and had satisfied all requirements to qualify as
a REIT for such  years,  except to the extent  that a failure  to  satisfy  such
requirements  would not have an ERP Material Adverse Effect.  Each Subsidiary of
EQR which is a corporation  or which is treated as an  association  taxable as a

     4.1  ACQUISITION  PROPOSALS.  Prior to the Company Merger  Effective  Time,
Grove agrees that:

          (a)  neither  it nor any of the  Grove  Subsidiaries  shall  initiate,
solicit or  encourage,  directly or  indirectly,  any inquiries or the making or
implementation  of any proposal or offer  (including,  without  limitation,  any
proposal or offer to any of their respective  shareholders or limited  partners)
with  respect  to  a  merger,   acquisition,   tender  offer,   exchange  offer,
consolidation,  sale of  assets  or  similar  transaction  involving  all or any
significant  portion of the assets or any equity  securities  of Grove or any of
the  Grove  Subsidiaries,  other  than  the  transactions  contemplated  by this
Agreement  (any such  proposal  or offer  being  hereinafter  referred  to as an
"Acquisition  Proposal") or engage in any negotiations concerning or provide any
confidential  information or data to, or have any  discussions  with, any person
relating to an  Acquisition  Proposal,  or  otherwise  facilitate  any effort or
attempt to make or implement an Acquisition Proposal;

          (b) it will use its best  efforts  not to permit any of its  officers,
trust managers,  employees, agents or financial advisors to engage in any of the
activities described in Section 4.1(a);

          (c) it will immediately  cease and cause to be terminated any existing
activities,  discussions or negotiations with any parties  conducted  heretofore
with respect to any of the foregoing and will take the necessary steps to inform
the  individuals or entities  referred to in Section  4.1(b) of the  obligations
undertaken in this Section 4.1; and

          (d) it will notify ERP as promptly as  practicable  if Grove  receives
any such inquiries or proposals, or any requests for such information, or if any
such  negotiations  or discussions  are sought to be initiated or continued with
it;

provided, however, that nothing contained in this Section 4.1 shall prohibit the
Grove Board from (i) furnishing  information to or entering into  discussions or
negotiations  with, any person or entity that makes an  unsolicited  Acquisition
Proposal, if, and only to the extent that (A) the Grove Board determines in good
faith that failure to do so would create a reasonable probability of a breach of
its duties to  shareholders  or Limited  Partners  imposed by law,  (B) prior to
furnishing  such  information  to, or entering into  discussions or negotiations
with, such person or entity,  Grove provides written notice to ERP to the effect
that it is furnishing  information to, or entering into  discussions  with, such
person or entity,  and (C) subject to any  confidentiality  agreement  with such
person or entity  (which  Grove  determined  in good  faith was  required  to be
executed in order for the Grove Board to comply with its duties to  shareholders
or Limited


                                       36

Partners  imposed by law),  Grove  keeps ERP  informed of the status of any such
discussions or negotiations;  and (ii) to the extent applicable,  complying with
Rule 14e-2 or Rule 14d-9  promulgated  under the  Exchange Act with regard to an
Acquisition  Proposal.  Nothing in this  Section  4.1 shall (x) permit  Grove to
terminate this Agreement (except as specifically  provided in Article 7 hereof),
(y)  permit  Grove to enter into an  agreement  with  respect to an  Acquisition
Proposal during the term of this Agreement (it being agreed that during the term
of this Agreement,  Grove shall not enter into an agreement with any Person that
provides for, or in any way facilitates,  an Acquisition  Proposal (other than a
confidentiality  agreement in customary form executed as provided above)) or (z)
affect any other  obligation of Grove under this Agreement;  provided,  however,
that the Grove Board may approve and recommend a Superior  Acquisition  Proposal
and, in connection therewith,  withdraw or modify its approval or recommendation
of  this  Agreement  and the  Mergers.  As used  herein,  "Superior  Acquisition
Proposal" means a bona fide  Acquisition  Proposal made by a third party which a
majority of the members of the Grove Board  determines  in good faith to be more
favorable to Grove's shareholders and Limited Partners from a financial point of
view than the Mergers and which the Grove Board determines is reasonably capable
of being consummated.

required to be filed with federal,  state, local and other authorities,  subject

form and  substance  satisfactory  to each of ERP and  Grove.  A portion  of the
Registration Statement shall also constitute a prospectus of ERP with respect to
the  ERP  Units  to  be  offered   pursuant  to  the  Partnership   Merger  (the

Act  and the  rules  and  regulations  promulgated  thereunder  as  promptly  as

reasonable  best  efforts to cause the  Prospectus  to be mailed to the  Limited
Partners, as promptly as practicable after the SEC has declared the Registration
Statement  effective.  Grove will use its  reasonable  best efforts to cause the
Proxy Statement to be mailed to Grove's shareholders, as promptly as practicable

notify the other promptly of the receipt of any comments from the SEC and of any
request by the SEC for amendments or supplements to the  Registration  Statement
or the Proxy  Statement or for additional  information and will supply the other
with copies of all  correspondence  (and written summaries or transcripts of any
oral  communication)  between such party or any of its  representatives  and the
SEC,  with respect to the  Registration  Statement or the Proxy  Statement.  The
respective parties will cause the Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement
to comply in all material  respects  with all  applicable  requirements  of law.
Whenever  any event  occurs which is required to be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to the Registration  Statement or the Proxy Statement,  ERP or Grove,
as the case may be,  shall  promptly  inform the other of such  occurrences  and
cooperate in filing with the SEC and/or mailing to the  shareholders of Grove or
the Limited  Partners such  amendment or  supplement  to the Proxy  Statement or
Prospectus,  as the case may be. ERP also shall take any action  required  to be
taken under any  applicable  state  securities  or "blue sky" laws in connection
with the issuance of ERP Units pursuant to the Partnership Merger, and Grove and
Grove OP shall furnish all information concerning Grove and the holders of Grove
Shares and rights to acquire Grove Shares,  or Grove OP and the Limited Partners
and the  rights  to  acquire  Grove LP  Units,  as the case may be and as may be
reasonably requested in connection with any such action.

          (b) Grove  will,  as soon as  practicable  following  the date of this

the  Limited   Partners   approval  of  this  Agreement  and  the   transactions
contemplated hereby; provided, that prior to the Grove OP Partners Meeting, such

Acquisition  Proposal,  the  Grove  Board  determines  in good  faith  that such
withdrawal, modification or amendment is appropriate.

          (e) If on the  date for the  Grove  Shareholders  Meeting  established

agreements  or  arrangements  which  would in any way  alter  the  Section  2.15

program, arrangement or agreement of Grove, or any term of this Agreement, shall
require  ERP to  continue  the  employment  of any  employee  of Grove after the

2.15 Employee and each other  terminated  employee  shall execute and deliver to
Grove an agreement  and release in the  applicable  form as attached to Schedule
2.15 to the Grove  Disclosure  Letter (a " Release").  The Section 2.15 Payments

Time for no consideration.

          (ii) From and after the date hereof, Grove, through the Grove Board or
otherwise,  will not modify any Plan or authorize, and Grove will not grant, any
Grove  Options,  Restricted  Share Grants or any other equity or cash  incentive
grants or awards of any kind, nature or description.

          (d)  WITHHOLDING.  Grove shall  require each  employee who exercises a
Grove Option,  receives  Grove Shares  pursuant to any existing  commitment,  or
otherwise  receives  any  payment  from  Grove as a result  of the  transactions
contemplated  by this  Agreement,  to pay to Grove in cash or  Grove  Shares  an
amount  sufficient  to satisfy in full  Grove's  obligation  to  withhold  Taxes
incurred by reason of such exercise, issuance or receipt.

     5.8 INDEMNIFICATION.

          (a) From and  after  the  Company  Merger  Effective  Time,  ERP shall
provide  exculpation and  indemnification for each person who is now or has been

Effective Time, an officer or trust


                                       46
<PAGE>


manager of Grove or any Grove  Subsidiary (the  "Indemnified  Parties") which is
the same as the  exculpation  and  indemnification  provided to the  Indemnified
Parties  by Grove  (including  advancement  of  expenses,  if so  provided,  and
provided that such coverage  provided by Grove shall have at least $5,000,000 of
current  trust  manager  and  officer  insurance  with  no more  than a  $75,000
deductible)  immediately  prior  to the  Company  Merger  Effective  Time in its
Declaration of Trust,  Bylaws, or any Employee Plan as in effect at the close of
business on the date hereof; PROVIDED, that such exculpation and indemnification
covers  actions on or prior to the Company  Merger  Effective  Time,  including,
without limitation,  all transactions  contemplated by this Agreement. ERP shall
use  commercially  reasonable  efforts to obtain and, if  obtained,  maintain in
effect from the Company Merger  Effective  Time and  continuing  until the sixth
anniversary  thereof "run-off" trust managers and officers  liability  insurance
with a coverage  amount and other  terms and  conditions  comparable  to Grove's
current trust  managers and officers  liability  insurance  policy  covering the
trust managers and officers of Grove with respect to their service as such prior
to the Company Merger Effective Time, PROVIDED,  HOWEVER, that in no event shall
ERP be  required  pay a premium in excess of  $300,000  for such  coverage  (the
"Run-Off  Policy").  ERP shall  provide Grove with a true and complete copy of a
binder with respect to the Run-Off  Policy at least 10 days prior to the Company
Merger  Effective  Time, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to provide to
Grove a true and  complete  copy of the Run-Off  Policy as proposed to be issued
prior to the Company Merger Effective Time. The premium for such policy shall be
paid in full at the Company Merger Effective Time.

          (b) The  provisions  of this  Section  5.8 are  intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be  enforceable  by, each  Indemnified  Party,  his or her
heirs  and his or her  personal  representatives  and  shall be  binding  on all
successors  and  assigns  of ERP and  Grove.  ERP  agrees  to pay all  costs and
expenses  (including  fees and expenses of counsel)  that may be incurred by any
Indemnified Party or his or her heirs or his or her personal  representatives in
successfully  enforcing  the  indemnity or other  obligations  of ERP under this
Section 5.8. The provisions of this Section 5.8 shall survive the Company Merger
and are in addition  to any other  rights to which an  Indemnified  Party may be
entitled.

          (c) In the  event  that  ERP or any of its  respective  successors  or
assigns (i)  consolidates  with or merges into any other person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving company or entity of such consolidation or merger or
(ii)  transfers all or  substantially  all of its  properties  and assets to any
person,  then,  and in each such case the  successors and assigns of such entity
shall assume the  obligations  set forth in this Section 5.8, which  obligations
are  expressly  intended  to be for the  irrevocable  benefit  of,  and shall be
enforceable by, each trustee and officer covered hereby.

     5.9 DECLARATION OF DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS.  From and after the date of
this Agreement, Grove or Grove OP shall not make any dividend or distribution to
its  shareholders or Limited  Partners without the prior written consent of ERP,
except for the  authorization  and payment of  dividends or  distributions  with
respect  to the  Grove  Common  Shares  and  Grove LP Units  of (i)  subject  to
reduction as provided  below,  an amount per  share/unit for each full quarterly
dividend not to exceed $0.18 per  share/unit  (each a "Quarterly  Dividend") and
(ii) subject to reduction as provided below, a pro-rated  Quarterly Dividend for
the period following the end of the calendar quarter  immediately  preceding the
payment  date  for the  latest  Quarterly  Dividend  until  the  Company  Merger
Effective Time, with such dividend to be pro-rated on the


                                       47
<PAGE>


basis of the  number of days in such  period  divided  by  ninety-two  (92) (the
"Short  Dividend"),  provided however,  that at least ten (10) days prior to the
setting  of any  record  date  or  declaring  of any  dividend  or  distribution
permitted pursuant to this Section 5.9, Grove shall submit to ERP a then current
estimate  of the fees and  expenses  of the  transactions  contemplated  by this
Agreement,  in reasonable  detail and in such categories so as to conform to the
detail and categories set forth in Schedule 2.30 to the Grove Disclosure Letter,
which  estimate shall be certified by the Chief  Financial  Officer of Grove and
subject to review by ERP. In conducting its review of such  estimate,  ERP shall
have the right to verify and  examine  all  supporting  documentation  which was
utilized by Grove in determining such estimate,  including,  without limitation,
the  right to  contact  vendors  of Grove for the  purpose  of  confirming  such
estimates.  To the extent that any  estimated  category of fees or expenses  set
forth in such estimate exceeds the  corresponding  estimate of such category set
forth on Schedule 2.30 of the Grove Disclosure  Letter, the total of such excess
amounts (the  "Exceeded  Cost  Amount")  shall be divided by the total number of
Grove Common Shares and Grove LP Units outstanding as of the record date for the
next  distribution  permitted to be made  pursuant to this Section 5.9 (the "Per
Share  Exceeded Cost  Amount"),  and the maximum  dividend or  distribution  per
share/unit  payable  pursuant to this Section 5.9 shall be $0.18 per  share/unit
less the Per Share  Exceeded  Cost Amount (or, in the case of a Short  Dividend,
the maximum amount of such Short  Dividend,  as calculated  above,  less the Per
Share Exceeded Cost Amount).  In the event that the Exceeded Cost Amount exceeds
the total  aggregate  distribution to be made pursuant to this Section 5.9, such
amount  shall be carried  forward  and added to the  Exceeded  Cost  Amount with
respect to the next  distribution  permitted  under this Section 5.9. The record
and  payment  dates for each  Quarterly  Dividend  shall be the same date as the
record and payment dates for the  corresponding  quarterly  dividend for the EQR
Common Shares,  as provided to Grove by written notice not less than twenty (20)
days prior to the record date for such quarterly EQR dividend. In the event that
a dividend with respect to Grove Common Shares or a distribution with respect to
Grove LP Units  permitted by this Section 5.9 has (i) a record date prior to the
Company Merger Effective Time or Partnership  Merger Effective Time, as the case
may be, and (ii) has not been paid as of such Company  Merger  Effective Time or
Partnership  Merger  Effective  Time,  as the case may be, the  holders of Grove
Common   Shares  or  Limited   Partners   shall  be  entitled  to  receive  such
distribution.

     5.10  NOTICES.  Each party hereto  shall  provide such notice to its equity
holders of the Mergers and other transactions contemplated hereby as is required
under  applicable law.

     5.11  RESIGNATIONS.  On the Closing Date, if requested by ERP,  Grove shall
request that the trust managers, directors and officers of Grove and each of the
Grove Subsidiaries to submit their  resignations from such positions,  effective
as of the Company Merger Effective Time or Partnership Merger Effective Time, as
requested.

     5.12 THIRD PARTY MANAGEMENT  AGREEMENTS AND OUTSIDE MANAGEMENT  AGREEMENTS.
Grove will not, and will not permit any Grove Subsidiary to, (i) amend the Third
Party Management  Agreements and Outside Management  Agreements,  (ii) renew the
Third Party Management  Agreements except on terms which permit its cancellation
by Grove or the  applicable  Grove  Subsidiary  on thirty  days  notice  without
charge, penalty or other cost for such cancellation,  or (iii) renew any Outside
Management Agreement.

consummated  prior to the  effectiveness  of the Mergers but  subsequent  to the

specify  the  "Restoration  Amount"  (as  such  term is  defined  under  the ERP

                        TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER
                        ---------------------------------

     7.1 TERMINATION.  This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
acceptance of the Partnership  Certificate of Merger by the Delaware  Secretary,
whether before or after the Grove Approvals are obtained:

          (a) by mutual  written  consent  duly  authorized  by both the general
partner of ERP and the Grove Board;

          (b) by ERP, upon a breach of any representation,  warranty,  covenant,
obligation  or  agreement  on the part of  Grove  or Grove OP set  forth in this
Agreement,  in either case such that the  conditions set forth in Section 6.2(a)
or Section 6.2(b),  as the case may be, would be incapable of being satisfied by
March 31, 2001 (or as otherwise extended);

          (c) by Grove, upon a breach of any representation,  warranty, covenant
obligation  or  agreement  on the part of ERP set  forth in this  Agreement,  in
either  case such that the  conditions  set forth in  Section  6.3(a) or Section
6.3(b),  as the case may be, would be incapable of being  satisfied by March 31,
2001 (or as otherwise extended);

          (d) by either ERP or Grove, if any judgment, injunction, order, decree
or action by any  Governmental  Entity of  competent  authority  preventing  the
consummation  of either  the  Partnership  Merger or Company  Merger  shall have
become final and nonappealable;

          (e) by  either  ERP or  Grove,  if the  Mergers  shall  not have  been
consummated  before March 31, 2001;  provided,  that in the case of  termination
pursuant to this Section 7.1(e),  the terminating  party shall not have breached
in any material respect its obligations  under this Agreement in any manner that
shall have proximately  contributed to the occurrence of the failure referred to
in this Section and,  provided  further,  that (i) if the Mergers shall not have
been consummated  solely due to the failure to receive any required lender,  HUD
or MHFA  consents  (as listed on Schedule 2.5 of the Grove  Disclosure  Letter),
March 31,  2001 shall be  automatically  extended  to May 31,  2001 and (ii) any
termination of this Agreement  resulting solely by reason of the failure to meet
the condition  set forth in (i) above shall be pursuant to this Section  7.1(e);

          (f) by  either  ERP or  Grove  if,  upon a vote at a duly  held  Grove
Shareholders Meeting or any adjournment thereof, the Grove Shareholder Approvals

          (g) by either ERP or Grove if the Grove  Partner  Approvals  shall not
have been obtained as contemplated by Section 5.1;


                                       53
<PAGE>


          (h) by Grove, if prior to the Grove Shareholders  Meeting or the Grove
OP  Partners  Meeting,  the Grove  Board shall have  withdrawn  or modified  its
approval or  recommendation of the Mergers or this Agreement in connection with,
or approved or recommended,  a Superior Acquisition Proposal;  and

          (i) by ERP if (i) prior to the Grove Shareholders Meeting or the Grove
OP Partners  Meeting,  the Grove Board shall have  withdrawn  or modified in any
manner  adverse to ERP its  approval  or  recommendation  of the Mergers or this
Agreement  in  connection  with,  or  approved  or  recommended,   any  Superior
Acquisition  Proposal,  or (ii)  Grove  shall  have  entered  into a  definitive
agreement  with  respect  to any  Acquisition  Proposal.

     7.2 CERTAIN FEES AND EXPENSES.

          (a) If this  Agreement  shall be  terminated  (i)  pursuant to Section
7.1(h) or 7.1(i),  then Grove will pay ERP  (provided  Grove was not entitled to
terminate  this  Agreement  pursuant  to  Section  7.1(c)  at the  time  of such
termination)  a fee  equal  to the  Break-Up  Fee (as  defined  below),  or (ii)
pursuant to Section 7.1(b),  7.1(f) or 7.1(g), then Grove will pay ERP (provided
Grove was not entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(c) at
the time of such  termination)  an amount  equal to the  Expense Fee (as defined
below).  If this  Agreement  shall be  terminated  by ERP or Grove  pursuant  to
Section 7.1(e) and Grove has not, at the time of such termination,  (i) obtained
and  delivered  to ERP the Closing  Agreement  in  satisfaction  of both Section
6.2(j)  and  Section  6.3(g)  or (ii)  caused to be  delivered  to ERP the legal
opinion referenced in Section 6.2(e), then Grove will pay ERP an amount equal to
the  Expense  Fee. If this  Agreement  shall be  terminated  pursuant to Section
7.1(c), then ERP will pay Grove (provided ERP was not entitled to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(b) at the time of such termination), an amount
equal to the Expense  Fee. If the Merger is not  consummated  (other than due to
the termination of this Agreement  pursuant to Section 7.1(a),  7.1(c) or 7.1(e)
(excluding  any  termination  pursuant to Section  7.1(e) with  respect to which
Grove  is  obligated  to pay  ERP  the  Expense  Fee)),  and at the  time of the
termination  of this  Agreement an  Acquisition  Proposal  has been  received by
Grove,  and either prior to the  termination  of this Agreement or within twelve
(12) months  thereafter  Grove or any Grove  Subsidiary  enters into any written
Acquisition  Proposal  which is  subsequently  consummated  (whether or not such
Acquisition Proposal is the same Acquisition Proposal which had been received at
the  time of the  termination  of this  Agreement),  then  Grove  shall  pay the
Break-Up Fee to ERP, PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that for purposes of this sentence only,
(x)  "Acquisition  Proposal"  shall not include a sale of Grove  Properties to a
single purchaser or related group of purchasers for a Purchase Price (as defined
below)  equal to or in excess of $158.6  million (an "Exempt  Sale") and (y) ERP
shall have a right of first  offer for a period of thirty  days (but no right of
first refusal) with respect to the Grove Properties  subject to the Exempt Sale.
EQR shall  communicate  its offer with respect to a proposed  Exempt Sale within
thirty  days of its  receipt of notice  that (i) Grove  desires to sell  certain
Grove Properties which sale, if consummated, would constitute an Exempt Sale (an
"Offer to  Sell")  or (ii)  Grove has  received  a bona fide  offer to  purchase
certain Grove Properties which sale, if consummated,  would constitute an Exempt
Sale (an "Offer to Purchase").  Grove shall provide notice to ERP of an Offer to
Sell or Offer to Purchase as soon as practicable  (but in all cases within three
(3) days) following its decision to undertake an Offer to Sell or its receipt of
an Offer to Purchase,  as the case may be. In the case of an Offer to Sell,  (i)
if Grove does not accept ERP's offer with respect to such proposed


                                       54
<PAGE>


Exempt Sale,  Grove shall be prohibited from  consummating  such proposed Exempt
Sale with any other  Person or Persons at a price or on other  terms equal to or
less than that  offered  by ERP and (ii) in the event ERP does not make an offer
with  respect to such  proposed  Exempt Sale  within the time period  prescribed
herein,  Grove shall be free to consummate  such  proposed  Exempt Sale with any
Person or Persons. In the case of an Offer to Purchase,  (i) if ERP's offer with
respect to such proposed  Exempt Sale shall (x) equal or exceed the value of the
Offer  to  Purchase  and (y)  contain  substantially  equivalent  terms in other
respects, Grove shall be bound to consummate the Exempt Sale with ERP as soon as
practicable  in  accordance  with such  offer,  (ii) EQR shall have the right to
consummate such proposed Exempt Sale with Grove on substantially  the same terms
as the Offer to Purchase and (iii) in the event that ERP makes an offer which is
declined  by Grove,  Grove must  consummate  the Exempt  Sale with the Person or
Persons  making the Offer to  Purchase,  on better  terms than the  declined ERP
offer,  within six months of Grove's refusal of such ERP offer.  For purposes of
this Section 7.2 "Purchase  Price" shall include the value of the  consideration
paid for the Grove  Properties,  including  the value of any direct or  indirect
debt  assumed,  retired or  released in  connection  with the Exempt  Sale.  Any
amounts to be paid by the purchaser contingent upon future events, if any, shall
be estimated in a manner to be mutually agreed upon by the parties  hereto.  All
communications  with  respect  to an Exempt  Sale  shall be in  accordance  with
Section 8.2.

          (b)  The  payment  of the  Break-Up  Fee  shall  be  compensation  and
liquidated  damages  for the loss  suffered by ERP as a result of the failure of
the Mergers to be consummated and to avoid the difficulty of determining damages
under the  circumstances and neither party shall have any other liability to the
other after the payment of the  Break-Up  Fee. The Break-Up Fee shall be paid by
Grove to ERP,  or the  Expense Fee shall be paid by Grove to ERP or ERP to Grove
(as applicable),  in immediately  available funds within fifteen (15) days after
the  date of the  event  giving  rise to the  obligation  to make  such  payment
occurred.

          (c) As used in this Agreement, "Break-Up Fee" shall be an amount equal
to the lesser of (i)  $8,500,000  plus the Expense Fee (the "Base  Amount")  and
(ii) the sum of (A) the maximum  amount that can be paid to ERP without  causing
it to fail to meet the  requirements  of Sections  856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code
determined as if the payment of such amount did not constitute  income described
in  Sections  856(c)(2)(A)-(H)  and  856(c)(3)(A)-(I)  of the Code  ("Qualifying
Income"), as determined by independent  accountants to ERP, and (B) in the event
ERP receives a letter from  outside  counsel (the  "Break-Up  Fee Tax  Opinion")
indicating  that ERP has  received  a ruling  from the IRS  holding  that  ERP's
receipt of the Base Amount would either constitute Qualifying Income or would be
excluded from gross income  within the meaning of Sections  856(c)(2) and (3) of
the Code (the "REIT  Requirements")  or that the receipt by ERP of the excess of
the Base Amount over the amount  payable in clause (A)  following the receipt of
and pursuant to such ruling would not be deemed  constructively  received  prior
thereto,  the Base Amount less the amount payable under clause (A) above. In the
event that ERP determines,  in its absolute and sole discretion,  that it is not
able to receive the full Base  Amount,  Grove  shall place the unpaid  amount in
escrow and shall not release  any portion  thereof to ERP unless and until Grove
receives  any one or  combination  of the  following:  (i) a letter  from  ERP's
independent  accountants  indicating the maximum amount that can be paid at that
time to ERP without causing ERP to fail to meet the REIT  Requirements or (ii) a
Break-Up  Fee Tax  Opinion,  in which event Grove shall pay to ERP the lesser of
the unpaid Base Amount or the maximum amount stated in the letter referred to in
(i) above. Grove's obligation to pay any unpaid portion


                                       55
<PAGE>


of the Break-Up Fee shall terminate three years from the date of this Agreement.
The "Expense Fee" payable to ERP or Grove, as the case may be (the "Recipient"),
shall be an amount equal to the least of (i)  $2,000,000,  (ii) the  Recipient's
documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and
the  transactions  contemplated  hereby  (including,   without  limitation,  all
attorneys',  accountants'  and investment  bankers' fees and expenses) and (iii)
the sum of (A) the  maximum  amount  that can be paid to the  Recipient  without
causing it to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the
Code  determined as if the payment of such amount did not constitute  Qualifying
Income,  as determined by independent  accountants to the Recipient,  and (B) in
the event the Recipient  receives a Break-Up Fee Tax Opinion indicating that the
Recipient  has  received  a ruling  from the IRS  holding  that the  Recipient's
receipt of the Expense Fee would either constitute Qualifying Income or would be
excluded from gross income within the meaning of the REIT  Requirements  or that
receipt  by the  Recipient  of the  excess of the  Expense  Fee over the  amount
payable  under clause (A)  following  the receipt of and pursuant to such ruling
would not be deemed constructively  received prior thereto, the Expense Fee less
the amount  payable  under clause (A) above.  In the event that the Recipient is
not able to receive the full  Expense  Fee,  the Payor (as defined  below) shall
place the unpaid  amount in escrow and shall not release any portion  thereof to
the Recipient  unless and until the Payor receives any one or combination of the
following:  (i) a letter from the Recipient's independent accountants indicating
the  maximum  amount  that  can be paid at that  time to the  Recipient  without
causing the Recipient to fail to meet the REIT  Requirements  or (ii) a Break-Up
Fee Tax Opinion,  in which event the Payor shall pay to the Recipient the lesser
of the unpaid Expense Fee or the maximum amount stated in the letter referred to
in (i) above.  The obligation of ERP or Grove, as applicable  ("Payor"),  to pay
any unpaid portion of the Expense Fee shall  terminate three years from the date
of this Agreement.

     7.3 EFFECT OF TERMINATION. In the event of termination of this Agreement by
either Grove or ERP as provided in Section 7.1, this Agreement  shall  forthwith
become void and have no effect,  without any liability or obligation on the part
of ERP, Grove or Grove OP, other than the last sentence of Section 5.2,  Section
7.2,  this  Section 7.3 and Article 8;  provided  that (a) if this  Agreement is
terminated by ERP pursuant to Section 7.1(b), Grove shall not be entitled to any
of the benefits of Section 7.2, or (b) if this  Agreement is terminated by Grove
pursuant to Section 7.1(c),  ERP shall not be entitled to any of the benefits of
Section  7.2.

     7.4  AMENDMENT.  This Agreement may be amended by the parties in writing by
action of the  general  partner of ERP and the Grove Board at any time before or
after the Grove  Approvals  are  obtained and prior to the filing of the Company
Articles of Merger or  Partnership  Certificate  of Merger;  provided,  however,
that, after the Grove Approvals are obtained, no such amendment, modification or
supplement shall be made which changes the amount or type of consideration to be
received  by the  shareholders  of Grove or partners of Grove OP or which by law
requires the further  approval of the shareholders of Grove or partners of Grove
OP without obtaining such further approval.

     7.5  EXTENSION;  WAIVER.  At any time prior to the  earlier of the  Company
Merger Effective Time or Partnership  Merger Effective Time, the parties may (a)
extend the time for the  performance of any of the  obligations or other acts of
the  other  party,  (b)  waive  any  inaccuracies  in  the  representations  and
warranties  of the other party  contained  in this  Agreement or in any document
delivered  pursuant to this  Agreement  or (c) subject to the proviso of Section
7.4,


                                       56
<PAGE>


waive  compliance  with any of the  agreements  or conditions of the other party
contained in this  Agreement.  Any  agreement on the part of a party to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing
signed on behalf of such party.  The failure of any party to this  Agreement  to
assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise  shall not constitute
a waiver of those rights.

     8.6 GOVERNING  LAW. THIS  AGREEMENT  SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN

or  unenforceable  in  any  jurisdiction  shall,  as to  that  jurisdiction,  be

rendering  invalid or  unenforceable  the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement or affecting  the  validity or  enforceability  of any of the terms or
provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of this
Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted
to be only so broad as is enforceable.
