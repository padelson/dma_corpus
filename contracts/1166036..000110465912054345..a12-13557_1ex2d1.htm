 **ARTICLE I 
THE MERGER**

 



 

SECTION 1.1. _The Merger. _Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth herein, and in accordance with the Act, at the Effective Time, the
Company shall be merged with and into Merger Subsidiary, and the separate
existence of the Company shall thereupon cease. Merger Subsidiary shall be the
surviving entity (the " **Surviving Entity** ") in the Merger and shall
continue its existence under the laws of the State of Delaware. All references
herein to the Company in respect of actions or omissions to occur after the
Effective Time shall be deemed to refer to the Surviving Entity.

 



 

SECTION 1.2. _Effective Time. _The Merger shall be effected through the filing
of a certificate of merger (the " **Certificate of Merger** "), in
substantially the form of _Exhibit A_ hereto, with the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware as provided in the Act. The Merger shall be effective
upon the later of (i) the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or (ii) at such later time as may
be specified in the Certificate of Merger in accordance with applicable law
(the " **Effective Time** ").

 



 

SECTION 1.3. _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in the Act.

 



 

SECTION 1.4. _Organizational Documents_. As of the Effective Time, the limited
liability company agreement of the Surviving Entity (the " **Surviving Entity
LLC Agreement** ") shall be amended and restated so that it is in the form
agreed to by the parties on or prior to the date hereof.

 



 

SECTION 1.5. _Conversion_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Subsidiary, the Company or
the Holders:

 



 

(a) Each Holders Membership Interest outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted automatically into and shall represent the
right to receive (i) cash in an amount equal to the product of (x) the Initial
Merger Consideration and (y) such Holders Sharing Ratio and (ii) the portion
of any cash amounts to be distributed in respect of such Membership Interest
pursuant to Sections 2.4(a)(i) or 2.4(b)(i), if any, or the Escrow Agreement
as specified in Section 14.1, and, as of the Effective Time, all such
Membership Interests shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and retired and cease to exist; and

 



      
 

 



 

(b) All membership interests of the Merger Subsidiary outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become the membership
interests in the Surviving Entity shown as owned by the Parent in the
Surviving Entity LLC Agreement (which will constitute all outstanding
membership interests in the Surviving Entity as of the Effective Time).

 



 

 **ARTICLE II 
MERGER CONSIDERATION**

 



 

SECTION 2.1. _Merger Consideration_.

 



 

(a) At the Closing, the Parent shall pay to the Holders an aggregate amount in
cash equal to $512,000,000 (" **Base Consideration** "), as such amount is
increased or decreased (as the case may be) pursuant to Section 2.2(b), _plus_
the amount of Estimated Closing Cash and _minus_ the amount of Closing
Indebtedness (the " **Initial Merger Consideration** ").

 



 

(b) The final merger consideration to be paid by the Parent shall be the
Initial Merger Consideration, as such amount is increased or decreased (as the
case may be) to reflect the payment of the Final Adjustment Amount pursuant to
Section 2.4 (the " **Merger Consideration** ").

 



 

SECTION 2.2. _Initial Adjustment_.

 



 

(a) No later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall deliver to the Parent a certificate of the Manager of the
Company (or an authorized officer whose responsibilities relate to the
preparation of financial statements of the Company) (the " **Initial Closing
Certificate** ") setting forth (i) an estimated balance sheet of the Company
as of the Closing Calculation Date, prepared in accordance with GAAP applied
on a basis consistent with past practice and the principles used in the
preparation of the Latest Balance Sheet, (ii) an estimated calculation of Net
Working Capital prepared in accordance with the definition of Net Working
Capital (the " **Estimated Working Capital** "), (iii) the estimated amount of
Closing Cash (the " **Estimated Closing Cash** ") and (iv) the estimated
amount of Closing Indebtedness. In the event that Parent disagrees with any
amounts set forth in the Initial Closing Certificate, the parties shall work
together in good faith to resolve any such disputes, and any changes to the
amounts set forth in the Initial Closing Certificate agreed upon in writing by
the Company and the Parent shall be substituted for the amounts set forth in
the Initial Closing Certificate. If such dispute is not resolved prior to
Closing, then the amounts set forth in the Initial Closing Certificate shall
be binding for purposes of the Closing.

 



 

(b) If the Estimated Working Capital is:

 



 

(i) greater than the Target Working Capital, then an amount equal to (x) the
Estimated Working Capital _minus_ (y) the Target Working Capital will be added
to the Base Consideration; and

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) less than the Target Working Capital, then an amount equal to (x) the
Target Working Capital _minus_ (y) the Estimated Working Capital will be
subtracted from the Base Consideration.

 



 

SECTION 2.3. _Final Balance Sheet and Final Working Capital_. No later than 60
days after the Closing Date, the Parent shall deliver to the Holder
Representative a certificate of the chief financial officer of Parent (the "
**Final CFO Certificate** ") setting forth (i) a balance sheet of the Company
as of the Closing Calculation Date (the " **Final Balance Sheet** "), prepared
in accordance with GAAP applied on a basis consistent with past practice and
the principles used in the preparation of the Latest Balance Sheet, (ii) the
proposed calculation of Final Working Capital prepared in accordance with the
definition of Net Working Capital and (iii) the proposed calculation of Final
Closing Cash prepared in accordance with the definition of Closing Cash. From
and after the Closing Date, the Parent and the Company shall give the Holder
Representative access during normal business hours to the books and records,
the accounting and other appropriate personnel and the independent accountants
of the Company in order to enable the Holder Representative to obtain
information relating to the preparation or review of the Final Balance Sheet
or the calculation of Final Working Capital or Final Closing Cash.

 



 

SECTION 2.4. _Post-Closing Adjustment_. No later than five days after a
binding determination of Final Working Capital and Final Closing Cash has been
made in accordance with Section 2.5:

 



 

(a) The parties shall make the applicable payment specified below with respect
to Net Working Capital:

 



 

(i) If Final Working Capital is greater than Estimated Working Capital, the
Parent shall make a payment equal to such excess in immediately available
funds to such account or accounts as is designated in writing by the Holder
Representative.

 



 

(ii) If Estimated Working Capital is greater than Final Working Capital, each
Holder shall make a payment in an amount equal to (x) such excess _multiplied
by_ (y) such Holders Sharing Ratio, in immediately available funds to such
account or accounts as is designated in writing by the Parent.

 



 

(b) The parties shall make the applicable payment specified below with respect
to Closing Cash:

 



 

(i) If Final Closing Cash is greater than Estimated Closing Cash, the Parent
shall make a payment equal to such excess in immediately available funds to
such account or accounts as is designated in writing by the Holder
Representative.

 



 

(ii) If Estimated Closing Cash is greater than Final Closing Cash, each Holder
shall make a payment in an amount equal to (x) such excess _multiplied by_ (y)
such Holders Sharing Ratio, in immediately available funds to such account or
accounts as is designated in writing by the Parent.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) In satisfying the payments as described above in paragraphs (a) and (b)
above, all amounts due and owing shall be netted so that only one aggregate
payment is made pursuant to this Section 2.4, which is referred to herein as
the " **Final Adjustment Amount**." If Final Working Capital equals Estimated
Working Capital and Final Closing Cash equals Estimated Closing Cash, no Final
Adjustment Amount will be paid.

 



 

SECTION 2.5. _Dispute Resolution_.

 



 

(a) The Holder Representative shall be entitled to dispute the calculation of
the Final Working Capital or Final Closing Cash set forth in the Final CFO
Certificate if it delivers a written notice (an " **Objection Notice** ") to
the Parent within 45 days after receipt of the Final Balance Sheet and Final
CFO Certificate in which it objects to the calculation by the Parent of the
Final Working Capital or Final Closing Cash (the date upon which the Holder
Representative delivers an Objection Notice to the Parent being hereinafter
referred to as the " **Objection Date** "). The Objection Notice shall contain
any changes that the Holder Representative proposes to be made to the Final
CFO Certificate, to the extent such changes are reasonably determinable based
on information to which the Holder Representative has been granted actual
access to pursuant to Section 2.3.

 



 

(b) If the Holder Representative delivers an Objection Notice to the Parent
within the time period specified in paragraph (a) above, the Parent and the
Holder Representative shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the amount of
the Final Adjustment Amount during the period commencing on the Objection Date
and ending 30 days thereafter (the " **Negotiation Period** ").

 



 

(c) If the Parent and the Holder Representative agree in writing prior to the
expiration of the Negotiation Period on the amount of the Final Adjustment
Amount (whether such amount is the same as or different from the amount
calculated based upon the Final CFO Certificate), the payment provided for in
Section 2.4 shall be based upon the agreed upon amount.

 



 

(d) If the Parent and the Holder Representative do not agree in writing prior
to the expiration of the Negotiation Period on the amount of the Final
Adjustment Amount, each party shall submit a statement containing its
calculation of the items in dispute (each, an " **Arbiter Objection
Statement** "), which shall include only those items set forth in the
Objection Notice that remain in dispute following the expiration of the
Negotiation Period and any such other items that the parties mutually agree in
writing to include therein, to Ernst and Young Global Limited, or, if such firm
declines to serve as accounting arbiter or the parties agree in writing not to
engage such firm, such other firm of independent public accountants mutually
agreed upon by the Parent and the Holder Representative (in either case, the "
**Final Arbiter** "), which firm shall make a final and binding determination
as to all matters in dispute relating to the calculation of the amount of the
Final Adjustment Amount as promptly as practicable after its appointment. In
determining the proper amount of the Final Adjustment, the Final Arbiter shall
be bound by the terms of this Section 2.5(d) and may not increase the amount
of any item in dispute above the highest amount set forth in the Arbiter
Objection Statements nor below the lowest amount set forth in the Arbiter
Objection Statements. The Final Arbiter shall send its written determination
of Final Working Capital and Final Closing Cash to the Parent and the Holder
Representative,

 



      
 

 



 

together with a calculation of the Final Adjustment Amount that results from
such determination, and such determination and calculation shall be binding on
the parties, absent fraud or manifest error. The fees and expenses of the
Final Arbiter shall be borne equally, with one-half being paid by the Parent
and one-half being paid by the Holders, severally (in proportion to their
Sharing Ratios) and not jointly. The Final Arbiter may not award damages,
interest or penalties to any party with respect to any matter.

 



 

SECTION 2.6. _Escrow_. ** **At Closing, the Parent shall deposit the Escrow
Amount in an account (the " **Escrow Account** ") to be established by Parent
and the Holder Representative with the Escrow Agent pursuant to the terms of
an escrow agreement substantially in the form agreed to by the parties on or
prior to the date hereof (the " **Escrow Agreement** "). The Escrow Account
shall be administered in accordance with the terms and provisions of the
Escrow Agreement.

 



 

 **ARTICLE III 
CLOSING**

 



 

SECTION 3.1. _Closing_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions contained
herein, the closing of the Merger pursuant to this Agreement (the "
**Closing** ") shall take place at the offices of the Company, 11400 Westmoor
Circle, Westminster, Colorado, 80021 at 9:00 a.m., Westminster, Colorado time,
on the earlier of (i) May 31, 2012 or (ii) 10 days after the expiration or
termination of the "waiting period" or any extension thereof under the HSR Act
applicable to the Merger (provided that, if the conditions to the obligations
of the parties to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
set forth in Articles IX and X are not satisfied or waived on such date, the
Closing shall take place as soon as practicable after the satisfaction or
waiver of such conditions (but in no event more than two Business Days
thereafter)), or at such other time and date as the parties may agree (the "
**Closing Date** ").

 



 

SECTION 3.2. _Deliveries by the Company_. At the Closing, the Company shall

 **ARTICLE VII 
COVENANTS**

 



 

SECTION 7.1. _Cooperation; Certain Consents and Approvals_.

 



 

(a) From the date hereof until the Closing Date, upon the terms and subject to
the conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions,
and to do, or cause to be done and cooperate with each other in order to do,
all things necessary, proper or advisable (subject to any applicable Laws) to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as promptly as practicable, including the preparation and filing of
all forms, registrations and notices required to be filed to consummate the
transactions contemplated

 



      
 

 



 

hereby, and the taking of such actions as are necessary to obtain any
requisite Consents, Orders, Permits, qualifications, exemptions, waiting
period expirations or terminations or waivers from any Person or Governmental
Authority. In addition, no party shall take any action from the date hereof
until the Closing Date (other than any action required to be taken under this
Agreement or to which the other parties shall have granted their consent) that
would reasonably be expected to materially delay the obtaining of, or result
in not obtaining, any Consent, Order, Permit, qualification, exemption,
waiting period expirations or terminations or waiver from any Governmental
Authority or other Person required to be obtained prior to Closing.

 



 

(b) To the extent permitted by applicable Law and subject to any limitations
on access to information provided for in Section 7.3, each party shall consult
with the other parties with respect to, and provide any information reasonably
requested by the other parties in connection with, all material filings made
with any Governmental Authority in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby. If any party or any of its Affiliates
receives a request for information or documentary material from any
Governmental Authority with respect to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby, then such party shall endeavor in good faith
to make, or cause to be made, as soon as reasonably practicable and, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, after consultation with the other parties,
an appropriate response in compliance with such request. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, to the extent permitted by Law and subject to any
limitations on access to information contained in Section 7.3, each party
shall provide to the other (or the others respective advisors) upon request
copies of all correspondence between such party and any Governmental Authority
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , that
(i) neither party is obligated to share any document submitted to or received
from a Governmental Authority that reflects the negotiations among the parties
or the valuation of some or all of any Persons business and (ii) neither
party shall be required to provide to the other party a complete copy of the
filing made by such party or its "ultimate parent entity" under the HSR Act
(but only such portions of such filing as are customarily exchanged by the
parties for the purposes of preparing similar filings). The parties may, as
they deem advisable and necessary, designate any competitively sensitive
materials provided to the other under this Section 7.1 as "outside counsel
only." Such materials and the information contained therein shall be given
only to outside counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such
outside counsel to employees, officers, or directors of the recipient without
the advance written consent of the party providing such materials. In
addition, to the extent reasonably practicable and permitted by such
Governmental Authority, no party shall agree to participate in any
discussions, telephone calls, and meetings with a Governmental Authority
regarding proceedings under or related to the HSR Act, unless it gives the
other parties the opportunity to attend or participate therein. Subject to
applicable Law, the parties shall consult and cooperate with each other in
advance in connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations,
memoranda, briefs, arguments, and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf
of a party hereto or its "ultimate parent entity" to any Governmental
Authority regarding proceedings under or related to the HSR Act.

 



 

(c) In addition to and without limiting any of the other covenants of the
parties contained in this Section 7.1, the Parent and the Company shall (i)
make the filings required of them or their "ultimate parent entities" under
the HSR Act in connection with the

 



      
 

 



 

transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable after the date of
this Agreement (and in no event later than eight Business Days after the date
hereof), (ii) comply, at the earliest practicable date, with any request for
additional information or documentary material received by them, or any of
their respective Affiliates from the FTC or the DOJ pursuant to the HSR Act or
from any state attorney general or other Governmental Authority in connection
with antitrust matters, (iii) cooperate with each other in connection with any
filing under the HSR Act and in connection with resolving any investigation or
other inquiry concerning the transactions contemplated hereby commenced by the
FTC, DOJ, any state attorney general or any other Governmental Authority, (iv)
use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may
be asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby under any
antitrust Law and (v) advise the other parties promptly of any material
communication received by such party from the FTC, DOJ, any state attorney
general or any other Governmental Authority regarding any of the transactions
contemplated hereby, and of any understandings, undertakings or agreements
(oral or written) such party proposes to make or enter into with the FTC, DOJ,
any state attorney general or any other Governmental Authority in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby. Concurrently with the filing of
notifications under the HSR Act, the Parent and the Company shall each request
early termination of the applicable "waiting period" under the HSR Act.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no party hereto shall be required to take any
commercially unreasonable action that substantially impairs the overall
benefits realized from the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and in no event shall any party hereto be required, in order
to resolve any objection or proceeding asserted or commenced by the FTC, DOJ,
any state attorney general or any other Governmental Authority to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to (i) sell, hold separate or
otherwise dispose of any of its or its Affiliates assets or businesses (or,
in the case of the Parent, any assets or businesses of the Surviving Entity)
or (ii) terminate any of its or its Affiliates existing business
relationships or contractual agreements if, in the case of clause (i) or (ii)
of this sentence, such party determines in good faith sole discretion that any
such action would be commercially unreasonable.

Date, the Company shall, unless the Parent shall otherwise consent in writing

except as described in Section 7.2 of the Company Disclosure Schedule or as

owing to any Holder or (iii) any other payments in the Ordinary Course of
Business.

 



 

SECTION 7.3. _Access to Information_. From the date hereof until the Closing
Date, the Company shall (i) make its management personnel reasonably available

(c) The Company and each Holder agrees that the rights and remedies for
noncompliance with this Section 7.8 shall include having such provision

adequate remedy to Parent.

Closing Date) and (ii) all other Tax Returns which are required to be filed by
the Company, the due date of which (taking into account extensions) occurs on
or before the Closing Date. The Holder Representative shall pay all Taxes
shown as due on such Tax Returns, except to the extent such Taxes were paid by
the Company prior to the Closing or were reflected as a liability in Final
Working Capital.

 



 

(b) The Parent shall prepare or cause to be prepared, and timely file (taking
into account any applicable extensions), all Tax Returns attributable to
Straddle Periods the due dates of which arise after the Closing Date (each, a
" **Straddle Period Tax Return** "). Not later than 30 days prior to the due
date for each such Straddle Period Tax Return (including extensions thereof),
the Parent shall provide, or cause to be provided, to the Holder
Representative a draft of such Straddle Period Tax Return, together with the
work papers and schedules utilized in its preparation for review and comment
by the Holder Representative, which comments shall be duly incorporated, with
the consent of the Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld), in
the preparation of the final copy of such Straddle Period Tax Return. Not
later than five days prior to the due date for each Straddle Period Tax Return
(including extensions thereof), the Holder Representative shall pay to Parent
all Taxes shown as due on each such Straddle Period Tax Return that are
attributable to the portion of such Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date
in accordance with the allocation method described in Section 12.2(b), except
to the extent such Taxes were reflected as a liability in the Final Working
Capital. Promptly upon filing, the Parent shall deliver to the Holder
Representative a copy of each Straddle Period Tax Return. In the event that
any Straddle Period Tax Return filed by the Parent does not take into account
changes and comments requested by the Holder Representative, the amount of Tax
owed by the Holders for the Pre-Closing Tax Period with respect to such
Straddle Period Tax Return shall be determined pursuant to resolution
procedures similar to those set forth in Section 2.5 of this Agreement.

 



 

(c) The Parent shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, any
and all Tax Returns required to be filed by or with respect to the Company for
any taxable period beginning after the Closing Date.

 



 

SECTION 8.2. _No Changes in Elections, etc_.

 



 

(a) Except as provided in Section 8.6, the Parent shall not, and it shall
cause its Affiliates and the Surviving Entity not to, make or change any Tax
election, amend any Tax Return or take any Tax position on any Tax Return,
take any action, omit to take any action or enter into any transaction that
results in any increased Tax liability or reduction of any Tax asset of the
Holders or the Company in respect of any tax period or portion thereof ending
on or prior to the Closing Date.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall not, and shall not cause its
Affiliates to, change any Tax election, amend any Tax Return or take any Tax
position on any Tax Return that results in any increased Tax liability or
reduction of any Tax asset of the Parent, the Company, or the Surviving Entity
in respect of any tax period beginning after the Closing Date or any portion
of any Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Date.

 



 

SECTION 8.3. _Tax Refunds_. After the Closing Date, any refund received by the
Parent, any of its Affiliates, or the Company in respect of Taxes paid by the
Holders or the Company in respect of any Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be paid
by the recipient to the Holder Representative promptly upon receipt.

 



 

SECTION 8.4. _Tax Contests_. The Parent shall promptly notify the Holder
Representative in writing of any matter which may give rise to a claim for
indemnification against the Holders in respect of Taxes pursuant to Section
12.2(b) upon receiving written notice of such matter; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that failure of the Parent to give the Holder Representative notice as
provided herein will not relieve the Holders of their indemnification
obligations under Section 12.2 (b), except as to the extent that the Holders
are materially prejudiced by the Parents failure to give such prompt notice.
The Holder Representative shall be entitled to manage, conduct and control any
Tax audits, examinations, appeals, litigation, or other Tax proceedings
relating to Tax items and issues of the Company for which the Holders are
required to indemnify Parent under Section 12.2(b) (each, a " **Tax Contest**
"), unless such Tax Contest arises in a proceeding that also involves Tax
items or issues of the Parent or any of its Affiliates other than the Company
or that also involves Tax items or issues of the Surviving Entity for taxable
periods ending after the Closing Date, in which case the Holder Representative
and the Parent shall jointly control the Tax Contest. In any event, the Parent
shall have the right to participate in, and consult with the Holder
Representative regarding, any Tax Contest described in this paragraph that may
affect the Surviving Entity for any periods ending after the Closing Date at
the Parents own expense, and the Holder Representative shall keep the Parent
reasonably informed of material developments in such Tax Contest and provide
the Parent with copies of any written correspondence from or to the relevant
Tax Authority with respect to such Tax Contest. Any settlement or other
disposition of any Tax Contest (whether administratively or after the
commencement of litigation), which is controlled by the Holder Representative
pursuant to this paragraph and which could reasonably be expected to increase
any Taxes of the Surviving Entity in any taxable period or portion thereof
ending after the Closing Date, may only be with the written consent of the
Parent, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. In cases where the Tax Contest is jointly controlled, neither party
may settle or concede, either administratively or after the commencement of
litigation, any such Tax Contest without the written consent of the other
party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. In no event shall the Parent be entitled to settle or concede, either
administratively or after the commencement of litigation, any Tax Contest
relating to Taxes for which the Holders are required to indemnify Parent under
Section 12.2(b) unless (i) the Holder Representative consents (in writing) to
such settlement or concession, which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed or (ii) the Parent agrees to waive its right
to be indemnified for the issue being conceded or settled. In the event of a
conflict between

 



      
 

 



 

the provisions of this Section 8.4 and Article XII, the provisions of this
Section 8.4 shall control.

 



 

SECTION 8.5. _Merger Consideration Allocation_. The Merger Consideration and
any liabilities of the Company that for Tax purposes are treated as assumed by
the Parent (collectively, the " **Tax Purchase Price** ") shall be allocated
among the assets of the Company in such a manner as is set forth in a purchase
price allocation schedule that is jointly prepared and mutually agreed to by
the Holder Representative and the Parent prior to, or as soon as practicable
after, the Closing Date (the " **Agreed Asset Acquisition Statement** "). The
Tax Purchase Price as finally determined shall be allocated in accordance with
the Agreed Asset Acquisition Statement, all income Tax Returns and reports
filed by the Parent and the Holder Representative shall be prepared
consistently with the Agreed Asset Acquisition Statement, and no party nor any
of their respective Affiliates or direct or indirect owners shall take a
position on any Tax Return, or before any Governmental Authority in connection
with the examination of a Tax Return or in any judicial proceeding, that is in
any manner inconsistent with the Agreed Asset Acquisition Statement, except as
required by applicable Law. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
in the event that the Holder Representative and the Parent are unable to
mutually agree to an Agreed Asset Acquisition Statement within ninety (90)
days after the Closing Date, each party shall be permitted to adopt its own
positions regarding the allocation of Tax Purchase Price among the assets of
the Company and neither party shall have any further obligations to the other
with respect to such allocations of Tax Purchase Price.

 



 

SECTION 8.6. _Tax Characterization of Transaction_. The Parties acknowledge
and agree that (i) the merger is properly characterized for U.S. federal
income Tax purposes as a taxable sale of the assets of (followed by
liquidating distributions of the sales proceeds by) the Company and as a
purchase of assets of the Company by the Parent, and (ii) none of the Parties
shall adopt positions inconsistent with such characterization or treatment in
any Tax Return or Tax Contest, except to the extent there is a change in Tax
law requiring a different characterization.

 



 

SECTION 8.7. _Transfer Taxes_. The Parent shall bear all sales, use, gross
receipts, transfer, and similar Taxes, if any, assessed or payable in
connection with the Merger pursuant to this Agreement; _provided_ that the
party legally responsible for any such Taxes shall timely remit same, and if
the Holders are the legally responsible party, the Parent shall reimburse the
Holder Representative for such Taxes.

 



 

SECTION 8.8. _Cooperation; Access to Records_. After the Closing Date, each of
the Holder Representative and the Parent shall:

 



 

(a) assist (and cause its respective Affiliates to assist) the other party in
preparing any Tax Returns which such other party is responsible for preparing
and filing in accordance with Section 8.1;

 



 

(b) promptly notify the other party in writing upon receipt of notice of any
pending or threatened audits or assessments relating to Taxes for which the
other party may be required to pay indemnification under Article XII;

 



      
 

 



 

(c) cooperate fully in preparing for and conducting any audits of, or disputes
with taxing authorities regarding, any Tax Returns of the Company;

 



 

(d) make available to the other party and to any taxing authority as
reasonably requested all records, documents, accounting data and other
information relating to Taxes of the Company;

 



 

(e) furnish the other party with copies of all correspondence received from
any taxing authority in connection with any Tax audit or information request
with respect to any such taxable period for which the other party may have any
liability under Section 12.2; and

 



 

(f) execute and deliver such powers of attorney and other documents as are
necessary to carry out the purposes and intent of this Article VIII.

 



 

SECTION 8.9. _Tax Treatment of Payments_. All amounts payable under Sections
12.2 and 12.3 shall be treated as adjustments to the Tax Purchase Price for
all Tax purposes, except and to the extent (i) any portion of one or more of
such amounts is treated as interest under section 1272, 1274 or 483 of the
Code or other provision of the Code and any similar provision of state and
local Tax law or (ii) otherwise required under applicable tax law.

 **ARTICLE XII 
INDEMNIFICATION**

 



 

SECTION 12.1. _Survival of Representations and Warranties and Covenants_. The
representations and warranties (other than the Fundamental Representations and
the Statutory Representation) and covenants and agreements of the parties
contained in this Agreement, and rights to indemnification in respect thereof,
shall survive the Closing and continue in effect until ****** ; _provided_ ,
that those covenants and agreements that by their terms are to be performed in
whole or in part subsequent to the Closing shall remain in full force until
such particular covenant or agreement is fully performed as provided in this
Agreement. The Fundamental Representations, and the rights of indemnification
in respect thereof, shall survive the Closing and continue in effect ******.
The Statutory Representation, and the rights of indemnification in respect
thereof, shall survive the Closing and continue in effect until ****** with
respect to the subject matter thereof. The agreement of the Holders to provide
indemnification pursuant to Section 12.2(b) shall continue until ****** with
respect to the Taxes that are covered by Section 12.2(b). The agreement of the
Holders to provide indemnification pursuant to Section 12.2(c) shall continue
until ****** applicable to the subject matter of such indemnification
provision. The period for which a representation or warranty, covenant or
agreement contained in this Agreement survives the Closing is referred to
herein as the " **Survival Period**." Notwithstanding anything herein to the

representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the parties set forth in
this Agreement: (A) such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement shall
be of no further force or effect; and (B) no Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to any indemnification rights arising from a breach of such
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement except to the extent that such
Indemnified Party has given written notice thereof to the

 



      
 

 



 

Indemnifying Party during the Survival Period pursuant to the applicable
provisions of this Article XII.

 



 

SECTION 12.2. _Holders  Indemnification Obligations_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the limitations set forth in this Article XII, from and after
the Closing Date, each Holder shall, severally (in proportion to its Sharing
Ratio) and not jointly, indemnify and hold the Parent and each of its
officers, directors, managers, partners, members and employees (the " **Parent
Indemnified Parties** ") harmless from and against any and all Claims,
judgments, causes of action, liabilities, obligations, damages, losses,
deficiencies, costs, penalties, interest and expenses (collectively, "
**Losses** ") arising out of (i) any breach of any representation or warranty
of such Holder contained in Article IV, (ii) any breach of any covenant on the
part of such Holder contained in this Agreement, (iii) any breach of any
representation or warranty of the Company contained in Article V and (iv) any
breach of any covenant on the part of the Company contained in this Agreement,
but only to the extent that such agreement or covenant is required to be
performed prior to or at Closing.

 



 

(b) Subject to the limitations set forth in this Article XII, from and after
the Closing Date, each Holder shall, severally (in proportion to its Sharing
Ratio) and not jointly, indemnify and hold the Parent Indemnified Parties
harmless from and against any Losses arising out of Taxes of the Company that
are attributable to any taxable periods and partial taxable periods ending on
or before the Closing Date (" **Pre-Closing Tax Periods** "), except to the
extent such Taxes were reflected as liabilities in the Final Working Capital
or were reserved for in the Latest Balance Sheet. For purposes of this Section
12.2(b), in the case of any Taxes that are payable for a Tax period that
includes, but does not end on, the Closing Date (a " **Straddle Period** "),
the portion of such Tax attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall (A)
in the case of any Tax based upon or related to income, sales, gross receipts
or wages, be deemed to equal the amount that would be payable if the Pre-
Closing Tax Period ended (and the books of the Company were closed) on the
Closing Date and (B) in the case of any Taxes other than those described in
clause (A) ( _e.g_., property or ad valorem Taxes), be deemed to be the amount
of such Tax for the Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction (i) the numerator
of which is the days in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and (ii) the denominator of
which is the number of days in the entire Straddle Period.

 



 

(c) Subject to the limitations set forth in this Article XII, from and after
the Closing Date, the Holders shall, severally (in proportion to their Sharing
Ratios) and not jointly, indemnify and hold the Parent Indemnified Parties
harmless from and against any **. For the avoidance of doubt, the Holders
obligations under this Section 12.2(c) shall not extend to **. **** After the
Closing, the Parent agrees that it shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to cause the Surviving Entity to **. Each of Rex and Summit hereby releases
and forever discharges the Parent, the Surviving Entity, and each and every of
their respective Affiliates, officers, directors, shareholders, partners,
members, managers, employees and agents (the " **Parent Releasees** "), from
any and all claims, demands, proceedings, causes of action, orders,
obligations, debts and liabilities whatsoever, whether known or unknown,
suspected or unsuspected, both at law and in equity, which Rex, Summit or any
of their respective Affiliates has, has ever had or may hereafter have against
any Parent Releasee arising in connection with ****** the Company Disclosure
Schedule.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) For the purposes of the indemnification provisions contained in this
Article XII, in determining the amount of any Loss arising out of any
inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty (but not for
purposes of determining whether a breach of any such representation or
warranty has occurred), all materiality, Material Adverse Effect or other
similar qualifications contained in or otherwise applicable to such
representation or warranty shall be disregarded.

 



 

SECTION 12.3. _Parent s Indemnification Obligations_. Subject to the
limitations set forth in this Article XII, from and after the Closing Date,
the Parent shall indemnify and hold each of the Holders and its Affiliates and
each of their respective officers, directors, managers, partners, members and
employees (the " **Holder Indemnified Parties** ") harmless from and against
any and all Losses arising out of (a) any breach of any representation or
warranty of the Parent contained in Article VI, (b) any breach of any covenant
on the part of the Parent contained in this Agreement or (c) any breach of any
covenant on the part of the Company or Surviving Entity contained in this
Agreement, but only to the extent that such agreement or covenant is required
to be performed after Closing.

 



 

SECTION 12.4. _Limitations on Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) In no event shall the indemnification obligations of the Holders include
any obligation to provide indemnification for Covered Losses unless and until
the aggregate amount of all Covered Losses for which the Parent Indemnified
Parties are entitled to indemnification exceeds an amount equal to ****** (the
" **Indemnity Basket** "), in which case the Parent Indemnified Parties may be
entitled (subject to the other limitations herein) to indemnification only for
Covered Losses in excess of the Indemnity Basket. In addition to the foregoing
limitation, if the total amount of Covered Losses arising out of a specific
breach does not exceed ****** , then no Parent Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to indemnification for any such Covered Losses and such Covered
Losses shall not be included for purposes of determining whether the Indemnity
Basket has been exceeded.

 



 

(b) The maximum obligation of the Holders to provide indemnification to any
and all Parent Indemnified Parties pursuant to Sections 12.2(a) (other than in
respect of the Fundamental Holder Representations, the Fundamental Company
Representations or the Statutory Representation) shall be limited to **.
Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, ****** , the maximum obligation of the
Holders to provide indemnification to any and all Parent Indemnified Parties
pursuant to Sections 12.2(a) (other than in respect of the Fundamental Holder
Representations, the Fundamental Company Representations or the Statutory
Representation) and 12.2(c) shall be limited to an amount equal to ****** ;
_provided, however_ , that any such indemnification obligation shall be
satisfied first from the Escrow Account to the extent any funds remain
therein, and thereafter by each Holder, severally (in accordance with its
Sharing Ratio) but not jointly.

 



 

(c) The maximum obligation of the Holders to provide indemnification to any
and all Parent Indemnified Parties pursuant to Section 12.2(a)(iii) in respect
of the Statutory Representation and pursuant to Sections 12.2(b) and 12.2(c)
shall be limited to an amount equal to ****** ; _provided, however_ , that any
such indemnification obligation shall be satisfied

 



       
 

 



 

first from the Escrow Account to the extent any funds remain therein, and
thereafter by each Holder, severally (in accordance with its Sharing Ratio)
but not jointly.

 



 

(d) The maximum obligation of the Holders to provide indemnification to any
and all Parent Indemnified Parties pursuant to Sections 12.2(a)(i) and
12.2(a)(iii) in respect of the Fundamental Holder Representations and the
Fundamental Company Representations shall be limited to an amount equal to
****** ; _provided, however_ , that any such indemnification obligation shall
be satisfied first from the Escrow Account to the extent any funds remain
therein, and thereafter (A) in the case of the Fundamental Holder
Representations, by the Holder who made such representations and (B) in the
case of the Fundamental Company Representations, by each Holder, severally (in
accordance with its Sharing Ratio) but not jointly.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Article XII,
any Losses subject to indemnification pursuant to Section 12.2 shall be
decreased to the extent that the amount of such Losses are reflected as a
liability, reserve, accrual or other item on the Final Balance Sheet or are
otherwise included in the determination of the Final Adjustment Amount.

 



 

SECTION 12.5. _Third-Party Claims_. If any third party asserts a Claim (a "
**Third-Party Claim** ") against an Indemnified Party that could reasonably be
expected to give rise to a right on the part of the Indemnified Party to
indemnification under this Article XII, the Indemnified Party shall give
notice of such Third-Party Claim to the Holder Representative (in the case of
a Third-Party Claim asserted against a Parent Indemnified Party) or the Parent
(in the case of a Third-Party Claim asserted against a Holder Indemnified
Party) as soon as practicable (but in no event later than ten Business Days
after receiving written notice of such Third-Party Claim), and the
Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume the defense of such Third-
Party Claim; _provided, however_ , that the failure to so notify the
Indemnifying Party will not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any liability
that the Indemnifying Party may have hereunder with respect to such Third-
Party Claim, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is materially
prejudiced as a result of such failure, including where the failure to so
notify the Indemnifying Party results in material Losses to the Indemnifying
Party or the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses that would otherwise
be available in the defense of such Third-Party Claim; and _provided, further_
that the Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to assume the defense of
any Third-Party Claim asserted by or on behalf of a Governmental Authority or
any Third-Party Claim seeking injunctive relief if the Indemnified Party
determines in good faith that such action would reasonably be expected to have
a material adverse effect on the conduct of its business or future operations
(other than as the result of the payment of any damages in respect of such
Third-Party Claim). If the Indemnifying Party elects not to assume the
defense, is not entitled to assume the defense or fails to assume the defense
in a timely manner, then the Indemnified Party may employ counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnifying Party to represent or defend it against any
such Third-Party Claim, and, subject to Section 12.4, the reasonable out-of-
pocket attorneys fees and other out-of-pocket costs incurred by the
Indemnified Party for such counsel and defense will be included in the
Indemnified Partys Losses; _provided, however_ , that the Indemnified Partys
Losses shall not, in connection with any Legal Proceeding or separate but
substantially similar Legal Proceedings arising out of the same general
allegations, include the fees and expenses of

 



      
 

 



 

more than one separate firm of attorneys at any time for all Indemnified
Persons, except to the extent that local counsel, in addition to its regular
counsel, is required, in the reasonable judgment of the Indemnified Party, in
order to effectively defend against such Legal Proceeding. If the Indemnifying
Party does assume the defense of a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party
shall have the right to participate in the defense of such Third-Party Claim
at its expense. If the Indemnified Party retains its own counsel, the
Indemnifying Party shall reasonably cooperate in providing information to and
consulting with the Indemnified Party about the Third-Party Claim. The
Indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party, enter into any settlement with respect to any Third-Party
Claim it has assumed the defense of (i) unless such settlement includes an
unconditional release of the Indemnified Party for liability arising out of
such claim or (ii) if such settlement imposes injunctive relief upon the
Company in a manner that would adversely impact the business or future

SECTION 12.6. _Procedures_.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no Parent Indemnified
Party shall be entitled to indemnification under this Article XII unless it
has duly delivered a written notice to the Holder Representative (a " **Notice
of Claim** ") **** before the expiration of the applicable Survival Period
setting forth: (i) a statement that such Parent Indemnified Party believes in
good faith that there is or has been a breach of a representation, warranty,
covenant or obligation contained in this Agreement, with reference to the
specific representation, warranty, covenant or obligation, and that such
Parent Indemnified Party is entitled to be held harmless and indemnified under
this Article XII, (ii) a brief description of the circumstances supporting
such Parent Indemnified Partys belief that there is or has been such a
breach, (iii) a good faith estimate of the aggregate dollar amount of actual
and potential Losses for which it is entitled to be indemnified hereunder and
that have arisen and may arise as a result of the breach (the " **Claimed
Amount** ") and (iv) in the event of a Third-Party Claim, a copy of such
Third-Party Claim (if available) and a description of the basis for such
Third-Party Claim.

 



 

(b) If during the 30-Business Day period commencing upon the receipt by the
Holder Representative of a Notice of Claim, the Holder Representative delivers
to the Parent Indemnified Party a written response (the " **Response Notice**
") in which the Holder Representative objects to the payment of some or all of
the Claimed Amount to such Parent Indemnified Party, then the Holder
Representative and such Parent Indemnified Party shall attempt in good faith
to resolve the dispute.

 



 

(c) If the Holder Representative and Parent Indemnified Party are unable to
resolve the dispute during the 30-day period commencing upon the receipt of
the Response Notice by the Parent Indemnified Party, then such dispute (and
any other disputes relating

 



      
 

 



 

to the Claimed Amount or the related Indemnification Claim) shall be submitted
to, and settled by, arbitration in accordance with the procedures in Section
14.10.

 



 

(d) Funds shall be released from the Escrow Account only in accordance with
the Escrow Agreement.

 



 

SECTION 12.7. _Exclusive Remedy_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, any indemnification obligation of any Holder for Losses under
this Agreement shall be satisfied first by recourse to the Escrow Account, and
the Parent Indemnified Parties shall not seek any recovery from the Holders
themselves until such time as the Escrow Account has been exhausted. Parent
shall not seek any indemnification, contribution repayment or other remedy or
recourse directly or indirectly (through any director or officer of the
Company or otherwise) from any Holder or its respective Affiliates with
respect to any matter relating to the Company or its business, operations,
properties or assets (including, but not limited to, any matters relating to
the merchantability, value or use of any such properties or assets), financial
condition or results of operations, or the subject matter of this Agreement
(whether on the basis of a claim sounding in tort, contract, statute or
otherwise) other than claims for indemnification pursuant to, and subject to
the limitations contained in, this Article XII. Unless otherwise prohibited by
applicable Law (pursuant to statutory or other provisions that cannot be
waived by the parties), and except for claims for intentional fraud, from and
after the Closing, the remedies of the parties specifically provided for in
this Article XII shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of the parties for
all matters covered or contemplated by this Agreement (including any breach of
a representation, warranty or covenant); _provided, however_ , that nothing
herein shall limit the right of any party to seek specific performance or
injunctive relief in connection with a breach by another party of its
obligations under this Agreement that occurs after the Closing Date. In no
event shall any party be liable to any other party for special, punitive,
exemplary, incidental, consequential or indirect damages, lost profits,
diminution in value, damage to reputation or loss to goodwill, whether based
in contract, tort, strict liability or otherwise, except in the case of such
items payable in satisfaction of a Third Party Claim for which such party is
entitled to indemnification hereunder.

 



 

SECTION 12.8. _Mitigation; Insurance_. In the case of any Indemnification
Claims for which it is reasonably likely that a party may have a direct or
indirect right of recovery against one or more third parties (including, but
not limited to, rights of recovery under insurance policies or indemnification
arrangements with third parties), such party shall seek recovery of such
Indemnification Claims from such third parties for so long as pursuit of such
recovery is commercially reasonable unless such party reasonably determines
that seeking such recovery is likely to result in a material increase in
future premiums. To the extent that a party obtains recovery in respect of any
Indemnification Claims from any third parties, such party shall use the funds
provided by such recovery (in lieu of funds provided by any other party
pursuant to the indemnification provisions of this Article XII) to pay or
otherwise satisfy such Indemnification Claims and the amount of any Losses
with respect to any Indemnification Claim for which indemnification is
available under this Article XII shall be reduced by the amount of such
insurance proceeds or other such funds realized or paid to the Indemnified
Party. If, after the making of any payment in respect of an Indemnification
Claim under this Article XII, the amount of the Losses to which such payment
relates is reduced by recovery, settlement

 



      
 

 



 

or otherwise under any insurance coverage, or pursuant to any claim, recovery,
settlement or payment by or against any other Person, the amount of such
reduction will promptly be repaid by the Indemnified Party to the Indemnifying
Party. Each party hereto shall take commercially reasonable steps within its
control to mitigate its Losses upon and after becoming aware of any event
which could reasonably be expected to give rise to any Losses; _provided_ ,
that any obligation to seek insurance recovery shall be subject to limitations
set forth in the first sentence of this Section 12.8.

 



 

SECTION 12.9. _Indemnification Net of Tax Benefit_. The amount of any Losses
with respect to any Claim for which indemnification is available under this
Article XII (an " **Indemnification Claim** ") shall be reduced by the Tax
Benefit actually realized by the Indemnified Parties and their Affiliates as a
result of such Losses. For these purposes, " **Tax Benefit** " means the
positive excess, if any, of (i) the excess (if any) of the Tax liability of
the Indemnified Parties and their Affiliates without regard to such Losses for
the taxable year in which the Loss occurs, over the Tax liability of the
Indemnified Parties and their Affiliates for the taxable year in which the
Loss occurs taking into account such Losses, with all other circumstances
remaining unchanged, over (ii) the excess (if any) of the Tax liability of the
Indemnified Parties and their Affiliates for the taxable year in which the
Loss occurs determined after taking into account the receipt/accrual of the
indemnity payments under this Article XII with respect to such Indemnification
Claim, over the Tax liability of the Indemnified Parties and their Affiliates
for the taxable year in which the Loss occurs determined without regard to the
receipt/accrual of the indemnity payments under this Article XII with respect
to such Indemnification Claim. Notwithstanding anything contained herein, this
provision shall not enable the Holders or Holder Representative to have access
to the Tax records of the Parent or its Affiliates (including the Company)
following Closing.

 



 

SECTION 12.10. _Cooperation; Access to Documents and Information_. The parties
shall cooperate with each other in connection with resolving any
Indemnification Claims. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any
Indemnified Party who desires to assert an Indemnification Claim pursuant to
this Agreement shall (i) provide to the Indemnifying Party all documents
books, records and other information relating to such Indemnification Claim
which are in the possession of the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates or can
be obtained by the Indemnified Party without undue cost or expense as promptly
as practicable and (ii) give the Indemnifying Party reasonable access from
time to time to the accounting and other appropriate personnel and the
independent accountants of the Indemnified Party and its Affiliates in order
to permit the Indemnifying Party to obtain information reasonably required to
evaluate such Indemnification Claim.

 **ARTICLE XIV 
GENERAL**

 



 

SECTION 14.1. _Holder Representative_.

 



 

(a) Each Holder (A) consents to the deposit of the Escrow Amount in the Escrow
Account, (B) agrees that the Merger Consideration will be subject to the
adjustment provisions set forth in Article II, (C) agrees that it will be
subject to the indemnification provisions set forth in Article XII and (D)
designates and appoints KMS Shareholder Representative, LLC, to serve as its
true and lawful attorney-in-fact and to act as representative of the Holders
(the " **Holder Representative** ") under this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement and, as such, to act as such Holders agent (with full power of
substitution) and to take any action on such Holders behalf with respect to
any and all matters relating to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including, without limitation:

 



 

(i) to accept payment from the Parent and Escrow Agent on behalf of the
Holders;

 



 

(ii) to (1) dispute or refrain from disputing, on behalf of such Holder, any
claim made by the Parent under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement; (2)
negotiate and compromise, on behalf of such Holder, any dispute that may arise
under, and to exercise or refrain from exercising any remedies available
under, this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement; and (3) execute, on behalf of
such Holder, any settlement agreement, release or other document with respect
to such dispute or remedy;

 



 

(iii) to enforce, on behalf of such Holder, any claim against Parent arising
under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement;

 



 

(iv) to engage attorneys, accountants and agents, including the Final Arbiter
in accordance with Section 2.5, at the expense of the Holders;

 



 

(v) to amend this Agreement (other than this Section 14.1), or any of the
instruments to be delivered to the Parent by such Holder pursuant to this
Agreement or the Escrow Agreement;

 



 

(vi) to have exclusive power and authority to institute legal action or
otherwise act on behalf of such Holder with respect to any claims against the
Parent (including any and all claims for non-payment or claims relating to
disbursement of escrowed funds) relating to payment of the Merger
Consideration and to control and direct any such claims;

 



 

(vii) to cause to be paid, on behalf of such Holder, any amount owed to such
Holder under the terms of this Agreement or in any other written agreement
executed by such Holder or any claim asserted against such Holder by Parent or
any Parent Indemnified Party;

 



      
 

 



 

(viii) to give such instructions and to take such action or refrain from
taking such action, on behalf of such Holder, as the Holder Representative
deems, in its sole discretion, necessary or appropriate to carry out the
provisions of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement;

 



 

(ix) to withhold and set aside from the payments made hereunder or pursuant to
the Escrow Agreement, cash in such amount as the Holder Representative
determines in its sole discretion is required to pay any amounts or claims
described in Section 14.1(a)(vii) or any fees, charges or expenses incurred in
connection with the actions and obligations of the Holder Representative as
authorized by this Section 14.1;

 



 

(x) to determine, in its sole discretion, the time or times when, purpose for,
and manner in which any of the above powers conferred upon the Holder
Representative shall be exercised, and the conditions, provisions, covenants
of any instrument or document that may be executed by the Holder
Representative pursuant to this Section 14.1.

 



 

The authority conferred upon the Holder Representative shall be irrevocable
and coupled with an interest.

 



 

(b) The Parent and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to conclusively rely on
the instructions, decisions and acts of the Holder Representative required,
permitted or contemplated to be taken by the Holder Representative hereunder
or under the Escrow Agreement.

 



 

(c) All decisions and actions by the Holder Representative, including, without
limitation, any agreement between the Holder Representative and the Parent (or
any Parent Indemnified Party) relating to indemnification obligations under
Article XII or any disputes arising hereunder, including the defense or
settlement of any claims and the making of payments with respect hereto, shall
be binding upon all of the Holders, and no Holder shall have the right to
object, dissent, protest or otherwise contest the same. The Holder
Representative shall not incur any liability to any of the Holders with
respect to any action taken or suffered by any Holder in reliance upon any
notice, direction, instruction, consent, statement or other documents believed
by the Holder Representative to be genuinely and duly authorized, nor for any
other action or inaction taken in its capacity as Holder Representative,
including with respect to the indemnification obligations under Article XII,
including the defense or settlement of any claims and the making of payments
with respect thereto. The Holder Representative may, in all questions arising
under this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, rely on the
advice of counsel and for anything done, omitted or suffered in good faith by
the Holder Representative shall not be liable to any of the Holders. The
Holder Representative shall not have any duties or responsibilities except
those expressly set forth in this Agreement, and no implied covenants,
functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read
into this Agreement or shall otherwise exist against the Holder
Representative.

 



 

(d) The Holder Representative shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully
protected in relying, upon any statements furnished to it by any Holder, or
the Parent, or

 



      
 

 



 

any other evidence deemed by the Holder Representative to be reliable, and the
Holder Representative shall be entitled to act on the advice of counsel
selected by it. The Holder Representative shall be fully justified in failing
or refusing to take any action under this Agreement unless it shall have
received such advice or concurrence of such Holders as it deems appropriate or
it shall have been expressly indemnified to its satisfaction by the Holders,
against any and all liability and expense that the Holder Representative may
incur by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action.

 



 

(e) Each of the Holders shall (i) indemnify the Holder Representative (in its
capacity as such) against and hold the Holder Representative (in its capacity
as such) harmless from, any and all Losses which may at any time be imposed
upon, incurred by or asserted against the Holder Representative or any member
thereof in such capacity in any way relating to or arising out of its action
or failure to take action in good faith pursuant to this Agreement (other than
Losses arising out of gross negligence) connection herewith in such capacity,
and (ii) reimburse the Holder Representative for all costs and expenses
incurred on behalf of Holders (and not reimbursable from the Escrow Account)
in accordance with such Holders Sharing Ratio of such costs and expenses.

 



 

(f) The Holder Representative shall instruct the Parent and the Escrow Agent,
as applicable, that the amounts to be distributed to or for the benefit of the
Holders pursuant to this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement shall be
distributed as follows:

 



 

(i) first, to the Holder Representative to pay any amounts, claims, fees,
charges or other expenses in accordance with Section 14.1(a)(vii) or (ix); and

 



 

(ii) second, to the Holders in accordance with their relative Sharing Ratios.

 



 

(g) The agreements in this Section 14.1 shall survive termination of this
Agreement.

 



 

SECTION 14.2. _Amendments_. This Agreement may only be amended, modified or
supplemented by an instrument in writing executed by each of the parties
hereto, subject to Section 14.1(a)(v).

 



 

SECTION 14.3. _Waivers_. The observance of any term of this Agreement may be
waived (either generally or in a particular instance and either retroactively
or prospectively) by the party entitled to the benefits of such term, but such
waiver shall be effective only if it is in a writing signed by the party
entitled to the benefits of such term and against which such waiver is to be
asserted. Unless otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, no delay or
omission on the part of any party in exercising any right or privilege under
this Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any waiver on the
part of any party of any right or privilege under this Agreement operate as a
waiver of any other right or privilege under this Agreement nor shall any
single or partial exercise of any right or privilege preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or privilege under
this Agreement.

 



 

SECTION 14.4. _Notices_. Any notices or other communications required or
permitted hereunder shall be in writing and shall be sufficiently given if
delivered

 



      
 

 



 

personally or sent by facsimile transmission or recognized international
overnight courier to the parties at the following addresses (or at such other
address for any party as shall be specified by like notice); provided, that
notices of a change of address shall be effective only upon receipt thereof.
Notices sent by facsimile transmission shall be effective when receipt is

SECTION 14.5. _Successors and Assigns; Parties in Interest_. This Agreement
shall be binding upon and shall inure solely to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective successors, legal representatives and permitted
assigns. Neither this Agreement nor any rights or obligations hereunder may be
assigned without the written consent of the other parties. Nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any Person,
other than the parties hereto and the Indemnified Parties (with respect to the
provisions of Article XII), any rights, benefits or remedies of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement, and no other Person shall be
deemed a third-party beneficiary under or by reason of this Agreement.

 



 

SECTION 14.6. _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement or the
application of any such provision to any Person or circumstance, shall be
declared judicially to be invalid, unenforceable or void, such decision shall
not have the effect of invalidating or voiding the remainder of this
Agreement, it being the intent and agreement of the parties that this
Agreement shall be deemed amended by modifying such provision to the extent
necessary to render it valid, legal and enforceable while preserving its
intent or, if such modification is not possible, by substituting therefor
another provision that is valid, legal and enforceable and that achieves the
same objective.

 



 

SECTION 14.7. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Disclosure
Schedules and the Exhibits hereto, and the documents and instruments executed
and delivered in connection herewith) and the Confidentiality Agreement
constitute the entire agreement among the parties hereto with respect to the
subject matter hereof and supersede all prior and contemporaneous agreements
and understandings, whether written or oral, among the parties or any of them
with respect to the subject matter hereof, and there are no representations,
understandings or agreements relating to the subject matter hereof that are
not fully expressed in this Agreement and the documents and instruments
executed and delivered in connection herewith. All Exhibits and Disclosure
Schedules attached to

 



      
 

 



 

this Agreement are expressly made a part of, and incorporated by reference
into, this Agreement.

 



 

SECTION 14.8. _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the **** State of Delaware for
contracts made and to be fully performed in such state, without giving effect
to any choice-of-law rules that would require the application of the laws of
another jurisdiction.

 



 

SECTION 14.9. _Remedies_. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges and agrees
that (i) the provisions of this Agreement are reasonable and necessary to
protect the proper and legitimate interests of the other parties hereto and
(ii) the other parties hereto would be irreparably damaged if any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the
parties hereto shall be entitled to preliminary and permanent injunctive
relief to prevent breaches of the provisions of this Agreement by other
parties hereto without the necessity of proving actual damages or of posting
any bond, and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, which
rights shall be cumulative and in addition to any other remedy to which the
parties hereto may be entitled hereunder or at law or equity (which other
remedies shall be limited to the provisions of Article XII from and after the
Closing).

 



 

SECTION 14.10. _Arbitration_. The parties agree that all disputes,
controversies or claims that may arise out of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, or the breach, termination or invalidity thereof (other than
(i) any dispute, controversy or claim in respect of the Final Working Capital
or Final Adjustment Amount, which shall be governed by Section 2.5 and (ii) a
suit to obtain specific performance of the provisions of this Agreement or
obtain other injunctive relief), shall be submitted to, and determined by,
binding arbitration in accordance with the following procedures:

 



 

(a) Either the Parent or the Holder Representative may submit a dispute,
controversy or claim to arbitration by giving the other party written notice
to such effect, which notice shall describe, in reasonable detail, the facts
and legal grounds forming the basis for the filing partys request for relief.
The arbitration shall be held before one neutral arbitrator in Denver,
Colorado.

 



 

(b) Within 30 days after the other partys receipt of such demand, the Parent
and the Holder Representative shall mutually agree upon a neutral arbitrator.
If the parties are unable to agree on the arbitrator within that time period,
the arbitrator shall be selected by the American Arbitration Association ("
**AAA** "). In any event, the arbitrator shall have a background in, and
knowledge of, transactions in the oil and gas industry and shall otherwise be
an appropriate person based on the nature of the dispute. If a person with
experience in such matters is not available, the arbitrator shall be chosen
from the retired federal judges pool maintained by AAA.

 



 

(c) The arbitration shall be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules of
the AAA, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Section 14.10.
However, the arbitration shall be administered by any organization mutually
agreed to in writing by the

 



      
 

 



 

parties. If the parties are unable to agree on the organization to administer
the arbitration, it shall be administered by the AAA.

 



 

(d) Discovery shall be limited (i) to that for which each party has a
substantial, demonstrable need and (ii) to the request for and production of
documents, depositions and interrogatories. Except as otherwise provided in
this Section 14.10, all discovery shall be guided by the Federal Rules of
Civil Procedure. All issues concerning discovery upon which the parties cannot
agree shall be submitted to the arbitrator for determination.

 



 

(e) In rendering an award, the arbitrator shall determine the rights and
obligations of the parties based on the evidence presented and according to
the substantive and procedural laws of the State of Delaware, except as
otherwise expressly provided in this Section 14.10.

 



 

(f) The decision of, and award rendered by, the arbitrator shall (unless the
arbitrator determines that this time frame is impracticable) be determined no
more than 30 days after the selection of the arbitrator and shall be final and
binding on the parties and shall not be subject to appeal. Judgment on the
award may be entered in and enforced by any court of competent jurisdiction.

 



 

(g) Each party shall bear its own costs and expenses (including filing fees)
with respect to the arbitration, including one-half of the fees and expenses
of the arbitrator; _provided, however_ , that following the Closing, any such
fees or expenses that are to be borne by any Holder or the Holder
Representative shall be satisfied out of the Escrow Account to the extent of
any funds remaining in such account.

 



 

SECTION 14.11. _Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, each
of the parties hereto shall bear its own expenses (including, without
limitation, fees and disbursements of its counsel, accountants and other
experts) incurred by it in connection with the preparation, negotiation,
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement, each of the other
documents and instruments executed in connection with or contemplated by this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

SECTION 14.12. _Survival_. Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement,
the representations and warranties made in this Agreement or in any agreement,
certificate or other document executed in connection herewith shall not
survive the Closing.

 



 

SECTION 14.13. _Release of Information_. The parties shall cooperate with each
other in releasing information concerning this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby. No press releases or other public announcements
concerning the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be made by
any party without prior consultation with, and agreement of, the other
parties, except for any legally required communication by any party, including
any rules or regulations of any stock exchange, and then only with prior
consultation with the other party to the extent practicable.

 



 

SECTION 14.14. _Disclosure Schedules_. For purposes of the representations and
warranties of each party contained herein, disclosure in any section of a

 



       
 

 



 

Disclosure Schedule delivered by such party of any facts or circumstances
shall be deemed to be adequate disclosure of such facts or circumstances with
respect to all other representations or warranties made by such party, whether
or not such disclosure specifically identifies or purports to respond to one
or more of such other representations and warranties, if it is reasonably
apparent on its face that such disclosure pertains to the subject matter of
such other representations and warranties. Any information provided in a
Disclosure Schedule is solely for informational purposes, and the inclusion of
such information shall not be deemed to enlarge or enhance any of the
representations or warranties of the party providing the Disclosure Schedule
pursuant to this Agreement. The inclusion of any information in any section of
the Disclosure Schedule or other document delivered by the parties pursuant to
this Agreement shall not be deemed to be an admission or evidence of the
materiality of such item, nor shall it establish a standard of materiality for
any purpose whatsoever.

 



 

SECTION 14.15. _Certain Rules of Construction_. The article and section
headings and the table of contents contained in this Agreement are for
convenience of reference only and shall in no way define, limit, extend or
describe the scope or intent of any provisions of this Agreement. Whenever the
context may require, any pronoun used in this Agreement shall include the
corresponding masculine, feminine or neuter forms, and the singular form of
nouns, pronouns and verbs shall include the plural and vice versa. In
addition, as used in this Agreement, unless otherwise provided to the
contrary, (a) all references to days, months or years shall be deemed
references to calendar days, months or years or (b) any reference to a
"Section," "Article" or "Exhibit" shall be deemed to refer to a section or
article of this Agreement, a Disclosure Schedule or an exhibit attached to
this Agreement. Unless the context otherwise requires, the words "hereof,"
"herein," and "hereunder" and words of similar import referring to this
Agreement refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular
provision of this Agreement. The words "include," "includes," or "including"
shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." Unless
otherwise specifically provided for herein, the term "or" shall not be deemed
to be exclusive. Whenever this Agreement refers to an event, occurrence or
development that "would reasonably be expected to have" or "would not
reasonably be expected to have" a specified effect on the Company or any other
Person (including a Material Adverse Effect) a determination as to whether
such effect would reasonably be expected to occur shall be made from the
viewpoint of a reasonable and objective third party that is experienced in the
oil and gas industry, and not from the viewpoint of, or taking into account
any special circumstances applicable to, any particular Person (including the
Parent).

 



 

SECTION 14.16. _Waiver of Conflicts_. The Parent and the Company agree that,
notwithstanding any current or prior representation of the Company by Baker
Botts L.L.P. (" **Baker Botts** "), Baker Botts shall be allowed to represent
any Holder, the Holder Representative or any of their respective Affiliates in
any matters and disputes related to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the GPA Amendment, even if such matter or
dispute is adverse to the Parent, the Company or the Surviving Entity (such
representation in any such matter permitted by the foregoing, a " **Permitted
Representation** "). Each of the Parent, Merger Subsidiary and the Company (on
behalf of itself and the Surviving Entity) hereby (i) waives any claim that
any of them have or may have that Baker Botts has a conflict of interest or is
otherwise prohibited from

 



      
 

 



 

engaging in such Permitted Representation and (ii) agrees that, in the event
that a dispute related to a Permitted Representation arises after the Closing
between the Parent or the Surviving Entity, on the one hand, and any Holder,
the Holder Representative or any of their Affiliates, on the other hand, Baker
Botts may represent such Holder, the Holder Representative or Affiliate in
such dispute constituting a Permitted Representation even though the interests
of such Holder, the Holder Representative or Affiliate may be directly adverse
to the Parent or the Surviving Entity and even though Baker Botts may have
represented the Company in a matter substantially related to such dispute, or
may be handling ongoing matters for the Company at any time prior to the
Closing. The Parent and the Company each further agree (on behalf of itself
and the Surviving Entity) that any and all documents in Baker Botts files
relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including
any offers or indications of interest received by the Company in connection
therewith) shall be the property of and shall be retained by Baker Botts and
shall not be delivered to the Company, the Surviving Entity or the Parent, but
all other documents relating to the Companys assets and arising out of the
representation of the Company by Baker Botts, for periods prior to the
Closing, shall remain the property of the Company and shall be delivered to
Parent and the Surviving Entity at or promptly following the Closing.

 



 

SECTION 14.17. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in multiple
counterparts (delivery of which may be made by facsimile or in portable
document format (.pdf)), each of which shall be deemed an original and all of
which taken together shall constitute one instrument binding on all the
parties, notwithstanding that all the parties are not signatories to the
original or the same counterpart.
