Agreement and in accordance with the Cayman Companies Law. As a result of the
Merger, the separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company will
continue as the surviving company of the Merger (the "Surviving Company")
under the laws of the Cayman Islands as a wholly owned Subsidiary of
HoldCo. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Subject to the provisions of Article 9, the closing of the
Merger (the "Closing") shall take place remotely via electronic exchange of
documents, as soon as possible after, but in any event no later than four
Business Days after, the date the conditions set forth in Article 9 (other
than conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent permissible under Applicable
Law, waiver of those conditions at the Closing) have been satisfied or, to the
extent permissible under Applicable Law, waived by the Party or Parties
entitled to the benefit of such conditions, or at such other place, at such
other time or on such other date as Parent and the Company may mutually agree
in writing. The date upon which the Closing occurs is referred to herein as
the "Closing Date". At and in anticipation of the Closing, the Parties shall
cooperate to effectuate the transactions set forth on Section 2.01(b) of each
of the Company Disclosure Letter and the Parent Disclosure Letter consistent
with the timeframe set forth on Section 2.01(b) of each of the Company
Disclosure Letter and the Parent Disclosure Letter. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) On the Closing Date (or as otherwise set forth on Section
2.01(b) of each of the Company Disclosure Letter and the Parent Disclosure
Letter), the Company and Merger Sub shall execute a plan of merger (the "Plan
of Merger") substantially in the form of Exhibit B and the Parties shall file
the Plan of Merger and other documents required under the Cayman Companies Law
to effect the Merger with the Registrar of Companies of the Cayman Islands.
The Merger shall become effective at such time (the "Effective Time") as may
be agreed to by the Parties

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t18  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

and subject to such conditions as specified in the Plan of Merger, consistent
with the transactions and timeframe set forth on Section 2.01(b) of each of
the Company Disclosure Letter and the Parent Disclosure Letter. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall
possess all the rights, powers, privileges and franchises and be subject to
all of the obligations, liabilities, restrictions and disabilities of the
Company and Merger Sub, all as provided under the Cayman Companies Law. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 2.02 Conversion of Shares. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, HoldCo,
Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of any Company Common Shares or any
shares of Parent, HoldCo or Merger Sub: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) Except as otherwise provided in Section 2.02(b) or Section
2.04, each Company Common Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive from the
Exchange Agent (who shall act on behalf of the holders of Company Common
Shares entitled to the Merger Consideration), after the consummation of the
transactions set forth on Section 2.01(b) of each of the Company Disclosure
Letter and the Parent Disclosure Letter, (i) 1.6128 newly issued fully paid
and non-assessable Parent Registered Shares (the "Share Consideration") and
(ii) $12.75 in cash, without interest (the "Cash Consideration" and together
with the Share Consideration, the "Merger Consideration"). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Each Company Common Share held by the Company as treasury
shares or owned by Parent, HoldCo, Merger Sub or any of their respective
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and
shall cease to exist, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) Each common share of Merger Sub outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one common share of
the Surviving Company with the same rights, powers and privileges as the
shares so converted and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of the
Surviving Company. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) All of the Company Common Shares converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article 2 shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to
exist as of the Effective Time and, subject to Section 2.03, (i) each
certificate previously representing any such Company Common Shares (each a
"Certificate") and (ii) each uncertificated Company Common Share represented
in book entry, including through Cede and Co., the nominee of the Depository
Trust Company (collectively, the "Uncertificated Shares"), that immediately
prior to the Effective Time was registered to a holder on the shareholder
register of the Company shall thereafter represent only the right to receive
(A) the Merger Consideration and (B) with respect to the Share Consideration,
the right to receive (1) any dividends or other distributions pursuant to
Section 2.03(g) and (2) any cash in lieu of any fractional Parent Registered
Shares pursuant to Section 2.06, in each case to be issued or paid in
accordance with Section 2.03, without interest. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 2.03 Exchange and Payment. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall
appoint a Person authorized to act as exchange agent in connection with the
Transactions, which Person shall be selected by Parent and the Company (the
"Exchange Agent") and shall act on behalf of the holders of Company Common
Shares entitled to the Merger Consideration, and enter into an exchange agent
agreement with the Exchange Agent reasonably acceptable to Parent and the
Company for the purpose of (i) exchanging Certificates or Uncertificated
Shares for the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Company Common
Shares and (ii) effecting the contribution in kind of newly issued shares of
HoldCo to Parent against the issuance of new Parent Registered Shares, as
contemplated by Section 2.01(b) of each of the Company Disclosure Letter and
the Parent Disclosure Letter. As of the Effective Time, or as otherwise
contemplated by Section 2.01(b) of each of the Company Disclosure Letter and
the Parent Disclosure Letter, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent,
for the benefit of the holders of Company

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t19  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

Common Shares, as consideration for the deliveries by the Exchange Agent
pursuant to Section 2.01(b) of each of the Company Disclosure Letter and the
Parent Disclosure Letter, and for exchange in accordance with this Section
2.03 through the Exchange Agent, (A) Parent Registered Shares issued pursuant
to Section 2.02(a), (B) cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Cash
Consideration payable pursuant to Section 2.02(a) and (C) the cash to be paid
in lieu of fractional shares. Parent agrees to promptly deposit with the
Exchange Agent from time to time any additional cash or Parent Registered
Shares required to pay any dividends or other distributions to which such
holders are entitled pursuant to Section 2.03(g). All Parent Registered
Shares and cash deposited with the Exchange Agent pursuant to this Section
2.03 shall be referred to as the "Exchange Fund". \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time,
the Exchange Agent shall mail or otherwise deliver to each holder of Company
Common Shares who has the right to receive the Merger Consideration hereunder:
(i) a letter of transmittal (the "Letter of Transmittal"), which shall specify
that, in respect of any Certificate, risk of loss and title shall pass only
upon receipt thereof (or of an affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) by the
Exchange Agent or, in the case of Uncertificated Shares, upon adherence to the
procedures set forth in the Letter of Transmittal, and shall be in such form
and have such other customary provisions as Parent and the Company may
reasonably specify, (ii) any notice required pursuant to the Cayman Companies
Law, and (iii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates held by any holder of Company Common Shares represented by
Certificates. In the event a holder of Company Common Shares does not deliver
to the Exchange Agent a duly executed and completed Letter of Transmittal and
does not deliver the Certificate(s) (or an affidavit of loss in lieu thereof),
where applicable, such Person shall not be entitled to receive the Merger
Consideration relating to such Certificate or Uncertificated Share unless and
until such Person delivers a duly executed and completed Letter of Transmittal
and Certificate(s) (or an affidavit loss in lieu thereof), as applicable, to
the Exchange Agent. Each Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall at any
time after the Effective Time represent only the right to receive, upon
compliance with these requirements, the Merger Consideration pursuant to
Section 2.02 and this Section 2.03. The delivery of a duly completed and
validly executed Letter of Transmittal is a condition to each holder of
Company Common Shares receiving any portion of the Merger Consideration. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) Upon the Exchange Agent's receipt of a duly executed and
completed Letter of Transmittal and the surrender of the Certificates (or an
affidavit loss in lieu thereof), as applicable, the Exchange Agent shall
deliver, in accordance with Section 2.02(a), to such holder of Company Common
Shares (i) the Merger Consideration and (ii) cash in lieu of any fractional
Parent Registered Shares and any dividends and distributions with respect to
the Share Consideration as contemplated in Section 2.06 or Section 2.03(g) for
each Company Common Share. The Parent Registered Shares constituting part of
such Merger Consideration shall be in uncertificated book entry form.
Following the Effective Time, each Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration. Parent, the
Company and the Exchange Agent may agree on transfer procedures in addition to
or different from the procedures set forth above in order to effect the
exchange and payment contemplated in this Section 2.03. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) If any portion of the Merger Consideration (or cash in lieu of
any fractional Parent Registered Shares or any dividends and distributions
with respect to the Share Consideration as contemplated by Section 2.06 or
Section 2.03(g)) is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name
the Company Common Share is registered, it shall be a condition to such
payment that (i) all documents reasonably requested by the Exchange Agent
shall be provided, and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to
the Exchange Agent any transfer or other Taxes required as a result of such
payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent
that such Tax has been paid or is not payable. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e) The Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of
this Article 2 upon conversion of any Company Common Shares shall be deemed to
have been delivered and paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
such Company Common Shares. From and after the Effective Time, subject to the
Cayman

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t20  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

Companies Law in the case of Dissenting Shares, all holders of Company Common
Shares shall cease to have any rights as shareholders of the Company other
than the right to receive the Merger Consideration (and cash in lieu of any
fractional Parent Registered Shares or any dividends and distributions with
respect to the Share Consideration as contemplated by Section 2.06 or Section
2.03(g)) into which the shares represented by such Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares have been converted pursuant to this Agreement. After
the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration or transfers of
Company Common Shares. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
former holders of Company Common Shares as of the one year anniversary of the
Effective Time shall be returned to Parent. Any former shareholders of the
Company who have not theretofore complied with this Article 2 or the Letter of
Transmittal and instructions shall thereafter look only to Parent (subject to
abandoned property, escheat or other similar Applicable Laws), as general
creditors thereof, for payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of each
Company Common Share as such shareholder held prior to the Effective Time as
determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any interest
thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing and anything to the contrary, none of
Parent, HoldCo, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Company, the Exchange
Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of Company
Common Shares for any amount delivered in good faith to a public official
pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, any portion of the Merger
Consideration to be paid in accordance with this Article 2 that remains
undistributed to any former holder of Company Common Shares, as of immediately
prior to the date on which the Merger Consideration that would otherwise
escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Authority, shall, to the
maximum extent permitted by Applicable Law, automatically become the property
of the Surviving Company, free and clear of all claims or interest of any
Person previously entitled thereto. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(g) Following the compliance by the holders of Company Common
Shares with the requirements of this Section 2.03, Parent shall pay, or cause
to be paid, without interest, to the Person in whose name the Parent
Registered Shares constituting the Share Consideration have been registered,
(i) in connection with the payment of the Share Consideration, (A) the amount
of any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares to which such Person is
entitled pursuant to Section 2.06, and (B) the aggregate amount of all
dividends or other distributions payable with respect to such Parent
Registered Shares with a record date on or after the Effective Time that were
paid prior to the time of such compliance, and (ii) at the appropriate payment
date after the payment of the Merger Consideration, the amount of all
dividends or other distributions payable with respect to whole Parent
Registered Shares constituting the Share Consideration with a record date on
or after the Effective Time and prior to the time of such compliance and with
a payment date subsequent to the time of such compliance. No dividends or
other distributions with respect to Parent Registered Shares constituting the
Share Consideration, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares pursuant
to Section 2.06, shall be paid to the holder of any Company Common Shares with
respect to such Company Common Shares prior to such holder's compliance with
the requirements of this Section 2.03. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(h) The payment of any transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration, value added and other Taxes and fees (including any penalties
and interest) incurred solely by a holder of Company Common Shares in
connection with the Merger, and the filing of any related Tax Returns and
other documentation with respect to such Taxes and fees, shall be the sole
responsibility of such holder. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 2.04 Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding Section 2.02, and
to the extent available under the Cayman Companies Law including following an
exercise of the drag-along rights set forth in Article 6 of the Company
Memorandum and Articles of Association in accordance with Section 6.06,
Company Common Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and
held by a holder who has validly exercised and not effectively withdrawn or
lost its rights to dissent from the Merger in accordance with Section 238 of
the Cayman Companies Law ("Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration. At the Effective Time, all
Dissenting Shares shall be canceled and cease to exist, and the holders of
Dissenting

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t21  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

Shares shall only be entitled to receive the payment of the fair value of such
Dissenting Shares held by them in accordance with the provisions of Section
238 of the Cayman Companies Law. If, after the Effective Time, such holder
fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or otherwise loses the right to
appraisal with respect to such shares, in any case pursuant to the Cayman
Companies Law, such shares shall be treated as if they had been converted as
of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. The
Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice (and in any event within two
Business Days) of any notices of objection, notices of approval, notices of
dissent, demands for appraisal or demands for fair value or written offers
under Section 238 of the Cayman Companies Law received by the Company,
attempted withdrawals of such notices or demands or offers and any other
instruments served pursuant to Applicable Law of the Cayman Islands and
received by the Company relating to its shareholders' rights to dissent from
the Merger or fair value rights and (ii) the opportunity to direct all
communications, negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such notice
or demand for appraisal under the Cayman Companies Law. The Company shall
not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any offers or
payment with respect to any exercise by a shareholder of its rights to dissent
from the Merger or any demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any
such demands or approve any withdrawal of any such demands. In the event that
any written notices of objection to the Merger are served by any shareholders
of the Company pursuant to Section 238(2) of the Cayman Companies Law, the
Company shall serve written notice of the authorization of the Merger on such
shareholders pursuant to Section 238(4) of the Cayman Companies Law within 20
days of the approval of the Merger by shareholders of the Company at the
Company Shareholder Meeting. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 2.05 Adjustments. Without limiting or affecting any of
the provisions of Section 6.01 or Section 7.01, if, during the period between
the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the issued
and outstanding shares of the Company or Parent shall occur as a result of any
reclassification, recapitalization, share split (including reverse share
split), merger, combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, subdivision
or other similar transaction, or any share dividend thereon with a record date
during such period, the Merger Consideration and any other amounts payable
pursuant to this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted to eliminate the
effect of such event on the Merger Consideration or any such other amounts
payable pursuant to this Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 2.06 Fractional Shares. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, no fractional Parent Registered Shares shall be
issued in the Merger. All fractional Parent Registered Shares that a holder
of Company Common Shares would otherwise be entitled to receive as a result of
the Merger shall be aggregated and, if a fractional share results from such
aggregation, such holder shall be entitled to receive, in lieu thereof, an
amount in cash, without interest, determined by multiplying the Parent Share
Price by the fraction of a share of Parent Registered Shares to which such
holder would otherwise have been entitled. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 2.07 Withholding Rights. Each of the Exchange Agent,
Parent and the Surviving Company shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as
it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under any provision of any Applicable Law, including U.S. federal,
state, local or non-U.S. Tax law. If the Exchange Agent, Parent or the
Surviving Company, as the case may be, so withholds and pays over any amounts
so withheld to the appropriate Taxing Authority, such amounts shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in
respect of which the Exchange Agent, Parent or the Surviving Company, as the
case may be, made such deduction and withholding. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 2.08 Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by the Surviving Company, Parent or the Exchange Agent, the
posting by such Person of a bond, in such amount as the Surviving Company,
Parent or the Exchange Agent may determine is reasonably necessary, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent (or if subsequent to the termination of the
Exchange Fund and subject to Section 2.03(f), Parent) will pay, in exchange

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t22  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration be
paid in respect of the Company Common Shares represented by such Certificate,
as contemplated by this Article 2. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 2.09 Fair Value. Parent, HoldCo, Merger Sub and the
Company agree that the Merger Consideration represents the fair value (or more
than the fair value) of the Company Common Shares for the purposes of Section
238(8) of the Cayman Companies Law. \t\t

out in the Plan of Merger until their successors have been duly elected and
qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal. \t\t

exempted company incorporated with limited liability, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the Cayman Islands and has all corporate power
and authority required to carry on its business as now conducted. The Company
is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good
standing (in jurisdictions where such concept exists) in each jurisdiction
where such qualification is necessary, except for those jurisdictions where
failure to be so qualified or in good standing has not had, and would not

Adverse Effect on the Company. Prior to the date of this Agreement, the
Company has made available to Parent a true, correct and complete copy of the
memorandum and articles of association of the Company as in effect on the date

material respects with (i) all applicable current listing and corporate
governance rules and regulations of the NASDAQ and (ii) all applicable rules,

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(g) The Company has established and maintains disclosure controls
and procedures required by Rule 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act.
Such disclosure controls and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that
material information relating to the Company, including its consolidated
Subsidiaries, required to be included in the Company's periodic and current
reports required under the Exchange Act is made known to the Company's
principal executive officer and its principal financial officer by others
within those entities, particularly during the periods in which the periodic
reports required under the Exchange Act are being prepared. For the purposes
of this Agreement, "principal executive officer" and "principal financial
officer" shall have the meanings given to such terms in the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(h) Since January 1, 2013, the Company, under the supervision of
its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has
established and maintained a system of internal control over financial
reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f), as applicable, under the
Exchange Act) ("internal controls"). Such internal controls are reasonably
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of the
Company's financial reporting and the preparation of the Company's financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. The Company has
disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation of internal controls prior to
the date of this Agreement, to the Company's auditors and audit committee of
the Company Board (i) all "significant deficiencies" and "material weaknesses"
(as such terms are defined by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board)
in the design or operation of internal controls which are reasonably likely to
adversely affect in any material respect the Company's ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information and (ii) any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in the Company's internal controls. The Company has made
available to Parent prior to the date of this Agreement a summary of any such
disclosure made by management to the Company's auditors and audit committee of
the Company Board since January 1, 2013. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i) There are no outstanding loans or other extensions of credit,
including in the form of a personal loan (within the meaning of Section 402 of

Sarbanes-Oxley Act, taken any action prohibited by Section 402 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(j) Since January 1, 2013, each of the principal executive officer
and principal financial officer of the Company (or each former principal
executive officer and principal financial officer of the Company, as
applicable) have made all applicable certifications required by Rule 13a-14
and 15d-14 under the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act, and the statements contained in any such certifications were, when
made, complete and correct. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(k) Since January 1, 2013, no Executive Officer or director of the
Company has received from any former or current auditor, accountant,
consultant or representative of the Company or any Governmental Authority,
written notice of any material complaint or allegation, whether written or
oral, that the Company has engaged in material

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t27  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

improper accounting practices. No attorney representing the Company has
reported to the current Company Board or any committee thereof or to any
current director or Executive Officer of the Company evidence of a material
violation of U.S. or other securities laws or material breach of fiduciary
duty by the Company or any of its officers or directors. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(l) To the Company's knowledge, no employee of the Company is
providing, or since January 1, 2013 has provided, information to any law
enforcement agency regarding any conduct which the employee reasonably
believes constitutes a violation of, nor filed, caused to be filed, testified,
participated in, or otherwise assisted in a Proceeding relating to an alleged
material violation of, chapter 63 of title 18, U.S. Code, sections 1341, 1343,
1344, or 1348, any rule or regulation of the SEC, or any provision of Federal
law relating to fraud against shareholders as described in Section 806 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act by the Company. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(m) Except for such items that are of the type to be set forth in
the notes to the consolidated financial statements of the Company, the Company
is not a party to any off-balance sheet contract or other "off-balance sheet
arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K of the SEC),
where the result, purpose or intended effect of such contract is to avoid
disclosure of any material transaction involving, or material liabilities of,
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in the Company SEC Documents. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 4.08 Financial Statements and Financial Matters. The
consolidated financial statements (including all related notes and schedules)
of the Company included in or incorporated by reference into the Company SEC

disclosure) applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except
as may be indicated therein or in the notes thereto), and (iii) have been
prepared from and are in accordance with the books and records of the Company
and its Subsidiaries. The books and records of the Company and its
Subsidiaries have been, and are being, maintained in all material respects in
accordance with GAAP and any other applicable legal and accounting
requirements. As of the date of this Agreement, Ernst Young (Hellas)

Statement/Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto is first mailed to
the shareholders of the Company and the shareholders of Parent and at the time
of the Company Shareholder Meeting and the Parent Shareholder Meeting, contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries and Joint Venture
Affiliates operates each Company Fleet Asset, as applicable, in compliance

Company. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries and Joint Venture
Affiliates are qualified in all material respects to own and operate the
Company Fleet Assets, as set forth on Section 4.10(a) of the Company
Disclosure Letter, under Applicable Law, including the Applicable Laws of each

has occurred and no condition exists that would cause such Company Fleet
Asset's class to be suspended or withdrawn, and is duly and lawfully
documented under the laws of its flag jurisdiction. \t\t

will after the date of this Agreement and prior to the earlier of the Closing
Date and the termination of this Agreement, duly performed in all material
respects all of their respective obligations under the Derivative Transactions

Subsidiaries has been conducted in the ordinary course consistent with past

the aggregate, result in, or would be reasonably likely to result in,
liabilities to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Joint Venture
Affiliates in excess of $1,000,000. As of the date of this Agreement, there

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(xxiii) any contract guaranteeing the performance of any Third

 \t\t

 \t\t\tAll contracts of the types referred to in clauses (i) through (xxiii)

received any written notice of the intention of any other party to a Company

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries will be

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(m) The charges, accruals and reserves for Taxes with respect to
the Company and its Subsidiaries reflected in each of the consolidated balance
sheets included in or incorporated by reference into the Company Balance Sheet
(including the related notes and schedules) are adequate under GAAP to cover
unpaid Tax liabilities accruing through the date thereof. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 4.20 Employee Benefit Plans. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) Section 4.20(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter contains a
true, correct and complete list separately identifying each Company Non-U.S.
Employee Plan and each Company U.S. Employee Plan (each a "Company Employee
Plan"). The Company has delivered or made available to Parent true, correct
and complete copies, together with all amendments, of each Company Employee
Plan (and a written description of each unwritten Company Employee Plan), and,
as applicable, all current trust agreements, insurance and group annuity
contracts and other documents establishing other funding arrangements,
together with all amendments thereto, and the two most recent annual financial
statements and actuarial valuation reports thereof. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Each Company Employee Plan has been administered in accordance
with its terms and is in compliance with all Applicable Laws, except for
instances that would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t35  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) (i) Each Company Employee Plan that is intended to qualify for
favorable Tax benefits under the Applicable Laws of any jurisdiction has, to
the knowledge of the Company, been operated and maintained in a manner to
remain so qualified, and (ii) to the knowledge of the Company no condition
exists and no event has occurred that could reasonably be expected to result
in the loss or revocation of such status. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has incurred any obligation in connection with the termination or
wind-up of, or withdrawal from, any Company U.S. Employee Plan that is a
"pension plan" as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA or any Company Non-U.S.
Retirement Plan, and, to the knowledge of the Company, no condition exists and
no event has occurred that would reasonably be expected to constitute grounds
under Applicable Laws to terminate, wind-up or appoint a trustee to administer
any such Company U.S. Employee Plan or Company Non-U.S. Retirement Plan. To
the knowledge of the Company, all benefits, contributions and premiums
relating to each Company Employee Plan have been timely paid or made in
accordance with the terms of such Company Employee Plan and the terms of all
Applicable Laws and no request by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has
been made to waive or defer payment of any benefits, contributions or premiums
that would otherwise be required to be made to any Company Employee Plan. No
claim, action, litigation, proceeding, audit, examination, investigation or
administrative proceeding has been made, commenced or, to the knowledge of the
Company, threatened with respect to any Company Employee Plan (other than
routine claims for benefits payable in the ordinary course) that would
reasonably be expected to result in a material liability of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries. Neither the Company, nor, to the knowledge of the
Company, any other Person has engaged in any prohibited transaction with any
Company Employee Plan that could reasonably be expected to give rise to any
material Tax or penalty for which the Company could reasonably be expected to
incur any material liability. Except to the extent it would not reasonably be
expected to result in a material liability to the Company and its
Subsidiaries, individually or in the aggregate, all required consents and
releases necessary or desirable in connection with the amendment, modification
or termination of any Company Employee Plan (or any plan, program or
arrangement that would be a Company Employee Plan if it had not been amended,
modified or terminated), have been validly obtained and are fully effective.
With respect to each Company Employee Plan, no event has occurred and no
condition or circumstance has existed that could result in an increase in the
benefits under or the expense of maintaining any such Company Employee Plan
from the level of benefits or expense incurred for the most recent fiscal year
ended thereof, except for any such increase as would not be material to the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. No Company Employee Plan has
assets that include securities issued by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. No Company Employee Plan provides for the payment of material
severance, termination, change in control or similar-type payments or
benefits. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) Except as would not result in any material liability to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, each Company Employee Plan which is a
"nonqualified deferred compensation plan" (within the meaning of Section 409A
of the Code) that the Company is a party to with any employee subject to U.S.
income Tax either is not subject to the provisions of Section 409A of the Code
or has been operated and administered in compliance in all material respects
with Section 409A of the Code. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e) Except as would not reasonably be expected to result in any
material liability to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, each Company
U.S. Employee Plan that is a "group health plan" as defined in Section
733(a)(1) of ERISA (a "Company Health Plan") (i) is currently in compliance
with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Pub. L. No. 111-148
("PPACA") and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, Pub.
L. No. 111-152 ("HCERA" and together with PPACA, the "Healthcare Reform
Laws"), and (ii) has been in compliance in all material respects with all
applicable Healthcare Reform Laws since January 1, 2012; and, to the knowledge
of the Company, no event has occurred, and no condition or circumstance
exists, that would reasonably be expected to subject the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries, or any Company Health Plan to penalties or excise taxes under
Sections 4980D, 4980H, or 4980I of the Code. Neither the Company nor any of
its ERISA Affiliates has incurred or expects to incur any material liability
(including additional contributions, fines, taxes or penalties) as a result of
a failure to administer or operate any Company U.S. Employee Plan that is a
"group health plan" (as

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t36  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

such term is defined in Section 607(1) of ERISA or Section 5000(b)(1) of the
Code) in compliance with the applicable requirements of Part 6 of Subtitle B
of Title I of ERISA or Section 4980B of the Code ("COBRA"). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(f) None of the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has, within
the preceding six year period, ever maintained or contributed to, or had any
obligation to contribute to, any material Company U.S. Employee Plan. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(g) None of the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred,
and no Circumstance exists that would reasonably be expected to result in, any
unsatisfied liability of the Company and its Subsidiaries under Title IV of
ERISA or Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA arising in connection
with any Company U.S. Employee Plan covered or previously covered by Title IV
of ERISA or such Sections 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA. No Company
U.S. Employee Plan is a "multiple employer plan" (within the meaning of the
Code or ERISA). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(h) The present value of the accrued benefit liabilities
attributable to employees and former employees of the Company and for which
the Company is or may be liable under each Company Non-U.S. Employee Plan that
provides pension, retirement or other similar benefits (each, a "Company
Non-U.S. Retirement Plan"), determined as of the end of the most recently
ended fiscal year of the Company, on the basis of actuarial assumptions, each
of which is reasonable, did not exceed the current value of the assets of such
Company Non-U.S. Retirement Plan allocable to such benefit liabilities. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i) No Company Employee Plan provides for post-employment or
retiree health, life insurance and/or other welfare benefits, and the Company
does not have any obligation to provide any such benefits to any retired or
former employees or active employees following such employees' retirement or
termination of service, other than any such plan the cost of which is borne by
the employee. There are no liabilities of the Company with respect to any
Company Employee Plan that are not properly accrued and reflected in the
financial statements in accordance with applicable accounting rules. No
condition or circumstance exists that would prevent the amendment or
termination of any Company Employee Plan. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(j) The execution of, and performance of, the Transactions will
not (either alone or upon the occurrence of any additional or subsequent
events) (i) constitute an event under any Company Employee Plan that will or
may result in any payment (whether of severance pay or otherwise),
acceleration, forgiveness of indebtedness, vesting, distribution, increase in
benefits or obligation to fund benefits with respect to any employee or
consultant of the Company and its Subsidiaries or trigger the right of any
employee to terminate any employment relationship with the Company and its
Subsidiaries, or (ii) result in the triggering or imposition of any
restrictions or limitations on the right of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to amend or terminate any Company Employee Plan. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 4.21 Labor Matters. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) The Company and the Subsidiaries are in compliance in all
material respects with all Applicable Laws relating to employment and

Since January 1, 2013, no Governmental Authority nor any Person has initiated
or sought to maintain or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened to
initiate a Proceeding against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (i) to
the effect that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has misclassified
employees or independent contractors, and the Company and its Subsidiaries
have not misclassified, any Person as (A) an independent contractor rather
than as an employee or (B) an employee exempt from overtime regulations, or
(ii) with respect to a material violation of Labor Laws. The

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t37  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

Company and its Subsidiaries have paid or properly accrued all wages and other
compensation due to all employees and independent contractor, including all
overtime pay, vacations or paid time off (or vacation paid time off pay),
holidays or holiday pay, sick days or sick pay, commissions, bonuses, and
incentive compensation. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is liable for
any payments to any Governmental Authority, other than Taxes and routine
payments to be made in the ordinary course of business. All Persons who are
performing services for the Company or any of its Subsidiaries are legally-
authorized to work in the jurisdiction where such Persons perform work and the
Company and its Subsidiaries maintain appropriate records documenting this
authorization for all such Persons. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to,
or otherwise bound by, any collective bargaining agreement, contract or other
agreement or understanding with a labor union, works council, employee
representative or other labor organization (a "Labor Contract"). Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any charge, demand, petition
or representation Proceeding seeking to compel, require or demand it to
bargain with any labor union, works council, employee representative or other
labor organization (a "Labor Union") nor is there pending or, to the knowledge
of the Company, threatened, any labor strike, slowdown, stoppage, dispute or
lockout involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in any unfair labor practice with
respect to any Persons employed by or otherwise performing services primarily
for the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and there is no unfair labor
practice complaint, grievance or other similar Proceeding against the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries initiated by or pending before any Governmental
Authority or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened with respect to
Persons employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. No Labor Union
represents or purports to represent any Person employed by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any
legal duty to recognize, negotiate or bargain with any Labor Union or employee
or notify any Labor Union or employee in connection with the contemplated
transaction. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) The Company and its Subsidiaries are in compliance in all
material respects with all Applicable Laws relating to worker health and
safety. Since January 1, 2013, (i) no allegations of harassment,
discrimination or retaliation have been made against any director or Executive
Officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) no material
allegations of harassment, discrimination or retaliation have been made
against Persons engaged in the hiring or supervision of Persons employed by or
seeking employment with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (whether as
employees or independent contractors) and (iii) neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries has entered into any material settlement agreement related to
allegations of harassment, discrimination, retaliation or sexual misconduct by
an employee, contractor, director, officer or other Representative of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) Since January 1, 2013, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has effectuated a plant closing, a mass layoff, mass redundancy
or termination on economic grounds, nor has the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries engaged in layoffs or employment terminations sufficient in
number to trigger application of any Applicable Law. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 4.22 Intellectual Property. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) Section 4.22(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a
true, correct and complete list of all registered trademarks and applications
to register trademarks, Internet domain names, patents and patent applications
and registered copyrights and applications to register copyrights owned by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Registered Intellectual

registration number or application serial number, the jurisdiction and the
recorded owner for each listed item. The Registered Intellectual Property
Rights are subsisting, and to the knowledge of the Company, valid and
enforceable. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries owns, or is licensed to
use (in each case, free and clear of

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t38  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

any Liens), all material Intellectual Property used in or necessary for the
conduct of its business as currently conducted. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Neither Company nor its Subsidiaries has infringed,
misappropriated or otherwise violated the Intellectual Property rights of any
Person in any material respect. To the knowledge of the Company, no Person
has challenged, infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated any
Intellectual Property right owned by or licensed to the Company or its
Subsidiaries in any material respect. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received any written notice or otherwise has knowledge of any
pending Proceeding with respect to any Intellectual Property used by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or alleging that any services provided,
processes used or equipment manufactured, used, imported, offered for sale or
sold by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries infringes, misappropriates or
otherwise violates any Intellectual Property rights of any Person. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) The consummation of the Transactions will not alter, encumber,
impair or extinguish any Intellectual Property right of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or impair the right of Parent to develop, use, sell, exploit,
license or dispose of, or to bring any action for the infringement or
misappropriation of, any Intellectual Property right of the Company or any of

as of the date such registration statement or amendment became effective, did
not, and any Parent SEC Document that is a registration statement filed
subsequent to the date of this Agreement will not, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(f) Parent has complied in all material respects with (i) all
current listing and corporate governance rules and regulations of the NYSE and
(ii) all rules, regulations and requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(g) Parent has established and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures required by Rule 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act.
Such disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that material
information relating to Parent, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, is
made known to Parent's principal executive officer and its principal financial
officer by others within such entities, particularly during the periods in
which the periodic reports required under the Exchange Act are prepared. Such
disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting Parent's
principal executive officer and principal financial officer to material
information required to be included in Parent's periodic and current reports
required under the Exchange Act. For the purposes of this Agreement,
"principal executive officer" and "principal financial officer" shall have the
meanings given to such terms in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(h) Since January 1, 2013, Parent, under the supervision of its
principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has established
and maintained internal controls. Such internal controls are sufficient to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of Parent's financial
reporting and the preparation of Parent's financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with GAAP. Parent has disclosed, based on its most
recent evaluation of internal controls prior to the date of this Agreement, to
Parent's auditors and audit committee of the Parent Board (i) all "significant
deficiencies" and "material weaknesses" (as such terms are defined by the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board) in the design or operation of
internal controls which are reasonably likely to adversely affect in any
material respect Parent's ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in Parent's
internal controls. Parent has made available to the Company prior to the date
of this Agreement a summary of any such disclosure made by management to
Parent's auditors and audit committee of the Parent Board since January 1,
2016. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i) There are no outstanding loans or other extensions of credit,
including in the form of a personal loan (within the meaning of Section 402 of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act), made by Parent to any Executive Officer or director
of Parent. Parent has not, since the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act,
taken any action prohibited by Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(j) Since January 1, 2013, each of the principal executive officer
and principal financial officer of Parent (or each former principal executive
officer and principal financial officer of Parent, as applicable) have made
all certifications required by Rule 13a-14 and 15d-14 under the Exchange Act
and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the statements
contained in any such certifications were, when made, complete and
correct. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(k) Since January 1, 2013, no Executive Officer or director of
Parent has received from any former or current auditor, accountant, consultant
or representative of Parent or any Governmental Authority, written notice of,
any material complaint or allegation, whether written or oral, that Parent has
engaged in material improper

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t46  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

accounting practices. No attorney representing Parent has reported to the
current Parent Board or any committee thereof or to any current director or
Executive Officer of Parent evidence of a material violation of U.S. or other
securities laws or material breach of fiduciary duty by Parent or any of its
officers or directors. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(l) To Parent's knowledge, no employee of Parent is providing, or
since January 1, 2013 has provided, information to any law enforcement agency
regarding any conduct which the employee reasonably believes constitutes a
violation of, nor filed, caused to be filed, testified, participated in, or
otherwise assisted in a Proceeding relating to an alleged material violation
of, chapter 63 of title 18, U.S. Code, sections 1341, 1343, 1344, or 1348, any
rule or regulation of the SEC, or any provision of Federal law relating to
fraud against shareholders as described in Section 806 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act by Parent. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(m) Except for such items that are of the type to be set forth in
the notes to the consolidated financial statements of Parent, Parent is not a
party to any off-balance sheet contract or other "off-balance sheet
arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K of the SEC),
where the result, purpose or intended effect of such contract is to avoid
disclosure of any material transaction involving, or material liabilities of,
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in the Parent SEC Documents. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 5.08 Financial Statements and Financial Matters. The
consolidated financial statements (including all related notes and schedules)
of Parent included in or incorporated by reference into the Parent SEC
Documents (i) fairly present in all material respects the consolidated
financial position of Parent, as of the respective dates thereof, and the
consolidated results of its operations and its consolidated cash flows for the
respective periods then ended, (ii) were prepared in conformity with GAAP
(except, in the case of the unaudited statements, subject to normal year-end
audit adjustments and the absence of footnote disclosure, the effect of which
shall not be material) applied on a consistent basis during the periods
involved (except as may be indicated therein or in the notes thereto), and
(iii) have been prepared from and are in accordance with, in all material
respects, the books and records of Parent and its Subsidiaries. The books and
records of Parent and its Subsidiaries have been, and are being, maintained in
all material respects in accordance with GAAP and any other applicable legal
and accounting requirements. As of the date of this Agreement, Ernst and Young
LLP has not resigned (or informed Parent that it intends to resign) or been
dismissed as independent public accountants of Parent as a result of or in
connection with any disagreements with Parent on a matter of accounting
principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or
procedure. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 5.09 Fleet Assets. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) Section 5.09(a) of the Parent Disclosure Letter sets forth a
true, correct and complete list of all drilling units and vessels owned by
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (the "Parent Fleet Assets"), including, as
applicable with respect to each Parent Fleet Asset: the name, registered
owner, capacity (gross tonnage or deadweight tonnage, as specified therein),
year built, classification society, class, IMO number, flag state, and whether
any such Parent Fleet Asset is "cold stacked," "warm stacked" or is being
prepared to be "cold stacked" or "warm stacked." Neither Parent nor any of
its Subsidiaries leases or charters-in any drilling units or vessels. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Parent or its Subsidiaries has good and marketable title to
the Parent Fleet Assets, as set forth on Section 5.09(a) of the Parent
Disclosure Letter, in each case free and clear of all Liens other than any
Permitted Liens and no such Parent Fleet Asset or any related asset is leased
under an operating lease from a lessor that, to Parent's knowledge, has
incurred non-recourse indebtedness to finance the acquisition or construction
of such Parent Fleet Asset. Parent has made available to the Company true,
correct and complete copies of all current class status reports from the
relevant class societies relating to Parent Fleet Assets. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) To the extent consistent with its operating status, each
Parent Fleet Asset has been maintained consistent with general practice in the
offshore drilling industry and is in good operating condition and repair,

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t47  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

subject to ordinary wear and tear. To the extent consistent with its
operating status, each Parent Fleet Asset is seaworthy, has all material
national and international operating certificates and endorsements, each of
which is valid, that are required for the operation of such Parent Fleet Asset
in the trades and geographic areas in which it is operated. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) Parent and each of its Subsidiaries operates each Parent Fleet
Asset, as applicable, in compliance with all Applicable Law and Maritime
Guidelines, except where such failure to be in compliance has not had and
would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Parent and each of its Subsidiaries are
qualified in all material respects to own and operate the Parent Fleet Assets,
as set forth on Section 5.09(a) of the Parent Disclosure Letter, under
Applicable Law, including the Applicable Laws of each Parent Fleet Asset's
flag state. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e) To the extent consistent with its operating status, each
Parent Fleet Asset is classed by a classification society which is a member of
the International Association of Classification Societies and possesses class
certificates free from overdue conditions affecting class and valid through
the date of this Agreement, and, to Parent's knowledge no event has occurred
and no condition exists that would cause such Parent Fleet Asset's class to be
suspended or withdrawn, and is duly and lawfully documented under the laws of
its flag jurisdiction. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 5.10 Disclosure Documents. The information relating to
Parent and its Subsidiaries that is provided by Parent, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Registration Statement or the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus will not (a) in the case of the Registration Statement,
at the time the Registration Statement or any amendment or supplement thereto
becomes effective and at the time of the Company Shareholder Meeting and the
Parent Shareholder Meeting, and (b) in the case of the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, at the time the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or any
amendment or supplement thereto is first mailed to the shareholders of the
Company and the shareholders of Parent and at the time of the Company
Shareholder Meeting and Parent Shareholder Meeting, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in
order to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 5.11 Taxes. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) (i) All material Tax Returns required by Applicable Law to be
filed with any Taxing Authority by, or on behalf of, Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries have been filed when due (taking into account extensions) in
accordance with Applicable Law, and all such material Tax Returns were, at the
time of filing, accurate and complete in all material respects, and (ii) each
of Parent and its Subsidiaries has paid (or has had paid on its behalf) all
Taxes shown as due and payable on such Tax Returns and all material Taxes
otherwise due and payable, except for any such Taxes (A) contested in good
faith or (B) for which adequate reserves have been established under GAAP.
Parent has sought and obtained advice from external advisors concerning its
Tax filing obligations and Tax compliance policies in all relevant material
jurisdictions. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) As of the date of this Agreement, (i) there is no Proceeding
now pending or threatened in writing by any Taxing Authority against Parent or
its Subsidiaries in respect of any material Tax, (ii) no deficiencies for any
material Taxes have been proposed, asserted or assessed against Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries, and (iii) no requests for waivers of the time to assess
any such Taxes are pending or have been granted. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has distributed
stock of another Person, or has had its stock distributed by another Person,
in a transaction intended to be governed by Section 355 of the Code (i) within
the past three years or (ii) in a transaction that could otherwise constitute
part of a "plan" or "series of related transactions" (within the meaning of
Section 355(e) of the Code) that includes the Transactions. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t48  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries will be required to
include any material item of income in, or exclude any material item of
deduction from, Taxable income for any Taxable period (or portion thereof)
ending after the Effective Time as a result of any (i) "closing agreement" as
described in Section 7121 of the Code (or any corresponding or similar
provision of state, local or non-U.S. income Tax law) executed on or prior to
the Effective Time, (ii) installment sale or open transaction disposition made
on or prior to the Effective Time, (iii) prepaid amount received on or prior
to the Effective Time, (iv) intercompany item under Treasury Regulation
Section 1.1502-13, (v) change in accounting method for a Taxable period ending
on or before the Effective Time, or (vi) election under Section 108(i) of the
Code (or any corresponding or similar provision of state, local or non-U.S.
income Tax law). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e) Parent has not requested, received or executed with any Taxing
Authority any ruling or binding agreement which could have a material adverse
effect in a post-Closing period. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(f) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries (i) is a member of
any group that files an affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary Tax
Return (other than a group of which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is the
common parent), (ii) was a member of any group that filed an affiliated,
consolidated, combined or unitary Tax Return (other than a group of which
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is the common parent) for a Tax year during
which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries was a member and that remains open
under any applicable statute of limitations, or (iii) has any liability for
the Taxes of another Person under Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6 (or
any corresponding or similar provision of state, local or non-U.S. income Tax
law), as a transferee or successor or otherwise. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(g) Parent and each of its Subsidiaries have withheld and paid to
the appropriate Taxing Authorities all material Taxes required to be withheld
and paid by them on payments to any employee, independent contractor,
shareholder, creditor, customer or other third party. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(h) There are no material Liens for Taxes on or pending against
any assets of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries other than Permitted
Liens. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i) No claim has been made in writing by any Taxing Authority in a
jurisdiction where Parent or Parent's Subsidiaries do not file Tax Returns
that Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is or may be subject to Taxation by, or
required to file any Tax Return in, that jurisdiction. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(j) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any
Tax Sharing Agreement, but excluding any Tax Sharing Agreement entered into in
the ordinary course of business and any such agreement the principal purpose
of which does not relate to Taxes. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(k) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has a permanent
establishment in any country other than (i) the country of its formation or
(ii) any country in which it files a Tax Return. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(l) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is or has been a
party to any "reportable transaction," as defined in Section 6707A(c)(1) of
the Code and Treasury Regulations Section 1.6011-4(b)(1). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(m) The charges, accruals and reserves for Taxes with respect to
Parent and its Subsidiaries reflected in each of the consolidated balance
sheets included in or incorporated by reference into the Parent Balance Sheet
(including the related notes and schedules) are adequate under GAAP to cover
unpaid Tax liabilities accruing through the date thereof. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 5.12 Employee Benefit Plans. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t49  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) Section 5.12(a) of the Parent Disclosure Letter contains a
true, correct and complete list separately identifying each Parent Non-U.S.
Employee Plan and each Parent U.S. Employee Plan (each a "Parent Employee
Plan"). Parent has delivered or made available to the Company true, correct
and complete copies, together with all amendments, of each Parent Employee
Plan that would be required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 601(b)(10) of
Regulation S-K. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Each Parent Employee Plan has been administered in accordance
with its terms and is in compliance with all Applicable Laws, except for
instances that would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) (i) Each Parent Employee Plan that is intended to qualify for
favorable Tax benefits under the Applicable Laws of any jurisdiction has, to
the knowledge of Parent, been operated and maintained in a manner to remain so
qualified, and (ii) to the knowledge of Parent no condition exists and no
event has occurred that could reasonably be expected to result in the loss or
revocation of such status. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has
incurred any obligation in connection with the termination or wind-up of, or
withdrawal from, any Parent U.S. Employee Plan that is a "pension plan" as
defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA or any Parent Retirement Plan, and, to the
knowledge of Parent, no condition exists and no event has occurred that would
reasonably be expected to constitute grounds under Applicable Laws to
terminate, wind-up or appoint a trustee to administer any such Parent U.S.
Employee Plan or Parent Retirement Plan. To the knowledge of Parent, all
benefits, contributions and premiums relating to each Parent Employee Plan
have been timely paid or made in accordance with the terms of such Parent
Employee Plan and the terms of all Applicable Laws and no request by Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries has been made to waive or defer payment of any
benefits, contributions or premiums that would otherwise be required to be
made to any Parent Employee Plan. No claim, action, litigation, proceeding,
audit, examination, investigation or administrative proceeding has been made,
commenced or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened with respect to any
Parent Employee Plan (other than routine claims for benefits payable in the
ordinary course) that would reasonably be expected to result in a material
liability of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries. Neither Parent, nor, to the
knowledge of Parent, any other Person has engaged in any prohibited
transaction with any Parent Employee Plan that could reasonably be expected to
give rise to any material Tax or penalty for which Parent could reasonably be
expected to incur any material liability. Except to the extent it would not
reasonably be expected to result in a material liability to Parent and its
Subsidiaries, individually or in the aggregate, all required consents and
releases necessary or desirable in connection with the amendment, modification
or termination of any Parent Employee Plan (or any plan, program or
arrangement that would be a Parent Employee Plan if it had not been amended,
modified or terminated), have been validly obtained and are fully effective.
With respect to each Parent Employee Plan, no event has occurred and no
condition or circumstance has existed that could result in an increase in the
benefits under or the expense of maintaining any such Parent Employee Plan
from the level of benefits or expense incurred for the most recent fiscal year
ended thereof, except for any such increase as would not be material to Parent
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. No Parent Employee Plan has assets
that include securities issued by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries. No
Parent Employee Plan provides for the payment of severance, termination,
change in control or similar-type payments or benefits. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) Except as would not result in any material liability to Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries, each Parent Employee Plan which is a "nonqualified
deferred compensation plan" (within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code)
that Parent is a party to with any employee subject to U.S. income Tax either
is not subject to the provisions of Section 409A of the Code or has been
operated and administered in compliance in all material respects with Section
409A of the Code. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e) Except as would not reasonably be expected to result in any
material liability to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, each Parent U.S.
Employee Plan that is a "group health plan" as defined in Section 733(a)(1) of
ERISA (a "Parent Health Plan") (i) is currently in compliance with the
Healthcare Reform Laws, and (ii) has been in compliance in all material
respects with all applicable Healthcare Reform Laws since January 1, 2012;
and, to

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t50  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

the knowledge of Parent, no event has occurred, and no condition or
circumstance exists, that would reasonably be expected to subject Parent, any
of its Subsidiaries, or any Parent Health Plan to penalties or excise taxes
under Sections 4980D, 4980H, or 4980I of the Code. Neither Parent nor any of
its ERISA Affiliates has incurred or expects to incur any material liability
(including additional contributions, fines, taxes or penalties) as a result of
a failure to administer or operate any Parent U.S. Employee Plan that is a
"group health plan" (as such term is defined in Section 607(1) of ERISA or
Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code) in compliance with the applicable requirements
of COBRA. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(f) None of Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has, within the
preceding six year period, ever maintained or contributed to, or had any
obligation to contribute to, any Parent U.S. Employee Plan. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(g) None of Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred, and
no Circumstance exists that would reasonably be expected to result in, any
unsatisfied liability of Parent and its Subsidiaries under Title IV of ERISA
or Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA arising in connection with
any Parent U.S. Employee Plan covered or previously covered by Title IV of
ERISA or such Sections 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA. No Parent
U.S. Employee Plan is a "multiple employer plan" (within the meaning of the
Code or ERISA). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(h) The present value of the accrued benefit liabilities
attributable to employees and former employees of Parent and for which Parent
is or may be liable under each Parent Employee Plan that provides pension,
retirement or other similar benefits (each, a "Parent Retirement Plan"),
determined as of the end of the most recently ended fiscal year of Parent, on
the basis of actuarial assumptions, each of which is reasonable, are funded at
no less than the minimum legally required level of each jurisdiction in which
the plan is registered and are properly reflected by adequate reserves
included in the consolidated financial statements of Parent included in or
incorporated by reference into the Parent SEC Documents. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i) No Parent Employee Plan provides for post-employment or
retiree health, life insurance and/or other welfare benefits, and Parent does
not have any obligation to provide any such benefits to any retired or former
employees or active employees following such employees' retirement or
termination of service, other than any such plan the cost of which is borne by
the employee. There are no liabilities of Parent with respect to any Parent
Employee Plan that are not properly accrued and reflected in the financial
statements in accordance with applicable accounting rules. No condition or
circumstance exists that would prevent the amendment or termination of any
Parent Employee Plan. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(j) The execution of, and performance of, the Transactions will
not (either alone or upon the occurrence of any additional or subsequent
events) (i) constitute an event under any Parent Employee Plan that will or
may result in any payment (whether of severance pay or otherwise),
acceleration, forgiveness of indebtedness, vesting, distribution, increase in
benefits or obligation to fund benefits with respect to any employee or
consultant of Parent and its Subsidiaries or trigger the right of any employee
to terminate any employment relationship with Parent and its Subsidiaries, or
(ii) result in the triggering or imposition of any restrictions or limitations
on the right of Parent any of its Subsidiaries to amend or terminate any
Parent Employee Plan. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 5.13 Absence of Certain Changes. Since the Parent Balance
Sheet Date until the date of this Agreement, there has not been any
Circumstance that has had, or would reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Since
the Parent Balance Sheet Date (a) the business of Parent and its Subsidiaries
has been conducted in the ordinary course consistent with past practice in all
material respects and (b) there has not been any action taken by Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries that, if taken without the Company's prior written consent
during the period from the date of this Agreement through the Effective Time,
would constitute a breach of Section 7.01. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 5.14 No Undisclosed Material Liabilities. There are no
liabilities or obligations of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, of any kind
whatsoever, whether accrued, contingent, absolute, determined, determinable or
otherwise, other than (a) liabilities or obligations disclosed and provided
for in the Parent Balance Sheet or in the notes thereto, (b) liabilities or
obligations incurred in connection with the Transactions, (c) liabilities or
obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice since the Parent Balance Sheet Date and which have not had, and would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on Parent, (d) liabilities or obligations that have
not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 5.15 Environmental Matters. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) (i) No material notice, notification, demand, request for
information, citation, summons, or order has been received by Parent or its
Subsidiaries and no material complaint has been filed, no penalty has been
assessed, and no material Proceeding is pending, unresolved in any respect or,
to the knowledge of Parent, is threatened by any Governmental Authority or
other Person, in each case relating to Parent or its Subsidiaries and relating
to or arising out of any Environmental Law or Environmental Permit; (ii) the
business and operations of Parent and its Subsidiaries are, and since January
1, 2013 have at all times been, in compliance in all material respects with
all Environmental Laws and all Environmental Permits; (iii) Parent and its
Subsidiaries have all material Environmental Permits necessary for the conduct
of their operations (including the occupation of relevant leases and
concessions), each Environmental Permit is in full force and effect in all
material respects and is final with all material administrative and statutory
appeal periods having expired, and all material required applications for
renewal or reissuance of such Environmental Permits have been timely filed;
(iv) there has been no Release that Parent or its Subsidiaries have been or
would be obligated to investigate, remove, remediate, or otherwise respond to
or pay any part of the costs of response pursuant to any Environmental Law or
any contract entered into with any other Person, or that would result in a
material liability to Parent or one of its Subsidiaries; (v) except to the
extent as would not result in a material liability to Parent or one of its
Subsidiaries, during the term of Parent's ownership or operation of any
facility or property now or, to the knowledge of Parent, previously owned,
leased, or operated by Parent or its Subsidiaries, there are and have been no
(A) underground storage tanks or related piping on, in, beneath or emanating
from or to any facility or property now or to the knowledge of Parent
previously owned, leased, or operated by Parent or its Subsidiaries, (B)
asbestos containing material in friable or damaged condition or (C) materials
or equipment coated with lead-based paint; and (vi) there are no past or
present facts, conditions or circumstances at, on or arising out of, or
otherwise associated with, any current (or, to the knowledge of Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries, former) businesses, assets or properties of Parent or any
of its Subsidiary which are reasonably likely to give rise under any
Environmental Law to material (A) costs, expenses, liabilities or obligations
related to any cleanup, remediation, investigation, disposal or corrective
action, (B) claims arising for personal injury, property damage or damage to
natural resources, or (C) fines, penalties or injunctive relief. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Since January 1, 2013, there has been no material
environmental investigation, study, audit, test, review, assessment, or other
analysis conducted of which Parent has knowledge, in relation to the current
or prior business of Parent or its Subsidiaries or any property or facility
now or previously owned, leased, or operated by Parent during the period since
January 1, 2013 to identify actual or potential liabilities or obligations of
Parent or its Subsidiaries arising under or relating to any Environmental Law
or Hazardous Substance or the presence of mold, asbestos, or lead paint that
has not been made available to Parent prior to the date of this
Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) For purposes of this Section 4.24, the terms "Parent" and
"Subsidiaries" shall include any entity that is, in whole or in part, a

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) General Prohibitions. Neither the Company nor any of its

It is agreed that any violation of the restrictions on the Company set forth
in Section 6.04 by any Representative of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall be a breach of Section 6.04 by the Company. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Exceptions. Notwithstanding Section 6.04(a), at any time
prior to the Company Shareholder Approval: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i) the Company, directly or indirectly through advisors, agents
or other intermediaries, may (A) engage in negotiations or discussions with
any Third Party and its Representatives that, subject to the Company's
compliance with Section 6.04(a), has made after the date of this Agreement a
bona fide, written Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board reasonably
believes will lead to a Superior Proposal and (B) furnish to such Third Party
or its Representatives or financing sources non-public information relating to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement; provided that all such information (to the extent
that such information has not been previously provided or made available to
Parent) is provided or made available to Parent, as the case may be, prior to
or substantially concurrently with the time it is provided or made available
to such Third Party; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(ii) Subject to compliance with Section 6.04(d), the Company Board
may make an Adverse Recommendation Change following receipt of a Superior
Proposal; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tin each case referred to in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) only if
the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside
legal counsel, that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under any Applicable Law. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tIn addition, nothing contained herein shall prevent the Company Board
from complying with Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act with regard to an
Acquisition Proposal so long as any action taken or statement made to so
comply is consistent with this Section 6.04; provided that any such action
taken or statement made that relates to an Acquisition Proposal shall be
deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change unless the Company Board
reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation in such statement or in connection
with such action. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) Required Notices. The Company Board shall not take any of the
actions referred to in Section 6.04 unless the Company shall have delivered to
Parent a prior written notice advising Parent that it intends to take such
action, and, after taking such action, the Company shall continue to advise
Parent on a prompt basis of the status and terms of any discussions and
negotiations with the Third Party. In addition, the Company shall notify
Parent promptly (but in no event later than 24 hours) after receipt by the
Company (or, if received by any of the Company's Representatives, after the
Company is informed by such Representative) of any Acquisition Proposal, any
indication that a Third Party is considering making an Acquisition Proposal or
any request for information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or for access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any Third Party that may be considering
making, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall provide such
notice orally and in writing and shall identify the Third Party making, and
the terms and conditions of, any such Acquisition Proposal, indication or
request. The Company shall keep Parent informed, on a prompt basis, of the
status, terms of any discussions and details of any such Acquisition Proposal,
indication or request, and shall promptly (but in no event later than 24 hours
after receipt) provide to Parent copies of all correspondence and written
materials that describe any terms or conditions of any Acquisition Proposal
sent or provided to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Any material
amendment to any Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to be a new Acquisition
Proposal for purposes of the Company's compliance with this Section
6.04(c). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) "Last Look". Further, the Company Board shall not make an
Adverse Recommendation Change in response to an Acquisition Proposal (or
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.01(d)(i)), unless (i) the
Company promptly notifies Parent, in writing at least three Business Days
before taking that action, of its intention

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t58  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

to do so, attaching in the case of an Adverse Recommendation Change to be made
following receipt of a Superior Proposal, the most current version of any
proposed agreement under which such Superior Proposal is proposed to be
consummated and the identity of the Third Party making the Acquisition
Proposal, and (ii) Parent does not make, within three Business Days after its
receipt of that written notification, an offer that in the case of any Adverse
Recommendation Change to be made following receipt of a Superior Proposal, is
at least as favorable to the shareholders of the Company as such Superior
Proposal (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to the financial
terms or other material terms of such Superior Proposal shall require a new
written notification from the Company and a new three Business Day period
under this Section 6.04(d)). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e) Definition of Superior Proposal. For purposes of this
Agreement, "Superior Proposal" means a bona fide, unsolicited written
Acquisition Proposal for at least 62.5% of the outstanding Company Common
Shares or at least 62.5% of the consolidated assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, on terms that the Company Board determines in good faith by a
majority vote, after considering the written advice of a financial advisor of
internationally recognized reputation and outside legal counsel and taking
into account all of the applicable terms, conditions, impacts and all legal,
financial, regulatory, fiduciary and other aspects of such Acquisition
Proposal, including the identity of the Third Party making the proposal, any
break-up fees, expense reimbursement provisions and conditions to
consummation, are more favorable from a financial point of view to the
Company's shareholders than as provided under this Agreement (taking into
account any proposal by Parent to amend the terms of this Agreement pursuant
to Section 6.04(d)), which the Company Board determines is reasonably likely
to be consummated in accordance with its terms, and either (i) for which
financing, if a cash transaction (whether in whole or in part), is then fully
committed or reasonably expected by the Company Board to be available or (ii)
the Company Board determines, after considering the advice of a financial
advisor of internationally recognized reputation, that the Third Party making
such Acquisition Proposal has sufficient cash on hand to consummate the
Acquisition Proposal without financing. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(f) Obligation to Terminate Existing Discussions. The Company
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives to,
cease immediately and cause to be terminated any and all existing activities,

Representatives pursuant to this Section 6.05 (other than the use of any
information provided by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective Representatives in writing for use in connection with the Debt
Financing), except to the extent such losses, claims, damages, liabilities,
costs, reasonable attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, penalties and amounts
paid in settlement are determined by a final non-appealable judgment of a
court of competent jurisdiction to have arisen out of, or resulted from, the
gross negligence or willful misconduct of, or a Willful Breach by, the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Representatives. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent and the
Surviving Company shall indemnify and hold harmless the present and former
officers and directors of the Company and its Subsidiaries (each, an
"Indemnified Person") against any liability, Proceeding, costs, damages or
expenses, including legal expenses, whatsoever which they or any of them may
incur as a result of any act or failure to act in carrying out their functions
other than such liability (if any) that they may incur (i) by reason of their
own actual fraud or willful default, or (ii) as a result of the insurance
policy maintained by the Company not available due to such person's willful
failure to disclose to the insurance provider (where, in the absence of such
failure to disclose, the insurance maintained by the Company would have
otherwise been available). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to
be maintained in effect all provisions in the Surviving Company's memorandum
and articles of association regarding (i) elimination of liability of
directors and managers, (ii) indemnification of officers, directors and
managers, and (iii) advancement of expenses, in each case, that are no less
advantageous to the intended beneficiaries than the corresponding provisions
in existence on the date of this Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall, or, if the
Company is unable to or does not, Parent shall and shall cause the Surviving
Company as of the Effective Time to, obtain and fully pay the premium for the
non-cancellable extension of the directors' and officers' liability coverage
of the Company's existing directors' and officers' insurance policies and the
Company's existing fiduciary liability insurance policies (collectively, "DandO
Insurance"), in each case for a claims reporting or discovery period of six
years from and after the Effective Time with respect to any claim related to
any period of time at or prior to the Effective Time, from an insurance
carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company's current
insurance carrier with respect to DandO Insurance, with terms, conditions,
retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than the
coverage provided under the Company's existing policies with respect to any
actual or alleged error, misstatement, misleading statement, act, omission,
neglect, breach of duty or any matter claimed against a director or officer of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by reason of him or her serving in such
capacity that existed or occurred at or prior to the Effective Time (including
in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions); provided that neither
the Company nor the Surviving Company shall purchase such a "tail" policy for
a premium amount for any one year in excess of 200% of the annual premium
currently paid by the Company for such insurance (the "Tail Cap"); provided,
further, that if the premiums of such "tail" policy exceed the Tail Cap, the
Company, after prior consultation with Parent, may obtain such a "tail" policy
with the greatest coverage available, with respect to matters occurring prior
to the Effective Time, for a cost not exceeding the Tail Cap. If the Company
or the Surviving Company for any reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance
policies as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall, and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Company to, either (i) continue to maintain in
effect, for a period of at least six years from and after the Effective Time,
the DandO Insurance in place as of the date of this Agreement with the Company's
current insurance carrier or with an insurance carrier with the same or better
credit rating as the Company's current insurance carrier with respect to DandO
Insurance with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are
no less favorable than the coverage provided under the Company's existing
policies as of the date of this Agreement with respect to claims related to
any period of time at or prior to the Effective Time or (ii) purchase from the
Company's current insurance carrier or from an insurance carrier with the same
or better credit rating as the Company's current insurance carrier with
respect to DandO Insurance comparable DandO Insurance for such six-year period
with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less
favorable than as provided in the Company's existing policies as of the date
of this Agreement with respect to claims related to any period of time at or
prior to the Effective Time; provided that in no event shall Parent or the
Surviving Company be required to

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t64  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

expend for such policies pursuant to this sentence a premium amount for any
one year in excess of the Tail Cap; and provided, further, that if the
premiums of such insurance coverage with respect to any policy year exceed the
Tail Cap, the Surviving Company shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the
greatest coverage available, with respect to matters occurring prior to the
Effective Time, for a cost not exceeding the Tail Cap. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) The rights of each Indemnified Person under this Section 7.04
shall be in addition to any rights such Person may have under the memorandum
and articles of association and other governing documents of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, under Applicable Law under any agreement of any
Indemnified Person with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. These rights
shall survive consummation of the Merger and are intended to benefit, and
shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person. \t\t

Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to have any such stop
order or suspension lifted, reversed or otherwise terminated. Each of the
Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take any other
action required to be taken by it under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act,

the Company), or requested by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, in

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) The Company, in connection with an Adverse Recommendation
Change made in compliance with the terms hereof, may amend or supplement the

sky" permits and approvals required to carry out the

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t67  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

Transactions (provided that in no event shall Parent be required to qualify to

general consent to service of process). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e) Each of the Company and Parent shall, upon request, furnish to
the other all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors,
officers and (to the extent reasonably available to the applicable Party)
shareholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable (or as otherwise required in accordance with Applicable Law) in
connection with any statement, filing, notice or application made by or on
behalf of the Company, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries, to the
SEC, the NYSE or the NASDAQ in connection with the Merger and the other
Transactions, including the Registration Statement and the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus. In addition, each of the Company and Parent shall use
its reasonable best efforts to provide information concerning it necessary to

efforts to deliver such representations, reports, historical financial

of the Company Shareholder Approval and the receipt of the Parent Shareholder
Approval, any information relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their
respective Affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by the
Company or Parent that, in the reasonable judgment of the Company or Parent,
should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to either of the
Registration Statement or the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, so that either
of such documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the
Party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other Party
and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall
promptly be prepared and filed with the SEC and, to the extent required under
Applicable Law, disseminated to the shareholders of the Company and the
shareholders of Parent. \t\t

that the Company may, without the prior written consent of Parent, adjourn,
postpone or delay the commencement or conclusion of the Company Shareholder
Meeting, after consultation with Parent, if the Company believes in good faith
that such adjournment, postponement or delay is reasonably necessary to allow
reasonable additional time to (A) solicit additional proxies necessary to
obtain the Company Shareholder Approval, or (B) distribute any supplement or
amendment to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus that

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t68  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

postponement or delay is reasonably necessary to allow reasonable additional
time to (A) obtain a quorum, (B) solicit additional proxies necessary to
obtain the Parent Shareholder Approval, or (C) distribute any supplement or
amendment to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus that Parent has determined

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 9.04 Frustration of Closing Conditions. Neither the
Company nor Parent may rely, either as a basis for not consummating the Merger
or terminating this Agreement and abandoning the Merger, on the failure of any
condition set forth in Section 9.01, Section 9.02 or Section 9.03, as the
case may be, to be satisfied if such failure was caused by such Party's breach
in any material respect of any provision of this Agreement or failure in any
material respect to use the standard of efforts required from such Party to
consummate the Merger and the other Transactions. \t\t

 \t\t\tTERMINATION \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 10.01 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated and
the Merger may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time
(notwithstanding any approval of this Agreement by the shareholders of the
Company): \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) by mutual written agreement of the Company and Parent; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) by either the Company or Parent, if: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i) the Merger has not been consummated on or before March 31,
2019 (the "End Date"); provided that the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 10.01(b)(i) shall not be available to any Party whose
breach in any material respect of any provision of this Agreement (other than
Section 6.05) results in the failure of the Merger to be consummated by such
time; provided, further, that if the conditions set forth in Section 9.01(d)
(or, with respect to matters addressed in Section 9.01(d), Section 9.01(c))
have not been satisfied or waived on or prior to such date, but all other
conditions set forth in Article 9 have been satisfied or waived (except for
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing and
are capable of being satisfied by such date), then the End Date may be
extended for up to an additional two months for each such extension, by either
the Company or Parent, with such extensions permitted on one or more
occasions, by notice delivered to the other Party, until a date for all such
extensions that is no later than September 3, 2019 (in which case the End Date
shall be deemed for all purposes to be the latest of such dates); \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(ii) there shall be any Applicable Law that (A) makes consummation
of the Merger illegal or otherwise prohibited or (B) enjoins the Company or
Parent from consummating the Merger and such injunction shall have become
final and nonappealable (each, a "Regulatory Impediment"); \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(iii) at the Company Shareholder Meeting (including after taking
into account any adjournment or postponement thereof in accordance with this
Agreement), the Company Shareholder Approval shall not have been obtained;
or \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i) (A) an Adverse Recommendation Change shall have occurred, (B)
prior to the receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval, the Company Board
shall have failed to reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation within five
Business Days after receipt of any written request to do so from Parent
following the public announcement of an Acquisition Proposal, or (C) after
receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval, the Company Board shall have
failed to confirm publicly its intention to (subject to all of the applicable
conditions contained herein) complete the Transactions within five Business
Days after receipt of any written request to do so from Parent following the
public announcement of an Acquisition Proposal; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(ii) the Company shall have committed a Willful Breach of any of
its obligations under Section 6.04, Section 8.02(c) or Section 8.03 in any
material respect; provided that in no event shall Parent be entitled to
terminate this Agreement on the basis of any breach of Section 8.03 following
the receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval; or \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(iii) a breach of any representation or warranty or failure to
perform any covenant or agreement (other than the covenants and agreements set
forth in Section 6.05) on the part of the Company set forth in this Agreement
shall have occurred that would cause the condition set forth in Section
9.02(a) or Section 9.02(b) not to be satisfied, and such condition is
incapable of being satisfied by the End Date; or \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) by the Company, if: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i) at any time prior to (but not after) receipt of the Company
Shareholder Approval (A) the Company Board authorizes the Company, in
accordance with Section 6.04, to enter into an Alternative Acquisition
Agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal that did not result from a
Willful Breach of Section 6.04, (B) concurrently with the termination of this
Agreement the Company, in accordance with Section 6.04, enters into an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal that did
not result from a Willful Breach of Section 6.04 and (C) prior to or
concurrently with such termination, the Company pays to Parent the Company
Termination Fee pursuant to Section 10.03; or \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(ii) a breach of any representation or warranty or failure to
perform any covenant or agreement on the part of Parent, HoldCo or Merger Sub
set forth in this Agreement shall have occurred that would cause the
conditions set forth in Section 9.03(a) or Section 9.03(b) not to be satisfied
and to be incapable of being satisfied by the End Date. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tThe Party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 10.01 (other than pursuant to Section 10.01(a)) shall give notice of
such termination to the other Party. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 10.02 Effect of Termination. Except as provided in
Section 10.03, if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 10.01, this
Agreement shall become void and of no effect without liability of any Party
(or any shareholder, director, officer, employee, agent, consultant or
representative of such Party) to the other Parties; provided that if such
termination shall result from a Willful Breach, such Party shall be fully
liable for any and all liabilities and damages (which the Parties acknowledge
and agree shall not be limited to reimbursement of expenses or out-of-pocket
costs) incurred or suffered as a result of such failure. The provisions of
this Section 10.02 and Sections 6.05(c), 10.03, 11.06, 11.07, 11.08,
11.09 and 11.10 shall survive any termination of this Agreement pursuant to

 \t\t\tSection 10.03 Expenses; Termination Fees. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) If this Agreement is terminated by the Company or Parent
pursuant to Section 10.01(b)(iv), then Parent shall pay to the Company
$60,000,000 (such amount being the parties' reasonable estimate of the
Expenses of the Company) within one Business Day after such termination. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) If this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section
10.01(c)(i) or Section 10.01(c)(ii), then the Company shall pay to Parent
$90,000,000 (the "Company Termination Fee") within one Business Day after such
termination. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) If this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to
Section 10.01(d)(i) then the Company shall pay to Parent the Company
Termination Fee immediately before and as a condition to such
termination. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) If (i) this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company
pursuant to Section 10.01(b)(i), Section 10.01(b)(iii) or Section
10.01(c)(iii) and at the time of termination all conditions to the
consummation of the Merger set forth in Article 9, other than the condition
set forth in Section 9.01(a), have been satisfied or waived, (ii) an
Acquisition Proposal shall have been made (or, in the case of termination by
Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 10.01(b)(iii), publicly announced)
after the date of this Agreement and not withdrawn prior to the Company
Shareholder Meeting or the applicable breach, as the case may be, and (iii)
within 12 months following the date of such termination, the Company or any
Subsidiary enters into a definitive agreement with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal (which is thereafter consummated) or an Acquisition Proposal shall
have been consummated (provided that for purposes of this clause (e), each
reference to "15%" in the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed
to be a reference to "62.5%"), then the Company shall pay to Parent the
Termination Fee after the consummation of the applicable transaction. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e) Any payment of the Company Termination Fee shall be made by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in
writing by Parent to the Company. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(f) Each Party acknowledges that the agreements contained in this
Section 10.03 are an integral part of this Agreement, and that, without these
agreements, Parent, HoldCo, Merger Sub and the Company would not enter into
this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay any
applicable amount when due pursuant to this Section 10.03, and, in order to
obtain such payment, Parent, HoldCo or Merger Sub, as applicable, commences a
Proceeding that results in a judgment against the Company for the fee set
forth in this Section 10.03 or any portion of such fee, then the Company shall
pay to Parent all reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys' fees and expenses) incurred by Parent, its Affiliates and
Representatives in connection with such suit, together with interest on such
amount at the prime rate published in The Wall Street Journal on the date such
payment was required to be made through the date of payment. Except as set
forth in the preceding sentence or in the case of fraud, Parent, HoldCo and
Merger Sub agree that, upon any termination of this Agreement under
circumstances where the Company Termination Fee is payable by the Company
pursuant to this Section 10.03 and such Company Termination Fee is paid in
full, Parent, HoldCo and Merger Sub shall be precluded from any other remedy
against the Company, at law or in equity or otherwise, and neither Parent,
HoldCo nor Merger Sub shall seek to obtain any recovery, judgment, or damages
of any kind, including consequential, indirect, or punitive damages, against
the Company or any of the Company's Subsidiaries or any of their respective
directors, officers, employees, partners, managers, shareholders or Affiliates
or their respective Representatives in connection with this Agreement or the
Transactions. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(g) Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the Company a fee
equal to $132,500,000 (the "Parent Termination Fee") if this Agreement is
terminated (i) by the Company or Parent pursuant to Section 10.01(b)(i) (in
the case of termination by Parent, only under circumstances in which the
Company has a concurrent right to

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t76  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

terminate pursuant to Section 10.01(b)(i)) and, as of the End Date, one or
more of the conditions set forth in Section 9.01(d) (or, with respect to
matters addressed in Section 9.01(d), Section 9.01(c)) shall not have been
satisfied or waived and all other conditions set forth in Article 9 to the
obligation of Parent to consummate the Merger have been satisfied or waived
(other than any such conditions that by their nature cannot be satisfied until
the Closing Date but subject to such conditions being capable of being
satisfied or waived by Parent if the Closing Date were the date of
termination), or (ii) by the Company or Parent pursuant to Section
10.01(b)(ii) in the event a Regulatory Impediment relates to an Antitrust Law;
provided that, solely in the case of Section 10.03(g)(ii), Parent shall have
no obligation to pay, or cause to be paid, to the Company the Parent
Termination Fee if (A) there shall have been a Willful Breach of this
Agreement by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (B) the condition set
forth in Section 9.02(d) shall not have been satisfied. The Parent
Termination Fee shall be paid within one Business Day after such termination
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in
writing by the Company to Parent. Each Party acknowledges that the agreements
contained in this Section 10.03(g) are an integral part of this Agreement, and
that, without these agreements, Parent, HoldCo, Merger Sub and the Company
would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if Parent fails to promptly
pay any applicable amount when due pursuant to this Section 10.03(g), and, in
order to obtain such payment, the Company commences a Proceeding that results
in a judgment against Parent for the fee set forth in this Section 10.03(g) or
any portion of such fee, then Parent shall pay to the Company all reasonable
costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses)
incurred by the Company, its Affiliates and Representatives in connection with
such suit, together with interest on such amount at the prime rate published
in The Wall Street Journal on the date such payment was required to be made
through the date of payment. Except as set forth in the preceding sentence or
in the case of fraud, the Company agrees that, upon any termination of this
Agreement under circumstances where the Parent Termination Fee is payable by
Parent pursuant to this Section 10.03(g) and such Parent Termination Fee is
paid in full, the Company shall be precluded from any other remedy against
Parent, at law or in equity or otherwise, and the Company shall not seek to
obtain any recovery, judgment, or damages of any kind, including
consequential, indirect, or punitive damages, against Parent or any of
Parent's Subsidiaries or any of their respective directors, officers,
employees, partners, managers, shareholders or Affiliates or their respective
Representatives in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 11.03 Amendments and Waivers. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived prior
to the Effective Time if, but only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing
and is signed, in the case of an amendment, by each Party to this Agreement
or, in the case of a waiver, by each Party against whom the waiver is to be
effective; provided that after the Company Shareholder Approval has been
obtained there shall be no amendment or waiver that would require the further
approval of the shareholders of the Company under Applicable Law without such
approval having first been obtained; provided further that this Section 11.03,
Section 11.06, Section 11.15 and any other provision of this Agreement
permitting an amendment, supplement, waiver or other modification of this
Section 11.03, Section 11.06 or Section 11.15 may not be amended,

of the Financing Sources. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) No failure or delay by any Party in exercising any right,

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 11.05 Disclosure Letter and SEC Document References. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) The Parties agree that any reference in a particular Section
of either the Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter shall
be deemed to be an exception to (or, as applicable, a disclosure for purposes
of) (i) the representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of
the relevant Party that are contained in the corresponding Section of this
Agreement and (ii) any other representations and warranties of such Party that
are contained in this Agreement to the extent that such disclosure is set
forth with such specificity that it is reasonably apparent on the face of such
disclosure that such disclosure is applicable to such Sections. The mere
inclusion of an item in either the Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent
Disclosure Letter as an exception to a representation or warranty shall not be
deemed an admission that such item represents a material exception or material
fact or Circumstance or that such item has had or would reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company or a Material Adverse Effect
on Parent, as applicable. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) The Parties agree that in no event shall any disclosure
contained in any part of any Company SEC Document or Parent SEC Document

  \t\t\t79  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements", "Special Note on Forward
Looking Statements" or "Forward Looking Information" or containing a
description or explanation of "Forward-Looking Statements" or any other
disclosures in any Company SEC Document or Parent SEC Document that are
cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature be deemed to be an
exception to (or a disclosure for purposes of) any representations and
warranties of any Party contained in this Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and
shall inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and
assigns, and no provision of this Agreement is intended to confer any rights,
benefits, remedies, obligations or liabilities hereunder upon any Person other
than the Parties and their respective successors and assigns, other than: (i)
with respect to the provisions of Section 7.05 which shall inure to the
benefit of the persons or entities benefiting therefrom who are intended to be
third-party beneficiaries thereof, (ii) at and after the Effective Time, the
rights of the former holders of Company Common Shares to receive the Merger
Consideration in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
in each case, in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
and (iii) the Financing Sources with respect to the provisions of Section
11.03, this Section 11.06 and Section 11.15. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) No Party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its
rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent
of each other Party, except that Parent may transfer or assign its rights and
obligations under this Agreement, in whole or from time to time in part, to
any Person after the Closing, and HoldCo and Merger Sub each may transfer or
assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement, in whole or from time
to time in part, to any other wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent; provided that
such transfer or assignment shall not (i) relieve Parent, HoldCo or Merger Sub
of its obligations hereunder or enlarge, alter or change any obligation of any
other Party or due to Parent, HoldCo or Merger Sub or (ii) materially delay
the consummation of the Merger or any of the other Transactions. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 11.07 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be interpreted,
construed and governed by and in accordance with the laws of the State of New
York without regard to the conflicts of law principles thereof.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the following matters arising out of or
relating to this Agreement shall be construed, performed and enforced in
accordance with the laws of the Cayman Islands in respect of which the Parties
hereby irrevocably submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of
the Cayman Islands: the Merger, the vesting of the rights, property, choses
in action, business, undertaking, goodwill, benefits, immunities and
privileges, contracts, obligations, claims, debts and liabilities of Merger

provided in Section 238 of the Cayman Companies Law, the fiduciary or other
duties of the Company Board and the board of directors of Merger Sub and the

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) Subject to Section 11.07, each of the Parties (i) irrevocably
consents to the service of the summons and complaint and any other process in
any Proceeding relating to the Transactions, on behalf of itself or its
property, in accordance with Section 11.01 and Section 11.08(b) or in such
other manner as may be permitted by Applicable Law, and nothing in this
Section 11.08 shall affect the right of any Party to serve legal process in
any other manner permitted by Applicable Law, (ii) irrevocably and
unconditionally consents and submits itself and its property to the exclusive
general jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts in connection with any dispute that

attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other
request for leave from any such Chosen Courts, (iv) agrees that any actions or
proceedings arising in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions
shall be brought, tried and determined only in the Chosen Courts, (v) waives
any objection that

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t80  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

it may now or hereafter have to the venue of any such Proceeding in any such
Chosen Courts or that such Proceeding was brought in an inconvenient court and
agrees not to plead or claim the same and (vi) agrees that it shall not bring

Party will bring any Proceeding against any Financing Source in any way

 \t\t\tVOTING AND SUPPORT AGREEMENT \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tThis VOTING AND SUPPORT AGREEMENT (this "Agreement"), is dated as of
[], 2018, by and among Transocean Ltd., a Swiss corporation ("Parent"), and
the shareholders of Ocean Rig UDW Inc., an exempted company incorporated with
limited liability under the laws of the Cayman Islands (the "Company"), listed
on the signature pages hereto (each, a "Shareholder" and collectively, the
"Shareholders"). Capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein shall
have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Merger Agreement (as defined
below). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tW I T N E S S E T H: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tWHEREAS, the Company is considering whether to enter into an Agreement
and Plan of Merger with Parent, Transocean Oceanus Holdings Limited, an
exempted company incorporated with limited liability under the laws of the
Cayman Islands and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Holdco"), and
Transocean Oceanus Limited, an exempted company incorporated with limited
liability under the laws of the Cayman Islands and a wholly owned subsidiary
of HoldCo ("Merger Sub"), substantially in the form of the draft, dated
September 3, 2018, previously furnished to the Shareholders (the "Merger
Agreement"). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tWHEREAS, the Merger Agreement provides for, among other things, the
merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company, with the Company surviving the
Merger, pursuant to which each Company Common Share (other than Company Common
Shares held by the Company as treasury shares or owned by any Subsidiary of
the Company or Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Subsidiaries prior to the
Effective Time and the Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the right to
receive (i) 1.6128 fully paid and non-assessable shares of Parent Common
Shares and (ii) $12.75 in cash, without interest. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tWHEREAS, as of the date hereof, each Shareholder is the legal or
beneficial owner of the number of Company Common Shares set forth on Exhibit A
hereto (together with such additional Company Common Shares that become
legally or beneficially owned by such Shareholder, whether by purchase, share
dividend, distribution, split-up, recapitalization, combination, exchange of
shares or the like, conversion of convertible securities or otherwise, after
the date hereof, the "Company Owned Shares"). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tWHEREAS, as a condition to Parent's willingness to enter into and
perform its obligations under the Merger Agreement, Parent has required that
each Shareholder agree, and each Shareholder has agreed, to enter into this
Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tNOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and for other good
and valuable consideration given to each party hereto, the receipt of which is
hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as follows: \t\t

 \t\t

(the "Company Voting Period"), at any meeting of the shareholders of the
Company at which the approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement and the
other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (including the Merger)

be present) and vote (or cause to be voted), or give written consent (or cause
written consent to be given) covering, all of its Company Owned Shares at such
time: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) in favor of (A) approval and adoption of the Merger
Agreement and the Transactions, (B) any other matter necessary or appropriate
to consummate the Transactions, and (C) the approval of any proposal to
adjourn or postpone the meeting to a later date, if there are not sufficient
votes for the approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement, any of the
Transactions or any other matter necessary or appropriate to consummate the
Transactions on the date on which such meeting is held; and \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) against (A) any Acquisition Proposal or any other action,
proposal, agreement or transaction made in opposition to or competition with,
or inconsistent with, the Merger Agreement and the Transactions, and (B) any
other action, proposal, agreement or transaction that would reasonably be
expected, or the effect of which would reasonably be expected, to prevent,
nullify, materially impede, interfere with, frustrate, delay, postpone,
discourage or adversely affect the timely consummation of the Transactions or
the performance by the Shareholder of its obligations under this Agreement,
including (1) any extraordinary dividend or distribution by the Company, (2)
any material change in the capital structure or corporate structure or
business of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company, (3) any merger
agreement or merger (other than the Merger Agreement and the Merger),
consolidation, combination, material business transaction, sale of assets,
reorganization, recapitalization, dissolution, liquidation or winding up of
the Company, or any other action or transaction involving the Company, (4) any
election of new members to the Company Board, other than the re-election of
the members of the Company Board who are serving as directors of the Company
on the date of this Agreement (collectively, the "Existing Directors") or any
new member(s) whose nomination(s) is approved by a majority of the Existing
Directors, and (5) any amendment of the Company's organizational
documents. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tNotwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, this Section 1.1
shall not require any Shareholder to be present (in person or by proxy) or
vote (or cause to be voted), or give written consent (or cause written consent
to be given) covering, any of its Company Owned Shares to amend, modify or
waive any provision of the Merger Agreement in a manner that would (i)

payment of the Merger Consideration to shareholders of the Company or (iii)
extend the End Date. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t1.2 Agreement to Vote Parent Owned Shares. Each Shareholder
hereby agrees that, from the date of execution of the Merger Agreement until
the earliest of (i) the time that the Parent Shareholder Approval has been
obtained and (ii) termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 6.1
(the "Parent Voting Period"), at any meeting of the shareholders of Parent at
which the Parent Shareholder Approval and the Merger Agreement and the other
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (including the Merger) are
to be voted upon, however called, or any adjournment or postponement thereof,

 \t\t\tShareholder shall be present (in person or by proxy, or cause to be

of association in connection therewith, (D) any other Transactions (as
necessary) and (E) one or more "routine" matters under the rules of the New
York Stock Exchange (the proposals referred to in clauses (A), (B), (C), (D)
and (E) being collectively referred to as the "Parent Proposals"). Parent
hereby agrees to provide each Shareholder with at least ten (10) calendar
days' advance notice of the record date for any shareholder meeting of the
Parent held during the Parent Voting Period. For purposes of this Agreement,
"Parent Owned Shares" means the Parent Registered Shares beneficially owned by
such Shareholder as of the date hereof together with such additional Parent
Registered Shares that become beneficially owned by such Shareholder, whether
by purchase, share dividend, distribution, split-up, recapitalization,
combination, exchange of shares or the like, conversion of convertible
securities or otherwise, after the date hereof less any Parent Registered
Shares that have been Transferred pursuant to a Permitted Transfer. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t2. Representations and Warranties of Shareholders. Each
Shareholder hereby represents and warrants to Parent, as of the date of this
Agreement, as of the Company Shareholder Meeting, and, if such Shareholder
beneficially owns any Parent Registered Shares as of the Parent Shareholder
Meeting, as of the Parent Shareholder Meeting, as follows: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t2.1 Power; Due Authorization; Binding Agreement. Such
Shareholder has the requisite power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement
and the consummation by such Shareholder of the transactions contemplated
hereby have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate,
partnership or other applicable action on the part of such Shareholder, and no
other proceedings on the part of such Shareholder are necessary to authorize
this Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. This
Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by such Shareholder
and, assuming the due and valid authorization, execution and delivery hereof
by the other parties hereto, constitutes a valid and binding agreement of such
Shareholder, enforceable against such Shareholder in accordance with its
terms, except that (i) such enforcement may be subject to applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar Applicable
Laws, now or hereafter in effect, relating to creditors' rights generally and
(ii) equitable remedies of specific performance and injunctive and other forms
of equitable relief may be subject to equitable defenses and to the discretion
of the court before which any proceeding therefor may be brought. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t2.2 Ownership of Shares. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i) The Company Owned Shares set forth opposite such
Shareholder's name on Exhibit A hereto as adjusted for Company Owned Shares
Transferred pursuant to a Permitted Transfer are owned legally or beneficially
by such Shareholder, free and clear of any Liens (including any restriction on
the right or power to vote, consent with respect to, or otherwise dispose of
the Company Owned Shares, other than pursuant to this Agreement), except for
any Liens that (x) could not reasonably be expected, either individually or in
the aggregate, to materially impair the ability of such Shareholder to perform
fully its obligations hereunder on a timely basis or (y) are incurred with
Parent's prior written consent ("Permitted Liens"). For the avoidance of
doubt, the fact that such  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tShareholder's Company Owned Shares may be loaned by such Shareholder
as part of customary securities lending arrangements shall constitute a
Permitted Lien so long as such Shareholder is entitled to vote any such loaned
Company Owned Shares at any shareholder meeting of the Company held during the
Voting Period (including by recalling such loaned Company Owned Shares prior
to the record date for such meeting as necessary). Parent hereby agrees to
provide each Shareholder with at least ten (10) calendar days' advance notice
of the record date for any shareholder meeting of the Company held during the
Company Voting Period. Other than the restrictions in favor of Parent
pursuant to this Agreement, any Permitted Liens, any transfer restrictions of
general applicability under applicable securities laws, or as disclosed by
such Shareholder on a Schedule 13D filed with respect to the Company Common
Shares, as amended as of the date hereof, such Shareholder has, and at any
shareholder meeting of the Company held during the Company Voting Period to
vote regarding the Merger Agreement and the Transactions such Shareholder will
have, either (A) sole voting power and sole dispositive power with respect to
the matters set forth in Section 1.1 in respect of all of the Company Owned
Shares of such Shareholder or (B) voting power and dispositive power with
respect to the matters set forth in Section 1.1 in respect of all of the
Company Owned Shares of such Shareholder that is shared with one or more of
the other Shareholders hereto or their respective transferees in accordance
with Section 4.1 of this Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t\t(ii) As of the date hereof, except for the Company Owned Shares
set forth on Exhibit A hereto, such Shareholder does not legally or
beneficially own any (a) common, ordinary or restricted shares or any other
voting securities of the Company, (b) securities of the Company convertible
into or exchangeable for common shares, preferred shares or voting securities
of the Company or (c) options, warrants or other rights to acquire from the
Company any common shares, preferred shares or any other voting securities of
the Company or securities convertible into or exchangeable for common shares,
preferred shares or voting securities of the Company, or rights the value of
which is linked to the price or value of any common shares, preferred shares
or voting securities of the Company. Except for this Agreement, any Permitted
Liens or as disclosed by such Shareholder on a Schedule 13D filed with respect
to the Company Common Shares, as amended as of the date hereof, none of the
Company Owned Shares is subject to any voting trust or other agreement,
arrangement, understanding or instrument with respect to the voting of, or
exercise of voting power with respect to, or the Transfer (as defined below)
of, such shares. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tFor purposes of this Agreement, to "Transfer" any securities shall
mean (a) to sell, assign, transfer, pledge, encumber, distribute, gift or
otherwise dispose of (including by merger or otherwise by operation of law)
such securities or any interest in such securities, (b) to tender such
securities in any tender or exchange offer, or (c) to create or permit to
exist any Liens (other than Permitted Liens), or (d) enter into any contract,
option, agreement or other arrangement or understanding with respect to any of
the actions contemplated by the preceding clauses (a) through (c). The term
"sell," "sale" or any derivatives thereof used in this Agreement with respect
to any securities of the Company shall include (w) any sale, transfer or
disposition of legal or beneficial ownership, or both, of such securities, (x)
any short sale with respect to such securities, (y) any swap transaction,
option, warrant, forward purchase or sale transaction, futures transaction,
cap transaction, floor transaction, collar transaction or any other similar
transaction (including any option with respect to any such transaction) or
combination of any such transactions, in each case involving such securities
and (1) has, or would reasonably be expected to have, the effect of reducing
or limiting such Shareholder's economic interest in such securities or (2)
grants a third party the right to vote  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t2.3 Non-Contravention. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement by such Shareholder does not, and the performance by such
Shareholder of its obligations under this Agreement will not, (i) conflict
with or violate any Applicable Law with respect to such Shareholder or by
which any of its assets or properties (including any Company Owned Shares or
Parent Owned Shares) are bound or (ii) conflict with, result in any breach of
or constitute a default (or an event that with notice or lapse of time or both
would become a default) under, or give to others any rights of termination,
amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or require payment under, or
result in the creation of any Lien on the properties or assets of such
Shareholder pursuant to, any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, contract,
agreement, lease, license, permit, franchise or other instrument or obligation
to which the Shareholder is a party or by which such Shareholder or any of its
assets or properties (including any Company Owned Shares or Parent Owned
Shares) are bound, except for any of the foregoing as could not reasonably be
expected, either individually or in the aggregate, to materially impair the
ability of such Shareholder to perform fully its obligations hereunder on a
timely basis. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by such Shareholder
does not, and the performance of this Agreement by such Shareholder will not,
require any consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or filing with or
notification to, any (A) Governmental Authority, except for filings that may
be required to be made with the SEC under the Exchange Act or (B) third party
(including with respect to individuals, trusts, any co-trustee or
beneficiary). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t2.4 Acknowledgment. Such Shareholder understands and
acknowledges that Parent is entering into the Merger Agreement in reliance
upon such Shareholder's execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t3. Representations and Warranties of Parent. Parent hereby
represents and warrants to each of the Shareholders, as of the date of this
Agreement, as of the Company Shareholder Meeting, and as of the Parent
Shareholder Meeting as follows: (a) Parent has the requisite corporate power

obligations hereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby;
(b) the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation by
Parent of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and validly
authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of Parent, and no
other proceedings on the part of Parent are necessary to authorize this
Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby; and (c) this
Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by Parent and,
assuming the due and valid authorization, execution and delivery hereof by the
other parties hereto, constitutes a valid and binding agreement of
Parent. \t\t

outstanding Company Common Shares (each, a "Permitted Person") who (x) is a
party to an agreement with Parent with substantially identical terms to this
Agreement or (y) executes a joinder to this Agreement in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to Parent pursuant to which such Permitted Person agrees

Company Owned Shares (each a "Permitted Transfer"), (b) grant any proxies or
powers of attorney with respect to the Company Owned Shares or the Parent
Owned Shares of such Shareholder, deposit any such Company Owned Shares or
Parent Owned Shares into a voting trust or enter into a voting agreement or

Agreement, the term "Opposing Proposal" means any of the actions or proposals
described in clause (b) of Section 1.1. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(iii) During each of the Company Voting Period and the Parent

hereby agrees that it shall not (and it shall cause its Subsidiaries and
controlled Affiliates and shall instruct and use its reasonable commercial

 \t\t\tVOTING AND SUPPORT AGREEMENT \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tThis VOTING AND SUPPORT AGREEMENT (this "Agreement"), is dated as of
[], 2018, by and among Ocean Rig UDW Inc., an exempted company incorporated
with limited liability under the laws of the Cayman Islands (the "Company"),
and the shareholder of Transocean Ltd., a Swiss corporation ("Parent"), listed
on the signature pages hereto (the "Shareholder"). Capitalized terms used and
not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in
the Merger Agreement (as defined below). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tW I T N E S S E T H: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tWHEREAS, Parent is considering whether to enter into an Agreement and
Plan of Merger with the Company, Transocean Oceanus Holdings Limited, an
exempted company incorporated with limited liability under the laws of the
Cayman Islands and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Holdco"), and
Transocean Oceanus Limited, an exempted company incorporated with limited
liability under the laws of the Cayman Islands and a wholly owned subsidiary
of HoldCo ("Merger Sub"), substantially in the form of the draft, dated
September 3, 2018, previously furnished to the Shareholder (the "Merger
Agreement"). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tWHEREAS, the Merger Agreement provides for, among other things, the
merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company, with the Company surviving the
Merger, pursuant to which each Company Common Share (other than Company Common
Shares held by the Company as treasury shares or owned by any Subsidiary of
the Company or Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Subsidiaries prior to the
Effective Time and the Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the right to
receive (i) 1.6128 fully paid and non-assessable shares of Parent Common
Shares and (ii) $12.75 in cash, without interest. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tWHEREAS, as of the date hereof, the Shareholder is the legal or
beneficial owner of the number of Parent Registered Shares set forth on
Exhibit A hereto (together with such additional Parent Registered Shares that
become legally or beneficially owned by the Shareholder, whether by purchase,
share dividend, distribution, split-up, recapitalization, combination,
exchange of shares or the like, conversion of convertible securities or
otherwise, after the date hereof, the "Parent Owned Shares"). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tWHEREAS, as a condition to the Company's willingness to enter into and
perform its obligations under the Merger Agreement, the Company has required
the Shareholder agree, and the Shareholder has agreed, to enter into this
Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tNOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and for other good
and valuable consideration given to each party hereto, the receipt of which is
hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as follows: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t1. Agreement to Vote Parent Owned Shares. The Shareholder
hereby agrees that, from the date of execution of the Merger Agreement until
the earliest of (i) the time that the Parent Shareholder Approval has been
obtained and (ii) termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 5.1
(the "Parent Voting Period"), at any meeting of the shareholders of Parent at
which the Parent Shareholder Approval is to be voted upon, however called, or
any adjournment or postponement thereof, the Shareholder shall be present (in
person or by proxy, or cause to be present) and vote (or cause to be voted),
all of its Parent Owned Shares (as defined below) which the Shareholder
beneficially owns as of the record date for such meeting at such time in favor
of (A) the Authorized Share Capital, (B) the Parent Share \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t   \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tIssuance, (C) the related amendments to Parent's articles of
association in connection therewith, (D) any other Transactions (as necessary)
and (E) one or more "routine" matters under the rules of the New York Stock
Exchange (the proposals referred to in clauses (A), (B), (C), (D) and (E)
being collectively referred to as the "Parent Proposals"); provided, however,
that nothing in this Section 1.1 shall require any Shareholder beneficially
owning any securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for
Parent Registered Shares to convert, exercise or exchange such
securities. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t2. Representations and Warranties of the Shareholder. The
Shareholder hereby represents and warrants to the Company, as of the date of
this Agreement and as of the Parent Shareholder Meeting, as follows: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t2.1 Power; Due Authorization; Binding Agreement. The
Shareholder has the requisite power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the consummation by the Shareholder of the transactions
contemplated hereby have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary
corporate, partnership or other applicable action on the part of the
Shareholder, and no other proceedings on the part of the Shareholder are
necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and
delivered by the Shareholder and, assuming the due and valid authorization,
execution and delivery hereof by the other parties hereto, constitutes a valid
and binding agreement of the Shareholder, enforceable against the Shareholder
in accordance with its terms, except that (i) such enforcement may be subject
to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other
similar Applicable Laws, now or hereafter in effect, relating to creditors'
rights generally and (ii) equitable remedies of specific performance and
injunctive and other forms of equitable relief may be subject to equitable
defenses and to the discretion of the court before which any proceeding
therefor may be brought. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t2.2 Ownership of Shares. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i) The Parent Owned Shares set forth opposite the
Shareholder's name on Exhibit A hereto are owned legally or beneficially by
the Shareholder, free and clear of any Liens (including any restriction on the
right or power to vote, consent with respect to, or otherwise dispose of the
Parent Owned Shares, other than pursuant to this Agreement), except for any
Liens that (x) could not reasonably be expected, either individually or in the
aggregate, to materially impair the ability of the Shareholder to perform
fully its obligations hereunder on a timely basis or (y) are incurred with the
Company's prior written consent ("Permitted Liens"). For the avoidance of
doubt, the fact that the Shareholder's Parent Owned Shares may be loaned by
the Shareholder as part of customary securities lending arrangements shall
constitute a Permitted Lien so long as the Shareholder is entitled to vote any
such loaned Parent Owned Shares at any shareholder meeting of Parent held
during the Parent Voting Period (including by recalling such loaned Parent
Owned Shares prior to the record date for such meeting as necessary). The
Company hereby agrees to provide the Shareholder with at least ten (10)
calendar days' advance notice of the record date for any shareholder meeting
of Parent held during the Parent Voting Period. Other than the restrictions
in favor of the Company pursuant to this Agreement, any Permitted Liens, any
transfer restrictions of general applicability under applicable securities
laws, or as disclosed by the Shareholder on a Schedule 13D filed with respect
to the Parent Registered Shares, as amended as of the date hereof, the
Shareholder has, and at any shareholder meeting of Parent \t\t

 \t\t\theld during the Parent Voting Period to vote regarding the Merger
Agreement and the Transactions the Shareholder will have, either (A) sole
voting power and sole dispositive power with respect to the matters set forth
in Section 1.1 in respect of all of the Parent Owned Shares of the Shareholder
or (B) voting power and dispositive power with respect to the matters set
forth in Section 1.1 in respect of all of the Parent Owned Shares of the
Shareholder that is shared with one or more transferees in accordance with
Section 4.1 of this Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(ii) As of the date hereof, except for the Parent Owned Shares
set forth on Exhibit A hereto, the Shareholder does not legally or
beneficially own any (a) common, ordinary or restricted shares or any other
voting securities of Parent, (b) securities of Parent convertible into or
exchangeable for common shares, preferred shares or voting securities of
Parent or (c) options, warrants or other rights to acquire from Parent any
common shares, preferred shares or any other voting securities of Parent or
securities convertible into or exchangeable for common shares, preferred
shares or voting securities of Parent, or rights the value of which is linked
to the price or value of any common shares, preferred shares or voting
securities of Parent. Except for this Agreement, any Permitted Liens or as
disclosed by the Shareholder on a Schedule 13D filed with respect to the
Parent Registered Shares, as amended as of the date hereof, none of the Parent
Owned Shares is subject to any voting trust or other agreement, arrangement,
understanding or instrument with respect to the voting of, or exercise of
voting power with respect to, or the Transfer (as defined below) of, such
shares. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tFor purposes of this Agreement, to "Transfer" any securities shall
mean (a) to sell, assign, transfer, pledge, encumber, distribute, gift or
otherwise dispose of (including by merger or otherwise by operation of law)
such securities or any interest in such securities, (b) to tender such
securities in any tender or exchange offer, or (c) to create or permit to
exist any Liens (other than Permitted Liens), or (d) enter into any contract,
option, agreement or other arrangement or understanding with respect to any of
the actions contemplated by the preceding clauses (a) through (c); provided
that any conversion, exercise or exchange of any securities convertible into
or exercisable or exchangeable for Parent Registered Shares by any Shareholder
shall not constitute a Transfer to the extent the Parent Registered Shares
underlying such security continue to be beneficially owned by the Shareholder
following such conversion, exercise or exchange. The term "sell," "sale" or
any derivatives thereof used in this Agreement with respect to any securities
of the Company shall include (w) any sale, transfer or disposition of legal or
beneficial ownership, or both, of such securities, (x) any short sale with
respect to such securities, (y) any swap transaction, option, warrant, forward
purchase or sale transaction, futures transaction, cap transaction, floor
transaction, collar transaction or any other similar transaction (including
any option with respect to any such transaction) or combination of any such
transactions, in each case involving such securities and (1) has, or would
reasonably be expected to have, the effect of reducing or limiting the
Shareholder's economic interest in such securities or (2) grants a third party
the right to vote or direct the voting of such securities, or (z) any
transaction that has the same effect as any of the foregoing; provided that
any conversion, exercise or exchange of any securities convertible into or
exercisable or exchangeable for Parent Registered Shares by any Shareholder
shall not constitute a sale to the extent the Parent Registered Shares
underlying such security continue to be beneficially owned by the Shareholder
following such conversion, exercise or exchange. \t\t

 \t\t\t2.3 Non-Contravention. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement by the Shareholder does not, and the performance by the Shareholder
of its obligations under this Agreement will not, (i) conflict with or violate
any Applicable Law with respect to the Shareholder or by which any of its
assets or properties (including any Parent Owned Shares) are bound or (ii)
conflict with, result in any breach of or constitute a default (or an event
that with notice or lapse of time or both would become a default) under, or
give to others any rights of termination, amendment, acceleration or
cancellation of, or require payment under, or result in the creation of any
Lien on the properties or assets of the Shareholder pursuant to, any note,
bond, mortgage, indenture, contract, agreement, lease, license, permit,
franchise or other instrument or obligation to which the Shareholder is a
party or by which the Shareholder or any of its assets or properties
(including any Parent Owned Shares) are bound, except for any of the foregoing
as could not reasonably be expected, either individually or in the aggregate,
to materially impair the ability of the Shareholder to perform fully its
obligations hereunder on a timely basis. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement by the Shareholder does not, and the performance of this Agreement
by the Shareholder will not, require any consent, approval, authorization or
permit of, or filing with or notification to, any (A) Governmental Authority,
except for filings that may be required to be made with the SEC under the
Exchange Act or (B) third party (including with respect to individuals,
trusts, any co-trustee or beneficiary). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t2.4 Acknowledgment. The Shareholder understands and
acknowledges that the Company is entering into the Merger Agreement in
reliance upon the Shareholder's execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t3. Representations and Warranties of the Company. The Company
hereby represents and warrants the Shareholder, as of the date of this
Agreement and as of the Parent Shareholder Meeting, as follows: (a) the
Company has the requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver
this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby; (b) the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated
hereby have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate action
on the part of the Company, and no other proceedings on the part of the
Company are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby; and (c) this Agreement has been duly and
validly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming the due and valid
authorization, execution and delivery hereof by the other parties hereto,
constitutes a valid and binding agreement of the Company. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t4. Certain Covenants of the Shareholder. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t4.1 Restriction on Transfer, Proxies and Non-Interference. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i) The Shareholder hereby agrees, during the Parent Voting
Period, not to, directly or indirectly, (a) Transfer, cause or permit any
Transfer of, or make any offer regarding any Transfer of, any of the Parent
Owned Shares of the Shareholder or any other securities of Parent, in each
case, other than (1) any such transaction as to which the Company or any of
its Affiliates are the sole counterparty, (2) any Permitted Liens or (3) any
Transfer to (A) any Affiliate of the Shareholder or (B) any Person who has,
prior to the Transfer, filed a Schedule 13D or Schedule 13G with respect to
the Parent Registered Shares indicating that such Person is the beneficial
owner of 5% or greater of the outstanding Parent Registered Shares (each, a
"Permitted Person") who (x) is a party to an agreement with the Company with
substantially identical terms to this Agreement or (y) executes a joinder to

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tAgreement in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company
pursuant to which such Permitted Person agrees to be bound by the terms hereof
applicable to the Shareholder as to any such Parent Owned Shares, (b) other
than a proxy granted or voting instructions issued to Parent in connection
with the Parent Shareholder Meeting, grant any proxies or powers of attorney
with respect to the Parent Owned Shares of the Shareholder, deposit any such
Parent Owned Shares into a voting trust or enter into a voting agreement or
understanding with any Person to vote or give instructions with respect to any
such Parent Owned Shares in any manner inconsistent with the terms of this
Agreement, in each case with respect to any vote on the matters set forth in
Section 1.1 of this Agreement, or (c) commit or agree to take any of the
foregoing actions; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 4.1(i)
shall prohibit the Shareholder from Transferring, directly or indirectly, or
taking any other action with regard to any Parent Bonds (or, so long as such
Parent Bonds have not been exchanged for Parent Owned Shares, any Parent
Owned Shares issuable upon exchange of any such Parent Bonds) beneficially
owned by the Shareholder. If any involuntary Transfer of any of the Parent
Owned Shares shall occur (including a sale by a Shareholder's trustee in any
bankruptcy, liquidator in any liquidation or winding-up or provisional
liquidator in any restructuring by way of provisional liquidation, or a sale
to a purchaser at any creditor's or court sale), the transferee (which term,
as used herein, shall include any and all transferees and subsequent
transferees of the initial transferee) shall, to the extent permitted by
Applicable Law, take and hold such Parent Owned Shares subject to all of the
restrictions, liabilities, obligations and rights under this Agreement, which
shall continue in full force and effect until the valid termination of this
Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(ii) During the Parent Voting Period, the Shareholder agrees
that it will not take any action designed to, or that has the effect of,
frustrating, delaying or impeding the ability of Parent to obtain the approval
or adoption of the Parent Proposals. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(iii) During the Parent Voting Period, the Shareholder agrees
that it will not bring, commence, institute, maintain, prosecute, participate
in or voluntarily aid any Proceeding in law or in equity, in any court or
before any Governmental Authority, which alleges that the execution and
delivery of the Merger Agreement by the Company, Parent, Holdco or Merger Sub
or the approval of the Merger Agreement and the Transactions by the Board of
Directors or similar governing body, as applicable, of Parent, Holdco or
Merger Sub or the Board of Directors of the Company, breaches any fiduciary
duty of such governing body or any member thereof or which otherwise
challenges the Merger Agreement and the Transactions. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t4.2 Acquisition of Additional Shares. During the Parent Voting
Period, the Shareholder shall notify the Company promptly in writing of the
acquisition or Transfer of legal or beneficial ownership of additional Parent
Registered Shares after the date hereof. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t5. Miscellaneous. \t\t

to occur of: (i) the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with

amendment, waiver or other modification to any provision of the Merger
Agreement that (x) decreases the amount or changes the form of the Merger
Consideration, (y) imposes any material restrictions on or additional material
conditions on the payment of the Merger Consideration to the shareholders of
the Company or (z) extends the End Date; (iv) if the Company Board makes an
Adverse Recommendation Change following receipt of \t\t

 \t\t\t5.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 5.1, this Agreement shall become void and of no
effect with no liability on the part of any party hereto; provided, however,
no such termination shall relieve any party hereto from any liability for any
willful and intentional breach of this Agreement occurring prior to such
termination and the provisions of this Article 5 shall survive any such
termination. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t5.3 Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire
agreement among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter of this
Agreement and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both oral and
written, among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter of this
Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

but only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed, in the case
of an amendment, by each party to this Agreement or, in the case of a waiver,
by each party against whom the waiver is to be effective. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t5.4.2 No failure or delay by any party hereto in exercising any
right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor
shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The
rights and remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of
any rights or remedies provided by Applicable Law. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t5.5 Binding Effect; Benefit; Assignment. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t5.5.1 The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and
shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns, and no provision of this Agreement is intended to
confer any rights, benefits, remedies, obligations or liabilities hereunder
upon any Person other than the parties hereto and their respective successors
and assigns, other than with respect to the provisions of Section 5.14 which
shall inure to the benefit of Parent, and Parent shall be an express third-
party beneficiary of Section 5.14. \t\t

any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior
written consent of each other party hereto. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) Subject to Section 5.7, each of the parties irrevocably
agrees that any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative and whether formal or
informal (a "Proceeding"), arising out of or relating to this Agreement
brought by any party against any other party shall be brought and determined
in the court of any New York federal court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan
of The City of New York; provided, however, that if such federal court does
not have jurisdiction, then any New York state court sitting in the Borough of
Manhattan of The City of New York (collectively, the "Chosen Courts"). Each
of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits
itself and its property in any Proceeding to the exclusive general
jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts in the event any dispute arises out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or for
recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect thereof, (iii) agrees
that it shall not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by
motion or other request for leave from any such Chosen Courts, (iv) agrees
that any actions or proceedings arising in connection with this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be brought, tried and
determined only in the Chosen Courts, (v) waives any objection that it may now
or hereafter have to the venue of any such Proceeding in any such Chosen
Courts or that such Proceeding was brought in an inconvenient court and agrees
not to plead or claim the same and (vi) agrees that it shall not bring any
action relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement in any court other than the Chosen Courts. Each of the parties
hereto agrees that a final judgment in any Proceeding in the Chosen Courts
shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by Applicable Law. Each of the
parties further agrees that notice as provided herein shall constitute
sufficient service of process and the parties further waive any argument that
such service is insufficient. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY
AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO
THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) EACH PARTY HERETO EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE WAIVERS
IN SECTION 5.8(A) AND SECTION 5.8(B) ARE INTENDED TO BE IRREVOCABLE UNDER THE
LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK AND OF THE U.S. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t5.9 Specific Performance. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and that the parties
hereto shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
of this Agreement or to enforce specifically the performance of the
terms \t\t

any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same
effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.
This Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto shall have
received a counterpart of this Agreement signed by all of the other parties
hereto. Until and unless each party hereto has received a counterpart of this
Agreement signed by all of the other parties hereto, this Agreement shall have
no effect and no party hereto shall have any right or obligation hereunder
(whether by virtue of any other oral or written agreement or other
communication). The exchange of a fully executed Agreement by electronic
transmission in .PDF format shall be sufficient to bind the parties hereto to

 \t\t\t5.11 Descriptive Headings. The descriptive headings used herein
are inserted for convenience of reference only and are not intended to be part
of or to affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t5.12 Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or
restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or
other Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the
remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be
affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance
of the Transactions is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party hereto. Upon such a determination, the parties hereto shall negotiate
in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of
the parties hereto as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order
that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement be consummated as
originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t5.13 Other. Nothing contained herein, and no action taken by any
Shareholder pursuant hereto, shall be deemed to constitute the parties as a
partnership, an association, a joint venture or any other kind of entity, or
create a presumption that the parties are in any way acting in concert or as a
group with respect to the obligations or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t5.14 Disclosure. The Shareholder (i) consents to and authorizes
the publication and disclosure by Parent and the Company of the Shareholder's
identity and holding and legal or beneficial ownership of the Parent Owned
Shares and the nature of its commitments and obligations under this Agreement
in any press release and in any disclosure required by the SEC or other
Governmental Authority, including the Registration Statement and the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus, and any amendment or supplement to either of them,
and (ii) agrees promptly to give to Parent and the Company any additional
information Parent or the Company may reasonably request for the preparation
of any such disclosure documents so long as such information is required by
Applicable Law to be disclosed therein. Nothing in this Agreement shall
preclude any Shareholder from making such filings as are required by
Applicable Law in connection with the entering into of this Agreement,
including an amendment to any Schedule 13D or Schedule 13G previously filed by
any Shareholder with the SEC. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t5.15 No Ownership Interest. Nothing contained in this Agreement
shall be deemed to vest in the Company any direct or indirect ownership or
incidence of ownership of or with \t\t

 \t\t\t5.16 Further Assurances. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, upon request of the Parent, the Shareholder shall use
