"), among MORGANS HOTEL GROUP CO., a Delaware corporation (" _Monroe_ "),

respective stockholders or members (as applicable) that Trousdale acquire
Monroe;

 

WHEREAS the acquisition of Monroe by Trousdale shall be effected under the
terms of this Agreement through the Merger;

 

WHEREAS, in furtherance thereof, the board of directors or board of managers
(as applicable) of each of Monroe, Trousdale and Sub-S has declared advisable
and approved this Agreement and the Merger, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, pursuant to which each share of Monroe

will be converted into the right to receive $2.25 per share in cash;

WHEREAS, prior to the Closing, the Rollover Investor will contribute to

WHEREAS, in connection with the transactions contemplated hereunder,
concurrent with the execution and delivery hereof, certain holders of Monroe
Common Stock are entering into voting agreements with Trousdale in support of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Monroe Voting
Agreements_ " and together with this Agreement and the Rollover Letter, the "
_Transaction Agreements_ "); and

WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Transactions and
also to prescribe various conditions to the Merger.

NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

 

[Intentionally Omitted.] ARTICLE II

 

 _The Merger; Certain Related Matters_

 

SECTION 2.01. _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the Delaware General
Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_ "), Sub-S shall be merged with and into Monroe
(the " _Merger_ "). Monroe shall be the surviving corporation in the Merger
and shall continue its corporate existence under the laws of the State of
Delaware (the " _Surviving Corporation_ "). The Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Rollover Investment, are
referred to in this Agreement collectively as the " _Transactions_ ".

SECTION 2.02. _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall
take place at the offices of OÂ’Melveny and Myers LLP, 400 South Hope Street,
Los Angeles, CA 90071 at 7:00 a.m. local time on the second (2nd) business day
following the satisfaction (or, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law,
waiver by all parties) of the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing), or
at such other place, time and date as shall be agreed in writing between
Monroe and Trousdale. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to in
this Agreement as the " _Closing Date_ ".

SECTION 2.03. _Effective Time_. Prior to the Closing, the parties shall
prepare, and on the Closing Date, the parties shall file the Certificate of
Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in such form as is
required by and executed and acknowledged in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the DGCL and make all other filings or recordings required under
the DGCL. The parties shall agree on and specify such time on the Closing Date
that the Merger shall become effective (the " _Effective Time_ ") in the
certificate of merger relating to the Merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_
"), which time shall be consistent with Section 2.01.

 

SECTION 2.04. _Effects_. The effects of the Merger shall be as provided in
this Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. 

SECTION 2.05. _Organizational Documents_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of Monroe shall be
amended and restated to be in the form attached as Exhibit A, and, as so
amended and restated, such certificate of incorporation shall be the
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, until thereafter
amended as provided therein or by Applicable Law, in each case consistent
with the obligations set forth in Section 6.07.

(b) At the Effective Time, and without any further action on the part
of Monroe and Sub-S, the bylaws of Sub-S in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, until
thereafter amended as provided therein or by Applicable Law, in each case
consistent with the obligations set forth in Section 6.07.

SECTION 2.06. _Officers and Directors_.

 

(a) The directors of Sub-S immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
the directors of the Surviving Corporation, until the earlier of their
resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected
or appointed and qualified, as the case may be.

 



2 (b) The officers of Sub-S immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
the officers of the Surviving Corporation, until the earlier of their
resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected
or appointed and qualified, as the case may be, until the earlier of their
resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected
or appointed and qualified, as the case may be.

SECTION 2.07. _Effect on Monroe Capital Stock_. As of the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any
shares of Monroe Common Stock or any shares of capital stock of Sub-S:

 

(a) _Capital Stock of Sub-S_. Each issued and outstanding share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Sub-S shall be converted into one fully
paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.

 

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock_. Each share of Monroe Common Stock issued
and owned or held by Monroe, Trousdale or any of their wholly-owned
subsidiaries at the Effective Time, including the Rollover Shares (the "
_Cancelled Shares_ ") shall, by virtue of the Merger, cease to be outstanding
and shall be cancelled and retired, and no consideration shall be delivered
in exchange therefor (except with respect to the Rollover Investor as set
forth in the Rollover Letter in respect of the Rollover Shares).

 

(c) _Treatment of Monroe Common Stock_. Each outstanding share of Monroe
Common Stock (other than Cancelled Shares and Dissenting Shares) shall be
canceled and automatically converted into the right to receive $2.25 (the "
_Merger Consideration_ "). As a result of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the holders thereof, at the Effective Time and by virtue of the
Merger, all shares of Monroe Common Stock shall be cancelled and retired and
shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate which immediately prior
to the Effective Time represented any such shares of Monroe Common Stock (a "
_Monroe Certificate_ ") and each holder of a Book-Entry Share that represented
such shares of Monroe Common Stock shall thereafter cease to have any rights
with respect to such shares of Monroe Common Stock, except the right (subject
to Section 2.07(b) and Section 2.08) to receive the Merger Consideration with
respect thereto, without interest thereon, upon compliance with the procedures
described in Section 2.11.

 

(d) _Treatment of Monroe Series A Preferred Stock_. Immediately prior to the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
the holder of any shares of Monroe Series A Preferred Securities, each
outstanding share of Monroe Series A Preferred Securities shall be contributed
to Holdco in exchange for the right to receive equity of Holdco in accordance
with the Rollover Letter.

(e) _Treatment of Non-Managing Member Units_. At the Effective Time,
each Non-Managing Member Unit shall be canceled and automatically converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration and each holder of a Non-
Managing Member Unit shall thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to
such Non-Managing Member Units, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration with respect thereto, without interest thereon. Prior to the
Effective Time, Monroe shall, and shall cause the Monroe Group to, effect a
Forced Conversion (as defined in the Monroe Group LLC

 



3  Agreement) of all outstanding LTIP Units into Non-Managing Member Units in
accordance with the terms of the Monroe Group LLC Agreement. For the purposes
of this Section 2.07(e), a Non-Managing Member Unit is a Membership Unit (as
defined in the Monroe Group LLC Agreement) held by a Non-Managing Member (as
defined in the Monroe Group LLC Agreement) that is not an LTIP Unit (as
defined in the Monroe Group LLC Agreement).

 

(f) _Treatment of Monroe Equity Awards_. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Monroe Board (or, if appropriate, any committee administering the Monroe
Stock Plan) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions as may be
required to effect the following:

 

(i) At the Effective Time, each Monroe Employee Stock Option, whether vested
or unvested, that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, automatically and without any action on the part of the
holder thereof, be canceled at the Effective Time, with the holder of such
Monroe Employee Stock Option becoming entitled to receive an amount in cash
equal to (A) the excess, if any, of (1) the Merger Consideration over (2) the
exercise price per share of Monroe Common Stock subject to such Monroe
Employee Stock Option, multiplied by (B) the number of shares of
Monroe Common Stock subject to such Monroe Employee Stock Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time (the " _Monroe Option Cash Payment_ "). The
Surviving Corporation shall cause each Monroe Option Cash Payment to be paid,
less any required withholding Taxes, as promptly as practicable following the
Effective Time. For the avoidance of doubt, if the exercise price per share of
any Monroe Employee Stock Option equals or exceeds the Merger Consideration,
such Monroe Employee Stock Option shall be canceled at the Effective Time for
no consideration.

(ii) At the Effective Time, each Monroe RSU Award, whether vested or
unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall,
automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be
canceled at the Effective Time, with the holder of such Monroe RSU
Award becoming entitled to receive an amount in cash equal to (A) the Merger
Consideration, multiplied by (B) the number of shares of Monroe Common Stock
subject to such Monroe RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time
(the " _Monroe RSU Award Cash Payment_ "). The Surviving Corporation shall
cause each Monroe RSU Award Cash Payment to be paid, less any required
withholding Taxes, as promptly as practicable following the Effective Time;
provided, that notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, any payment in respect of a Monroe RSU Award which immediately
prior to such cancellation constituted nonqualified deferred compensation
subject to Section 409A of the Code shall be made on the applicable
settlement date for such Monroe RSU Award if required in order to comply with
Section 409A of the Code.

 



4 (iii) As of the Effective Time, all Monroe Employee Stock Options and Monroe
RSU Awards shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically cease to
exist, and each holder of a Monroe Employee Stock Option and Monroe RSU Award
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive, in respect of a Monroe Employee Stock Option with an exercise price
per share of Monroe Common Stock that is less than the Merger Consideration,
the Monroe Option Cash Payment, and in respect of a Monroe RSU Award, the
Monroe RSU Award Cash Payment. Prior to the Effective Time, the Monroe Board
(or, if appropriate, any committee administering the Monroe Stock Plan) shall
adopt such resolutions and take such other actions to terminate the Monroe
Stock Plan upon the Effective Time.

 

(iv) In this Agreement:

 

" _Monroe Employee Stock Option_ " means any option to purchase Monroe Common
Stock granted under any Monroe Stock Plan.

" _Monroe RSU Award_ " means any restricted stock unit award granted under any
Monroe Stock Plan.

 

" _Monroe LTIP Award_ " means any long-term incentive plan unit award or other
award with respect to the membership interests of Monroe Group LLC.

" _Monroe Stock Plan_ " means the Monroe Amended and Restated 2007 Omnibus
Incentive Plan and any other Monroe equity incentive plan.

SECTION 2.08. _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, the shares of Monroe Common Stock outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who is entitled to demand and
has properly demanded appraisal for such shares of Monroe Common Stock
in accordance with, and who complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the
DGCL (such Shares, the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and shall instead represent
the right to receive payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in
accordance with and to the extent provided by Section 262 of the DGCL. If any
such holder fails to perfect or otherwise waives, withdraws or loses his right
to appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL or other Applicable Law, then the
right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such Dissenting Shares shall
cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted, as of
the Effective Time, into and shall be exchangeable solely for the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, without interest. Monroe shall give
Trousdale prompt notice of any demands received by Monroe for appraisal of
shares of Monroe Common Stock, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any
other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by Monroe relating
to rights to be paid the fair value of Dissenting Shares, and Trousdale shall
have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, Monroe shall not, except
with the prior written consent of Trousdale, make any payment with respect to,
or settle or compromise or offer to settle or compromise, any such demands,
or approve any withdrawal of any such demands, or agree to do any of the
foregoing.

 



5 SECTION 2.09. _Adjustments_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if between the
date of this Agreement and the Effective Time the outstanding shares of
Monroe Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares
(other than, for the avoidance of doubt, as a result of the exercise of any
convertible or exchangeable securities of Monroe) or class or series of
stock, by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification,
recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of shares, or any similar
event shall have occurred, then any number or amount contained herein which
is based upon the number of shares of Monroe Common Stock will be
appropriately adjusted to provide to the holders of Monroe Common Stock the
same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

 

SECTION 2.10. _Paying Agent Fund_. Prior to the Effective Time, Trousdale
shall appoint a commercial bank or trust company to act as paying agent
hereunder for the purpose of exchanging Monroe Certificates for the applicable
Merger Consideration (the " _Paying Agent_ "). At or promptly after the
Effective Time, Trousdale shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with
the Paying Agent, in trust for the benefit of holders of shares of Monroe
Common Stock (other than Cancelled Shares or Dissenting Shares) with the
Paying Agent the aggregate Merger Consideration to which holders of shares of
Monroe Common Stock shall be entitled at the Effective Time pursuant to this
Agreement (the " _Paying Agent Fund_ "). Earnings from such investments shall
be the sole and exclusive property of Trousdale, and no part of such earnings
shall accrue to the benefit of holders of shares of Monroe Common Stock.

SECTION 2.11. _Surrender Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective
Time, Trousdale shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record
of a Monroe Certificate or non-certificated shares of Monroe Common Stock
represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") (i) a letter of
transmittal which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Monroe Certificates shall pass, only upon proper
delivery of the Monroe Certificates to the Paying Agent, and which letter
shall be in customary form and have such other provisions as Trousdale may
reasonably specify and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of such
Monroe Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger
Consideration. Upon surrender of a Monroe Certificate or Book-Entry Shares to
the Paying Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and
completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of
such Monroe Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive the
Merger Consideration for each share of Monroe Common Stock formerly
represented by such Monroe Certificates or for each Book-Entry Share. Any
Monroe Certificates and Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. No interest will be paid or will accrue on any Merger
Consideration. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Monroe Common Stock
which is not registered in the transfer records of Monroe, the Merger
Consideration may be paid with respect to such Monroe Common Stock to such a
transferee if the Monroe Certificate representing such shares of Monroe Common
Stock is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents required
to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable
stock transfer taxes have been paid. Payment of the Merger Consideration with
respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the person in whose name
such Book-Entry Shares are registered. Until surrendered as contemplated
hereby, each Monroe Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration in cash as contemplated by this Agreement, without
interest thereon.

 



6 SECTION 2.12. _Stock Transfer Books_. The stock transfer books of Monroe shall
be closed immediately upon the Effective Time and thereafter there shall be
no further registration of transfers on the records of Monroe of shares of
Monroe Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time. On or after the Effective Time, any Monroe Certificates presented to
the Paying Agent or Trousdale for any reason shall represent only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of Monroe Common
Stock formerly represented thereby.

 

SECTION 2.13. _No Further Ownership Rights in Monroe Common Stock_. From and

Monroe Common Stock for a period of two years after the Effective Time (or

Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of
Monroe Common Stock formerly represented thereby.

SECTION 2.19. _Withholding Rights_. Trousdale (or its agents) shall be

Code and the Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of
state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by
Trousdale (or its agents) and paid over to the appropriate Governmental
Entity, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Monroe Common

 _Representations and Warranties of Monroe_

 

Except as disclosed in the Filed Monroe SEC Documents (excluding any
disclosures in any risk factors section that do not constitute statements of
fact, disclosures in any forward-looking statements disclaimer and other
disclosures that are generally cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in
nature) or in the Monroe Disclosure Letter, Monroe represents and warrants to
Trousdale as follows:

SECTION 3.01. _Organization, Standing and Power_. Each of Monroe and each
Significant Monroe Subsidiary is duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is organized and has
full corporate power and authority and possesses all governmental franchises,
licenses, permits, authorizations and approvals necessary to enable it to
own, lease or otherwise hold its properties and assets and to conduct its
businesses as presently conducted, other than such franchises, licenses,
permits, authorizations and approvals the lack of which, individually or in
the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on Monroe (a " _Monroe Material Adverse Effect_ ").
Monroe and each Significant Monroe Subsidiary is duly qualified to do business
in each jurisdiction where the nature of its business or its ownership or
leasing of its properties make such qualification necessary or the failure to
so qualify has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Monroe Material
Adverse Effect. Monroe has made available to Trousdale true and complete
copies of the amended and restated certificate of incorporation of Monroe, as
amended to the date of this Agreement (as so amended, the " _Monroe Charter_
"), and the bylaws of Monroe, as amended to the date of this Agreement (as so
amended, the " _Monroe Bylaws_ "), and the comparable charter and
organizational documents of each Significant Monroe Subsidiary, in each case
as amended through the date of this Agreement. For purposes of this
Agreement, a " _Significant Monroe Subsidiary_ " means any subsidiary of
Monroe that constitutes a significant subsidiary within the meaning of Rule
1-02 of Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_
").

 



8 SECTION 3.02. _Monroe Subsidiaries; Equity Interests_.

 

(a) The letter, dated as of the date of this Agreement, from Monroe to
Trousdale (the " _Monroe Disclosure Letter_ ") lists each Significant Monroe
Subsidiary as of the date of this Agreement and its jurisdiction of
organization. All the outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity
interests of each Significant Monroe Subsidiary have been validly issued and
are fully paid and nonassessable and, except as set forth in the Monroe
Disclosure Letter, are as of the date of this Agreement owned by Monroe, by
another subsidiary of Monroe (a " _Monroe Subsidiary_ ") or by Monroe and
another Monroe Subsidiary, free and clear of all pledges, liens, charges,
mortgages, encumbrances and security interests of any kind or nature
whatsoever (collectively, " _Liens_ ").

 

(b) Except for its interests in the Monroe Subsidiaries and except for the
ownership interests set forth in the Monroe Disclosure Letter, Monroe does
not as of the date of this Agreement own, directly or indirectly, any capital
stock, membership interest, partnership interest, joint venture interest or
other equity interest with a fair market value as of the date of this
Agreement in excess of $50,000 in any person.

SECTION 3.03. _Capital Structure_.

 

(a) The authorized capital stock of Monroe consists of 200,000,000 shares of
common stock, $0.01 par value per share (the " _Monroe Common Stock_ "), and
40,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share (the " _Monroe
Preferred Stock_ ", together with the Monroe Common Stock, the " _Monroe
Capital Stock_ "). Of the 40,000,000 shares of Monroe Preferred Stock, 75,000
shares have been designated as Series A preferred securities (the " _Monroe
Series A Preferred Securities_ "). At the close of business on the last
business day immediately prior to the date hereof, (i) 34,768,044 shares of

LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, effective February 17, 2006, as
amended (the " _Monroe Group LLC Agreement_ "), (viii) 75,446 Membership Units

shares of Monroe Common Stock were reserved for issuance pursuant to
the Monroe Stock Plan. Except as set forth above, as of the date of this

9  other voting securities of Monroe were issued, reserved for issuance or
outstanding. All outstanding shares of Monroe Capital Stock are, and all such
shares that may be issued prior to the Effective Time will be when issued,
duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and not subject
to or issued in violation of any purchase option, call option, right of first
refusal, preemptive right, subscription right or any similar right under any
provision of the DGCL, the Monroe Charter, the Monroe Bylaws or any Contract

debentures, notes or other indebtedness of Monroe having the right to

Agreement, there are not any options, warrants, rights, convertible or
exchangeable securities, "phantom" stock rights, stock appreciation rights,

Monroe Debt, (ii) obligating Monroe to issue, grant, extend or enter into any
such option, warrant, call, right, security, commitment, Contract,

Monroe to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of capital stock
of Monroe. There are no voting trusts or other agreements or understandings to
which Monroe or its subsidiaries is a party with respect to the voting of the

Monroe nor any of its subsidiaries has granted any preemptive rights, anti-
dilutive rights or rights of first refusal, registration rights or similar
rights with respect to shares of capital stock that are in effect.

SECTION 3.04. _Authority; Execution and Delivery; Enforceability_.

 



10 (a) Monroe has all requisite corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement and to consummate the Transactions. The execution and
delivery by Monroe of this Agreement and the consummation by Monroe of the
Transactions have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on
the part of Monroe, subject, in the case of the Merger, to receipt of the
Monroe Stockholder Approval. Monroe has duly executed and delivered this
Agreement, and this Agreement constitutes its legal, valid and binding
obligation, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, subject to
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and
similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditorsÂ’
rights generally and to general equity principles (the " _Bankruptcy and

of Monroe and its stockholders, (iii) recommending that MonroeÂ’s stockholders
adopt this Agreement and approving the inclusion of this recommendation in the
Proxy Statement, and (iv) approving and declaring that this Agreement is
advisable. Such resolutions are sufficient to render inapplicable to the
Transaction Agreements and the Transactions the restrictions contained in
Section 203 of the DGCL. To MonroeÂ’s knowledge, no other state takeover
statute or similar statute or regulation applies or purports to apply to
Monroe with respect to the Transaction Agreements or the Transactions.

Monroe Common Stock, voting together as a single class, and (ii) the adoption
of this Agreement by the holders of a majority of the outstanding Monroe
Series A Preferred Securities, voting as a separate class (collectively, the "
_Monroe Stockholder Approval_ "). Other than the Monroe Stockholder Approval,

which may be necessary to approve and adopt this Agreement and the Merger or
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby is the written consent of
Yardley which may be required pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement,
dated as of October 15, 2009, by and among Monroe, Yucaipa American Alliance
Fund II, L.P. and Yucaipa American Alliance (Parallel) Fund II, L.P.,
(collectively, " _Yardley_ ").

SECTION 3.05. _No Conflicts; Consents_.

 

(a) Except as set forth in the Monroe Disclosure Letter, the execution and
delivery by Monroe of this Agreement, does not, and the consummation of the
Transactions and compliance with the terms hereof will not, conflict with, or
result in any violation of or default (with or without notice or lapse of
time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of termination, cancelation or
acceleration of any obligation or to loss of a material benefit under, or to
increased, additional, accelerated or guaranteed rights or entitlements of any
person under, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the 

 



11  properties or assets of Monroe or any Monroe Subsidiary under, any provision
of (i) the Monroe Charter, the Monroe Bylaws or the comparable charter or
organizational documents of any Monroe Subsidiary, (ii) any material
contract, lease, license, indenture, note, bond, agreement, permit,
concession, franchise or other instrument (a " _Contract_ ") to which Monroe
or any Monroe Subsidiary is a party or by which any of their respective
properties or assets is bound or (iii) subject to the filings and other
matters referred to in Section 3.05(b), any judgment, order or decree ("
_Judgment_ ") or statute, law (including common law), ordinance, rule or
regulation (" _Applicable Law_ ") applicable to Monroe or any Monroe
Subsidiary or their respective properties or assets, other than, in the case
of clauses (ii) and (iii) above, any such items that, individually or in the
aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Monroe
Material Adverse Effect (it being agreed that for purposes of this Section
3.05(b), clause (i) of the definition of the term " _material adverse effect_
", shall not be excluded in determining whether a Monroe Material Adverse
Effect has occurred or would reasonably be expected to occur).

 

(b) No material consent, approval, license, permit, order or authorization ("
_Consent_ ") of, or registration, declaration or filing with, or permit from,
any federal, state, local or foreign government or any court of competent
jurisdiction, administrative agency or commission or other governmental
authority or instrumentality, domestic or foreign (a " _Governmental Entity_
") is required to be obtained or made by or with respect to Monroe or any
Monroe Subsidiary in connection with the execution, delivery and performance
of this Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions, other than (i)
compliance with and filings under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements
Act of 1976, as amended (the " _HSR Act_ ") and the similar antitrust laws of
other jurisdictions, (ii) the filing with the SEC of (A) the Proxy Statement,
(B) the Rule 13E-3 transaction statement on Schedule 13E-3 relating to the
Transactions (as amended or supplemented from time to time, the " _Schedule
13E-3_ ") and (C) such reports under Section 13 of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ "), as may be required in
connection with the Transaction Agreements and the Transactions, (iii) the
filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware and appropriate documents with the relevant authorities of the
other jurisdictions in which Monroe is qualified to do business and (iv) such

_material adverse effect_ ", shall not be excluded in determining whether a
Monroe Material Adverse Effect has occurred or would reasonably be expected
to occur).

SECTION 3.06. _SEC Documents; Undisclosed Liabilities_. Monroe has filed all
registration statements, prospectuses, reports, schedules, forms,
certifications, statements and other documents (including exhibits and other
information incorporated therein) required to be filed by Monroe with the SEC
since January 1, 2015, pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Exchange
Act (the " _Monroe SEC Documents_ "). As of its respective date, each Monroe
SEC Document complied in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Exchange 

 



12  Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act or the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "
_Securities Act_ "), as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of the
SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to such Monroe SEC Document. Except to
the extent that information contained in any Monroe SEC Document has been
revised, amended or superseded by a later filed Monroe SEC Document, none of
the Monroe SEC Documents at the time filed (or if amended prior to the date
hereof, as of the date of such amendment) contained any untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. To the knowledge of
Monroe, none of the Monroe SEC Documents is the subject of any outstanding SEC
comment or outstanding SEC investigation. Monroe has, prior to the date
hereof, provided Trousdale with correct and complete copies of all SEC
comment letters received and response letters submitted and other written
correspondence with the SEC with respect to the Monroe SEC Documents within
one year prior to the date of this Agreement to the extent such comments
letters, response letters and correspondence are not publicly available. The
consolidated financial statements of Monroe included in the Monroe SEC
Documents comply as to form in all material respects with applicable
accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC
with respect thereto, have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") applied on a consistent basis during the
periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto and in the
case of unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC and for
normal and recurring year-end adjustments that are not material in the
aggregate) and fairly present, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of Monroe and its consolidated subsidiaries as of the dates
thereof and the consolidated results of their operations and cash flows for
the periods then ended. Except as set forth in the Filed Monroe SEC
Documents, as of the date of this Agreement neither Monroe nor any Monroe
Subsidiary has any liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether accrued,
absolute, contingent or otherwise) required by GAAP to be set forth on a
consolidated balance sheet of Monroe and its consolidated subsidiaries or in
the notes thereto and that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably
be expected to have a Monroe Material Adverse Effect. None of the Monroe
Subsidiaries is, or has at any time since January 1, 2015, been, subject to
the reporting requirements of Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Exchange Act.

 

SECTION 3.07. _Information Supplied_.

 

(a) None of the information supplied or to be supplied by or on behalf of
Monroe for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement or
the Schedule 13E-3 will, (i) in the case of the Proxy Statement, on the date
that it (and any amendment or supplement thereto) is first mailed to MonroeÂ’s
stockholders and at the time of the Monroe Stockholders Meeting, and (ii) in
the case of the Schedule 13E-3, at the time such document or any amendment or
supplement thereto is filed with the SEC or at the time of the Monroe
Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit

to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading and Monroe will correct any information provided by
it or on its behalf for use in the Proxy Statement and in the Schedule 13E-3
which shall have become false or misleading.

 



13 (b) Notwithstanding Section 3.07(a), no representation or warranty is made by
Monroe with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference in the
Proxy Statement or the Schedule 13E-3 based on information supplied by
Trousdale for inclusion or incorporation by reference therein.

necessary to permit Monroe and the Monroe Subsidiaries to conduct their
business as currently conducted. As of the date hereof, (i) neither Monroe nor
any Monroe Subsidiary has received notice of any pending, and (ii) to the
knowledge of Monroe there is no threatened, condemnation proceeding with
respect to any real property owned, leased or operated by Monroe or any Monroe
Subsidiary. Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have
or reasonably be expected to have a Monroe Material Adverse Effect, Monroe
and the Monroe Subsidiaries (x) are not in material breach or default under
any lease, sublease or license for an interest in leased real property
material to Monroe or the Monroe Subsidiaries, taken as a whole and (y) have
not leased or otherwise granted to any person the right to use or occupy any
leased real property or any portion thereof.

opinion.

representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, none of Monroe,
any of its Subsidiaries, MonroeÂ’s affiliates nor any other person makes any
express or implied representation or warranty on behalf of Monroe, its

its Subsidiaries and MonroeÂ’s affiliates hereby disclaims any such

 _Representations and Warranties of Trousdale and Sub-S_

 

Except as disclosed in the letter, dated as of the date of this Agreement,
from Trousdale to Monroe (the " _Trousdale Disclosure Letter_ "), each of
Trousdale and Sub-S represents and warrants to Monroe as follows:

hold its properties and assets and to conduct its businesses as presently

and approvals the lack of which,

 



26  individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect on Trousdale (a " _Trousdale
Material Adverse Effect_ "). Trousdale and Sub-S are duly qualified to do
business in each jurisdiction where the nature of its business or its
ownership or leasing of its properties make such qualification necessary or

termination, cancelation or acceleration of any obligation or to loss of a
material benefit under, or to increased, additional, accelerated or guaranteed
rights or entitlements of any person under, or result in the creation of any

that for purposes of this Section 4.03(b), clause (i) of the definition of
the term " _material adverse effect_ ", shall not be excluded in determining
whether a Trousdale Material Adverse Effect has occurred or would reasonably
be expected to occur). 

SECTION 4.04. _Information Supplied_.

 

(a) None of the information supplied or to be supplied by or on behalf of
Trousdale for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement
or the Schedule 13E-3 will, (i) in the case of the Proxy Statement, on the
date that it (and any amendment or supplement thereto) is first mailed to
MonroeÂ’s stockholders and at the time of the Monroe Stockholders Meeting, and

or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading and Trousdale will correct any
information provided by it or on its behalf for use in the Proxy Statement
and in the Schedule 13E-3 which shall have become false or misleading.

(b) Notwithstanding Section 4.04(a), no representation or warranty is made by

Proxy Statement or the Schedule 13E-3 based on information supplied by Monroe
for inclusion or incorporation by reference therein.

other Transactions based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Trousdale.

between Trousdale and Houlihan Lokey relating to the Merger and the other

28 SECTION 4.06. _Financing_

 

(a) Trousdale has delivered to Monroe a true, complete and correct copy of the
executed commitment letter of even date herewith (the " _Equity Commitment
Letter_ ") from Cain Hoy Enterprises LP (the " _Equity Financing Source_ ")
pursuant to which the Equity Financing Source has committed to provide,
subject only to the terms and conditions expressly set forth therein, equity
financing for the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement in the aggregate amount set forth therein (the " _Equity Financing_
"). The Equity Commitment Letter provides that Monroe is entitled to the
enforcement of such agreement in connection with MonroeÂ’s exercise of its
rights under Section 9.11, subject only to the express terms and conditions
thereof. The Debt Financing Source has provided to SBE a guarantee, subject
to the same conditions as the equity financing set forth in the Equity
Commitment Letter, of the commitment set forth in the Equity Commitment Letter
(the " _Guarantee_ "), and such guarantee shall terminate only if the Equity
Commitment Letter is validly terminated. Each of the Equity Commitment Letter
and the Guarantee, in the form so delivered to Monroe, is in full force and
effect and is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Trousdale and
the counterparty there to, enforceable against the parties thereto in
accordance with its terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the Equity Commitment Letter and the
Guarantee may be specifically enforced by Monroe against the Equity Financing
Source and the Guarantor in connection with MonroeÂ’s exercise of its rights
under Section 9.11.

 

(b) Trousdale has delivered to Monroe a true, complete and correct copy of the
executed commitment letter of even date herewith (the " _Debt Commitment
Letter_ " and together with the Equity Commitment Letter and the Guarantee,
each a " _Commitment Letter_ " and together the " _Commitment Letters_ "),
pursuant to which Security Benefit Corporation (the " _Debt Financing Source_
" and together with the Equity Financing Source, the " _Financing Sources_ ")
has committed to provide, subject only to the terms and conditions expressly
set forth therein, debt financing for the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement in the aggregate amount set forth therein (the
" _Debt Financing_ " and together with the Equity Financing, the " _Financing_
"). The Commitment Letters have not been amended, supplemented or modified
prior to the date of this Agreement, no such amendment or modification is
contemplated, and, as of the date hereof, the commitments contained in the
Commitment Letters have not been withdrawn or rescinded in any respect (and
no such withdrawal or rescission is contemplated). Except for any fee
arrangements with respect to the Financing, the complete copies of which have
been disclosed in full to Monroe, as of the date hereof there are no side
letters or other Contracts, or any other arrangements or understandings
related to the Financing. Trousdale has fully paid any and all commitment fees
or other fees in connection with the Commitment Letters that are payable on
or prior to the date hereof, and as of the date hereof, the Commitment
Letters, in the form so delivered to Monroe, are in full force and effect and
are the legal, valid, binding and enforceable obligation of Trousdale, and, to
the knowledge of Trousdale, each of the other parties thereto, subject to the
Bankruptcy and Equity Exception. There are no conditions precedent or other
contractual contingencies related to the funding of the full amount of the
Financing, other than as expressly set forth in the Commitment Letters. As of
the date hereof, no event has occurred that would constitute a breach or
default (or with notice or lapse of time or both would constitute a default)
under the Commitment Letters, by Trousdale or, to the knowledge of Trousdale,
any other parties to the Commitment Letters, or would otherwise result in any
portion of the Financing contemplated thereby to be unavailable or delayed.
Trousdale has no reason to believe that any term or condition to
the Financing set forth in the Commitment Letters will not be fully satisfied
on a timely basis or that the Financing will not be available to Trousdale at
the Closing, including

 



29  any reason to believe that the Financing Sources will not perform their
respective funding obligations under the Commitment Letters in accordance with
their respective terms and conditions. As of the date hereof, Trousdale has
no reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Financing contemplated
by the Commitment Letters to be satisfied by Trousdale will not be satisfied
on or prior to the Closing Date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary,
the Debt Commitment Letter may be specifically enforced by Monroe against the
Debt Financing Source in connection with MonroeÂ’s exercise of its rights under
Section 9.11.

 

(c) The amount of funds to be provided pursuant to the Commitment Letters, if
funded in accordance with the terms thereof, will be sufficient to (i) pay
the Merger Consideration, (ii) pay any and all fees and expenses required to
be paid at the Closing by Trousdale, Sub-S or the Surviving Corporation, in
connection with the Merger and the Financing and (iii) any other amounts
required to be paid at the Closing in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, the amounts
described in clauses (i) through (iii), the " _Financing Uses_ ").

(d) In no event shall the receipt or availability of any funds or financing
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Financing) by Trousdale or any
affiliate of Trousdale or any other financing or other transactions be a
condition to any of TrousdaleÂ’s or Sub-SÂ’s obligations hereunder.

 

SECTION 4.07. _Available Funds_. Trousdale has available as of the date
hereof, and for so long as any Reverse Termination Fee obligations exist
pursuant to this Agreement, will have available sufficient funds to pay the
Reverse Termination Fee on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and to
perform its obligations with respect to the Reverse Termination Fee under
this Agreement.

SECTION 4.08. _Absence of Certain Agreements_. Other than pursuant to the
Monroe Voting Agreements and the Rollover Letter, none of Trousdale or any of
its affiliates has entered into any contract, arrangement or understanding (in
each case, whether oral or written), or authorized, committed or agreed to
enter into any contract, arrangement or understanding (in each case, whether
oral or written), with any (i) affiliate of Monroe, including any person
holding more than 5% of the issued and outstanding Monroe Common Stock or the
Monroe Series A Preferred Securities and any of MonroeÂ’s directors
or officers, or (ii) any person who is an affiliate of any such stockholder,
director or officer.

SECTION 4.09. [Intentionally Omitted.]

SECTION 4.10. _Solvency_. Assuming satisfaction of the conditions to
TrousdaleÂ’s obligation to consummate the Transactions, or waiver of such
conditions, and after giving effect to the Transactions, including the
Financing, any alternative financing and the payment of the aggregate Merger
Consideration, any other repayment or refinancing of debt contemplated in
this Agreement or the Commitment Letters, payment of all amounts required to
be paid in connection with the consummation of the Transactions, the Rollover
Investment and payment of all related fees and expenses, and assuming
the accuracy of all of the representations and warranties of Monroe set forth
herein, each of Trousdale and the Surviving Corporation will be Solvent as of
the Effective Time and immediately after the consummation of the Transactions.

 



30 " _Solvent_ " means that, with respect to any person, as of any date
of determination, (a) the amount of the "fair saleable value" of the assets
of such person will, as of such date, exceed the sum of (i) the value of all
"liabilities of such person, including contingent and other liabilities," as
of such date, as such quoted terms are generally determined in accordance with
applicable laws governing determinations of the insolvency of debtors, and
(ii) the amount that will be required to pay the probable liabilities of such
person, as of such date, on its existing debts (including contingent and other
liabilities) as such debts become absolute and mature, (b) such person will
not have, as of such date, an unreasonably small amount of capital for the
operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged
following such date, and (c) such person will be able to pay its liabilities,
as of such date, including contingent and other liabilities, as they mature.

 

SECTION 4.11. _No Other Representations or Warranties_. Except for the
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, none of
Trousdale, any of its Subsidiaries, TrousdaleÂ’s affiliates nor any other
person makes any express or implied representation or warranty on behalf of
Trousdale, its Subsidiaries or TrousdaleÂ’s affiliates or any other person, and
each of Trousdale, its Subsidiaries and TrousdaleÂ’s affiliates hereby
disclaims any such representation or warranty whether by Trousdale, its
Subsidiaries or its affiliates.

 

SECTION 4.12. _Rollover Investment_. Trousdale has delivered to Monroe a true,
complete and correct copy of the executed rollover commitment letter of even
date herewith (the " _Rollover Letter_ "), pursuant to which Yucaipa
Hospitality Investments, LLC (the " _Rollover Investor_ ") has committed to
contribute to Holdco, subject only to the terms and conditions expressly set
forth therein, the number of shares of Monroe Series A Preferred Securities
and the number of Monroe Warrants set forth therein (including all accrued and
unpaid dividends thereon, the " _Rollover Investment_ "; any such shares and
Monroe Warrants being rolled over pursuant to the Rollover Letter, the "
_Rollover Shares_ "). As of the date of this Agreement, the Rollover Letter
has not been amended, supplemented or modified prior to the date of this
Agreement, no such amendment or modification is contemplated, and, as of the
date hereof, none of the commitments contained in the Rollover Letter has been
withdrawn, terminated or rescinded in any respect (and no such withdrawal,
termination or rescission is contemplated). The Rollover Letter provides that
Monroe is a third-party beneficiary thereof and is entitled to enforce such
agreement in connection with MonroeÂ’s exercise of its rights under Section
9.11, subject only to the express terms and conditions thereof. As of the
date of this Agreement, the Rollover Letter, in the form so delivered to
Monroe, is in full force and effect and is a legal, valid, binding and
enforceable obligation of Trousdale and Sub-S and the other parties thereto.
There are no side letters or other agreements, arrangements, contracts or
understandings relating to the Rollover Investment other than as expressly set
forth in the Rollover Letter. The only conditions precedent or
other contingencies related to the obligations of the Rollover Investor to
make the Rollover Investment are those expressly set forth in the Rollover
Letter. As of the date of this Agreement, no event has occurred which, with or
without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or breach
on the part of Trousdale, Sub-S, any direct investor in Trousdale or any of
the other parties to the Rollover Letter under any term, or a failure of any
condition, of the Rollover Letter or otherwise result in any portion of the
Rollover Investment contemplated thereby to be unavailable or delayed. As of
the date of this Agreement, none of Trousdale, Sub-S or any direct investor in
Trousdale has any reason to believe that any term or condition of the
Rollover Letter will not be fully satisfied on a timely basis. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary, the Rollover Letter may be specifically enforced by
Monroe against the Rollover Investor in connection with MonroeÂ’s exercise of
its rights under Section 9.11.

with respect to any Monroe Takeover Proposal or (iii) directly or indirectly
participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any
person any information with respect to, or take any other action to facilitate

_however_ , that prior to receipt of the Monroe Stockholder Approval, Monroe
and its Representatives may, to the extent required by the fiduciary
obligations of the Monroe Board, as determined in good faith by the Monroe
Board after consultation with outside counsel, in response to a Monroe
Takeover Proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior
Monroe Proposal that was not solicited by Monroe in violation of this
Agreement and that did not otherwise result from a breach or a deemed breach
of this Section 5.02(a), and subject to compliance with Section 5.02(c), (x)
furnish information with respect to Monroe to the person making such Monroe
Takeover Proposal and its Representatives pursuant to a confidentiality
agreement with confidentiality and other terms (other than any provisions
restricting a partyÂ’s ability to make private proposals to Monroe or

Confidentiality Agreement_ ") and (y) participate in discussions or
negotiations with such person and its Representatives regarding such Monroe
Takeover Proposal. Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any
intentional and material violation of the restrictions set forth in the
preceding sentence by any director, officer, legal counsel of Monroe or any
senior member of MonroeÂ’s financial advisor (or any non-senior member of
MonroeÂ’s financial advisor who Monroe fails to promptly prevent from violating
this Section 5.02 promptly after Monroe receives knowledge of such
violation), whether or not such person is purporting to act on behalf of
Monroe or any Monroe Subsidiary or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a breach
of this Section 5.02(a) by Monroe. Except as provided in this Section
5.02(a), Monroe shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, cease
immediately all discussions and negotiations regarding any proposal that
constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, a Monroe Takeover
Proposal and cause any third party (other than any financing sources for
Trousdale) to cease to have any access to any data room prepared by Monroe,
and shall direct that any third party return or destroy all confidential
information in such partyÂ’s possession.

(b) Neither the Monroe Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw or
modify in a manner adverse to Trousdale, or propose to withdraw or modify in
a manner adverse to Trousdale, the approval or recommendation by the Monroe
Board of this Agreement or the Merger, (ii) approve or cause or permit Monroe
or any of its subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent, agreement in
principle, acquisition agreement or similar agreement relating to any Monroe
Takeover Proposal (other than an Acceptable Monroe Confidentiality Agreement)
or (iii) approve or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, any Monroe
Takeover Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, prior to receipt of the
Monroe Stockholder Approval, Monroe receives a Superior Monroe Proposal and
the Monroe Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside
counsel, that it is necessary to do so in order to comply with its fiduciary
obligations, the Monroe Board may (x) withdraw or modify its approval or

 



36  recommendation of the Merger and this Agreement and, in connection
therewith, approve or recommend a Superior Monroe Proposal or (y) terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(d) to enter into a definitive
agreement providing for a Superior Monroe Proposal, in each case only if such
Superior Monroe Proposal did not result from a breach of this Section 5.02;
_provided_ that prior to withdrawing or modifying its approval or
recommendation of the Merger and this Agreement or terminating this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.01(d):

 

(A) Monroe shall have provided prior written notice to Trousdale, at least
four (4) business days in advance (such notice period, as it may be renewed
or extended pursuant to this Section 5.02(b), the " _Trousdale Match Period_
"), of its intention to withdraw or modify its approval or recommendation of
the Merger and this Agreement or to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.01(d), which notice shall specify the identity of the party making
such Superior Monroe Proposal and the material terms and conditions thereof
(or of any material modification thereto) and include an unredacted copy of
the Superior Monroe Proposal and an unredacted copy of the then-current
proposed draft definitive agreements providing for the Superior Monroe
Proposal;

 

(B) after providing such notice and prior to withdrawing or modifying its
approval or recommendation of the Merger and this Agreement or terminating
this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(d), Monroe shall, and shall cause its
Representatives to, negotiate with Trousdale in good faith (to the extent
Trousdale indicates in writing a desire to negotiate) to make
such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would
permit Monroe not to so withdraw or modify its approval or recommendation of
the Merger and this Agreement or to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.01(d); and

 

(C) the Monroe Board (after consulting with its financial advisor and outside
legal counsel) shall have considered in good faith any changes to this
Agreement offered in writing by Trousdale in a manner that would form a
binding agreement if accepted by Monroe and shall have determined that the
Superior Monroe Proposal would continue to constitute a Superior
Monroe Proposal if such changes were to be given effect;

_provided_ , _further_ , that, in the event of any material revision or
amendment to the terms of such Superior Monroe Proposal, Monroe shall be
required to deliver a new written notice to Trousdale and to comply with the
requirements of this Section 5.02(b) with respect to such new written
notice (except that the Trousdale Match Period shall be two (2) business days
with respect to each such new written notice).

 

(c) Monroe promptly and in no event later than forty-eight (48) hours after
receipt or delivery thereof shall advise Trousdale orally and in writing of
any Monroe Takeover Proposal or any inquiry with respect to or that could
reasonably be expected to lead to any Monroe Takeover Proposal, the identity
of the person making any such Monroe Takeover Proposal or inquiry and any
change to the material terms of any such

 



37  Monroe Takeover Proposal or inquiry. Monroe shall (i) keep Trousdale
reasonably informed of the status including any change to the material terms
of any such Monroe Takeover Proposal or inquiry and (ii) provide to Trousdale
as soon as practicable after receipt or delivery thereof with copies of all
correspondence and other written material sent or provided to Monroe from any
third party in connection with any Monroe Takeover Proposal or sent or
provided by Monroe to any third party in connection with any Monroe Takeover
Proposal.

(d) Nothing contained in this Section 5.02 shall prohibit Monroe from taking
and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act. Notwithstanding anything in this Section
5.02(d) or the last sentence of Section 5.02(b), the Monroe Board may not
take any action that violates this Section 5.02 and would result in MonroeÂ’s
stockholders no longer being legally capable under the DGCL of validly
adopting this Agreement.

 

(e) For purposes of this Agreement:

 

" _Monroe Takeover Proposal_ " means (i) any proposal or offer for a merger,
consolidation, dissolution, recapitalization or similar business combination
involving Monroe or any Significant Monroe Subsidiary, (ii) any proposal for
the issuance by Monroe of over 15% of any class of its equity securities as
consideration for the assets or securities of another person or (iii) any
proposal or offer to acquire in any manner, directly or indirectly, control of
over 15% of any class of the equity securities or consolidated total assets of
Monroe, in each case other than the Transactions.

 

" _Superior Monroe Proposal_ " means any proposal made by a third party to
acquire, through a tender or exchange offer, a merger, a consolidation, a
liquidation or dissolution, a recapitalization, a sale of its assets or
otherwise, (i) more than 50% of the aggregate voting power of the capital
stock of Monroe or of the surviving entity or the resulting direct or
indirect parent of Monroe or such surviving entity or (ii) more than 50%
(based on the fair market value thereof) of the assets (including capital
stock of the Monroe Subsidiaries) of Monroe and the Monroe Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, on terms which the Monroe Board determines in good faith to be
(a) superior from a financial point of view to the holders of Monroe Common
Stock than the Transactions and (b) reasonably capable of being completed,
taking into account all financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects of
such proposal.

(f) Monroe shall not fail to enforce or grant any waiver, amendment or
release under any standstill agreement (or any standstill provisions of any
other Contract or agreement with respect to Monroe Common Stock or other
equity securities of Monroe) unless the Monroe Board has determined in
good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the
failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent
the Monroe directorsÂ’ fiduciary duties under Delaware law and has provided
Trousdale with 48 hours prior written notice of MonroeÂ’s intent to take such
action (and to the extent any such waiver or release is granted or such
standstill agreement or such standstill provision of any other Contract is not
enforced, any standstill provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement shall be
deemed to be correspondingly waived or released or shall not be enforced, as
applicable).

 _Additional Agreements_

 

SECTION 6.01. _Preparation of the Proxy Statement and Schedule 13E-3;
Stockholders Meeting_.

 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable (but in any event within twenty (20)
business days after the date of this Agreement), Monroe shall prepare, in
consultation with Trousdale, and cause to be filed with the SEC the Proxy
Statement in preliminary form in connection with obtaining the Monroe
Stockholder Approval. Each of Monroe and Trousdale shall furnish
all information concerning itself, its affiliates and the holders of its
shares to the other and provide such other assistance as may be reasonably
requested in connection with the preparation, filing and distribution of the
Proxy Statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Monroe shall have no
responsibility with respect to information or statements made or incorporated
by reference in the Proxy Statement which were based on information supplied
by or on behalf of Trousdale.

 

(b) Monroe shall promptly notify Trousdale upon the receipt of any comments
from the SEC or any request from the SEC for amendments or supplements to the
Proxy Statement, and shall, as promptly as practicable after receipt thereof,
provide Trousdale with copies of all correspondence between Monroe and its
Representatives, on one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand, and all written
comments with respect to the Proxy Statement received by Monroe from the SEC
and advise Trousdale of any oral comments with respect to the Proxy Statement
received from the SEC. Monroe shall use its reasonable best efforts to
respond as promptly as practicable to any comments from the SEC with respect
to the Proxy Statement. Trousdale shall and shall cause its Representatives to
assist and cooperate with Monroe and its Representatives in the resolution of
any such comments from the SEC related thereto. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, prior to filing the preliminary and/or definitive draft of the
Proxy Statement with the SEC, mailing the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or
supplement thereto), or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect
thereto, Monroe shall provide Trousdale a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on such document or response in advance (including the proposed final
version of such document or response) and Monroe shall consider in good faith
any comments provided by Trousdale or any of its Representatives with respect
thereto.

(c) If, at any time prior to the receipt of the Monroe Stockholder Approval,
any information relating to Monroe or Trousdale, respectively, or any of their
respective affiliates, should be discovered by Monroe or Trousdale which, in
the reasonable judgment of Monroe or Trousdale, respectively, should be set
forth in an amendment of, or a supplement to, the Proxy Statement, so that any
of such documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made,

 



39  not misleading, the party hereto which discovers such information shall
promptly notify the other parties hereto, and Monroe and Trousdale shall
cooperate in the prompt filing with the SEC of any necessary amendment of, or
supplement to, the Proxy Statement and, to the extent required by Applicable
Law, in disseminating the information contained in such amendment or
supplement to shareholders of Monroe. Nothing in this Section 6.01(c) shall
limit the obligations of any party hereto under Section 6.01(b).

(d) For purposes of this Section 6.01, any information concerning or related
to Monroe, its affiliates or the Monroe Stockholder Meeting will be deemed to
have been provided by Monroe, and any information concerning or related to
Trousdale or its affiliates will be deemed to have been provided by
Trousdale.

(e) Monroe shall, as soon as reasonably practicable after the date hereof,
establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a
meeting of MonroeÂ’s stockholders (the " _Monroe Stockholders Meeting_ ") for
the purpose of seeking the Monroe Stockholder Approval. Once Monroe has
established a record date for the Monroe Stockholder Meeting, Monroe shall
not change such record date or establish a different record date without the
prior written consent of Trousdale, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned, or delayed. Monroe shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the stockholders of
Monroe entitled to vote at the Monroe Stockholder Meeting as promptly as
practicable after the date hereof and to hold the Monroe Stockholder Meeting
within forty-five (45) days of the initial mailing of the Proxy Statement and
confirmation from the SEC that it has no further comments on the Schedule
13E-3. Monroe may only, or at the written request of Trousdale shall, postpone
or adjourn the Monroe Stockholders Meeting for a period of no more than
thirty (30) days, and solely (i) to solicit additional proxies for the purpose
of obtaining the Monroe Stockholder Approval, (ii) for the absence of a quorum
and (iii) to allow reasonable additional time for the filing or mailing of
any supplemental or amended disclosure that Monroe has determined after
consultation with outside counsel is reasonably likely to be required under
Applicable Law and for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be
disseminated and reviewed by the Monroe stockholders prior to the Monroe
Stockholders Meeting. Monroe shall, through the Monroe Board, recommend to
MonroeÂ’s stockholders, including in the Proxy Statement and the Schedule
13E-3, that they give the Monroe Stockholder Approval, except to the extent
that the Monroe Board shall have withdrawn its approval or recommendation of
this Agreement or the Merger as permitted by Section 5.02(b). Except
as required by Applicable Law, Monroe shall not submit any other proposal to
its stockholders at the Monroe Stockholder Meeting without the prior written
consent of Trousdale, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Monroe agrees that its obligations pursuant to the first sentence of this
Section 6.01(e) shall not be affected by (i) the commencement, public
proposal, public disclosure or communication to Monroe of any Monroe Takeover
Proposal or (ii) the withdrawal by the Monroe Board of its approval or
recommendation of this Agreement or the Merger.

 



40 (f) Monroe and Trousdale shall cooperate to (i) concurrently with
the preparation and filing of the Proxy Statement, jointly prepare the
Schedule 13E-3 and file it with the SEC, and provide to each other all
information concerning such party as may be reasonably requested in connection
with the Schedule 13E-3, (ii) resolve any comments from the SEC or the staff
of the SEC, and provide each other with copies of all correspondence between
each party and its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or the staff
of the SEC, on the other hand, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably
practicable after consulting with each other, prepare and file any amendments
or supplements necessary to be filed in response to any such comments. Monroe
and Trousdale shall use reasonable best efforts to have cleared by the SEC
the Schedule 13E-3 as promptly as reasonably practicable after the filing
thereof.

SECTION 6.02. _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. Subject to Applicable
Law, upon reasonable prior notice, Monroe shall, and shall cause its
subsidiaries to, afford to Trousdale and to TrousdaleÂ’s Representatives,
reasonable access during normal business hours during the period prior to the
Effective Time to all their respective properties, books, contracts,
commitments, personnel and records and, during such period, Monroe shall, and
shall cause each of its subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to Trousdale and to
TrousdaleÂ’s Representatives (a) a copy of each report, schedule, registration
statement and other document filed by it during such period pursuant to the
requirements of federal or state securities laws and (b) all
other information concerning its business, properties and personnel as
Trousdale and TrousdaleÂ’s Representatives may reasonably request; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Monroe may withhold any document or information that is
subject to the terms of a confidentiality agreement with a third party or
such portions of documents or information relating to pricing or other matters
that are highly sensitive if the exchange of such documents (or portions
thereof) or information, as determined by MonroeÂ’s counsel, might reasonably
result in antitrust difficulties for Monroe (or any of its affiliates). If any
material is withheld by Monroe pursuant to the proviso to the preceding
sentence, Monroe shall inform Trousdale as to the general nature of what is
being withheld. In addition to, and without limitation of, the foregoing, from
the date hereof through the Closing Date or the date this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with Section 8.01, all information exchanged
pursuant to this Section 6.02 shall be subject to the confidentiality letter,
dated as of February 3, 2015, between Monroe and Trousdale (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

 

SECTION 6.03. _Reasonable Best Efforts; Notification_.

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of the parties shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and
cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner
practicable, the Transactions, including (i) the obtaining of all necessary
actions or nonactions, waivers, Consents and approvals from Governmental
Entities and the making of all necessary registrations and filings (including
filings with Governmental Entities, if any) and the taking of all reasonable
steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an
action or proceeding by, any Governmental Entity, (ii) the obtaining of all
necessary Consents, approvals or waivers from third parties, (iii) the
defending of any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or
administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the
Transactions, including seeking to have any stay or temporary restraining
order entered by any court or other Governmental Entity vacated or reversed

 



41  and (iv) the execution and/or delivery of any additional instruments
necessary to consummate the Transactions and to fully carry out the purposes
of the Transaction Agreements. In connection with and without limiting the
foregoing, Monroe shall (i) take all action necessary to ensure that no state
takeover statute or similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to
any Transaction or this Agreement and (ii) if any state takeover statute or
similar statute or regulation becomes applicable to any Transaction or this
Agreement, take all action necessary to ensure that the Merger may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by the
this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Monroe and its Representatives
shall not be prohibited under this Section 6.03(a) from taking any action
permitted by Section 5.02(b).

 

(b) Nothing in Section 6.03(a) shall require Trousdale to dispose of any of
its assets or to limit its freedom of action with respect to any of its
businesses, or to consent to any disposition of MonroeÂ’s assets or limits on
MonroeÂ’s freedom of action with respect to any of its businesses, or to commit
or agree to any of the foregoing, and nothing in Section 6.03(a) shall
authorize Monroe to commit or agree to any of the foregoing, to obtain any
Consents, approvals, permits or authorizations or to remove any impediments to
the Merger relating to the HSR Act or other antitrust, competition or
premerger notification, trade regulation law, regulation or order ("
_Antitrust Laws_ ") or to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of,
any injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in any suit or
proceeding relating to Antitrust Laws, other than dispositions, limitations
or Consents, commitments or agreements that in each such case may be
conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger and the Transactions and
which, in the reasonable judgment of Trousdale, individually or in the
aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to (i) have a
Trousdale Material Adverse Effect or (ii) have a Monroe Material Adverse
Effect.

 

SECTION 6.04. _Rollover Investment._

 

(a) Trousdale shall use, and shall cause its affiliates to use, its reasonable
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause
to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and obtain
the Rollover Investment, in each case, on the terms and subject only to the
conditions set forth in the Rollover Letter, as the case may be, including
using its reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Rollover
Letter, (ii) comply with its obligations under the Rollover Letter, (iii)
satisfy (or cause its affiliates to satisfy) on a timely basis all
conditions applicable to Trousdale (or its affiliates) or Sub-S contained in
the Rollover Letter, (iv) enforce its rights (including through litigation)
under the Rollover Letter and (v) consummate the Rollover Investment at or
prior to the Closing, including using its (or causing its affiliates to use)
reasonable best efforts (including through litigation) to cause the Rollover
Investor to make the Rollover Investment at or prior to the Closing. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Trousdale and Sub-S shall give
Monroe prompt (but in any event within one (1) business day) notice: (i) of
any breach (or threatened breach) or default (or any event or circumstance
that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, could reasonably be
expected to give rise to any breach or default) by any party to the Rollover
Letter of which Trousdale or its affiliates becomes aware;

 



42  (ii) of the receipt by Trousdale (or its affiliates) or Sub-S of any written
notice or other written communication from any person with respect to any (x)
actual or potential default, breach (or threatened breach), termination or
repudiation by any party to the Rollover Letter or any definitive agreements
relating to the Rollover Letter or (y) material dispute or disagreement
between or among any parties to the Rollover Letter; and (iii) if for any
reason Trousdale or Sub-S believes in good faith that it will not be able to
obtain all or any portion of the Rollover Investment on the terms or in the
manner contemplated by the Rollover Letter, as the case may be. As soon as
reasonably practicable (but in any event within two (2) business days) after
the date Monroe delivers Trousdale or Sub-S a written request, Trousdale and
Sub-S shall provide any information reasonably requested by Monroe
relating to any circumstance referred to in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of the
immediately preceding sentence. Each of Trousdale and Sub-S shall not agree to
or permit any amendments or modifications to, or grant any waivers of, any
condition, provision or remedy under the Rollover Letter without the prior
written consent of Monroe if such amendments, modifications or waivers would
(i) reduce (or could have the effect of reducing) the number of shares of
Monroe Series A Preferred Securities or the number of Monroe Warrants to be
contributed thereby, (ii) impose new or additional conditions or otherwise
expand, amend or modify any of the conditions to the Rollover Investment, or
otherwise expand, amend or modify any other provision of the Rollover Letter,
(iii) adversely impact the ability of Trousdale or Sub-S to enforce its rights
against the other parties to the Rollover Letter or (iv) prevent, impede or
materially delay the consummation of the Merger or the other Transactions.
Trousdale shall promptly deliver (but in any event within (2) two business
days) to Monroe true and complete copies of any such amendment, modification
or waiver.

 

(b) If any condition or other provision of the Rollover Letter is amended,
modified or waived in accordance with Section 6.04(a), then each of Trousdale
and Monroe shall comply with its covenants set forth herein with respect to
the Rollover Letter as so amended, modified or waived to the same extent that
Trousdale and Monroe would have been obligated to comply with respect to the
Rollover Investment.

(c) Trousdale shall, and shall cause its affiliates to, refrain from taking,
directly or indirectly, any action that would reasonably be expected to result
in the failure of any of the conditions contained in the Rollover Letter.
Trousdale and Sub-S acknowledge and agree that the consummation of the
Rollover Investment is not a condition to the Closing, and reaffirm their
obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
irrespective and independently of the consummation of the Rollover Investment,
subject to the applicable conditions set forth in Article VII and Section
9.11(b).

SECTION 6.05. _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, Monroe
shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any dispositions of
Monroe Common Stock (including, in each case, derivative securities with
respect thereto) resulting from the Merger and the other Transactions by each
individual who may become or is reasonably expected to become subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
Monroe immediately prior to the Effective Time to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 



43 SECTION 6.06. _Resignation of Directors_. Monroe shall use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain the resignations, effective as of the Effective Time, of
all of the directors of the Monroe Board.

SECTION 6.07.  _Indemnification_.

(a) Trousdale shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation, to the fullest
extent permitted by Applicable Law, honor all of MonroeÂ’s obligations to
indemnify and advance expenses to the current or former directors or officers
of Monroe and the Monroe Subsidiaries for acts or omissions by such directors
and officers occurring prior to the Effective Time to the extent that such
obligations of Monroe and the Monroe Subsidiaries exist on the date of this
Agreement, whether pursuant to the Monroe Charter, the Monroe Bylaws,
individual indemnity agreements or otherwise, to the extent in effect as of
the date hereof, and such obligations shall survive the Merger and shall
continue in full force and effect in accordance with the terms of the Monroe
Charter, the Monroe Bylaws and such individual indemnity agreements (to the
extent made available to Trousdale prior to the date hereof) from the
Effective Time until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations
with respect to any claims against such directors or officers arising out of
such acts or omissions.

 

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, Monroe shall and, if Monroe is unable to,
Trousdale shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, obtain and fully pay the
premium for a six-year "tail" prepaid policy on terms and conditions no less
advantageous to the current and former directors and officers of Monroe and
the Monroe Subsidiaries than the existing directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ insurance
policies of Monroe (" _D andO Insurance_") with respect to any claim related to
any period of time at or prior to the Effective Time from an insurance carrier
with the same or better credit rating as MonroeÂ’s current insurance carrier
with respect to DandO Insurance with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of
liability that are no less favorable than the coverage provided under MonroeÂ’s
existing policies as in effect as of the date of this Agreement; _provided_ ,
however, that neither Monroe nor Trousdale shall be required to pay for such
"tail" prepaid policy more than three hundred percent (300%) of the annual
premium currently paid by Monroe for its DandO Insurance. The Surviving
Corporation shall maintain such "tail" policy in full force and effect for its
full term. If the Surviving Corporation is unable to, or otherwise does not,
obtain such "tail" prepaid policy prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall continue to maintain in effect, for a period of at least six
(6) years from and after the Effective Time, the DandO Insurance in place as of
the date of this Agreement with MonroeÂ’s current insurance carrier or with an
insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as MonroeÂ’s current
insurance carrier with respect to DandO Insurance with terms, conditions,
retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than the
coverage provided under MonroeÂ’s existing policies as of the date of this
Agreement or, if such insurance coverage is unavailable, the best available
coverage; _provided_ , however, that Trousdale and the Surviving Corporation
shall not be required to pay an annual premium for the DandO Insurance in excess
of three hundred percent (300%) of the annual premium currently paid by Monroe
for such insurance; _provided_ , _further_ , that if the annual premiums of
such insurance coverage exceed such amount, Trousdale or the Surviving
Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage
available, with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time, for
a cost not exceeding three hundred percent (300%) of the annual premium
currently paid by Monroe for such insurance.

 



44 (c) From and after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted
by Applicable Law, Trousdale shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, indemnify, defend and hold harmless the present and former officers and
directors of Monroe and the Monroe Subsidiaries and any employee of Monroe or
the Monroe Subsidiaries who acts as a fiduciary under any Monroe Benefit Plan
(each an " _Indemnified Monroe Party_ ") against all losses, claims, damages,
liabilities, fees and expenses (including attorneysÂ’ fees and
disbursements), Judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement (in the case
of settlements, with the approval of the indemnifying party (which approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld)) (collectively, " _Losses_ "), as incurred
(payable monthly upon written request which request shall include reasonable
evidence of the Losses set forth therein) to the extent arising from, relating
to, or otherwise in respect of, any actual or threatened action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, in respect of actions or omissions occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time in connection with such Indemnified Monroe
PartyÂ’s duties as an officer or director of Monroe or any of the Monroe
Subsidiaries, including in respect of the Transaction Agreements and the

be deemed to be references to "50%". Any fee due under this Section 6.08(b)
shall be paid by wire transfer of same-day funds on the date of termination of

clause (iii) above such payment shall be made within two (2) business days of
execution of such definitive agreement or, if earlier, consummation of such
transactions and (y) in the case of termination pursuant to clause (ii) above
such payment shall be made prior to or concurrently with the termination of
this Agreement).

_Reverse Termination Fee_ ") if (x) Monroe terminates this Agreement pursuant
to Section 8.01(h), (y) Trousdale or Monroe terminates this Agreement pursuant

_would have been satisfied if the Closing were to have occurred at such time
(other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied by
actions taken at the Closing, each of which would be capable of being
satisfied at the Closing assuming the Closing was the date of termination) and
(ii) Monroe is not in material breach of Section 6.12. Any fee due under this

of-pocket costs, fees and expenses of Trousdale (including all reasonable,
documented and out-of-pocket costs, fees and expenses of TrousdaleÂ’s financial
advisor, legal counsel, accountants, consultants, experts, public relations
firms, investment banking firms, financing sources and other persons and

against any fee paid by Monroe to Trousdale under Section 6.08(b).

SECTION 6.09. _Public Announcements_. Monroe and Trousdale shall (x) consult
with each other before issuing, and provide each other the opportunity to
review and comment upon, any press release or other public statements with
respect to the Merger and the other Transactions and shall not issue any such
press release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation,
and (y) shall use reasonable efforts to cause their respective Representatives

national securities quotation system or as otherwise agreed by Monroe

 



46  and Trousdale. The parties agree that the initial press release to be issued

modification of the Monroe BoardÂ’s approval or recommendation of the Merger,
or in connection with a Monroe Takeover Proposal, from, negotiations with, or

Trousdale or Sub-S in such Equity Commitment Letter that are within its
control, if any, (iv) enforcing its rights under the Equity Commitment Letter

Debt Financing at or prior to the Closing. Trousdale and Sub-S will fully
pay, or cause to be fully paid, all commitment or other fees arising pursuant
to the Debt Commitment Letter as and when they become due.

 

(c) _No Amendments to Commitment Letters_. Subject to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement, each of Trousdale and Sub-S will not permit any assignment
of the Commitment Letters, or any amendment or modification to be made to, or
any waiver of any provision or remedy pursuant to, the Commitment Letters if

aggregate amount of the Equity Financing, (ii) impose new or additional
conditions to the Financing or otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the
conditions to the receipt of the Financing, (iii)

informed on a reasonably current basis of the status of its efforts to
arrange the Financing, and (ii) promptly (but in any event within one (1)
business day) provide Monroe with copies of all executed amendments,
modifications or replacements of the Debt Commitment Letter (it
being understood that any amendments, modifications or replacements shall
only be as permitted herein) or definitive agreements related to the
Financing. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Trousdale and
Sub-S shall promptly notify Monroe (A) of any breach (or threatened breach)
or default (or any event or circumstance that, with notice or lapse of time or
both, could reasonably be expected to give rise to any breach or default) by
any party to the Commitment Letters or definitive agreements related to the
Financing of which Trousdale becomes aware, (B) of the receipt by Trousdale or
Sub-S of any written notice or communication from each of the respective
Financing Sources with respect to any breach (or threatened breach), default,
termination or repudiation by any party to a Commitment Letter or any
definitive agreements related to the Financing of any provisions of any
Commitment Letter or such definitive agreements, and (C) if for any reason,
Trousdale or Sub-S at any time believes it will not be able to obtain all or
any portion of the Financing on the terms, in the manner or from the sources
contemplated by the Commitment Letters or any definitive agreements related to
the Financing.

(e) _No Financing Condition_. Trousdale and Sub-S each acknowledge and agree
that obtaining the Financing is not a condition to the Closing. In the event
that the Financing has not been obtained, Trousdale and Sub-S will each
continue to be obligated, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions set forth in Article VII and Section 9.11(b), to consummate the
Merger.

(f) _Cooperation_. Prior to the Closing, Monroe shall use reasonable best
efforts to provide, and shall cause its subsidiaries to use its reasonable

of collateral for the Financing; (iv) to the extent applicable, requesting
from MonroeÂ’s existing lenders such customary documents in connection with
financings as reasonably requested by Trousdale in connection with

furnishing Trousdale and the Financing Sources with all reasonably requested
information with respect to Monroe and

 



48  its subsidiaries, required by Governmental Entities with respect to the

Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act
of 2001, as amended; and (vi) assisting Trousdale in obtaining all documents,
affidavits, estoppels and signatures required in connection with title
insurance and other documentation and items relating to the Financing as

other provision of this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement will require

otherwise indemnified by or on behalf of Trousdale, (B) enter into any
definitive agreement the effectiveness of which is not conditioned on the
Closing, (C) give any indemnities the effectiveness of which are
not conditioned on the Closing, (D) take any action that, in the good faith
determination of Monroe, would unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the
business of Monroe and its subsidiaries (for the avoidance of doubt, any
action to be taken that is customary for transactions of the type
contemplated by the Financing shall not be deemed to unreasonably interfere
with the conduct of the business of Monroe and its subsidiaries), (E) provide
any information the disclosure of which is prohibited or restricted by its
organizational documents or any Applicable Law or is legally privileged, or
(F) take any action that will conflict with or violate any Applicable Laws or
would result in a violation or breach of, or default under, any agreement to
which Monroe or any of its subsidiaries is a party; provided that Monroe and
its subsidiaries shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the
consent of any third person to such agreement to which Monroe or any of
its subsidiaries is a party. In addition, no action, liability or obligation
of Monroe, any of its subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives
pursuant to any certificate, agreement, arrangement, document or instrument
relating to the Debt Financing will be effective until the Effective Time,
and neither Monroe nor any of its subsidiaries will be required to take any
action pursuant to any certificate, agreement, arrangement, document or
instrument (including being an issuer or other obligor with respect to the
Debt Financing) that is not contingent on the occurrence of the Closing or
that must be effective prior to the Effective Time. Nothing in this Agreement
will require (A) any officer or Representative of Monroe or any of its
subsidiaries to deliver any certificate or opinion or take any other action
pursuant to Section 6.10(f) or any other provision of this Agreement that
could reasonably be expected to result in personal liability to such officer
or Representative, or (B) the members of the Board of Monroe as of the date
hereof to approve any financing or Contracts related thereto prior to the
Effective Time.

 

(h) _Company Reimbursement and Indemnification_. Upon request by Monroe,
Trousdale shall promptly following the valid termination of this Agreement
(and in any event within thirty (30) calendar days following the valid
termination of this Agreement) reimburse Monroe and its subsidiaries for all
reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including legal fees and
expenses) incurred by Monroe and/or any of its subsidiaries in connection with
providing the support and cooperation contemplated by

 



49  Section 6.10(f). Trousdale shall indemnify and hold harmless Monroe and its
subsidiaries, and each of their respective directors, officers, employees,
agents and other representatives, from and against any and all losses,
damages, claims, interest, costs or expenses (including reasonable out-of-
pocket legal fees and expenses), awards, judgments, penalties and amounts paid
in settlement suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with the
Financing, including providing the support and cooperation contemplated by
Section 6.10(f) and any information utilized in connection therewith (other
than information provided by Monroe or any of MonroeÂ’s subsidiaries),
other than to the extent such losses, damages, claims, interest, costs or
expenses arise from the willful misconduct or gross negligence of any such
indemnified person.

 

SECTION 6.11. _Stock Exchange De-Listing; Exchange Act Deregistration_. As
promptly as possible following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary on its
part under Applicable Laws and rules and policies of Nasdaq to enable the de-
listing by the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Monroe Common Stock
under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time.

 

SECTION 6.12. _Monroe Mortgage Debt Agreements_. Trousdale agrees to use
reasonable best efforts to execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and
delivered, by or on behalf of Trousdale, Sub-S or Holdco (as the case may be),
and Monroe agrees to use reasonable best efforts to execute and deliver, or
cause to be executed and delivered, by or on behalf of Monroe or any
Monroe Subsidiary (as the case may be), at or prior to the Effective Time,
one or more agreements, instruments, guarantees, indemnities, amendments,
supplements, opinions or other documentation required by the terms of the
Monroe Mortgage Debt Agreements or the Monroe Lenders in order for (i) the
Transactions to be consummated pursuant to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and the Financings to be consummated pursuant to the terms and
conditions of the Commitment Letters (including the grant and perfection of
the securities interest contemplated thereby) and (ii) the due assumption by,
or the permitted transfer to, Trousdale, Holdco, Sub-S or the Surviving
Corporation of the Monroe Mortgage Debt Agreements and all of the obligations
thereunder (the " _Assumption of the Monroe Mortgage Debt Agreements_ "). Each
of Trousdale and Monroe shall take all action reasonably necessary to ensure
that the Monroe Mortgage Debt Agreements remain in full force and effect as
of the Effective Time and that all obligations thereunder remain outstanding
without the occurrence of any un-waived default, event of default or
termination of the Monroe Mortgage Debt Agreements or acceleration of the
obligations thereunder as a result of the Closing. In lieu of obtaining the
Assumption of the Monroe Mortgage Debt Agreements, Trousdale may (in its sole
discretion), but shall not be obligated to, refinance the Monroe Mortgage Debt
Agreements (the " _Mortgage Refinance_ "). Monroe shall use its reasonable
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause
to be done, and to assist and cooperate with Trousdale, Sub-S and Holdco in
doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable in connection with the
Assumption of the Monroe Mortgage Debt Agreement, the Mortgage Refinance (to
the extent applicable) and the other transactions contemplated by this Section
6.12 and to provide Trousdale with all cooperation and assistance reasonably
requested by Trousdale in connection therewith, in the most expeditious manner
practicable, including (i) providing all documents, financial information and
other information of Monroe or any Monroe Subsidiary reasonably requested by
Trousdale or requested by the Monroe Lenders or any other potential lender in

 



50  connection with the Mortgage Refinance and (ii) the execution and/or
delivery of any additional instruments or documents reasonably requested by
Trousdale, requested by any Monroe Lender or requested by any other potential
lender in connection with the Assumption of the Monroe Mortgage Debt
Agreements, the Mortgage Refinance (if applicable) and the other transactions
contemplated by this Section 6.12. The agreements of Monroe set forth in this
Section 6.12 shall be subject to the terms and conditions of Sections 6.10(f)
and 6.10(g), applied mutatis mutandis.

 

SECTION 6.13. _Certain Matters_. Trousdale shall, to the extent required by
any Applicable Law or the terms of any applicable collective bargaining
agreement (and any amendments thereto) set forth in Section 3.11(a) of the
Monroe Disclosure Letter, agree to be bound by and comply with the collective
bargaining agreements, memoranda of understanding, or other labor
union agreements (and any amendments thereto) set forth in Section 3.11(a) of
the Monroe Disclosure Letter. To this end, Trousdale will provide any required
instruments and documents, execute assumption agreements and copies of the
collective bargaining agreements and any other required instruments and
documents, as contemplated by the applicable collective bargaining agreement,
and take any other action required to comply with the applicable collective
bargaining agreements. Monroe shall, to the extent required by any Applicable
Law or the terms of any applicable collective bargaining agreement, take all
actions and provide all notices as required by all collective bargaining
agreements, memoranda of understanding, or other labor union agreements or
letters which govern the terms and conditions of any Monroe Employees.

remedy of the party receiving such termination fee (and its current, future or
former subsidiaries, stockholders and Representatives) against the other
party (or any of its current, future or former subsidiaries, stockholders and
Representatives and the Rollover Investor) for any losses or damages suffered

, that the Rollover Investor and its affiliates and Representatives shall have
no liability arising out of or related to this Agreement except as expressly
set forth in the Rollover Letter, and shall have no monetary liability
arising out of or related to this Agreement in the event Monroe has the right
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(h).

 

SECTION 8.03. _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties at any
time prior to the Effective Time before or after receipt of the Monroe
Stockholder Approval; _provided_ , _however_ , that after receipt of the

9.11 (and any provision of this Agreement to the extent an amendment,

 



55  modification, waiver or termination of such provision would modify the
substance of any such Section) may not be amended, modified, waived or
terminated in a manner that impacts or is adverse in any respect to the
Rollover Investor without the prior written consent of the Rollover Investor.

the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or in any
document delivered pursuant to this Agreement or (c) subject to the proviso of
Section 8.04, waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions
contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any party to this
Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall
not constitute a waiver of such rights.

SECTION 8.05. _Procedure for Termination, Amendment, Extension or Waiver_. A
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01, an amendment of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.03 or an extension or waiver pursuant to

61 SECTION 9.05. _Interpretation; Disclosure Letters_. When a reference is made
in this Agreement to a Section, such reference shall be to a Section of this
Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents and headings
contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not
affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever
the words "include", "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement,
they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation". The
term "or" is not exclusive. The word "extent" in the phrase "to the extent"
shall mean the degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and such
phrase shall not mean simply "if." Unless otherwise specifically indicated,
all references to "dollars" and "$" will be deemed references to United States
dollars. There shall not be any difference in meaning between the word "shall"
and the word "will" as used herein. Any matter disclosed in any section of
either the Monroe Disclosure Letter or the Trousdale Disclosure Letter shall
be deemed disclosed only for the purposes of the specific Sections of this
Agreement to which such section relates; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that any
information disclosed in one section of such disclosure letter shall be deemed
to be disclosed in such other sections of such disclosure letter to which its
relevance is readily apparent on the face of such information and without the
need to examine underlying documentation. Each party hereto has participated
in the drafting of this Agreement, which each party acknowledges is the result
of extensive negotiations among the parties and their advisors, and the
parties agree that there shall not apply to this Agreement or any provision
hereof any rule or presumption of interpreting this Agreement or any provision
hereof against the draftsperson of this Agreement or any provision hereof.

 

SECTION 9.06. _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule or law, or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties
hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable
manner to the end that the Transactions are fulfilled to the extent possible.

SECTION 9.07.  _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the parties and delivered to the other parties.

SECTION 9.08. _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. The
Transaction Agreements, taken together with the Monroe Disclosure Letter and
the Trousdale Disclosure Letter, (a) constitute the entire agreement, and
supersede all prior agreements, understandings and representations, both
written and oral, among the parties with respect to the Transactions and (b)
except for the provisions of Section 6.07 (for which the indemnified persons
are intended third party beneficiaries) and Section 2.07(b), Section 2.07(d),
Section 8.02(b), Section 8.03, this Section 9.08 and Section 9.11 (for which
the Rollover Investor is an intended third party beneficiary), are not
intended to confer upon any person other than the parties any rights or
remedies or otherwise create any third party beneficiary hereto.

 



62 SECTION 9.09. _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless
of the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of
conflicts of laws thereof.

 

SECTION 9.10. _Assignment_.

 

(a) Except as provided in Section 9.10(b), neither this Agreement nor any of
the rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned,
in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties
without the prior written consent of the other parties. Any purported
assignment without such consent shall be void. Subject to the preceding
sentences, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and
be enforceable by, the parties and their respective successors and assigns.

 

(b) Prior to the Closing, Trousdale shall, subject to the provisions of this
Section 9.10(b), assign, and cause Holdco to assume, all rights of Trousdale
under this Agreement (the " _Assignment_ "), provided that Trousdale shall not
be relieved of any of its obligations under and pursuant to this Agreement,
and shall remain responsible for all representations, warranties,
liabilities, covenants, agreements and any other obligations under and
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Agreement to the contrary, including this Section 9.10, Trousdale
agrees and acknowledges that Trousdale shall remain a party hereto and that
Trousdale, Holdco Assignee and Sub-S shall be jointly and severally
responsible and liable for all representations, warranties, liabilities,
covenants, agreements and any other obligations under and pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement, and for the avoidance of doubt Trousdale shall not be
relieved of any of its obligations under and pursuant to this Agreement. At
any time following the Assignment, any of the obligations of Trousdale
hereunder may be satisfied by Holdco and if satisfied by Holdco, shall be
deemed satisfied by Trousdale under this Agreement.

 

SECTION 9.11. _Enforcement_.

 

(a) Subject to the remainder of this Section 9.11, the parties agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of
this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
were otherwise breached, and that monetary damages, even if available, would
not be an adequate remedy therefor. It is accordingly agreed that, subject to
the remainder of this Section 9.11, the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any Delaware
state court or in any federal court located in the State of Delaware, and
this right shall include the right of Monroe to cause Trousdale and Sub-S to
fully enforce (i) the terms of the Equity Commitment Letter against the Equity
Financing Source to the fullest extent permissible under the Equity
Commitment Letter and Applicable Law, (ii) the terms of the Debt Commitment
Letter against the Debt Financing Source to the fullest extent permissible
under the Debt Commitment Letter and Applicable Law and (iii) the terms of
the Rollover Letter against the Rollover Investor to the fullest extent
permissible under the Rollover letter and Applicable Law, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

 



63 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
the parties hereto agree that the right of Monroe to obtain an injunction or
other form of specific performance or equitable relief in each case to cause
Trousdale and Sub-S to close shall be subject to the requirements that:

 

(i) all of the conditions set forth in Section 7.01 and Section 7.03 would
have been satisfied if the Closing were to have occurred at such time (other
than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied by actions taken
at the Closing, each of which shall be capable of being satisfied at the
Closing);

 

(ii) the Debt Financing, the Equity Financing and the Rollover Investment have
been funded or would (taking into account the right of Monroe to obtain, or
require Trousdale to obtain, specific performance of the Debt Financing, the
Equity Financing, the Rollover Investment and the Guarantee) be funded in
accordance with the terms thereof at the Closing;

 

(iii) Trousdale fails to complete the Closing in accordance with Section 2.02;
and

 

(iv) Monroe has irrevocably confirmed to Trousdale in writing that (A) all of
the conditions in Section 7.01 and Section 7.02 have been satisfied or that
it is willing to waive any such open conditions, and (B) if specific
performance is granted and if the Debt Financing, Equity Financing and the
Rollover Investment were funded, the Closing would occur.

(c) Each of the parties hereto agrees that it will not oppose the granting of
an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief as provided
herein on the basis that (x) either party has an adequate remedy at law or (y)
an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason
at law or in equity. Any party hereto seeking an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or
other security in connection with any such order or injunction. In addition,
each of the parties hereto (A) consents to submit itself to the personal
jurisdiction of any Delaware state court or any federal court located in the
State of Delaware in the event any suit, action or proceeding arises out of
or relating to this Agreement or any Transaction, (B) agrees that it will not
attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other
request for leave from any such court, (C) agrees that it will not bring any
suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
the Transactions in any court other than any Delaware state court or any
federal court located in the State of Delaware and (D) waives any right to
trial by jury with respect to any suit, action or proceeding arising out of
or relating to this Agreement or the Transactions, whether sounding in
contract, tort or otherwise.
