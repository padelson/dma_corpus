20  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 2.3. Consents and Shared Contracts.

  

  

(a) Except as set forth in Section 3.1(b), there shall be excluded from the
Conveyed Assets any Real Property Lease, Tangible Personal Property Lease,
Fleet Vehicle Lease, Assumed Contract, Governmental Authorization, Contract,
license or right which is not assignable or transferable without the consent
of any Person other than Ashland, the Asset Selling Corporations or any other
Affiliate of Ashland or Buyer, to the extent that such consent shall not have
been given prior to the Closing; provided, however, that each of Ashland, the
Asset Selling Corporations and Buyer shall have the continuing obligation for
a reasonable period not to exceed twelve (12) months commencing on the Closing
Date to use its commercially reasonable efforts to endeavor to obtain all
necessary consents to the assignment thereof and, upon obtaining the requisite
third party consents thereto, such Real Property Leases, Tangible Personal
Property Leases, Fleet Vehicle Leases, Assumed Contracts, and other Contracts,
Governmental Authorizations, licenses and rights, if such would, but for the
lack of such consent, otherwise be included in the Conveyed Assets, shall be
assigned to Buyer or a Buyer Corporation hereunder; and provided further that,
if any such requisite consent cannot be obtained, at Buyer's request, the
parties shall cooperate with each other to endeavor to obtain for Buyer an
arrangement reasonably designed to provide for Buyer the benefits thereof in
some other manner (provided that such arrangement shall not include any
obligation to commence, defend or participate in any litigation or offer or
grant any accommodation (financial or otherwise) to any third party).

  

  

(b) Buyer acknowledges that certain consents to the Contemplated Transactions
may be required from parties to the Real Property Leases, Tangible Personal
Property Leases, Fleet Vehicle Leases, Assumed Contracts, other Contracts,
Governmental Authorizations, licenses or rights and that such consents have
not been and may not be obtained. Buyer agrees that, except as provided in
Section 2.3(a) or 7.1(b), neither Ashland nor the Asset Selling Corporations
shall have any liability or obligation whatsoever arising out of or relating
to the failure to obtain any consents that may have been or may be required in
connection with the Contemplated Transactions or because of the default under
or acceleration or termination or any Real Property Lease, Tangible Personal
Property Lease, Fleet Vehicle Lease, Assumed Contract, other Contract,
Governmental Authorization, license or right, as a result thereof. Buyer
further agrees that no representation, warranty or covenant of Ashland
contained herein shall be breached or deemed breached, and no condition to
Buyer's obligations to close the Contemplated Transactions shall be deemed not
satisfied as a result of (i) the failure to obtain any such consent or as a
result of any such default, acceleration or termination, or (ii) any
Proceeding commenced or threatened by or on behalf of any Person arising out
of or relating to the failure to obtain any consent or any such default,
acceleration or termination; provided that the failure to obtain any such
consent and any such default, acceleration, termination or Proceeding may be
taken into account in determining whether the representation set forth in
Section 5.12 shall have been breached, provided further that this sentence
shall not be deemed to limit Ashland's covenants and agreements in Sections
7.1(a), (b) and (d).

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

21  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) Buyer acknowledges that certain Tangible Personal Property Leases, Fleet
Vehicle Leases and other Contracts to which Ashland or an Asset Selling
Corporation is a party relate to both (i) the Business or Conveyed Assets or
Assumed Liabilities and (ii) businesses (other than the Business) conducted by
Ashland or any of its Affiliates or properties or assets or liabilities of
such other businesses (each such Tangible Personal Property Lease, Fleet
Vehicle Lease or other Contract, a "Shared Contract"). The parties hereto
agree that, as of the date hereof, each Shared Contract shall be an Excluded
Asset pursuant to Section 2.4(x); provided that prior to the earlier of the
Closing Date and the valid termination of this Agreement Ashland and Buyer
shall engage in good faith negotiations with respect to the treatment of each
Shared Contract and the rights, benefits, obligations and liabilities
thereunder as of the Closing Date. Ashland and Buyer acknowledge that the
outcome of such negotiations may result in, among other outcomes, (w) any one
or more Shared Contracts remaining Excluded Assets as of the Closing Date, (x)
any one or more Shared Contracts being deemed to be Assumed Contracts and
being assigned to Buyer as of the Closing Date, (y) any one or more Shared
Contracts being split into two Contracts, with one of the resulting Contracts
being deemed to be an Assumed Contract and one of the resulting Contracts
remaining an Excluded Asset or (z) the rights, benefits, obligations and
liabilities under any one or more Shared Contracts being apportioned among
Ashland, Buyer and their respective Affiliates or otherwise provided by one
party hereto to the other party hereto by way of arrangement or agreement
between the parties. For the avoidance of doubt, if Ashland and Buyer agree
that any Shared Contract or any Contract resulting from the division of any
Shared Contract shall be deemed to be an Assumed Contract on the Closing Date,
then such Shared Contract or Contract resulting from such division shall be an
"Assumed Contract" and a "Conveyed Asset" for all purposes under this
Agreement.

  

  

Section 2.4. Excluded Assets of the Business.

  

  

(a) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement, it is hereby acknowledged
and agreed that Buyer and the Buyer Corporations shall not purchase, acquire
or accept, and Ashland and/or the Asset Selling Corporations, as the case may
be, shall retain, with respect to the Business, all of the following rights
and assets of any kind (all such rights and assets, the "Excluded Assets"):

  

  

(i) Cash Equivalents;

  

  

(ii) all losses, loss carry forwards and rights to receive refunds, pre-paid
Taxes, credits and credit carry forwards with respect to all Taxes, to the
extent attributable to the Pre-Closing Date Tax Period;

  

  

(iii) the corporate books and records, stock records and corporate seals of
Ashland and the Asset Selling Corporations and, except as set forth in Section
2.2(j), the ledger books and all other books and records of Ashland and the
Asset Selling Corporations;

  

  

(iv) any legal or beneficial interest in the share capital of any Asset
Selling Corporation, any other Affiliate of Ashland or any other Person;

  

  

(v) all real property currently or formerly owned or leased by Ashland or any
Asset Selling Corporation, other than the Conveyed Real Property and the
Conveyed Real Property Rights;

  

  

(vi) all assets (other than the Transferred Plan Assets) relating to any
Seller Benefit Plan or any Employee Benefit Plan of Ashland or any Asset
Selling Corporation;

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

22  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(vii) the Retained Names or any names, marks, domain names and logos either
alone or in combination with other words, phrases, designs and the like
similar thereto or any derivations therefrom in any language;

  

  

(viii) all insurance policies, issued to or for the benefit of Ashland and its
predecessors, whether issued for past or current policy periods, including all
title, general liability, excess liability, fire, property, casualty, all-
risk, business interruption, workers' compensation, crime and fidelity,
directors and officers, errors and omissions, surety bonds, and other forms of
insurance, captive insurance, self-retention and fronting policies and
corresponding arrangements, as well as any and all related claims, benefits,
rights, proceeds, choses in action, or other interests arising from such
insurance policies, or from any coverage agreements entered into by Ashland
and its predecessors relating to such policies;

  

  

(ix) all rights, claims and credits to the extent relating to any Excluded
Asset or any Retained Liability, whether arising before or after the Closing;

  

  

(x) the Shared Contracts;

  

  

(xi) the assets set forth on Schedule 2.4(xi);

  

  

(xii) any other right or asset that is not a Conveyed Asset; and

  

  

(xiii) any right, property or other asset that arises out of or relates
exclusively to any Excluded Asset.

  

  

(b) The parties acknowledge and agree that, for the purposes of this
Agreement, Buyer and the Buyer Corporations shall not purchase, acquire or
accept any rights of Ashland or any Asset Selling Corporation under this
Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements to which Ashland or any such Asset
Selling Corporation is a party.

  

  

Section 2.5. Assumed Liabilities of the Business.

  

  

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, Buyer and the
Buyer Corporations will assume and become responsible for any and all
Liabilities to the extent relating to the Business or the Conveyed Assets
(whether of Ashland or any of its Affiliates (including the Asset Selling
Corporations)), including the following Liabilities but excluding in each case
the Retained Liabilities (collectively, the "Assumed Liabilities"):

  

  

(a) all Accounts Payable (other than Allocated Accounts Payable) outstanding
as of or arising after the Closing Date;

  

  

(b) all Liabilities under or in connection with any Assumed Contract

arising exclusively out of the operation or conduct by Ashland or its
Affiliates of any business other than the Business.

  

  

Section 2.7. Purchase Price.

  

  

At the Closing, in consideration of the sale and transfer of the Conveyed
Assets and other covenants of Ashland contained herein, Buyer shall pay, for
itself and as agent for the Buyer Corporations, to Ashland, for itself and as
agent for the Asset Selling Corporations, an amount equal to U.S.$930,000,000
(the "Purchase Price"). The Purchase Price shall be subject to adjustment as
provided for in Sections 2.8 and 2.11. The Purchase Price (a) plus or minus an
estimate, prepared by Ashland and delivered to Buyer at least two Business
Days prior to the Closing Date, of any increase or decrease to the Purchase
Price under Section 2.8(d)(i) (the Purchase Price plus or minus such estimate
of any increase or decrease under Section 2.8 hereinafter called the "Closing
Date Amount"); and (b) minus an estimate, prepared by Ashland and delivered to
Buyer at least two Business Days prior to the Closing Date, of the amount of
any Unfunded Liability (such estimate, the "Estimated Unfunded Liability"),
shall be paid in immediately available funds by wire transfer in accordance
with written instructions given by Ashland to Buyer not less than two (2)
Business Days prior to the Closing or such later time as may be agreed by
Ashland and Buyer.

  

  

Section 2.8. Purchase Price Adjustment for Net Working Capital.

  

  

(a) Within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Ashland shall deliver to
Buyer a statement of Net Working Capital as of the Closing Date (the "Closing
Account"). The Closing Account shall be unaudited and prepared in accordance
with Ashland's accounting principles set forth on Schedule 2.8(a) (the
"Closing Account Principles"). During the preparation of the Closing Account
by Ashland and the period of any dispute with respect to the application of
this Section 2.8, Buyer shall, and shall cause the Buyer Corporations and
their respective Affiliates to, (i) provide Ashland and Ashland's accountants,
advisors and other representatives with reasonable access during normal
business hours to the books and records (to the extent in the possession or
control of Buyer or one of its Affiliates), properties and personnel of the
Buyer to the extent relevant to the preparation of the Closing Account and
(ii) assist Ashland and Ashland's accountants, advisors and other
representatives in the preparation of the Closing Account.

  

  

(b) Buyer may dispute the amounts reflected on the line items of the Closing
Account (each, a "Disputed Item"), but only on the basis of (i) mathematical
errors, or (ii) the Closing Account not being calculated in accordance with
Section 2.8(a); provided, however, that in each case Buyer shall notify
Ashland in writing of each Disputed Item, and specify in reasonable detail the
amount thereof in dispute and the basis therefor, within forty-five (45) days
after the Closing Account has been received by Buyer. The failure by Buyer to
provide a notice of Disputed Items to Ashland within such period will
constitute Buyer's final and binding acceptance of all items in the Closing
Account.

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

26  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

  

(c) If a notice of Disputed Items shall be timely delivered pursuant to sub-
clause (b) above, Ashland and Buyer shall, during the ten (10) Business Days
following the date of such delivery (the "Resolution Period"), negotiate in
good faith to resolve the Disputed Items. If, during the Resolution Period,
the parties reach an agreement, such agreement shall be evidenced in writing
and the Closing Account (as revised pursuant to such written agreement) shall
become final and binding on the date of such agreement. If, during the
Resolution Period, the parties are unable to reach agreement, Ashland and
Buyer shall refer all unresolved Disputed Items to an independent accounting
firm upon which Ashland and Buyer shall mutually agree (the "Independent
Accountant"). The Independent Accountant shall make a determination, acting as
an expert and not as an arbitrator, with respect to unresolved Disputed Items
within thirty (30) days after its engagement by Ashland and Buyer, which
determination shall be made in accordance with the rules set forth in this
Section 2.8. The Independent Accountant shall deliver to Ashland and Buyer,
within such thirty (30) day period, a report setting forth (i) its
adjustments, if any, to the Closing Account, and (ii) the calculations
supporting such adjustments. Such report shall be final, conclusive and
binding on the parties. Ashland and Buyer shall share equally all costs
incurred in connection with the engagement of the Independent Accountant.

  

  

(d) (i) The Purchase Price shall be increased by the amount by which the Net
Working Capital as reflected in the Agreed Closing Account exceeds
U.S.$454,000,000 and the Purchase Price shall be decreased by the amount by
which the Net Working Capital as reflected in the Agreed Closing Account is
less than U.S.$454,000,000 (the Purchase Price as so increased or decreased
shall hereinafter be referred to as the "Adjusted Purchase Price").

  

  

(ii) If the Closing Date Amount is less than the Adjusted Purchase Price, then
Buyer, for itself and as agent for the Buyer Corporations, shall pay to
Ashland, for itself and as agent for the Asset Selling Corporations, the
amount of such difference in accordance with paragraph (e). If the Closing
Date Amount is greater than the Adjusted Purchase Price, then Ashland, for
itself and as agent for the Asset Selling Corporations, shall pay to Buyer,
for itself and as agent for the Buyer Corporations, the amount of such
difference in accordance with paragraph (e).

  

  

(e) All payments to be made under paragraph (d) will be paid by the party
obligated to make such payment under this Section 2.8 (the "Paying Party") to
the other party (the "Receiving Party"), for itself and as agent for its
Affiliates (as applicable), within ten (10) days after the determination of
the Agreed Closing Account, in dollars by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, in accordance with written instructions given by the
Receiving Party to the Paying Party (which instructions shall be provided by
the Receiving Party promptly, and no later than eight (8) days, after the
determination of the Agreed Closing Account (or such later time as may be
agreed by Ashland and Buyer)), together with interest on such amount from the
Closing Date to the date of such payment, at a rate equal to the Interest Rate
on the Closing Date.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

27  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(f) For purposes of the preparation of the Closing Account and determining
amounts of payments to be made under paragraph (d), all amounts in a currency
other than dollars shall be converted to dollars at the applicable Bloomberg
Currency Composite Rate (London (CMPL)) (or any successor thereto) at 4 p.m.,
London time, on the Business Day prior to the Closing Date, or such other date
as Ashland and Buyer may agree to be appropriate for the relevant calculation.

  

  

Section 2.9. Allocation of the Consideration.

  

  

Ashland and Buyer shall cooperate in good faith to mutually agree before
Closing to an allocation of the Consideration among Ashland and the Asset
Selling Corporations (the "Seller Entity Allocation"). To facilitate such
agreement, within fifteen (15) days hereof, the Seller shall provide financial
statements with respect to the portion of the Business conducted by Ashland
and each Asset Selling Corporations. Within thirty (30) days after the receipt
of such financial statements, Buyer shall provide to Ashland a proposed
allocation of the Consideration among Ashland and the Asset Selling
Corporations. Within thirty (30) days after the receipt of such allocation,
Ashland shall propose to Buyer any changes to such allocation or otherwise
shall be deemed to have agreed with such allocation. Ashland and Buyer shall
cooperate in good faith to resolve any disagreements as to the Seller Entity
Allocation prior to Closing; provided that reaching such agreement shall not
be a condition to Closing. With respect to Ashland and each of the Asset
Selling Corporations, within thirty (30) days following Closing, Buyer shall
provide to Ashland a proposed allocation of the Consideration among the
categories of Conveyed Assets. Within ten (10) days after the receipt of such
allocation, Ashland shall propose to Buyer any changes to such allocation or
otherwise shall be deemed to have agreed with such allocation (the "Asset
Allocations"). Buyer's proposals shall be in accordance with Section 1060 of
the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder (or similar state or foreign
Tax laws) and Buyer and Ashland shall cooperate in good faith to mutually
agree to the Asset Allocations. The Seller Entity Allocation and the Asset
Allocation shall be adjusted to reflect adjustments to the Purchase Price
hereunder. Each of Ashland and the Asset Selling Corporations and their
respective Affiliates, on the one hand, and each of Buyer, the Buyer
Corporations and their respective Affiliates, on the other, shall (i) be bound
by an agreed upon Seller Entity Allocation and the agreed upon Asset
Allocations for purposes of determining any Taxes, (ii) prepare and file its
Tax Returns on a basis consistent with such allocations and (iii) take no
position inconsistent with such allocations on any applicable Tax Return or in
any Proceeding before any Governmental Authority or otherwise.

  

  

Section 2.10. Conveyance and Assumption Instruments.

  

  

At the Closing, Ashland and the Asset Selling Corporations, on the one hand,
and Buyer and Buyer Corporations, on the other hand, shall execute and deliver
such bills of sale, deeds, assignments, assumptions and other documents and
instruments of sale, conveyance, assignment, transfer and assumption as are
necessary for the conveyance of the Conveyed Assets by Ashland and the Asset
Selling Corporations and the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities by Buyer
and the Buyer Corporations as contemplated hereunder, in each case in form and
substance reasonably agreed by the parties and as is usual and customary with
respect to the applicable Conveyed Asset or Assumed Liability in the
applicable jurisdiction and that implements the applicable terms, and is
consistent with the underlying principles of, this Agreement.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

28  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 2.11. Purchase Price Adjustment for Unfunded Liability

  

  

(a) Within one hundred twenty (120) days after the Closing Date, Ashland shall
deliver to Buyer a statement of the Unfunded Liability (the "Unfunded
Liability Statement") and shall provide Buyer and Buyer's accountants,
actuaries, advisors and other representatives with copies of all plan
documents, census information, asset allocation calculations, other written
materials documenting plan provisions and, to the extent requested, examples
and explanations of individual liability calculations, in each case to the
extent relevant to the review of the Unfunded Liability Statement or to the
extent requested to re-perform the actuarial valuations contemplated by this
Section 2.11 in connection with Buyer's review pursuant to this Section 2.11
(the "Underlying Data"). "Unfunded Liability" shall mean, with respect to all
Transferred Non-U.S. Ashland Pension Plans, the aggregate of the excess of the
Projected Benefit Obligation ("PBO") or the Accumulated Postretirement Benefit
Obligation ("APBO"), as applicable, for the pension benefits or post-
employment benefits, as applicable, under each such plan statutorily required
to transfer to Buyer over the amount of plan assets statutorily required to
transfer to Buyer with respect to each such plan, calculated under GAAP as of
the day prior to the Closing Date for all Transferred Employees and in
accordance with the applicable plan provisions. The PBO or APBO, as
applicable, to be used in determination of the Unfunded Liability shall be
calculated as of the day prior to the Closing in accordance with GAAP using
the same actuarial assumptions and methods Ashland or its respective
Affiliates used to determine the PBO and APBO under GAAP for Ashland's year-
end financial statements as of September 30, 2010.

  

  

(b) Buyer may dispute the amounts reflected on the line items of the Unfunded
Liability Statement (each, a "Unfunded Liability Disputed Item"), but only on
the basis of (a) mathematical errors, or (b) the Unfunded Liability Statement
not being calculated in accordance with this Section 2.11; provided, however,
that in each case, Buyer shall notify Ashland in writing of each Unfunded
Liability Disputed Item, and specify in reasonable detail the amount thereof
in dispute and the basis thereof, within forty-five (45) days after the later
of (i) the date the Unfunded Liability Statement has been received by Buyer
and (ii) the date the Underlying Data has been received by Buyer. The failure
by Buyer to provide a notice of Unfunded Liability Disputed Items to Ashland
within such period will constitute Buyer's final and binding acceptance of all
items in the Unfunded Liability Statement.

  

  

(c) If a notice of Unfunded Liability Disputed Items shall be timely delivered
pursuant to paragraph (b) above, Ashland and Buyer shall, during the ten (10)
Business Days following the date of such delivery (the "Unfunded Liability
Resolution Period"), negotiate in good faith to resolve the Unfunded Liability
Disputed Items. If, during the Unfunded Liability Resolution Period, the
parties reach agreement, such agreement shall be evidenced in writing and the
Unfunded Liability Statement (as revised pursuant to such written agreement)
shall become final and binding on the date of such agreement. If, during the
Unfunded Liability Resolution Period, the parties are unable to reach
agreement, Ashland and Buyer shall refer all unresolved Unfunded Liability
Disputed Items to an independent actuary upon which Ashland and Buyer shall
mutually agree (the "Actuarial Mediator"). The Actuarial Mediator shall make a
determination, acting as an expert and not as an arbitrator, with respect to
unresolved Unfunded Liability Disputed Items within thirty (30) days after its
engagement by Ashland and Buyer, which determination shall be made in
accordance with the rules set forth in this Section 2.11. The Actuarial
Mediator shall deliver to Ashland and Buyer, within such thirty (30) day
period, a report setting forth (i) its adjustments, if any, to the Unfunded
Liability Statement, and (ii) the calculations supporting such adjustments.
Such report shall be final, conclusive and binding on the parties. Ashland and
Buyer shall share equally all costs incurred in connection with the engagement
of the Actuarial Mediator.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

29  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(d) If the Estimated Unfunded Liability is greater than the Agreed Unfunded
Liability, then Buyer, for itself and as agent for the Buyer Corporations,
shall pay to Ashland, for itself and as agent for the Asset Selling
Corporations, the amount of such difference in accordance with paragraph (e).
If the Agreed Unfunded Liability is greater than the Estimated Unfunded
Liability, then Ashland, for itself and as agent for the Asset Selling
Corporations, shall pay to Buyer, for itself and as agent for the Buyer
Corporations, the amount of such difference in accordance with paragraph (e).

  

  

(e) All payments to be made under paragraph (d) will be made by the party
obligated to make such payment under this Section 2.11 (the "Unfunded
Liability Paying Party") to the other party (the "Unfunded Liability Receiving
Party"), for itself and as agent for its Affiliates (as applicable), within
ten (10) days after the determination of the Agreed Unfunded Liability, in
dollars by wire transfer of immediately available funds, in accordance with
written instructions given by the Receiving Party to the Paying Party (which
instructions shall be provided by the Receiving Party promptly, and no later
than (8) days, after the determination of the Agreed Unfunded Liability (or
such later time as may be agreed by Ashland and Buyer)), together with
interest on such amount from the Closing Date to the date of such payment, at
a rate equal to the Interest Rate on the Closing Date.

  

  

(f) For purposes of the preparation of the Unfunded Liability Statement and
determining amounts of payments to be made under paragraph (d), all amounts in
a currency other than dollars shall be converted to dollars at the applicable
Bloomberg Currency Composite Rate (London (CMPL)) (or any successor thereto)
at 4 p.m., London time, on the Business Day prior to the Closing Date, or such
other date as Ashland and Buyer may agree to be appropriate for the relevant
calculation.

  

  

ARTICLE 3.

  

CLOSING

  

  

Section 3.1. Closing.

  

  

(a) The Closing shall take place at the offices of Cravath, Swaine and Moore, at
825 Eighth Avenue, New York NY 10019, at 10:00 a.m., Eastern Time, on the
first date that is both (i) at least three (3) Business Days following the
satisfaction (or, to the extent permitted, waiver by the parties entitled to
the benefits thereof) of all the conditions set forth in Article 4 and (ii)
the last Business Day of the month in which all such conditions are satisfied
or waived, or at such other times and places as the parties hereto may
mutually agree. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, if the
Marketing Period has not ended at the time of the satisfaction or waiver of
the conditions set forth in Article 4 (other than those conditions that by
their nature cannot be satisfied until the Closing, but subject to the
fulfillment or waiver of those conditions at the Closing), then the Closing
shall occur

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

30  

  

 

 

 

  

  

instead on the date following the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions
that is the earliest to occur of (a) any Business Day before or during the
Marketing Period as may be specified by Buyer on no less than three (3)
Business Days' prior notice to Ashland and (b) the final day of the Marketing
Period, subject in each case to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions
set forth in Article 4 as of the date determined in accordance with the
foregoing clause (a) or (b), or on such other date, time, or place as agreed
to in writing by the parties hereto. The date on which the Closing occurs is
the Closing Date (the "Closing Date"). All of the actions to be taken and
documents to be executed and delivered at the Closing shall be deemed to be
taken, executed and delivered simultaneously, and no such action, execution or
delivery shall be effective until all are complete, except as specifically
provided herein. The Closing shall be deemed to be effective as to each
jurisdiction in which the Conveyed Assets are transferred to, and the Assumed
Liabilities are assumed by, Buyer or the applicable Buyer Corporation as of
the Effective Time.

  

  

(b) (i)Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (A) if any condition
set forth in Section 4.1(d)(ii) would not be satisfied by the Closing Date
(without reference to Section 4.1(d)(ii)) due to circumstances in one or more
particular Foreign Jurisdictions (each such territory, a "Deferred
Jurisdiction") and (B) all other conditions of Article 4 have been satisfied
or waived, then the transfer of the Conveyed Assets and assumption of the
Assumed Liabilities in each such Deferred Jurisdiction (such Conveyed Assets
and Assumed Liabilities for each Deferred Jurisdiction, collectively, a
"Deferred Business") will not occur on the Closing Date, but shall instead
occur as soon as practicable after the circumstances giving rise to the
failure of the conditions set forth in Section 4.1(d)(ii) with respect to such
Deferred Jurisdiction have been resolved (or upon the waiver of such
conditions by the parties). Subject to Section 7.2, the parties shall use
reasonable best efforts to ensure that any Deferred Transfer occurs as soon as
reasonably practicable after the Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt, the
Closing Date shall not be delayed as a result of such failure and there shall
be no change in the amount paid at the Closing pursuant to Section 2.7 as a
result of any Deferred Transfer.

  

  

(ii) From and after the Closing, and until such time as each Deferred Business
has been transferred to Buyer (or its designated Affiliate) pursuant to
Section 3.1(b)(vi) or Section 3.1(b)(vii) (each, a "Deferred Transfer"), such
Deferred Business (including all Cash Equivalents generated with respect
thereto) will be held for Buyer's (or its designated Affiliate's) benefit and
account and will be managed and operated by Ashland and its Affiliates for
Buyer's (or its designated Affiliate's) benefit and account, with all gains,
income, losses, Taxes and Tax benefits or other items generated to be for
Buyer's (or its designated Affiliate's) account in accordance with applicable
Law.

  

  

(iii) Except as otherwise contemplated by Section 3.1(b)(ii) or the other
provisions of this Agreement, each Deferred Business will be operated on a
basis consistent with past practice or, unless prohibited by applicable Law,
otherwise in such manner as Buyer shall reasonably request and Ashland's pre-
Closing obligations pursuant to Section 7.13 will continue in force with
respect to such Deferred Business until its Deferred Transfer occurs. Buyer
and Ashland will, and will cause their respective Affiliates to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to minimize any Liability for Taxes resulting
from Deferred Transfers.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

31  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(iv) Ashland and its Affiliates will have no Liability to Buyer or any of its
Affiliates arising out of the management or operation of any Deferred Business
other than for breach of this Agreement, gross negligence or willful
misconduct, for which breach, gross negligence or willful misconduct Ashland
and its Affiliates will indemnify Buyer Indemnitees; provided, however, that
Ashland and its Affiliates will have no Liability for actions taken in
accordance with the request or direction of Buyer or its Affiliates.

  

  

(v) Except (A) as set forth in Section 3.1(b)(iv) or (B) to the extent
relating to or arising from a breach of this Agreement, gross negligence or
willful misconduct by Ashland or its Affiliates, Buyer will reimburse Ashland
and will indemnify and hold Ashland and the Ashland Indemnitees harmless from
and against all Losses incurred or asserted as a result of Ashland's and its
Affiliates' post-Closing direct or indirect ownership, management or operation
of each Deferred Business, including the amount of any additional Taxes
payable (or carried-forward Tax losses or credits consumed) by Ashland or its
Affiliates (whether currently or in the future), after application of the
terms of this Agreement, as a result thereof in excess of the amount of Taxes
which would have been payable by Ashland or its Affiliates, after application
of the terms of this Agreement, if each Deferred Business had been transferred
to Buyer or its designated Affiliates on the Closing Date.

  

  

(vi) Subject to Section 3.1(b)(vii), the closing of a transfer of each
Deferred Business will be effected on the fifth Business Day after the
satisfaction of all applicable conditions set forth in Section 4.1(d)(ii), or
at such other time as the parties may agree. Solely with respect to the
closing of each transfer of each Deferred Business, the conditions set forth
in Section 4.1(d)(ii) must be satisfied at the closing of the transfer of such
Deferred Business instead of the Closing.

  

  

(vii) If the Deferred Transfer of any Deferred Business has not occurred on or
prior to the first anniversary of the Closing Date, then Ashland or the
applicable Asset Selling Corporation may at any time, by delivery of written
notice to Buyer (each an "Sale Notice"), elect to sell each such remaining
Deferred Business to a third party; provided that, Ashland or such Asset
Selling Corporation shall remit the net proceeds (i.e., the purchase price
paid for the Deferred Business less any transaction costs, including
reasonable attorney and other advisors fees) from such sale to Buyer and shall
conduct the sale in a manner consistent with the way that Ashland would
conduct such sale as if it were selling such Deferred Business for its own
account.

  

  

Section 3.2. Closing; Deliveries.

  

  

(a) At the Closing, Ashland, for itself and as agent for the Asset Selling
Corporations and their Affiliates, shall deliver or cause to be delivered to
Buyer, for itself and as agent for the Buyer Corporations, the instruments and
documents set forth in Schedule 3.2(a).

  

  

(b) At the Closing, Buyer, for itself and as agent for the Buyer Corporations,
shall deliver to Ashland, for itself and as agent for the Asset Selling
Corporations: (i) an amount equal to the Closing Date Amount minus the
Estimated Unfunded Liability by wire transfer in dollars in immediately
available funds in accordance with the written instructions provided by
Ashland pursuant to Section 2.7; and (ii) the instruments and documents set
forth in Schedule 3.2(b).

ARTICLE 6.

  

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF BUYER

  

  

Buyer represents and warrants to Ashland the following:

  

  

Section 6.1. Organization.

  

  

Buyer is a limited liability company duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing (to the extent such concept is known in the relevant
jurisdiction) under the Laws of Delaware and has full power and authority to
own its properties and carry on its business in the places where such
properties are now owned or such businesses are now being conducted. Each
Buyer Corporation is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing (to
the extent such concept is known in the relevant jurisdiction) under the Laws
of the jurisdiction of its organization) and each Buyer Corporation has full
power and authority to own its properties and carry on its business in the
places where such properties are now owned or such businesses are now being
conducted, except where the absence of such power and authority would not have
a Buyer Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

Section 6.2. Authority; Binding Effect.

  

  

(a) Buyer has full power and authority to enter into this Agreement. Buyer and
each of the Buyer Corporations has full power and authority, corporate and
otherwise, to enter into the Ancillary Agreements to which it is a party and
to perform its respective obligations hereunder and thereunder (as the case
may be). This Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which Buyer and any of
the Buyer Corporations is a party have been duly authorized and approved by
all necessary corporate or other action.

  

  

(b) Assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement
by Ashland, this Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and legally binding
obligation of Buyer, enforceable against Buyer in accordance with its terms,
except as enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or similar Laws affecting creditors' rights
generally. Assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery of the
Ancillary Agreements by Ashland or the relevant Asset Selling Corporation, as
the case may be, each Ancillary Agreement to which Buyer or a Buyer
Corporation is a party, when delivered hereunder, will be duly and validly
executed and delivered and will constitute a legal, valid and binding
obligation of Buyer or the relevant Buyer Corporation (as the case may be),
enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as enforcement may be limited
by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar Laws
affecting creditors' rights generally.

  

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

45  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 6.3. Non-Contravention.

  

  

The execution, delivery and performance by Buyer of this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements to which it is a party and the execution, delivery and
performance by each Buyer Corporation of the Ancillary Agreements to which it
is a party, and the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions, do not and
will not (i) violate any provision of the organizational documents of Buyer or
the relevant Buyer Corporation, or (ii) assuming compliance with the matters
set forth in Sections 5.4 and 6.5, violate or result in a breach of or
constitute a default under any Law or Order to which Buyer or any Buyer
Corporation is subject.

  

  

Section 6.4. Financing.

  

  

(a) Buyer has received (i) an executed commitment letter, dated as of the date
of this Agreement (including all exhibits, schedules, annexes and amendments
thereto as of the date of this Agreement, the "Debt Commitment Letter"), from
Bank of America, N.A. and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith Incorporated
(collectively, the "Lenders") to provide Buyer with up to U.S.$600,000,000 in
debt financing at the Closing (the "Debt Financing") and (ii) an executed
commitment letter, dated as of the date of this Agreement (including all
exhibits, schedules, annexes and amendments thereto as of the date of this
Agreement, the "Equity Commitment Letter" and, together with the Debt
Commitment Letter, the "Commitment Letters"), from TPG Partners VI, L.P., an
Affiliate of Buyer (the "Sponsor Fund"), to provide Buyer with up to
U.S.$400,000,000 in equity financing (the "Equity Financing" and, together
with the Debt Financing, the "Financing"). The proceeds of the Financing or
any Alternate Financing arranged pursuant to Section 7.6(c) will be used to
pay the Purchase Price and the fees and expenses relating to the Contemplated
Transactions and the transactions under the Implementing Agreements. Buyer has
provided Ashland with a true, complete, correct and fully executed copy of
each Commitment Letter and will provide Ashland with a true, complete, correct
and fully executed copy of each commitment letter entered into in connection
with any Alternate Financing. The Equity Commitment Letter so provided is in
full force and effect and is a valid, legal, binding and enforceable
obligation of the parties thereto. The Debt Commitment Letter so provided is
in full force and effect and is a valid, legal, binding and enforceable
obligation of Buyer, and to the Knowledge of Buyer, the other parties thereto
(provided that, if Buyer has entered into any Alternate Financing, the phrase
"Debt Commitment Letter so provided" shall be deemed to mean, for purposes of
this sentence, the commitment letter with respect to such Alternate
Financing). Any Alternate Financing arranged pursuant to Section 7.6(c)
(including any new financing commitment) put in place after the date hereof
(x) will be in full force and effect from the time the commitment letter(s)
with respect thereto have been executed until the earlier of Closing or such
time as any replacement Alternate Financing (including any new financing
commitment) has been put in place in compliance with Section 7.6(c) and (y)
will be a valid, legal, binding and enforceable obligation of Buyer, and to
the Knowledge of Buyer, the other parties thereto. In addition, (i) except as
expressly permitted by Section 7.6(c) or with the express written consent of
Ashland, (x) no Commitment Letter (or any commitment letter in respect of any
Alternate Financing) has been amended, restated or otherwise modified, (y) the
financing commitments in each Commitment Letter (or any commitment letter in
respect of any Alternate Financing) have not been withdrawn or terminated and
(z) the financing commitments in each Commitment Letter (or any commitment
letter in respect of any Alternate Financing) have not been rescinded in any
respect (and no party thereto has indicated an intent to so   

rescind), (ii) none of Buyer or its Affiliates is in breach of any of the
terms or conditions set forth in any Commitment Letter (or any commitment
letter in respect of any Alternate Financing) and (iii) assuming the accuracy
of the representations and warranties of Ashland set forth in Article 5, in
all material respects and as of the date of this Agreement, no event has
occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
reasonably be expected to constitute a breach on the part of Buyer under any
term or condition of the Debt Commitment Letter. Buyer has fully paid any and
all commitment fees and other fees in connection with the Commitment Letters
(or any commitment letter in respect of any Alternate Financing) that are
payable on or prior to the date of this Agreement and shall in the future pay
any such fees as they become due. There are no side letters or other
agreements, arrangements or understandings (written or oral) relating to the
Financing (other than the Commitment Letters and the Fee Letter) to which
Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the Sponsor Fund) is a party that
impose additional conditions precedent to or are otherwise reasonably likely
to impair or delay the Closing or the availability of the Debt Financing or
any Alternate Financing on the Closing Date.

 

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

46  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in
Section 5 in all material respects and the performance by Ashland of its
obligations under Section 7.6 and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions set forth in Sections 4.1 and 4.2, as of the date hereof, Buyer has
no reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Financing contemplated
by the Commitment Letters (or any Alternate Financing that may be contemplated
by any future commitment letter in respect of any Alternate Financing) will
not be satisfied on the Closing Date or that the Financing or any portion
thereof (or, in the event any Alternate Financing is arranged in accordance
with Section 7.6(a)), the Alternate Financing or any portion thereof) will
otherwise not be available to Buyer on the Closing Date. The net proceeds from
(i) the Financing, when funded in accordance with the Commitment Letters at
the Closing, or (ii) in the event any Alternate Financing is arranged in
accordance with Section 7.6(a), such Alternate Financing, when funded in
accordance with the commitment letters in respect thereof, will constitute all
of the financing required for the consummation of the Contemplated
Transactions pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and be sufficient for the
satisfaction of all of Buyer's obligations under this Agreement and the
Implementing Agreements, including the payment of the Purchase Price and any
other amounts required to be paid in connection with the consummation of the
Contemplated Transactions and the transactions under the Implementing
Agreements. There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies
(including in any fee letter between Buyer and the Lenders (the "Fee Letter"))
(i) to the availability of any "market flex" provisions set forth in any
Commitment Letter (or any commitment letter in respect of any Alternate
Financing) or Fee Letter (or any fee letter in respect of any Alternate
Financing), (ii) other than as expressly set forth in the Debt Commitment
Letter (or any commitment letter in respect of any Alternate Financing), to
any lenders' obligations to fund the Debt Financing or any Alternate Financing
that replaces the Financing and (iii) other than as expressly set forth in the
Equity Commitment Letter, to the Sponsor Fund's obligation to fund the Equity
Financing.

  

  

Section 6.5. Buyer Governmental Consents and Approvals.

  

  

Except as set forth in Schedule 6.5, to the Knowledge of Buyer, the execution
and delivery of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements by each of Buyer
and the relevant Buyer Corporations, and the performance by Buyer and the
relevant Buyer Corporations of their respective obligations hereunder and
thereunder do not and will not require any filing with, or clearance, consent
or approval of, any Governmental Authority, except filings, clearances,
consents or approvals, the failure of which to effect or obtain would not have
a Buyer Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

47  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 6.6. Certain Proceedings.

  

  

As of the date of this Agreement, no Proceeding is pending, or to the
Knowledge of Buyer, threatened in writing, before or by any Governmental
Authority, against Buyer or any Buyer Corporation, which would restrain,
prohibit, invalidate, set aside, rescind, prevent or make unlawful this
Agreement or the carrying out of this Agreement and the Contemplated
Transactions.

  

  

Section 6.7. Brokers.

  

  

No broker, finder or investment banker is entitled to any brokerage, finder's
or other fee or commission in connection with the Contemplated Transactions
based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Buyer.

  

  

Section 6.8. Sponsor Guarantee.

  

  

Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Buyer has delivered to
Ashland a limited guarantee, dated the date hereof, of the Sponsor Fund
guaranteeing certain of Buyer's obligations hereunder (the "Sponsor
Guarantee"). The Sponsor Guarantee is in full force and effect and is a valid,
legal, binding and enforceable obligation of the Sponsor Fund. No event has
occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default on the part of the Sponsor Fund under the Sponsor
Guarantee. Nothing in this Section 6.8 shall be construed to limit in any way
Ashland's right to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of
this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement as contemplated by and subject to the limitations set forth in
Section 11.17.

  

  

Section 6.9. Buyer's Investigation.

  

  

Each of Buyer and the Buyer Corporations is purchasing the Conveyed Assets
based solely on the results of its inspections and investigations, and not on
any representation or warranty of Ashland or any Asset Selling Corporation not
expressly set forth in this Agreement.

  

  

ARTICLE 7.

Closing Date, (i) each of Buyer, Ashland and the Asset Selling Corporations
shall provide or cause to be provided to the other parties all commercially

Business for the twelve month period ended September 30, 2010, and the related
notes thereto, in each case prepared on basis consistent with the Financial
Statements.

  

  

(d) Prior to the Closing, Ashland shall unwind or otherwise amend or
restructure each of (i) the Amended and Restated Transfer and Administration

as enables Ashland and the Asset Selling Corporations to transfer to Buyer and
the Buyer Corporations the Accounts Receivable (other than Allocated Accounts
Receivable) in a form customarily acceptable to asset backed lenders for
purposes of securing asset backed financing facilities.

  

  

Section 7.2. Certain Governmental Matters.

  

  

(a) Without limiting the generality of the undertakings pursuant to this
Section 7.2, Buyer and Ashland agree to take or cause to be taken the
following actions: (i) provide promptly to any Governmental Authority with
regulatory jurisdiction over enforcement of any applicable Competition Laws
("Governmental Competition Authority") information and documents requested by
such Governmental Competition Authority, or necessary, proper or advisable in
connection with the Contemplated Transactions; and (ii) without in any way
limiting the other provisions of this Section 7.2, file any Notification and
Report form pursuant to the HSR Act and related material required under any
Competition Law, including the EU Merger Regulation, in connection with the
Contemplated Transactions as soon as practicable, and thereafter use its
reasonable best efforts to comply as soon as practicable with any requests for
additional information or documentary material that may be made under such
Competition Law. From and after the date hereof and until all governmental
approvals required in connection with the Contemplated Transactions have been
obtained, Buyer shall not, and shall cause each of the Buyer Corporations not
to, operate its business in such manner or take any action, that could
reasonably be expected to significantly increase the risk of not obtaining any
such governmental approval or clearance or the expiration or termination of
any applicable waiting period.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

50  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) Each of Ashland and Buyer shall (i) keep each other apprised of the status
of any communications with, and any inquiries or requests for additional
information from, any Governmental Competition Authority, and shall comply
with any such inquiry or request as promptly as practicable. Ashland and Buyer
shall cooperate and consult with each other in connection with the making of
all filings, notifications and any other material actions pursuant to this
Section 7.2, including, subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of
information, by permitting counsel for the other party to review in advance,
and consider in good faith the views of the other party in connection with,
any proposed written communication to any Governmental Competition Authority
and provide counsel for the other party with copies of all filings and
submissions made by such party and all correspondence and other written
communications between such party (and its advisors) and any Governmental
Competition Authority and any other information supplied by such party and
Ashland, the Asset Selling Corporations or Buyer or the Buyer Corporations, as
the case may be, to a Governmental Competition Authority or received from such
a Governmental Competition Authority in connection with the Contemplated
Transactions; provided, however, that materials may be redacted before being
provided to the other party

  

(x) to remove references concerning the valuation of the Business, (y) as
necessary to comply with contractual arrangements and (z) as necessary to
address reasonable privilege or confidentiality concerns, and (ii) furnish to
the other parties such information and assistance as such parties reasonably
may request in connection with the preparation of any submissions to, or
agency proceedings by, any Governmental Competition Authority. Upon and
subject to the terms of this Section 7.2, each party agrees to cooperate and
use its reasonable best efforts to assist in any defense by any other party to
the Contemplated Transactions before any Governmental Competition Authority
reviewing the Contemplated Transactions, including by providing as promptly as
practicable such information as may be requested by such Governmental
Competition Authority or such assistance as may be reasonably requested by the
other party to this Agreement in such defense.

  

  

(c) If any objections are asserted by any Governmental Competition Authority
with respect to the Contemplated Transactions under any applicable Competition
Law or which would otherwise prevent, materially impede or materially delay
the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions, or if any action is
instituted by any Governmental Competition Authority or any private party
challenging any of the Contemplated Transactions as violative of applicable
Competition Law, or an order is issued enjoining the Contemplated
Transactions, each of Ashland and Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts
to resolve any such objections or suits so as to permit consummation of the
Contemplated Transactions by the Closing, including in order to resolve such
objections or suits which, in any case if not resolved, could reasonably be
expected to prevent, materially impede or materially delay the consummation of
the Contemplated Transactions. In the event that any administrative or
judicial action or proceeding is instituted (or threatened to be instituted)
by a Governmental Competition Authority or private party challenging the
Contemplated Transactions, each of Ashland and Buyer shall cooperate in all
respects with each other and use its respective reasonable best efforts to
contest and resist any such action or proceeding, including defending through
litigation on the merits any claim asserted in any court by any Person, and to
have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction
or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect
and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the Contemplated
Transactions.

  

  

(d) Each of Ashland and Buyer shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause
the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the
applicable Competition Law as soon as practicable. Ashland and Buyer shall not
extend, directly or indirectly, any such waiting period or enter into any
agreement with a Governmental Competition Authority to delay or not to
consummate the Contemplated Transactions on the Closing Date, except with the
prior written consent of the other party to this Agreement. Ashland and Buyer
shall not have any substantive contact with any Governmental Competition
Authority in respect of any filing or proceeding contemplated by this Section
7.2 unless it consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent
permitted by such Governmental Competition Authority, gives the other party
the opportunity to participate.

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

51  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

  

(e) Without limiting the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement,
Buyer shall use reasonable best efforts to take any action necessary to avoid
and eliminate each and every impediment under any applicable United States
Competition Law if required by a Governmental Authority in the United States,
so as to enable the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions as soon as
reasonably possible, including, (i) proposing, negotiating, committing to and
effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order, mitigation agreement or
otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of the respective businesses,
product lines or assets of Buyer and each of the Buyer Corporations (including
the Conveyed Assets) and (ii) otherwise using reasonable best efforts to take
or commit to take actions that after consummation of the Contemplated
Transactions would limit Buyer's or the Buyer Corporations' freedom of action
with respect to, or its or their ability to retain, any of the businesses,
product lines or assets of Buyer or the Buyer Corporations (including the
Conveyed Assets), in each case as may be required in order to avoid the entry
of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining
order, or other order in any suit or proceeding brought under the Competition
Law in the United States, which would otherwise have the effect of preventing
or materially delaying the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions.
Buyer and the Buyer Corporations shall agree to divest, sell, dispose of, hold
separate, or otherwise take or commit to take any actions that limit its or
their freedom of action with respect to, or Buyer's or any Buyer Corporation's
ability to retain, any of the businesses, product lines or assets of Buyer or
any Buyer Corporation (including the Conveyed Assets) if required by a
Governmental Authority in the United States, provided that any such action is
conditioned upon the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions.

  

  

Section 7.3. Update of Schedules.

  

  

(a) Prior to the Closing Date, Ashland (x) shall update the Schedules with
additional material disclosures and (y) may, at its sole option, update the
Schedules with other additional disclosures that, in each case, have arisen or
first been discovered since the date of this Agreement; provided that nothing
in this Section 7.3 is intended to limit Ashland's obligation to update
Schedule 7.5(a), as set forth in Section 7.5(a). In the event that Ashland
updates the Schedules, in accordance with this Section 7.3, Ashland shall
provide such additional disclosures to Buyer by written notice in accordance
with Section 11.1 in the case of disclosures provided pursuant to clause (x),
promptly after senior management of Ashland becomes aware of the same and, in
the case of disclosures provided pursuant to clause (x) or clause (y), no
later than ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date.

  

  

(b) Upon receipt of such notice, Buyer shall have until the earlier of (i)
five (5) Business Days after receipt of such notice and (ii) two (2) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.1(d), if as a result of notice, the condition precedent to Buyer's
obligation to close set forth in Section 4.2(b) or (d) is not satisfied, by
delivering written notice thereof to Ashland in accordance with Section 11.1.
In the event that Buyer does not exercise such termination right, the
additional disclosures delivered by Ashland shall be deemed to be part of the
Schedules as delivered to Buyer on the date of this Agreement solely for
purposes of determining whether the condition precedent to Buyer's obligation
to close in Section 4.2(b) or (d) has been satisfied. For the avoidance of
doubt, such additional disclosures shall be disregarded in connection with
claims for indemnification with respect to representations and warranties made
as of the date hereof.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

52  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) In furtherance of the foregoing, each party acknowledges that the
intention of this Section 7.3 is not to delay or postpone the Closing Date and
except as set forth in this Section 7.3, the exercise, or failure to exercise,
by either party of any right, power or privilege pursuant to this Section 7.3
shall not operate as a waiver of any other right, power or privilege of such
party under this Agreement.

  

  

(d) Prior to the Closing Date, Ashland shall update Schedule 1.1(d) with any
additional disclosures relating to any Conveyed Real Property or Off-Site
Location that have arisen or first been discovered since the date of this
Agreement and for which Ashland has received written notice prior to the
Closing Date of a potential claim or written notice of responsibility with
respect to a Release of any Hazardous Material that may result in assessment,
response, removal, remediation, corrective action or related monitoring
activity in the future.

  

  

Section 7.4. Certain Tax Matters.

  

  

(a) Cooperation on Tax Matters. (i) Buyer and Ashland agree to furnish, or
cause to be furnished, to each other, upon request, in a timely manner, such
information (including access to books and records) and assistance relating to
the Business and the Conveyed Assets as is reasonably necessary for the filing
of any Tax Return, for the preparation or conduct of any audit, and for the
prosecution or defense of any claim, suit or proceeding relating to Taxes.

  

  

(ii) Ashland shall retain, or cause to be retained, all of its Tax and
accounting books and records (including all computerized books and records,
and any such information stored on any other form of media) as well as those
of the Asset Selling Corporations, in each case relevant for Taxes for all
Straddle Tax Periods until the applicable period for assessment under
applicable Law (giving effect to any and all extensions or waivers) has
expired ("Retention Period"), and to abide by all record retention agreements
entered into with any Taxing Authority.

  

  

(iii) To the extent requested by Ashland, and at Ashland's expense, Buyer
shall reasonably cooperate with Ashland in applying for and obtaining any
available Tax refunds with respect to Pre-Closing Date Tax Periods.

  

  

(b) VAT. (i) Subject to Section 7.4(b)(ii), the consideration specified for
all supplies of goods and services made or deemed to be made under or in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, the Implementing Agreements and the Transition Agreements shall be
exclusive of VAT. Ashland and Buyer shall procure that any of their respective
Affiliates receiving the supply in question shall pay to the Person making
that supply (in addition to the specified consideration) all VAT for which the
Person making the supply is required by any Taxing Authority to charge VAT in
relation to that supply. All VAT payable under this Agreement, the
Implementing Agreements and the Transition Agreements shall be paid two (2)
Business Days before that Person has to account for the same, and the supplier
shall provide a properly completed and executed VAT invoice in accordance with
applicable Tax Law.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

53  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(ii) The parties intend that any sale of the Conveyed Assets within the EU
will be treated by the relevant Taxing Authority as a TOGC and the parties
shall use their reasonable efforts to procure that any such sale is so
treated. This obligation shall not require Ashland to make any appeal to any
tribunal or court of law against any determination of any Taxing Authority
that the sale does not amount to a TOGC, unless Buyer has timely notified
Ashland that it requires such appeal or challenge to be made and that it
agrees to indemnify Ashland against all irrecoverable costs and expenses that
Ashland may incur by taking any such required action.

  

  

(iii) Ashland and Buyer shall procure that the Person retaining at the Closing
the VAT records relating to the Business shall preserve such records for such
periods as may be required by the relevant Tax Law and during such periods
shall permit the other party or its agents at all reasonable times and subject
to reasonable written notice to inspect and take copies of such records at the
cost of the Person requesting such inspection and/or copies.

  

  

(iv) If it is finally determined by the relevant Taxing Authority that any
sale of the Conveyed Assets under this Agreement does not constitute a TOGC,
then Buyer shall procure that the VAT chargeable shall be paid by the relevant
Affiliate to Ashland two (2) Business Days before Ashland has to account for
the same and against production of a properly completed and executed VAT
invoice in accordance with applicable Tax Law and any VAT records provided by
Ashland to Buyer or Buyer's Affiliate shall be returned to Ashland. Buyer
shall indemnify or procure that such Affiliate shall indemnify Ashland on an
after Tax basis against any penalty and interest charges incurred by Ashland
to any Taxing Authority in relation to such VAT.

  

  

(c) Transfer Taxes. (i) All recoverable and non-recoverable transfer,
documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration, and other similar Taxes, and all
conveyance fees, recording charges and other fees and charges (such Taxes,
fees and charges, including any penalties or interest but excluding VAT,
"Transfer Taxes") incurred in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Implementing Agreements and
the Transition Agreements, as well as the cost of the filing of all necessary
Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all such Taxes, fees and
charges, shall be borne and paid when due 50% by Buyer and 50% by Ashland, and
Ashland and Buyer shall file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation
required to be filed by it with respect to all such Taxes, fees and charges,
and, if required by applicable Law, the parties will, and will cause their
Affiliates to, join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other
documentation.

  

  

(ii) If there is any available sales Tax exemption in relation to any Conveyed
Assets, Buyer shall timely deliver to Ashland or the relevant Asset Selling
Corporation the relevant sales Tax exemption certificate. If there are any
available exemptions relating to Taxes described in Section 7.4(c)(i), Ashland
and Buyer shall take commercially reasonable actions to secure such
exemptions.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

54  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) FIRPTA Affidavit. Ashland shall deliver to Buyer at the Closing affidavits
(the "FIRPTA Affidavits"), duly executed and acknowledged, certifying that
Ashland or the relevant Asset Selling Corporation will be exempt from
withholding under Section 1445 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

  

  

(e) Allocation of Taxes in Straddle Tax Periods. For purposes of this
Agreement, in the case of Taxes that are payable with respect to a Straddle
Period, the portion of any such Tax that is allocable to the portion of the
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall be:

  

  

(i) in the case of Taxes that are either (x) based upon or related to income
or receipts, or (y) imposed in connection with any sale or other transfer or
assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or intangible), deemed
equal to the amount that would be payable if the taxable year ended on the
Closing Date; and

  

  

(ii) in the case of Taxes imposed on a periodic basis (e.g., real estate
Taxes), deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire period (or, in
the case of such Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such
Taxes for the immediately preceding period), multiplied by a fraction the
numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the period ending on the
Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in
the entire period.

  

  

(f) Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments. Any amount paid by a party to another
party under Sections 2.8, 9.1, 9.2 and 11.9 shall be treated for all Tax
purposes as an adjustment to the Purchase Price to the extent permitted under
applicable Tax Law.

  

  

Section 7.5. Certain Employee Matters.

  

  

(a) Employees. Schedule 7.5(a) lists, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, each Employee as of the date hereof, including the name, title, work
location and employer thereof. If the name of any Employee has been replaced
with an identification number on Schedule 7.5(a) in order to comply with
applicable Law, Ashland shall deliver an update of such Schedule with the
names of such individuals at the Closing. Ashland shall update Schedule 7.5(a)
periodically prior to the Closing Date to reflect, with respect to the
Business, any additional Employees, new hires, retirements, resignations,
dismissals and other employment terminations which may have occurred at any
time on or prior to the Closing Date; provided that one such update shall
occur within ten (10) to thirty (30) days prior to the Closing Date. Prior to
the earlier of the Closing and the valid termination of this Agreement,
Ashland and the Asset Selling Corporations shall not carry out any mass
layoffs or reductions in force involving five or more Employees at any single
site of employment primarily located in the United States without the prior
written agreement of Buyer.

  

  

(b) Continuation of Employment. (i) Where applicable Law provides for the
automatic transfer of employment of any Employee upon the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, the parties shall take or cause to be taken
such actions as are required under applicable Law to accomplish such transfer
of employment of such Employee to Buyer or a Buyer Corporation as a matter of
Law as of the Closing. Where applicable Law does not provide for the transfer
of employment of any Employee upon the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, Buyer shall, or shall cause a Buyer Corporation to, make
offers of at-will (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) employment in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 7.5, to be effective as of the
Closing (or such later date as provided in Section 7.5(e)), to all such
Employees.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

55  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(ii) The parties acknowledge that the transfer of the portions of the Business
conducted by Ashland and the Asset Selling Corporations in the European Union
("EU") and certain other countries listed in Schedule 7.5(b) constitutes a
transfer of business within the meaning of EU Council Directive 2001/23/EC,
the national Laws implementing the same or any similar Laws applicable in non-
EU jurisdictions, and each Employee belonging to said portions of the Business
shall be referred to herein as a "European Employee" and shall be listed in
and designated as such on Schedule 7.5(b), which Schedule shall be updated in
the same manner as Schedule 7.5(a) as described in Section 7.5(a). The parties
further acknowledge that, as a result, the employment of the European
Employees, including all related rights and obligations, will transfer by
operation of Law to Buyer or a Buyer Corporation (as the case may be) as of
the Closing Date, except as otherwise provided in this Section 7.5 and except
with respect to any European Employee who timely exercises his or her rights,
if any, under any applicable Law to prevent such transfer from occurring,
subject to Section 7.5(b)(iii) below (the European Employees whose employment
transfers to Buyer or a Buyer Corporation, the "European Transferred
Employees"). As a result, Buyer or the Buyer Corporations will assume by
operation of Law, as of the Closing Date, all Liabilities towards the European
Transferred Employees except to the extent otherwise provided in this Section
7.5.

  

  

(iii) The parties will use their reasonable efforts to obtain the approval of
the applicable Governmental Authority or any labor authority as may be
required for the transfer of any European Employees who, if any, are
"protected employees" under applicable Law.

  

  

(iv) If any contract of employment or engagement for any individual not listed
in Schedule 7.5(b) as of the Closing Date or any collective agreement not
listed in Schedule 5.18(c) transfers or is alleged to have transferred to
Buyer or a Buyer Corporation pursuant to EU Council Directive 2001/23/EC or
the national Laws implementing the same or any similar Laws applicable in non-
EU jurisdictions, Buyer or Buyer Corporation may terminate such contract or
agreement and Ashland shall indemnify and hold Buyer and Buyer Corporation
harmless against all Liabilities and reasonable attorney fees and costs that
Buyer or Buyer Corporation may suffer, incur, sustain, or pay by reason of, or
on account of, or arising out of such transfer or termination.

  

  

(c) Offers of Employment. Buyer shall, or shall cause a Buyer Corporation to,
make offers of at-will (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) employment
to the Employees in accordance with the provisions of this Section 7.5, at
least thirty (30) days prior to the Closing Date (or such longer period
required by applicable Law or the terms of any Union Contract), with such
employment to be effective as of the Closing (or such later date as provided
in Section 7.5(e)). Any such offer of employment shall be for a position that
is comparable to the type of position held by such Employee immediately prior
to the Closing Date and shall be made on terms and conditions sufficient to
avoid statutory, contractual,   

common law or other severance obligations, other than where such severance is
automatic pursuant to applicable Law or the terms of any Union Contract. Each
Employee (other than a European Employee) who accepts the offer of employment,
including offers described in Section 7.5(e), from Buyer or a Buyer
Corporation, is referred to herein as an "ASC Transferred Employee". ASC
Transferred Employees and European Transferred Employees are referred to
collectively herein as "Transferred Employees". Except as otherwise
specifically provided in this Article VII or to the extent required by
applicable Law, effective as of the Effective Time (or such later date on
which a Transferred Employee commences employment with Buyer or a Buyer
Corporation), the Transferred Employees shall cease all active participation
in and accrual of benefits under the Seller Benefit Plans.

 

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

56  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) Continuation of Compensation and Benefits. For a period of eighteen (18)
months immediately after the Closing Date (or for such longer period as
required by applicable Law or pursuant to the terms of any applicable Union
Contract), Buyer shall (or shall cause the Buyer Corporations to) provide to
each Transferred Employee (i) a base salary or wages no less favorable than
those provided immediately prior to the Closing Date and (ii) other employee
benefits, variable pay, incentive or bonus opportunities under plans, programs
and arrangements that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those
provided by Ashland or the applicable Asset Selling Corporation as expected to
be in effect on January 1, 2011, as set forth on Schedule 7.5(d).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contemplated by this Agreement shall be
construed as requiring either Buyer or any Buyer Corporation to be obligated
to continue the employment of any Transferred Employee for any period after
the applicable Closing Date.

  

  

(e) Inactive Employees. With respect to Employees who are not actively at work
on the Closing Date due to illness, short-term disability (including maternity
leave), worker's compensation or other approved leave of absence (other than
any such Employee whose employment is required to be transferred to Buyer
under applicable Law), Buyer or a Buyer Corporation shall be required to offer
employment to such Employee, in accordance with and subject to the provisions
of this Section 7.5, as of the date such Employee is released to return to
active work at the conclusion of such leave. Ashland or the applicable Asset
Selling Corporation or Affiliate shall have the sole obligation to provide
compensation and benefits to each such Employee as of the Closing Date until
the date he or she becomes a Transferred Employee.

  

  

(f) Severance Obligations. (i) Ashland and Buyer intend that the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall not result in a severance of employment
of any Employee prior to or upon the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and that the Employees will have continuous and
uninterrupted employment immediately before and immediately after the Closing
Date, and Ashland and Buyer shall comply with any requirements under
applicable Law to ensure the same. Subject to Section 7.5(b)(iv), Buyer shall
bear any costs related to, and shall indemnify and hold harmless Ashland and
the Asset Selling Corporations from and against, any claims made by any
Employee for any statutory, contractual or common law severance or separation
benefits and other legally mandated payment obligations (including the
employer portion of any employment taxes, together with any compensation
payable during any mandatory termination notice period related thereto,
collectively, "Separation Benefits"), in each case, arising out of or in
connection with the failure of Buyer or the Buyer Corporations to make offers
of employment or continue the employment of any Employee, in each case in
accordance with this Agreement and as required   

by applicable Law, and Ashland and the Asset Selling Corporations shall bear
any costs related to, and shall indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and the
Buyer Corporations from and against, any claims made by any Employee for any
Separation Benefits that arise out of the refusal of such Employee to accept
an offer of employment made in accordance with this Agreement and applicable
Law by, or an objection by such Employee to an automatic transfer of
employment to, Buyer or a Buyer Corporation or for the liabilities associated
with the agreements listed in Schedule 7.5.

 

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

57  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(ii) Subject to Section 7.5(b)(iv), Buyer shall, or shall cause the Buyer
Corporations to, provide each Transferred Employee whose employment is
terminated within eighteen (18) months following the Closing Date with
severance and other separation benefits substantially comparable to the
severance and other separation benefits provided to such Transferred Employee
by Ashland or the applicable Asset Selling Corporation as in effect as of the
date of this Agreement.

  

  

(g) Allocation of Employment Liabilities. (i) Except as otherwise specifically
provided in this Article VII, Ashland and the Asset Selling Corporations shall
retain liability and responsibility and shall indemnify and hold Buyer and its
Affiliates harmless for all employment and employee-benefit related
liabilities, obligations, claims or losses (including the payment of wages,
bonuses, profit share and other compensation entitlements and the provision of
employee benefits and any "withdrawal liabilities" as defined in Sections 4203
or 4205 of ERISA), that relate to any period prior to the Effective Time,
whether or not such liabilities, obligations, claims or losses become due
before, on or after the Closing Date, that relate to (x) the Employees or (y)
any individual who was formerly employed by or provided services to Ashland or
any of its Affiliates and whose employment or service relationship terminated
for any reason prior to the Closing Date (the "Former Employees")(or any
dependent or beneficiary of any such Employee or any such individual). Except
as otherwise specifically provided in this Article VII, effective as of the
Effective Time, Buyer or a Buyer Corporation shall assume and be solely
responsible and shall indemnify and hold Ashland and its Affiliates harmless
for all employment and employee-benefits related liabilities, obligations,
claims or losses that relate to the Transferred Employees (or any dependent or
beneficiary of any Transferred Employee) that relate to any period on or after
the Effective Time, whether or not such liabilities, obligations, claims or
losses become due on or after the Closing Date, or are otherwise expressly
assumed by Buyer or a Buyer Corporation pursuant to this Agreement.

  

  

(ii) Ashland and the Asset Selling Corporations shall retain all liabilities
and obligations for all workers' compensation, short- and long-term
disability, medical, prescription drug, dental, vision, life insurance,
accidental death and dismemberment and other welfare benefit claims incurred
by Former Employees and Employees prior to the Effective Time that are covered
under the terms of the applicable plans of Ashland and the Asset Selling
Corporations or their respective Affiliates. With respect to claims incurred
on or after the Effective Time by the Transferred Employees and their eligible
dependents for workers' compensation, short- and long-term disability,
medical, prescription drug, dental, vision, life insurance, accidental death
and dismemberment and other welfare benefit claims, Buyer or a Buyer
Corporation shall be responsible. For these purposes, a claim shall be deemed
to be incurred: (i) in the case of workers' compensation and short- or long-
term disability benefits (including related health benefits), at the time of
the injury, sickness or other event giving rise to the claim for such
benefits; (ii) in the case of medical, prescription drug, dental or vision
benefits, at the time professional services, equipment or prescription drugs
covered by the applicable plan are obtained; (iii) in the case of life
insurance benefits, upon death; and (iv) in the case of accidental death and
dismemberment benefits, at the time of the accident.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

58  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(iii) The liabilities, obligations, claims and losses that are retained by
Ashland and the Asset Selling Corporations pursuant to Sections 7.5(g)(i) and
(ii) above are referred to herein as the "Retained Employee Liabilities."

  

  

(h) Service Credit. Effective from and after the Effective Time, Buyer or a
Buyer Corporation shall (i) recognize, for all purposes (including
eligibility, vesting and benefit levels and accruals, but other than benefit
accrual under a defined benefit pension plan (other than any Seller Benefit
Plan that is assumed by Buyer or a Buyer Corporation)) under all plans,
programs and arrangements, established or maintained by Buyer or a Buyer
Corporation for the benefit of the Transferred Employees, service with Ashland
or the Asset Selling Corporations and their respective Affiliates prior to the
Closing Date to the extent such service was recognized under the corresponding
Seller Benefit Plan covering such Transferred Employees and (ii) waive any
pre-existing condition exclusion, actively-at-work requirement or waiting
period under all employee health and other welfare benefit plans established
or maintained by Buyer or a Buyer Corporation for the benefit of the
Transferred Employees, except to the extent such pre-existing condition
exclusion, requirement or waiting period would have applied to such individual
under the corresponding Seller Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Closing,
and (iii) provide full credit for any co-payments, deductibles or similar
payments made or incurred prior to the Closing Date for the plan year in which
the Closing occurs.

  

  

(i) Accrued Vacation. Except as otherwise required under applicable Law, as of
12:01 a.m. on the Closing Date, Buyer or a Buyer Corporation shall assume and
honor all vacation days and paid time off days accrued but not yet taken by
the Transferred Employees as of the Closing Date, to the extent reflected in
the Agreed Closing Account (it being understood that Buyer or a Buyer
Corporation may deduct from the number of vacation days and paid time off days
made available to any such Employee the number of days of vacation or paid
time off previously taken by such Employee in the applicable year).

  

  

(j) Bonuses. Within 120 days following the Closing Date, Ashland and the Asset
Selling Corporations shall make any payments to the Transferred Employees
pursuant to any variable pay, bonus, cash performance and incentive plans in
respect of the period prior to the Closing Date. Following the Closing Date,
Transferred Employees shall participate in any variable pay, bonus, cash
performance and incentive plans established or maintained by Buyer or a Buyer
Corporation.

  

  

(k) In the case of any Employee referred to in Section 7.5(e), except as
otherwise required by applicable Law or otherwise specifically provided in
this Agreement, references to Closing Date in Sections 7.5(g) through (j)
shall instead be deemed to refer to the date such Employee became a
Transferred Employee.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

59  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(l) 401(k) Plan. If Buyer or a Buyer Corporation maintains or establishes a
defined contribution plan that includes a qualified cash or deferred
arrangement within the meaning of Section 401(k) of the Code ("Buyer's 401(k)
Plan"), Buyer or a Buyer Corporation shall permit each Transferred Employee
participating in a Seller Benefit Plan that is a defined contribution plan
with a qualified cash or deferred arrangement within the meaning of Section
401(k) of the Code ("Seller's 401(k) Plan") to effect, and Buyer or a Buyer
Corporation agrees to cause Buyer's 401(k) Plan to accept, in accordance with
applicable law, a "direct rollover" (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31)
of the Code) of his or her account balances (including earnings thereon
through the date of transfer and promissory notes evidencing all outstanding
loans) under Seller's 401(k) Plan if such rollover to Buyer's 401(k) Plan is
elected in accordance with applicable law by such Transferred Employee,
subject to each of Ashland's or the Asset Selling Corporation's and Buyer's
reasonable satisfaction that Seller's 401(k) Plan or Buyer's 401(k) Plan, as
applicable, is in compliance with all applicable Laws and that such plan
continues to satisfy the requirements for a qualified plan under Section
401(a) of the Code and that the trust that forms a part of such plan is exempt
from tax under Section 501(a) of the Code. Upon completion of a direct
rollover of a Transferred Employee's account balances, as described in this
Section 7.5(l), Buyer or a Buyer Corporation and Buyer's 401(k) Plan shall be
fully responsible for all benefits relating to past service of such
Transferred Employee and none of Ashland, the Asset Selling Corporations and
Seller's 401(k) Plan shall have any liability whatsoever with respect to such
benefits.

  

  

(m) WARN Act. Buyer agrees to provide, or cause its Affiliates to provide, any
required notice under WARN and any similar federal, state or local Law or
regulation, and to otherwise comply with WARN and any other similar Law or
regulation, in each case with respect to any "plant closing" or "mass layoff"
(as defined in WARN) or group termination or similar event affecting Employees
(including as a result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement) and occurring on and after the Effective Time. None of Buyer
or any of its Affiliates shall take any action after the Closing that would
cause any termination of employment of any Employees that occurs before the
Effective Time to constitute a "plant closing" or "mass layoff" or group
termination under WARN or any similar federal, state or local Law or
regulation, or to create any liability or penalty to Ashland or any Asset
Selling Corporation for any employment terminations under applicable Law.

  

  

(n) Employee Consultations. Ashland and the Asset Selling Corporations shall
fully comply with all of its or their obligations (however arising) to inform
and consult with, and in respect of, the Employees of the Business, whether
the same arises under a Union Contract or applicable Law. To the extent such
communications occur in writing, Ashland and the Asset Selling Corporations
will provide a copy to Buyer at the time such communications occur and will
provide Buyer any written responses to said communications promptly after the
time they are received. Buyer or Buyer's Affiliates shall fully comply with
all of its or their obligations (however arising) to inform and consult with,
and in respect of, the Employees of the Business, whether the same arises
under a Union Contract or applicable Law. To the extent such communications
occur in writing, Buyer and Buyer's Affiliates will provide a copy to Ashland
at the time such communications occur and will provide Ashland any written
responses to said communications promptly after the time they are received.

  

  

(o) Union Contracts. From and after the Closing, Buyer shall, and shall cause
the Buyer Corporations to, comply with any applicable labor, employment and
retirement Laws with respect to the Transferred Employees, and shall recognize
any collective bargaining units representing the Transferred Employees that
are recognized as of immediately prior to the Closing.

  

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

60  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

  

(p) Retained Non-U.S. Ashland Pension Plans. Ashland or the applicable Asset
Selling Corporation shall retain or shall cause to be retained all assets and
liabilities under each Retained Non-U.S. Ashland Pension Plan and shall make
payments to Employees with vested rights thereunder in accordance with the
terms of such plan and applicable Law. With respect to each Retained Non-U.S.
Ashland Pension Plan, as of the applicable date the applicable Employees
become Transferred Employees, each Transferred Employee shall cease active
participation in such Retained Non-U.S. Ashland Pension Plan, and service
performed for, and compensation earned from, any employer, other than Ashland,
the Asset Selling Corporations and their predecessors, shall not be taken into
account for any purpose under such Retained Non-U.S. Ashland Pension Plan,
unless required by Law.

  

  

(q) Transferred Non-U.S. Ashland Pension Plan. With respect to each
Transferred Non-U.S. Ashland Pension Plan, Buyer, a Buyer Corporation or the
applicable pension plan of Buyer or a Buyer Corporation shall assume all
liabilities for all accrued benefits under such plan, as of the Effective
Time, and in accordance with the terms of applicable Law. Following any such
transfer of liabilities, none of Ashland or any Asset Selling Corporation
shall have any further liability for any accrued benefits under such plan. If
any assets with respect to any Transferred Non-U.S. Ashland Pension Plan are
required by applicable Law to be transferred to Buyer in connection with the
transfer of liabilities, such assets shall be transferred pursuant to
applicable Law.

  

  

(r) Vesting of Retirement Plans. Prior to the Closing Date, Ashland or the
applicable Asset Selling Corporations shall take all necessary actions to
fully vest all accrued accounts, benefits or payments each Transferred
Employee may be entitled to receive under all Seller Benefit Plans that are
non-qualified retirement plans or arrangements and any Seller 401(k) Plan, to
the extent not already vested.

  

  

(s) No Third Party Beneficiaries. The provisions of this Section 7.5 are
solely for the benefit of the respective parties to this Agreement and nothing
in this Section 7.5, express or implied, shall confer upon any Employee, or
legal representative or beneficiary thereof, any rights or remedies, including
any right to employment or continued employment for any specified period, or
compensation or benefits of any nature or kind whatsoever under this
Agreement. Nothing in this Section 7.5, express or implied, shall be (i)
deemed an amendment of any plan providing benefits to any Employee, or (ii)
construed to prevent Buyer from terminating or modifying to any extent or in
any respect any benefit plan that Buyer may establish or maintain.

  

  

Section 7.6. Financing.

  

  

(a) Buyer shall, and shall cause Sponsor to, use reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, do, or cause to be done,
all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law, and to execute
and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, such instruments and
documents as may be necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and obtain the
Financing as promptly as reasonably practicable on the terms (including the
"market flex" provisions) and subject only to the conditions described in the
Commitment Letters and Fee Letter, including, in the case of the Debt
Financing, (i) to negotiate and enter into definitive agreements (the
"Definitive Agreements") with respect to the   

Debt Financing on the terms (including the "market flex" provisions) and
subject only to the conditions contained in the Debt Commitment Letter and Fee
Letter (without regard to any adverse impact on any of Buyer's corporate
default or equivalent credit ratings (whether by Moody's, Standard and Poor's or

the Lenders shall agree so long as the terms of the Definitive Agreements (w)
do not reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing to below
$600,000,000, (x) do not contain additional or modified conditions or other
contingencies to the funding of the Debt Financing than those contained in the
Debt Commitment Letter, and (y) are otherwise not reasonably likely to impair
or delay the Closing or the date on which the Debt Financing would be
obtained, (ii) to satisfy (or obtain the waiver of) on a timely basis all
conditions to obtaining the Financing applicable to Buyer or its Affiliates
set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter and the Definitive Agreements, (iii)
to comply in all material respects with its obligations under the Debt
Commitment Letter (or obtain the waiver of such obligations) and (iv) to
consummate the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter and
the Fee Letter (including the "market flex" provisions) at the Closing,

(b) Buyer shall give Ashland prompt notice upon becoming aware of any material
breach of any Commitment Letter or Definitive Agreement (if a Definitive

Letter or Definitive Agreement (if a Definitive Agreement is executed prior to
Closing). Buyer shall keep Ashland informed on a timely basis and in
reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing and
any material developments relating to the Financing and shall provide to
Ashland, upon its request, copies of the Definitive Agreements and any other
agreements in respect of the Financing (provided that Buyer may redact the
amount of any fee, including in any "market flex" provisions, in any Fee
Letter). Further, Buyer shall not agree to or permit any amendment, supplement
or other modification of, or waive any of its rights under, any Commitment
Letter, Fee Letter or any Definitive Agreement without Ashland's prior written
consent, except that Buyer may amend, supplement or modify the Debt Commitment
Letter, Fee Letter or Definitive Agreement if such amendment, supplement or
modification (i) does not reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing,
(ii) does not contain additional or modified conditions or other contingencies
to the funding of the Debt Financing relative to those contained in the Debt
Commitment Letter, and (iii) is otherwise not reasonably likely to impair or
delay the Closing or the date on which the Debt Financing would be obtained;
provided, however, that Buyer shall notify Ashland in writing of any such
amendment, supplement or other modification of, or waiver of any of its rights
under, any Commitment Letter or any Definitive Agreement no later than the

refrain from taking, directly or indirectly, any action that is reasonably
likely to result in the failure of any of the conditions contained in any
Commitment Letter or any Definitive Agreement.

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, at the Buyer's option
after the date of this Agreement but prior to Closing, one or more Commitment
Letters may be superseded by replacement commitments (other than amounts that
are replaced by Buyer's cash on hand) from alternate sources (such portion
from alternate sources, the "Alternate Financing") on terms and conditions
that will enable Buyer to consummate the Contemplated Transactions and that
are not less favorable in the aggregate to Buyer and Ashland than   

those contained in the Commitment Letters and Fee Letter; provided that such
Alternate Financing shall not (i) be subject to any additional or materially
modified conditions or other contingencies to the funding of the Financing
than those contained in the Commitment Letters or (ii) otherwise be reasonably
likely to impair or delay the Closing or the date on which the Financing would
be obtained. Buyer shall deliver to Ashland complete and correct copies of all
amendments, supplements, other modifications or agreements pursuant to which
any Alternate Financing shall be made available to Buyer. In the event all or
any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and
conditions contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter, Buyer shall immediately
notify Ashland and Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain
promptly any such unavailable amount in the form of Alternate Financing.

warranty, covenant or other term in this Agreement to be breached or (z) cause
any closing condition set forth in Article 4 to fail to be satisfied),

Notice shall be the date of delivery of the Required Information) and any

the Closing in Article 4 (other than the condition set forth in Section 4.1(d)
and other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at
the Closing) shall have been satisfied or (to the extent permitted by
applicable Law) waived and the Marketing Period has expired and (ii) the
bridge facilities contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter are available,
then Buyer shall borrow under such bridge facilities, and cause the proceeds
of such borrowing to replace such privately offered note financing, no later

Competitive Activity exceed 15% of such aggregate annual Operating Income,
Ashland shall be required to attempt to divest such excess portion of the
Competitive Activity at such price and on such terms as Ashland deems

(a) On and after the Closing Date, except as expressly provided in this
Section 7.14, neither Buyer, any Buyer Corporation nor any of their respective
Affiliates shall use the "Ashland," "Ash," "ADC", "Ashdist" "GP" or
"GPezorder" names, marks, domain names and logos (the "Retained Names") or any

Within one hundred eighty (180) days after the Closing, Buyer shall, and shall
cause its Affiliates to revise print advertising, product labeling and all

during such one hundred eighty (180) day period, Buyer may continue to
distribute product literature that uses any Retained Names and distribute
products with labeling or packaging that uses any Retained Names. In no event
shall Buyer or any of its Affiliates use any Retained Names after the Closing
in any manner or for any purpose different from the use of such Retained Names
by Ashland prior to the Closing. With respect to the Inventory, Buyer may

Affiliates, directors, officers, managers, members, partners, employees,
investment bankers, financial advisors, representatives or agents not to,
directly or indirectly, (a) discuss or negotiate with any Person (except to
notify such Person of the existence of this Section 7.15) or knowingly

ARTICLE 8.

  

TERMINATION

  

  

Section 8.1. Termination Events.

  

  

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, this Agreement may
be terminated and the Contemplated Transactions abandoned at any time prior to
the Closing:

  

  

(a) by mutual written consent of Ashland and Buyer;

  

  

(b) by Ashland if (i) Buyer shall have breached or failed to perform any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in
this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (x) would result in the
failure of a condition set forth in Section 4.1 or 4.3 and (y) (A) cannot be
cured by the End Date or (B) if capable of being cured by the End Date, shall
not have been cured within thirty (30) days following receipt of written
notice from Ashland of such breach or failure to perform or any shorter period
of time that remains between the date of such written notice and the End Date
or (ii) if all of the conditions set forth in Sections 4.1 and 4.2 have been
satisfied or waived (other than the condition set forth in Section 4.1(d) and
other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by
actions taken at the Closing) and Buyer fails to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement within five Business Days following the date
the Closing should have occurred pursuant to Section 3.1 and the Company stood
ready and willing to consummate during such period (it being understood that,
during such period of five Business Days following the date the Closing should
have occurred pursuant to Section 3.1, Buyer shall not be entitled to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(e)(ii));

  

  

(c) by Buyer if (i) Ashland shall have breached or failed to perform any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in
this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (x) would result in the
failure of a condition set forth in Section 4.1 or 4.2 and (y) (A) cannot be
cured by the End Date or (B) if capable of being cured by the End Date, shall
not have been cured within thirty (30) days following receipt of written
notice from Buyer of such breach or failure to perform or any shorter period
of time that remains between the date of such written notice and the End Date.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

73  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) by Buyer on the circumstances contemplated by Section 7.3(b); or

  

  

(e) by either Ashland or Buyer if (i) any of the conditions set forth in
Section 4.1 shall have become incapable of fulfillment due to (x) the final
and nonappealable entry of any Order preventing or enjoining the Contemplated
Transactions or(y) the final and nonappealable entry of any Legal Restraint
preventing the Contemplated Transactions or (ii) the Closing has not occurred
(other than through the failure of any party seeking to terminate this
Agreement to comply fully with its obligations under this Agreement) on or
before

  

April 30, 2011 or such later date as the parties may agree upon (such date,
the "End Date").

  

  

Section 8.2. Effect of Termination.

  

  

(a) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1, all obligations
of the parties under this Agreement will terminate, except that the Sponsor
Guarantee will survive in accordance with its terms and the obligations in
Sections 7.6(d) with respect to confidentiality and expense reimbursement,
7.12(a) with respect to confidentiality, 8.2, 11.7, 11.8, 11.9,11.10 and 11.17
will survive; provided, however, that if this Agreement is terminated by Buyer
pursuant to Section 8.1(c), then Buyer's right to pursue all legal and
equitable remedies will survive such termination unimpaired and nothing in
this Section 8.2 shall be deemed to release Ashland from any liability for any
breach of the terms, conditions, covenants and other provisions of this
Agreement or to impair the right of Buyer to compel specific performance by
Ashland of its obligations under this Agreement; provided, further, that if
this Agreement is terminated by Ashland pursuant to Section 8.1(b), then,
except for Ashland's right to seek specific performance in accordance with
Section 11.17 and Ashland's right to enforce the Sponsor Guarantee, Ashland's
sole and exclusive remedy against Buyer or the Sponsor Fund or any former,
current or future stockholder, controlling person, director, officer,
employee, general or limited partner, member, manager, Affiliate, agent or
assignee of any of the foregoing or any Financing Sources for any loss
suffered as a result of any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement prior to the Closing or the failure of the Contemplated
Transactions to be consummated shall be its rights under Section 8.2(b) and
8.2(c).

  

  

(b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(b),
then Buyer shall promptly, but in no event later than five Business Days after
the date of such termination, pay or cause to be paid to Ashland of
immediately available funds by wire transfer in accordance with written
instructions given by Ashland to Buyer (it being understood that in no event
shall Buyer be required to pay the Buyer Fee on more than one occasion) an
amount equal to $120 million (the "Buyer Fee").

  

  

(c) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in Section 8.2 are
an integral part of the Contemplated Transactions, and that, without these
agreements, the parties would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if
Buyer fails to promptly pay the amount due pursuant to Section 8.2(b), and, in
order to obtain such payment, Ashland commences a suit that results in a
judgment against Buyer for the amount set forth in Section 8.2(b) or any
portion thereof, Buyer shall pay to Ashland its costs and expenses (including
attorneys' fees) in connection with such suit, together with interest on such
amount or portion thereof at the Interest Rate in effect on the date such
payment was required to be made through the date of payment.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

74  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Ashland's
receipt and acceptance of the Buyer Fee, if any, pursuant to Section 8.2(b)
(plus, in the case the Buyer Fee, if any, is not timely paid, the amounts
described in Section 8.2(c)) and Ashland's receipt and acceptance of the
reimbursement and indemnification obligations of Buyer pursuant to Section 7.6
shall, subject to Ashland's right to seek specific performance in accordance
with Section 11.17 and Ashland's rights under the Sponsor Guarantee, be the
sole and exclusive remedy of Ashland against Buyer and any of its former,
current or future stockholders, controlling persons, directors, officers,
employees, general or limited partners, members, managers, Affiliates, agents
or assignees or any Financing Sources for any loss suffered as a result of any
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in this
Agreement or the failure of the Contemplated Transactions to be consummated,
and upon payment in full of such amounts, none of Buyer or any of its former,
current or future stockholders, controlling persons, directors, officers,
employees, general or limited partners, members, managers, Affiliates, agents
or assignees shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions.

  

  

(e) For the avoidance of doubt, under no circumstances will Ashland or any of
its Affiliates be entitled to monetary damages (which, for the avoidance of
doubt, shall not include amounts owed to Ashland pursuant to the reimbursement
and indemnification obligations of Buyer under Section 7.6) from any of Buyer
(except to the extent provided in Sections 8.2(b) and 8.2(c)), the Sponsor
Fund or any former, current or future stockholder, controlling person,
director, officer, employee, general or limited partner, member, manager,
Affiliate, agent or assignee of any of the foregoing or any Financing Source
as a result of any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement of Buyer arising prior to the Closing Date.

  

  

ARTICLE 9.

  

INDEMNIFICATION

  

  

Section 9.1. Indemnification by Ashland.

  

  

Subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement, from and after the
Closing Date Ashland shall indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and its
Affiliates and each of their respective officers, directors, employees,
agents, advisors or representatives (the "Buyer Indemnitees"), from and
against any and all claims, actions, causes of action, judgments, awards,
Liabilities, losses, costs, expenses (including reasonable legal fees and
expenses), fines or damages (each, a "Loss", collectively the "Losses")
incurred or suffered to the extent such arise or result from:

  

  

(a) any breach of any covenant or agreement of Ashland or any of its
Affiliates to be performed on or prior to the Closing Date, in each case
contained in this Agreement or in any Implementing Agreement or Transition
Agreement delivered by Ashland or any of its Affiliates pursuant to this
Agreement (including in the certificate delivered pursuant to Section 4.2(b)),
or any breach or inaccuracy of any warranty or representation of Ashland
contained in this Agreement; provided that the phrases "have a Material
Adverse Effect" and "had a Material Adverse Effect" as used in the
representations and warranties in Article 5 shall be deemed to be replaced by
the phrases "be material to the Business in the aggregate" and "been material
to the Business in the aggregate", respectively;

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

75  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) any breach of any covenant or agreement of Ashland or any of its
Affiliates to be performed after the Closing Date, in each case contained in
this Agreement or in any Implementing Agreement or Transition Agreement
delivered by Ashland or any of its Affiliates pursuant to this Agreement; or

  

  

(c) any Retained Liability (including Retained Tax Liabilities).

  

  

In no event shall Ashland be obligated to indemnify any Buyer Indemnitee with
respect to any matter to the extent that such matter was reflected in the
calculation of the adjustment to the Purchase Price, if any, pursuant to
Section 2.8.

  

  

Section 9.2. Indemnification by Buyer.

  

  

Subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement, from and after the
Closing Date Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Ashland and its
Affiliates and each of their respective officers, directors, employees,
agents, advisors or representatives (the "Ashland Indemnitees"), from and
against any and all Losses incurred or suffered to the extent such arise or
result from:

  

  

(a) any breach of any covenant or agreement of Buyer or any of its Affiliates
to be performed on or prior to the Closing Date, in each case contained in
this Agreement or in any Implementing Agreement or Transition Agreement
delivered by Buyer or any of its Affiliates pursuant to this Agreement, or any
breach or inaccuracy of any warranty or representation of Buyer contained in
this Agreement (including in the certificate delivered pursuant to Section
4.3(b));

  

  

(b) any breach of any covenant or agreement of Buyer or any of its Affiliates
to be performed after the Closing Date, in each case contained in this
Agreement or in any Implementing Agreement or Transition Agreement delivered
by Buyer or any of its Affiliates pursuant to this Agreement;

  

  

(c) any Assumed Liability (including Assumed Tax Liabilities); or

  

  

(d) any Retained Litigation Liability or Retained Remediation Liability for
which Ashland's obligation to indemnify Buyer has terminated in accordance
with Section 2.5(k), (l), and (m) (as applicable) or the terms and conditions
of Sections 9.5 or 9.6.

  

  

Section 9.3. Notice of Claims.

  

  

(a) If any of the Persons to be indemnified under this Article 9 (the
"Indemnified Party") has suffered or incurred any Loss (other than one
resulting from a Third Party Claim), the Indemnified Party shall so notify in
writing the party from whom indemnification is sought (the "Indemnifying
Party") promptly after obtaining knowledge of such claim, describing such
Loss, the amount or estimated amount thereof, if known or reasonably capable
of estimation, and the method of computation of such Loss, all with reasonable
specificity and containing a reference to the provisions of this Agreement,
any Implementing Agreement or any Transition Agreement in respect of which
such Loss shall have occurred. A failure to give notice in a timely manner
pursuant to this Section 9.3(a) shall not limit the obligation of the
Indemnifying Party under this Article 9: (i) except to the extent   

such Indemnifying Party is prejudiced thereby and (ii) except to the extent
expenses are incurred during the period in which notice was not provided. The
Indemnified Party shall reasonably cooperate and assist the Indemnifying Party
in determining the validity of any claim of indemnity (including reasonable
access to and copies of records and information that are reasonably relevant
to such matters and the making available of employees on a mutually convenient
basis for providing additional information and explanation of any material
relating to such matters). If the Indemnifying Party does not notify the
Indemnified Party within sixty (60) calendar days following its receipt of a
notice delivered pursuant to this Section 9.3 that the Indemnifying Party
disputes its liability to the Indemnified Party under this Article 9, such
claim specified by the Indemnified Party in such notice shall be conclusively
determined to be a liability of the Indemnifying Party.

 

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

76  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) If any Proceeding is instituted by or against a third party with respect
to which the Indemnified Party intends to claim any Liability or expense as a
Loss under this Article 9, the Indemnified Party shall promptly following
receipt by such Indemnified Party of notice of the Third Party Claim notify
the Indemnifying Party in writing and in reasonable detail of such Proceeding.
Thereafter, the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party,
promptly following the Indemnified Party's receipt thereof, copies of all
notices and documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnified
Party relating to the Third Party Claim. A failure to give notice and to
tender the defense of the Proceeding in a timely manner pursuant to this
Section 9.3(b) shall not limit the obligation of the Indemnifying Party under
this Article 9: (i) except to the extent such Indemnifying Party is prejudiced
thereby, and for this purpose, any failure to give notice and to tender the
defense that results in the Indemnifying Party not controlling or
participating in such Proceeding shall be deemed to prejudice the Indemnifying
Party, (ii) except to the extent expenses are incurred during the period in
which notice was not provided, and (iii) except as provided by Section 9.4
below.

  

  

Section 9.4. Third Party Claims.

  

  

(a) The Indemnifying Party under this Article 9 shall have the right, but not
the obligation, to conduct and control, through counsel of its choosing, the
defense or prosecution, as applicable, of any third party claim, action or
suit for which indemnity may be sought under Section 9.1 or 9.2 (a "Third
Party Claim"), and the Indemnifying Party may compromise or settle the same;
provided that the Indemnifying Party shall give the Indemnified Party advance
notice of any proposed compromise or settlement; provided, further, that the
Indemnifying Party will not, in defense of such Third Party Claim, except with
the consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), consent to the entry of any judgment or
enter into any settlement (i) which provides for any relief other than the
payment of monetary damages and/or (ii) which does not include as an
unconditional term thereof the giving by the third party claimant to the
Indemnified Party of a release from all liability in respect thereof.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to
assume the defense or prosecution of any Third Party Claim if at the time of
assumption (x) the Indemnifying Party fails to demonstrate its ability to
conduct the defense or prosecution actively and diligently, (y) a majority of
the damages associated with such Third Party Claim are not reasonably expected
to be indemnifiable hereunder or (z) the relief sought in connection with such
Third Party Claim consists primarily of injunctive or other equitable relief.
If it assumes the defense or   

prosecution of any Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall permit the
Indemnified Party to participate in, but not control or file any papers in
respect of, the defense or prosecution of any such action or suit through
counsel chosen by the Indemnified Party, provided that the fees and expenses
of such counsel and any counsel retained or used by the Indemnified Party from
the time the Indemnifying Party assumed the defense or prosecution of the
Third Party Claim shall be borne by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying
Party shall be liable for the fees, costs and expenses of counsel employed by
the Indemnified Party for any period during which the Indemnifying Party has
not assumed the defense or prosecution of a Third Party Claim (other than
during any period in which the Indemnified Party shall have failed to give
notice of the Third Party Claim as provided in Section 9.3). Whether or not
the Indemnifying Party shall have assumed the defense or prosecution of a
Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall not admit any liability with
respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge such Third Party Claim, without
the Indemnifying Party's prior written consent. The election of the
Indemnifying Party to assume the defense or prosecution of a Third Party Claim
will not be deemed an admission by the Indemnifying Party that the claims made
in the Third Party Claim are within the scope of or subject to indemnification
under this Agreement. If the Indemnifying Party elects not to control or
conduct the defense or prosecution of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying
Party shall have the right to participate in, but not conduct or control, the
defense or prosecution of any Third Party Claim and, at its own expense, to
employ counsel of its own choosing for such purpose.

 

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

77  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) The parties shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution of any Third
Party Claim, with such cooperation to include (i) the retention and, upon the
Indemnifying Party's request, the provision to the Indemnifying Party of
records and information that are reasonably relevant to such Third Party
Claim, and (ii) the making available of employees on a mutually convenient
basis for providing additional information and explanation of any material
provided hereunder.

  

  

Section 9.5. Expiration.

  

  

(a) Subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement, all covenants,
agreements (including those relating to indemnification in Sections 9.1 and
9.2), warranties and representations made herein shall survive the Closing.

  

  

(b) Unless otherwise specified in this Agreement, including as set forth in
Sections 9.5(c), 9.6, 9.7 and 9.8 and in Article 10, neither Ashland nor Buyer
will have any liability (for indemnification or otherwise) for breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or for any obligation contained in this
Agreement or any Implementing Agreement or Transition Agreement unless on or
before the eighteen (18) month anniversary of the Closing Date, a written
notice in accordance with Section 9.3 has been received by the appropriate
Indemnifying Party; and

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding subparagraph (b) above: (i) the representations and
warranties contained in Sections 5.1(a) (Organization), 5.2 (Authority;
Binding Effect), 5.21 (Brokers), 6.1 (Organization), 6.2 (Authority; Binding
Effect) and 6.7 (Brokers) (collectively, the "Fundamental Representations")
shall survive the Closing until the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations and the representation and warranty contained in Section 5.14(e)
shall survive the Closing until the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date,
(ii) the Tax representations and warranties set forth in Section 5.17 shall
not survive the Closing for any purpose, (iii) the obligations of Ashland to
indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees for any   

Retained Tax Liabilities and of Buyer to indemnify Ashland Indemnitees for
Assumed Tax Liabilities and under Section 3.1(b)(v) shall survive the Closing
indefinitely, (iv) the covenants and agreements of the parties hereto
(including those relating to indemnification in Sections 9.1 and 9.2) to be
performed after the Closing Date survive for such length of time in accordance
with their respective terms and (v) the obligations of Ashland to indemnify
the Buyer Indemnitees for any Retained Remediation Liabilities shall survive
the Closing until, with respect to any Losses related to any individual matter
or location subject to indemnification under Section 9.1(c), Ashland addresses
the Release giving rise to such Losses as necessary to comply with
Environmental Law or any applicable Contract with any Governmental Authority,
including meeting applicable clean-up standards or obtaining a No Further
Action Letter, Letter of Completion or other written communication of similar
import from any Governmental Authority with primary jurisdiction over the
relevant matter, after which such Losses shall no longer be subject to
indemnification by Ashland, notwithstanding that any survival period
applicable generally to the Retained Specified Remediation Liabilities or the
Other Retained Remediation Liabilities may not have expired, and Buyer shall
pay, perform and discharge all Liabilities, obligations and commitments
relating to such Losses. Any claims in connection with intentional misconduct
or intentional misrepresentation shall survive indefinitely.

 

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

78  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 9.6. Limitations on Amount.

  

  

(a) Ashland shall not have any liability under Section 9.1(a) for any
individual Loss (or series of connected Losses) hereunder unless such
individual Loss (or series of connected Losses) exceeds U.S.$175,000 and
unless the aggregate of all such Losses for which Ashland would, but for this
provision, be liable exceeds on a cumulative basis, U.S.$18,600,000 (the
"Basket") and, if such amount is exceeded, Ashland shall be required to pay
only the amount of such Losses which exceeds the amount of the Basket;
provided, however, that Ashland shall not have any liability for any such
Losses pursuant to Section 9.1(a) in excess of, on a cumulative basis, U.S.
$93,000,000 (the "Ceiling").

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in Section 9.6(a),
neither the Basket nor the Ceiling shall apply to any Liability for any
Losses: (i) with respect to breaches of the Fundamental Representations or
(ii) relating to Taxes.

  

  

(c) Ashland shall not have any liability under Section 9.1(c) (i) for any
Retained Remediation Liabilities (other than such liabilities relating to Off-
Site Locations, which shall not be subject to the limitations of this Section
9.6(c)(i)) in excess of, on a cumulative basis, U.S. $75,000,000, or (ii) for
any Other Retained Remediation Liabilities for any individual Loss (or series
of connected Losses) hereunder unless such individual Loss (or series of
connected Losses) exceeds U.S. $175,000 and, unless the aggregate of all such
Losses for which Ashland would, but for this provision, be liable exceeds on a
cumulative basis, U.S. $5,000,000 and if such amount is exceeded, Ashland
shall be required to pay only the amount of such Losses which exceeds U.S.
$5,000,000.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

79  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, in no event
shall Ashland's aggregate liability under (i) Section 9.1(a), excluding any
Liability for any Losses (A) with respect to breaches of the Fundamental
Representations or (B) relating to Taxes, (ii) Section 9.1(c) for any Retained
Litigation Liabilities and (iii) Section 9.1(c) for any Retained Remediation
Liabilities exceed, on a cumulative basis, U.S. $139,500,000 (the "Aggregate
Cap"). The parties hereby acknowledge that the Aggregate Cap shall be a single
amount applicable to all claims subject to this Section 9.6(d) and that any
indemnification payments made pursuant to clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) of this
Section 9.6(d) shall reduce the remaining amounts for all such matters under
the Aggregate Cap.

  

  

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, in no event
shall Ashland's aggregate liability under Section 9.1, excluding any Liability
for any Losses relating to Taxes or the Retained Indebtedness, exceed the
Purchase Price (as it may be adjusted pursuant to Section 2.8) (the "Purchase
Price Cap"). The parties hereby acknowledge that the Purchase Price Cap shall
be a single amount applicable to all claims subject to this Section 9.6(e) and
that any indemnification payments made pursuant to Section 9.1 (excluding any
Liability for any Losses relating to Taxes) shall reduce the remaining amounts
for all such matters under the Purchase Price Cap.

  

  

Section 9.7. Other Limitations.

  

  

(a) Buyer and Ashland shall cooperate with each other with respect to
resolving any claim or liability with respect to which one party is obligated
to indemnify the other party hereunder, including by using reasonable best
efforts to resolve any such claim or liability. Further, each party shall use
its reasonable best efforts to mitigate any Loss upon becoming aware of any
event which would reasonably be expected to, or does, give rise to, a Loss,
including incurring costs but only to the minimum extent necessary to remedy
the breach which gives rise to the Loss. In the event that Buyer or Ashland
shall fail to use such commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate or resolve
any claim or liability, then notwithstanding anything else to the contrary
contained herein, the other party shall not be required to indemnify any
Person for any Loss that could reasonably be expected to have been avoided if
Buyer or Ashland, as the case may be, had made such efforts.

  

  

(b) The Indemnified Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain all
insurance proceeds or other payments from third parties. The amount of Loss
for which the Indemnified Party may be entitled to seek indemnification under
this Agreement will be reduced by the amount of any insurance proceeds or
other payment from a third party actually received, realized or retained by
the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates with respect to such Loss (less
the amount of any expenses incurred by it in procuring such recovery). If such
Person, after having received any indemnification payment pursuant to this
Agreement with respect to a Loss, subsequently receives or realizes any
insurance proceeds or other payment, the Indemnified Party will promptly
refund and pay to the Indemnifying Party an amount equal to such insurance
proceeds or payment (after deducting therefrom the amount of any expenses
incurred by it in procuring such recovery, to the extent such Indemnified
Party did not already receive payment for such expenses from the Indemnifying
Party), but not in excess of any amount previously paid by the Indemnifying
Party to the Indemnified Party in respect of such matter.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

80  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) The amount of any Loss for which indemnification is provided under this
Article 9 shall be (i) increased to take account of any net Tax cost incurred
by the Indemnified Party arising from the receipt of indemnity payments
hereunder (grossed up for such increase) and (ii) reduced to take account of
any net Tax benefit realized by the Indemnified Party arising from the
incurrence or payment of any such Loss. In computing the amount of any such
Tax cost or Tax benefit, the Indemnified Party shall be deemed to recognize
all other items of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit before recognizing
any item arising from the receipt of any indemnity payment hereunder or the
incurrence or payment of any indemnified Loss.

  

  

(d) If an Indemnified Party is indemnified for any Losses pursuant to this
Agreement with respect to any claim by a third party, then the appropriate
Indemnifying Party will be subrogated to all rights and remedies of the
Indemnified Party against such third party, and such Indemnified Party will
reasonably cooperate with and assist the Indemnifying Party in asserting all
such rights and remedies against such third party.

  

  

(e) Notwithstanding any provision herein, Ashland and its Affiliates shall not
in any event be liable to any Buyer Indemnitee and Buyer and its Affiliates
shall not in any event be liable to any Ashland Indemnitee on account of any
indemnity obligation set forth in Section 9.1 or Section 9.2 for any indirect,
consequential, special, incidental or punitive damages arising out of, or
relating to, this Agreement, any Implementing Agreement or any Transition
Agreement, the Contemplated Transactions, the performance or breach of this
Agreement or any liability or obligation retained or assumed under this
Agreement, other than any such damages for which the Indemnified Party is
found liable through the final resolution of a Third Party Claim.

  

  

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, it is intended
that the provisions of this Agreement will not result in a duplicative payment
of any amount required to be paid under this Agreement, and this Agreement
shall be construed accordingly.

  

  

Section 9.8. Acknowledgements; Exclusive Remedy.

  

  

(a) Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, any
Implementing Agreement or in any Transition Agreement, Buyer acknowledges and
agrees that, other than with respect to (i) claims of, or causes of action

Assets, the Assumed Liabilities, the Retained Liabilities or any applicable
Law (including, inter alia, any rights of contribution or recovery under
CERCLA or other Environmental Law) or otherwise shall be pursuant to the
indemnification provisions set forth in this Agreement. In furtherance of the
foregoing, Buyer hereby waives, from and after the Closing, to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law, any and all rights, claims and causes
of action (other than claims of, or causes of action arising from, fraud and
claims for equitable relief related to the breach of any covenant or agreement
of Ashland contained in this Agreement requiring performance after the
Closing) it or any of its Affiliates may have against Ashland or any of its
Affiliates or any of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents

relief related to the breach of any covenant or agreement of Buyer contained

ARTICLE 10.

  

CONDUCT OF ACTIONS RELATING TO ENVIRONMENTAL LOSSES AND OBLIGATIONS RELATING
THERETO

  

  

Section 10.1. Standard of Performance.

  

  

Ashland shall diligently satisfy any and all Losses for which it is liable
under Section 9.1(a) (as the result of a breach of any representation or
warranty set forth in Sections 5.4, 5.8(a) (as it relates to Encumbrances),
5.14, 5.15 or 5.16 herein) or otherwise under Section 9.1 and arising under
any Environmental Law or related to environmental matters ("Environmental
Loss") at its sole cost and expense and in accordance with Environmental Laws;
provided however, nothing contained herein shall be deemed to prevent Ashland
from satisfying its obligations at the lowest overall obtainable cost
consistent with the scope of the project or activity at issue, taking into
consideration and giving appropriate regard to the requirements of the
relevant Governmental Authorities, customary industry practices, and the
health and safety of employees and the public.

  

  

Section 10.2. Limitations.

  

  

In addition to the limitations contained in Article 9 of this Agreement,
Ashland shall have no liability under Section 9.1 and no obligation to
indemnify any Buyer Indemnitee for any Environmental Loss if the cost,
obligation, event, circumstance or condition that gave rise to such
Environmental Loss: (i) is the result of a site closure, cessation of
operations or change in use of any Conveyed Real Property after the Closing to
a use substantially dissimilar to the use of such Conveyed Real Property as of
the Closing Date, provided that no such site closure, cessation of operations
or change in use after the Closing shall be deemed to relieve Ashland of any
obligation to comply with Environmental Law or any applicable Contract with
any Governmental Authority relating to any assessment, response, removal,
remediation, corrective action or any related monitoring activity at any
Conveyed Real Property which is being conducted by or on behalf of Ashland at
the time of such site closure, cessation of operations or change in use in
connection with Ashland\'s obligations under Section 9.1(c) herein for the
Retained Specified Remediation Liabilities and the Other Retained Remediation
Liabilities (except that nothing in the foregoing clause shall be deemed to
limit or condition the applicability or terms of the provisions in (ii)-(v) of
this Section 10.2); (ii) arises out of or results from the repeal of,
amendment to, or other change in any Environmental Law or Governmental
Authorization issued thereunder in effect as of the Closing Date or the
enactment or new interpretation of any Environmental Law after the Closing
Date; (iii) was discovered as a result of a Phase II or other intrusive
sampling, testing or investigation ("Environmental Tests") conducted after the
Closing Date, except for Environmental Tests undertaken: (a) by or on behalf
of Ashland in connection with its obligations under Section 9.1(c) herein for
the Retained Remediation Liabilities; (b) to respond to, investigate, or
otherwise remediate environmental conditions that would reasonably be expected
to create an imminent and substantial endangerment to the environment or the
health, safety and welfare of the Employees or the public, (c) in specific
response to an inquiry, request, claim or demand by a Governmental Authority;
provided that, Buyer shall have consulted with Ashland prior to undertaking
any such Environmental Tests or (d) in connection with a condition first
discovered as a result of construction or essential maintenance   

activities conducted in the ordinary course of business and commencing after
the Closing Date at, on or beneath the Conveyed Real Property; (iv) with
respect to any Conveyed Real Property, to the extent the cost of such
Environmental Loss is increased, or the scope or extent of such Environmental
Loss is exacerbated, due to an act or omission by a Person other than Ashland,
its affiliates, agents, contractors or subcontractors, unless such act or
omission was at the direction of or under the supervision of any Governmental
Authority; or

  

(v) relates to the removal or abatement of asbestos or asbestos-containing
materials located on or in structural components of the Conveyed Real
Property.

 

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

83  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 10.3. Control, Access, Monitoring and Sampling.

  

  

(a) Ashland shall direct and control all discussions, negotiations and
Proceedings with or before Governmental Authorities or third parties with
respect to any Environmental Loss including the right, after notice to and
consultation with Buyer, to settle or otherwise resolve any Environmental
Notice, Proceeding or Liability giving rise to or forming part of such
Environmental Loss (except to the extent Ashland has refused to indemnify
Buyer under Section 9.1 herein for any such Environmental Loss, in which case
Buyer shall have the right to direct, control, settle or resolve such
Environmental Loss); provided that Ashland may not enter into any such
settlement or resolution that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect
Buyer's operation of the Conveyed Real Property or the Business without the
prior written consent of Buyer, which consent will not unreasonably be
withheld. Buyer may, at its cost and expense, participate in all discussions,
negotiations or Proceedings with or before Governmental Authorities or third
parties with respect to any such Environmental Loss.

  

  

(b) Buyer hereby grants to Ashland and its consultants an irrevocable and
fully paid-up license to enter upon the Conveyed Real Property in order to
meet its obligations with respect to any Environmental Loss; provided that,
Ashland shall conduct any assessment, remediation or response actions in a
manner that does not unreasonably interfere with ongoing operations at the
Conveyed Real Property or the conduct of the Business, except to the extent
Ashland is mandated to do so by a Governmental Authority. The license granted
herein will terminate at such time as all of Ashland's obligations under
Section 9.1 terminate.

  

  

(c) Buyer agrees that Ashland may, for the purposes of complying with its
obligations with respect to any Environmental Loss, take soil samples or
install additional groundwater monitoring wells and sample such wells and
soils as needed in specific areas of concern; provided that Ashland shall
conduct any such assessment, remediation or response actions in a manner that
does not unreasonably interfere with ongoing operations at the Conveyed Real
Property or the conduct by Buyer of the Business, except to the extent Ashland
is directed to do otherwise by a Governmental Authority. Buyer will use its
commercially reasonable efforts to avoid interfering with or damaging
Ashland's monitoring wells, subsurface piping, and/or remediation equipment of
any kind located on or adjacent to the Conveyed Real Property, and will
reimburse Ashland for any such damages or interference, notwithstanding any
language in Section 10.2(iv).

  

  

Section 10.4. Documents.

  

  

Each party shall provide to the other party, no later than five (5) Business
Days after receipt, or sooner if circumstances warrant, copies of all writings
and reasonable descriptions of all other material communications from any
Governmental Authority or other Person to it or from it to any Governmental
Authority or other Person that relate in any way to the Environmental Losses.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

84  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 10.5. Cooperation.

  

  

(a) Buyer shall cooperate with Ashland in (i) handling any Environmental
Notice, Proceeding or Liability; (ii) performing and completing any
assessment, response, removal, remediation, corrective action or monitoring
activity, including executing, as soon as practicable, all permits,
applications, filings, assignments and other instruments required by
applicable Governmental Authorities and providing copies of all materials
reasonably requested by Ashland; (iii) upon request, and as soon as
practicable thereafter, delivering to Ashland copies of all files, records,
documents, instruments and certificates in the possession and control of Buyer
and not previously provided to Ashland, relating to the Conveyed Assets, the
actual or alleged presence of Hazardous Materials at any Conveyed Real
Property or any other location and any other documents, information or
conditions which are reasonably requested by Ashland in connection therewith;
(iv) the performance of any further ministerial actions (include Buyer's
consent to and effectuation of such use restrictions or controls (via methods
including a deed restriction or other institutional controls requiring
continued industrial use of the Conveyed Real Property)) reasonably necessary
to Ashland's compliance with any obligation set forth in this Agreement or
otherwise arising under Environmental Law; and (v) providing reasonable
assistance to Ashland in its pursuit of recovery of insurance proceeds in
relation to any Retained Remediation Liabilities or any Retained Litigation
Liabilities, including providing files, records and other documentation as set
forth in (iii) of this Section 10.5(a) and providing Ashland's insurers with
reasonable access upon reasonable notice to such Conveyed Assets, as
appropriate and necessary under the terms and conditions of the relevant
insurance policies or agreements ancillary to such policies.

  

  

(b) Nothing in the foregoing will require Buyer to unreasonably curtail or
restrict its operation of the Business and none of the aforesaid obligations
shall require Buyer to incur any out-of-pocket cost.

Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived if, and only if, such
amendment or waiver is in writing and signed, in the case of an amendment, by
Buyer and Ashland or, in the case of a waiver, by the party against whom the
waiver is to be effective. No failure or delay by any party in exercising any

this Agreement, including by sale of stock or by operation of Law in

consent, Buyer may (i) assign its rights to purchase the Conveyed Assets to
one or more of its Affiliates (including the Buyer Corporations) and (ii)
assign its rights hereunder to secure indebtedness of Buyer and its

This Agreement (including Schedules and Exhibits), the Ancillary Agreements
and the Sponsor Guarantee comprise the entire agreement between the parties
hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior
agreements and understandings, oral or written, with respect to such matters,
except for the Confidentiality Agreement, which will remain in full force and
effect for the term provided for therein and any other written agreement of
the parties that expressly provides that it is not superseded by this
Agreement.

  

  

Section 11.5. Fulfillment of Obligations.

  

  

Any obligation of any party to any other party under this Agreement, which

Section 11.6. Parties in Interest.

  

  

This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties

provided in the following sentence, nothing in this Agreement, express or
implied, is intended to confer upon any Person other than Buyer, Ashland or
their successors or permitted assigns, any rights or remedies under or by
reason of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Financing Sources
shall be third party beneficiaries of the provisions of Sections 11.11, 11.16,

herein, Section 8.2(a), Section 8.2(d), Section 8.2(e), Section 11.11, Section
11.16 and this Section 11.6 (and any provisions of this Agreement to the
extent a modification, waiver or termination of such provisions would modify
the substance of Sections 8.2(a), 8.2(d), 8.2(e), 11.11, 11.16 and this
Section 11.6) may not be modified, waived or terminated in a manner that
impacts or is adverse in any respect to the Financing Sources without the
prior written consent of the Financing Sources.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

87  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 11.7. Public Disclosure.

  

  

No communication, release or announcement to the public or to employees or
others not directly involved in the negotiation or approval of this Agreement,
any Ancillary Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions shall be issued or
made by any party without the prior consent of the other party (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except as such
communication, release or announcement may be required by Law or the rules or
regulations of any U.S. or foreign securities exchange or similar
organization, in which case the party required to make the communication,
release or announcement shall allow the other party reasonable time to comment
thereon in advance of such issuance; provided, however, that each of the
parties may make internal announcements to their respective employees that are
consistent with the parties' prior public disclosures regarding the
Contemplated Transactions after reasonable prior notice to and consultation
with the other parties.

  

  

Section 11.8. Return of Information.

  

  

If for any reason whatsoever the Contemplated Transactions are not

behalf of such party.

  

  

(b) The filing fees required by any Governmental Competition Authority shall
be borne by Buyer.

  

  

Section 11.10.Schedules.

  

  

The disclosure of any matter in any Schedule to this Agreement shall expressly
not be deemed to constitute an admission by Ashland or any Asset Selling
Corporation, or to otherwise imply, that any such matter is material for the
purposes of this Agreement. Disclosure of any matter, fact, or circumstance in
any Schedule to this Agreement shall be deemed to be disclosure thereof for
purposes of any other Schedule to the extent it is reasonably apparent that
such information is relevant to such other Schedule.

Section 11.11. Governing Law; Jurisdiction.

  

  

This agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws
of the State of Delaware, U.S.A., its rules of conflict of laws
notwithstanding. Each of Ashland and Buyer irrevocably submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery or, if such court
does not have jurisdiction, any Delaware state court or United States Federal
court sitting in the State of Delaware, and any appellate court from any
thereof, for the purposes of any Proceeding arising out of this Agreement, the
Ancillary Agreements, or any Contemplated Transaction (including any action
involving any of the Financing Sources), or for recognition or enforcement of
any judgment, and each party irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all
claims in respect of such Proceeding may be heard in such state court or, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, in such Federal court. Each of Ashland
and Buyer agree to commence any such Proceeding either in the Delaware Court
of Chancery or, if such Proceeding may not be brought in such court for
jurisdictional reasons, in any Delaware state court or United States Federal
court sitting in the State of Delaware. Each of Ashland and Buyer further
agrees that service of any process, summons, notice or document by U.S.
registered mail to such party's address set forth above shall be effective
service of process for any action, suit or proceeding in Delaware with respect
to any matters to which such party has submitted to jurisdiction in this
Section 11.11. Each of Ashland and Buyer irrevocably and unconditionally
waives any objection to the laying of venue of any action, suit or proceeding
arising out of this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements or any Contemplated
Transaction, in any court referred to in the first sentence of this Section
11.11 and hereby further irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees not
to plead or claim in any such court that any such action, suit or proceeding
brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.

  

  

Section 11.12.Counterparts.

  

  

This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which
shall be deemed an original, and all of which shall constitute one and the
same agreement. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of
this Agreement by facsimile or other electronic imaging means shall be
effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.

  

  

Section 11.13.Headings.

  

  

The heading references herein and the Table of Contents hereto are for
convenience purposes only, do not constitute a part of this Agreement, and
shall not be deemed to limit or affect any of the provisions hereof.

  

  

Section 11.14.Severability.

  

  

The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed severable and the invalidity
or unenforceability of any provision shall not affect the validity or
enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any provision of this
Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or any circumstance, is
invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable provision shall be
substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may be valid and
enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or unenforceable
provision, and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the application of such
provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be affected by such
invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or unenforceability
affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or the application
thereof in any other jurisdiction.

  

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

89  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

  

Section 11.15. Governing Language.

  

  

The English language shall be the definitive and controlling text of this
Agreement, notwithstanding the translation of this Agreement into any other
language.

  

  

Section 11.16. Waiver of Jury Trial.

  

  

EACH PARTY HEREBY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY RIGHT IT
MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT TO ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, ANY
TRANSITION AGREEMENT, ANY IMPLEMENTING AGREEMENT OR ANY TRANSACTION
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY (INCLUDING ANY SUCH ACTION TO WHICH ANY
FINANCING SOURCE IS A PARTY). EACH PARTY (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE,
AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE
THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO
HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY TRANSITION AGREEMENT AND
ANY IMPLEMENTING AGREEMENT, AS APPLICABLE, BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL
WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 11.16.

  

  

Section 11.17. Specific Performance.

  

  

The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur and that the parties
would not have any adequate remedy at law if any provision of this Agreement
was not performed in accordance with its terms or was otherwise breached or
threatened to be breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be
entitled to equitable relief, without the proof of actual damages, including
in the form of an injunction or injunctions or orders for specific performance
(including causing Buyer to enforce its rights under any Commitment Letter) to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement. Such equitable relief shall be in addition to
any other remedy to which the parties hereto are entitled at law or in equity
as a remedy for such nonperformance, breach or threatened breach. Each party
agrees to (a) cooperate fully in any attempt by the other party in obtaining
any such equitable remedy and (b) waive any requirement for the security or
posting of any bond in connection with any such equitable remedy. Each party
further agrees that the only permitted objection that it may raise in response

but for the failure of the Equity Financing to be funded, (ii) the financing
provided for by the Debt Commitment Letter (as it may be amended, modified or
waived pursuant to Section 7.6) (or, if alternative financing is being used in
accordance with Section 7.6, pursuant to the commitments with respect thereto)
has been funded or will be funded at the Closing if the Equity Financing is
funded at the Closing, and (iii) Ashland has irrevocably confirmed that if
specific performance is granted and the Equity Financing and Debt Financing
are funded, then the Closing pursuant to Article 3 will occur.
