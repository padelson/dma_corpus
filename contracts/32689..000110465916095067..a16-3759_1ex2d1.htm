ARTICLE II

 



 

EFFECT ON CAPITAL STOCK; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES AND BOOK-ENTRY SHARES

 



 

SECTION 2.01 _Effect of Merger on Capital Stock_.

 



 

(a) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock; Dissenting
Stockholders; Conversion of Company Common Stock; Conversion of Merger Sub
Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any holder of shares
of Company Common Stock:

 



 

(i) each share of common stock, $1.00 par value, of the Company (" ** _Company
Common Stock_** ") that is owned by (x) the Company as treasury stock, if any,
each share of

 



      
 

 



 

Company Common Stock that is owned by a wholly owned Subsidiary of the
Company, if any, and each share of Company Common Stock that is owned directly
or indirectly by Guarantor or any of its Subsidiaries, if any, immediately
prior to the Effective Time and (y) stockholder (" ** _Dissenting
Stockholders_** ") who have perfected and not withdrawn a demand for appraisal
rights pursuant to Section 17-6712 of the GCC (each share of Company Common
Stock referred to in clause (x) or clause (y) being an " ** _Excluded Share_**
" and collectively, " ** _Excluded Shares_** ") shall no longer be outstanding
and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and
no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor, subject to any
rights the holder thereof may have under _Section 2.02(i)_;

 



 

(ii) subject to _Section 2.01(b)_, each share of Company Common Stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (except for the
Excluded Shares) shall be converted automatically into the right to receive an
amount in cash (without interest) equal to the Merger Consideration, payable
as provided in _Section 2.02_, and, when so converted, shall automatically be
canceled and retired and shall cease to exist;

 



 

(iii) each share of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into one share of common stock, $1.00 par value, of the Surviving
Corporation and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock
of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(b) _Adjustments to Merger Consideration_. If at any time during the period
between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company (or any other securities
convertible therefor or exchangeable thereto) shall occur as a result of any
reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), combination,
exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend or stock
distribution with a record date during such period, or any similar event, the
Merger Consideration and any other similarly dependent items shall be
equitably adjusted to provide to Parent, Merger Sub, and the holders of
Company Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this
Agreement prior to such action.

 



 

SECTION 2.02 _Payment for Shares_.

 



 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall
appoint Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. or such other Person as the Parties may mutual
agree to act as paying agent (the " ** _Paying Agent_** ") for the purpose of
exchanging shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger Consideration in
accordance with _Section 2.01(a)(ii)_. At or prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall irrevocably deposit or cause to be deposited with the Paying
Agent, in trust for the benefit of the holders of Company Common Stock
contemplated by _Section 2.01(a)(ii)_, cash in an amount equal to the
aggregate amount of the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section
2.01(a)(ii)_ (the " ** _Payment Fund_** ").

 



 

(b) _Payment Procedures_.

 



 

(i) Promptly after the Effective Time (but no later than two (2) Business Days
after the Effective Time), the Paying Agent will mail to each holder of record
of a certificate representing outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
immediately prior to the Effective Time (a " ** _Certificate_** ") and to each
holder of uncertificated shares of Company Common Stock represented by book
entry immediately prior to the Effective Time (" ** _Book-Entry Shares_** "),
in each case, whose shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.01(a)(ii)_:

 



      
 

 



 

(1) a letter of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and that risk of loss and title to Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
held by such holder will pass, only upon delivery of such Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent and which shall be in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Company, and

 



 

(2) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of such Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration with respect to
such shares.

 



 

(ii) Upon surrender to, and acceptance in accordance with _Section
2.02(b)(iii)_ by, the Paying Agent of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share, the
holder thereof will be entitled to the Merger Consideration payable in respect
of the number of shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share surrendered under this Agreement.

 



 

(iii) The Paying Agent will accept Certificates or Book-Entry Shares upon
compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Paying Agent may
impose to effect an orderly exchange of the Certificates and Book-Entry Shares
in accordance with customary exchange practices.

 



 

(iv) From and after the Effective Time, no further transfers may be made on
the records of the Company or its transfer agent of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares, and if any Certificate or Book-Entry Share is presented to the Company
for transfer, such Certificate of Book-Entry Share shall be canceled against
delivery of the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of
Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share.

 



 

(v) If any Merger Consideration is to be remitted to a name other than that in
which a Certificate or Book-Entry Share is registered, no Merger Consideration
may be paid in exchange for such surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share
unless:

 



 

(1) either (A) the Certificate so surrendered is properly endorsed, with
signature guaranteed, or otherwise in proper form for transfer or (B) the
Book-Entry Share is properly transferred; and

 



 

(2) the Person requesting such payment shall (A) pay any transfer or other
Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered
holder of the Certificate or Book-Entry Share or (B) establish to the
satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not
payable.

 



 

(vi) At any time after the Effective Time until surrendered as contemplated by
this _Section 2.02_, each Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed to
represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger
Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share as contemplated by
_Section 2.01(a)(ii)_. No interest will be paid or accrued for the benefit of
holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the Merger Consideration
payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

 



 

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_.

 



 

(i) At the Effective Time, each holder of a Certificate, and each holder of
Book-Entry Shares, will cease to have any rights with respect to such shares
of Company Common Stock, except, to the extent provided by _Section 2.01_,
for the right to receive the Merger Consideration

 



      
 

 



 

payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented
by such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares upon surrender of such Certificate or
Book-Entry Share in accordance with _Section 2.02(b)_;

 



 

(ii) The Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender or exchange of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with this Section 2.02 will be
deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the
shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares.

 



 

(d) _Termination of Payment Fund_. The Paying Agent will deliver to the
Surviving Corporation, upon the Surviving Corporations demand, any portion of
the Payment Fund (including any interest and other income received by the
Paying Agent in respect of all such funds) which remains undistributed to the
former holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares upon expiration of the
period ending one (1) year after the Effective Time. Thereafter, any former
holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares prior to the Merger who has not
complied with this _Section 2.02_ prior to such time, may look only to the
Surviving Corporation for payment of his, her or its claim for Merger
Consideration to which such holder may be entitled.

 



 

(e) _Investment of Payment Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash in
the Payment Fund if and as directed by Parent; _provided_ that such investment
shall be in obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States of America, in
commercial paper obligations of issuers organized under the Law of a state of
the United States of America, rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors
Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Ratings Service, respectively, or in
certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of
commercial banks with capital exceeding $10,000,000,000, or in mutual funds
investing in such assets. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investments shall be paid to, and be the property of, Parent. No investment
losses resulting from investment of the Payment Fund shall diminish the rights
of any of the Companys shareholders to receive the Merger Consideration or
any other payment as provided herein. To the extent there are losses with
respect to such investments or the Payment Fund diminishes for any other
reason below the level required to make prompt cash payment of the aggregate
funds required to be paid pursuant to the terms hereof, Parent shall
reasonably promptly replace or restore the cash in the Payment Fund so as to
ensure that the Payment Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient
to make such cash payments.

 



 

(f) _No Liability_. None of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of
any portion of the Payment Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 



 

(g) _Withholding Taxes_. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the
Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Certificates,
Book-Entry Shares, Time-Vested Restricted Stock Awards or Performance-Based
Restricted Stock Awards such amounts as may be required to be deducted and
withheld with respect to the making of such payment under applicable Tax Law.
Amounts so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority shall be
treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the
holder of Certificates, Book-Entry Shares, Time-Vested Restricted Stock Awards
or Performance-Based Restricted Stock Awards, as applicable, in respect of

Disclosure Letter, (b) initiate and pursue other rate cases and proceedings
with Governmental Entities; _provided_ that the prior written consent of
Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned)
shall be required to the extent any such other rate case or proceeding would
reasonably be expected to result in an outcome that would be materially
adverse to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taking into account the
requests made by the Company and the Company subsidiaries in such rate case or
proceeding and the resolution of similar recent rate cases or proceedings by

SECTION 5.03 _No Solicitation by the Company; Company Board Recommendation_.

 



 

(a) The Company shall not, shall cause its Affiliates not to, and shall use
reasonable efforts to cause its and their respective officers, directors,
principals, partners, managers, members, attorneys, accountants, agents,
employees, consultants, financial advisors or other authorized representatives
(collectively, " ** _Representatives_** ") not to, (i) directly or indirectly
solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage, induce or facilitate any Company
Takeover Proposal or any inquiry or proposal that would reasonably be expected
to lead to a Company Takeover Proposal, in each case, except for this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, or (ii) directly or
indirectly participate in any discussions or negotiations with any Person
(except for the Companys Affiliates and its and their respective
Representatives or Parent and Parents Affiliates and its and their respective
Representatives) regarding, or furnish to any such Person, any nonpublic
information with respect to, or cooperate in any way with any such Person with
respect to, any Company Takeover Proposal or any inquiry or proposal that
would reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Takeover Proposal. The
Company shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and its and

 



      
 

 



 

their respective Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be
terminated all existing discussions or negotiations with any Person (except
for the Companys Affiliates and its and their respective Representatives or
Parent and Parents Affiliates and its and their respective Representatives)
conducted heretofore with respect to any Company Takeover Proposal, request
the prompt return or destruction of all confidential information previously
furnished and immediately terminate all physical and electronic data room
access previously granted to any such Person or its Representatives.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, at any time prior to
obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, in response to the receipt of a
_bona fide_ written Company Takeover Proposal made after the date of this
Agreement that does not result from a breach (other than an immaterial breach)
of this _Section 5.03(a)_ by the Company and that the Company Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel and a
financial advisor) constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a
Superior Company Proposal, the Company and its Representatives may (1) furnish
information with respect to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to the
Person making such Company Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives)
(provided that all such information has previously been provided to Parent or
is provided to Parent prior to or substantially concurrently with the
provision of such information to such Person) pursuant to a customary
confidentiality agreement no less restrictive, in the aggregate, than the
Confidentiality Agreement and (2) participate in discussions regarding the
terms of such Company Takeover Proposal, including terms of a Company
Acquisition Agreement with respect thereto, and the negotiation of such terms
with the Person making such Company Takeover Proposal (and such Persons
Representatives). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Company
may grant a waiver, amendment or release under any confidentiality or
standstill agreement to the extent necessary to allow a confidential Company
Takeover Proposal to be made to the Company or the Company Board so long as
the Company promptly notifies Parent thereof after granting any such waiver,
amendment or release.

 



 

(b) Except as set forth in _Section 5.03(a)_, _Section 5.03(c)_ and _Section
5.03(e)_, neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i)
withdraw, change, qualify, withhold or modify in any manner adverse to Parent,
or propose publicly to withdraw, change, qualify, withhold or modify in any
manner adverse to Parent, the Company Board Recommendation, (ii) adopt,
approve or recommend, or propose publicly to adopt, approve or recommend, any
Company Takeover Proposal, (iii) fail to include in the Proxy Statement the
Company Board Recommendation or (iv) take any formal action or make any
recommendation or public statement in connection with a tender offer or
exchange offer (except for a recommendation against such offer or a customary
"stop, look and listen" communication of the type contemplated by Rule
14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) (any action in the foregoing clauses (i)(iv)
being referred to as a " ** _Company Adverse Recommendation Change_** ").
Except as set forth in _Section 5.03(a)_, _Section 5.03(c)_ and _Section
5.03(e)_, neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall authorize,
permit, approve or recommend, or propose publicly to authorize, permit,
approve or recommend, or allow the Company or any of its Affiliates to execute
or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in
principle, agreement or commitment constituting, or that would reasonably be
expected to lead to, any Company Takeover Proposal, or requiring, or that
would reasonably be expected to cause, the Company to abandon or terminate
this Agreement (a " ** _Company Acquisition Agreement_** ").

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, at any time prior to
obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, the Company Board may make a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change if (i) a Company Intervening Event has
occurred or (ii) the Company has received a Superior Company Proposal that
does not result from a breach (other than an immaterial breach) of _Section
5.03(a)_ by the Company and, in each case, if the Company Board determines in
good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that the failure to
effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change as a result of the occurrence
of such Company Intervening Event or in response to the receipt of such
Superior Company Proposal, as the case may be, would reasonably likely be
inconsistent with the Company

 



      
 

 



 

Boards fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Company Board shall not make such Company Adverse Recommendation Change
unless (1) the Company Board has provided prior written notice to Parent (a "
** _Recommendation Change Notice_** ") that it is prepared to effect a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change in response to the occurrence of a Company
Intervening Event or the receipt of a Superior Company Proposal, which notice
shall, in the case of a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in response to
the receipt of a Superior Company Proposal, at the Companys option, either
attach the most current draft of any Company Acquisition Agreement with
respect to such Superior Company Proposal or include a summary of the material
terms and conditions of such Superior Company Proposal (including the identity
of the Person making such Superior Company Proposal), (2) if requested by
Parent, during the three (3) Business Day period after delivery of the
Recommendation Change Notice, the Company and its Representatives negotiate in
good faith with Parent and its Representatives regarding any revisions to this
Agreement and (3) at the end of such three (3) Business Day period and taking
into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement committed to in
writing by Parent (it being understood and agreed that if there has been any
subsequent amendment to any material term of such Superior Company Proposal,
the Company Board shall provide a new Recommendation Change Notice and an
additional three (3) Business Day period from the date of such notice shall
apply), the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with
outside legal counsel) that the failure to make such a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change would reasonably likely be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 



 

(d) The Company shall promptly (and in any event no later than the later of
(i) twenty-four (24) hours or (ii) 5 p.m. New York City time on the next
Business Day) advise Parent orally and in writing of any Company Takeover
Proposal and the material terms and conditions of any such Company Takeover
Proposal (including the identity of the Person making such Company Takeover
Proposal). The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed in all material
respects on a reasonably current basis of the material terms and status
(including any change to the terms thereof) of any Company Takeover Proposal.

 



 

(e) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.03_ shall prohibit the Company from
(i) complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange
Act or (ii) making any disclosure to the shareholders of the Company if, in
the good-faith judgment of the Company Board (after consultation with outside
legal counsel) failure to so disclose would reasonably likely be inconsistent
with its obligations under applicable Law.

 



 

(f) For purposes of this Agreement:

 



 

(i) " ** _Company Takeover Proposal_** " means any proposal or offer (whether
or not in writing), with respect to any (1) merger, consolidation, share
exchange, other business combination, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution or similar transaction involving the Company, (2) sale, lease,
contribution or other disposition, directly or indirectly (including by way of
merger, consolidation, share exchange, other business combination,
partnership, joint venture, sale of capital stock of or other equity interests
in a Company Subsidiary or otherwise) of any business or assets of the Company
or the Company Subsidiaries representing 20% or more of the consolidated
revenues, net income or assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, (3) issuance, sale or other disposition, directly or
indirectly, to any Person (or the shareholders of any Person) or group of
securities (or options, rights or warrants to purchase, or securities
convertible into or exchangeable for, such securities) representing 20% or
more of the voting power of the Company, (4) transaction (including any tender
offer or exchange offer) in which any Person (or the shareholders of any
Person) would acquire (in the case of a tender offer or exchange offer, if
consummated), directly or indirectly, beneficial ownership, or the right to
acquire

 



      
 

 



 

beneficial ownership, or formation of any group which beneficially owns or has
the right to acquire beneficial ownership of, 20% or more of any class of
capital stock of the Company or (5) any combination of the foregoing.

 



 

(ii) " ** _Superior Company Proposal_** " means a _bona fide_ written Company
Takeover Proposal (provided that for purposes of this definition, the
applicable percentage in the definition of Company Takeover Proposal shall be
"more than 50%" rather than "20% or more"), which the Company Board determines
in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and a financial
advisor, and taking into account the legal, financial, regulatory and other
aspects of such Company Takeover Proposal and such other factors that are
deemed relevant by the Company Board, is more favorable to the holders of
Company Common Stock than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(after taking into account any proposed revisions to the terms of this
Agreement that are committed to in writing by Parent (including pursuant to
_Section 5.03(c)_).

 



 

(iii) " ** _Company Intervening Event_** " means any material fact,
circumstance, effect, change, event or development that (1) is unknown to or
by the Company Board as of the date hereof (or if known, the magnitude or
material consequences of which were not known or understood by the Company
Board as of the date of this Agreement) and (2) becomes known to or by the
Company Board prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval; _provided_
, _however_ , that neither a Company Takeover Proposal nor or any matter
relating thereto or consequence thereof shall constitute a Company Intervening
Event.

 



 

SECTION 5.04 _Financing_.

 



 

(a) Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, take, or cause to be
taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary to
consummate the Financing, or any Substitute Financing, as promptly as possible
following the date of this Agreement (and, in any event, no later than the
Closing Date), including (i) (1) maintaining in effect the Debt Letters and
complying with all of their respective obligations thereunder and (2)
negotiating, entering into and delivering definitive agreements with respect
to the Financing reflecting the terms contained in the Debt Letters (or with
other terms agreed by Parent or its Affiliates and the Financing Parties,
subject to the restrictions on amendments of the Debt Letters set forth
below), so that such agreements are in effect no later than the Closing, and
(ii) satisfying on a timely basis all the conditions to the Financing and the
definitive agreements related thereto that are applicable to Parent and its
Affiliates.

 



 

(b) In the event that all conditions set forth in _Sections 7.01_ and _7.03_
have been satisfied or waived or, upon funding shall be satisfied or waived,
Parent and its Affiliates shall cause the Persons providing the Financing (the
" ** _Financing Parties_** ") to fund on the Closing Date the Financing, to
the extent the proceeds thereof are required to consummate the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby, and shall enforce its rights under the
Debt Letters (including in the event of any breach or purported breach thereof
and including by taking enforcement action to cause such lenders and the other
Financing Parties to fund such Financing). Parent shall not, and shall cause
its Affiliates not to, take or refrain from taking, directly or indirectly,
any action that would reasonably be expected to result in a failure of any of
the conditions contained in the Debt Letters or in any definitive agreement
related to the Financing. Parent shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not
to, object to the utilization of any "market flex" provisions by any Financing
Party.

 



 

(c) Parent shall keep the Company reasonably informed on a current and timely
basis of the status of the efforts of Parent or its Affiliates to obtain the
Financing and to satisfy the conditions thereof, including advising and
updating the Company, in a reasonable level of detail, with respect to status,
proposed closing date and material terms of the definitive documentation
related to the Financing,

 



      
 

 



 

providing copies of then current drafts of the credit agreement and other
primary definitive documents and giving the Company prompt notice of any
material change (adverse or otherwise) with respect to the Financing. Without
limiting the foregoing, Parent shall notify the Company promptly (and in any
event within one (1) Business Day) if at any time prior to the Closing Date:

 



 

(i) any Debt Letter expires or is terminated for any reason (or if any Person
attempts or purports to terminate or repudiate any Debt Letter, whether or not
such attempted or purported termination or repudiation is valid);

 



 

(ii) Parent or any of its Affiliates obtains knowledge of any breach or
default or any threatened breach or default (or any event or circumstance
that, with or without due notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably be
expected to give rise to any breach or default) by any party to any Debt
Letter or any definitive document related to the Financing of any provisions
of the Debt Letters or any definitive document related to the Financing;

 



 

(iii) Parent or any of its Affiliates receives any communication (written or
oral) from any Person with respect to any (1) actual, potential or threatened
breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party to the Debt Letters
or any definitive document related to the Financing of any provisions of the
Debt Letters or any definitive document related to the Financing or (2)
dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to the Debt Letters;

 



 

(iv) any Financing Party refuses to provide or expresses (orally or in
writing) an intent to refuse to provide all or any portion of the Financing
contemplated by the Debt Letters on the terms set forth therein (or expresses
(orally or in writing) that such Person does not intend to enter into all or
any portion of definitive documentation related to the Financing or to
consummate the transactions contemplated thereby); or

 



 

(v) there occurs any event or development that could reasonably be expected to
adversely impact the ability of Parent or any of its Affiliates to obtain all,
or any portion of, the Financing contemplated by the Debt Letters on the terms
and conditions, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by any of the
Debt Letters or the definitive documents related to the Financing or if at any
time for any other reason Parent no longer believes in good faith that it will
be able to obtain all or any portion of the Financing on the terms and
conditions, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by any of the Debt
Letters or the definitive documents related to the Financing.

 



 

(d) As soon as reasonably practicable (but in any event within two (2)
Business Days after the date the Company delivers to Parent a written request
therefor), Parent shall provide any information reasonably requested by the
Company relating to any circumstance referred to in _Section 5.04(c)(i)(v)_
of the immediately preceding sentence.

 



 

(e) Parent or its Affiliates may amend, modify, terminate, assign or agree to
any waiver under the Debt Letters (including to add lenders, arrangers,
agents, bookrunners, managers and other financing sources) without the prior
written approval of the Company; _provided_ that Parent shall not, and shall
cause its Affiliates not to, without Companys prior written consent, permit
any such amendment, modification, assignment, termination or waiver to be made
to, or consent to any waiver of, any provision of or remedy under the Debt
Letters which would (1) reduce the aggregate amount of the Financing
(including by increasing the amount of fees to be paid or original issue
discount), (2) impose new or additional conditions to the Financing or
otherwise expand or render more burdensome to Parent or its Affiliates any of
the conditions to the Financing or (3) otherwise expand, amend, modify or
waive any provision of the Debt Letters in a manner that in any such case
would reasonably be expected to

 



      
 

 



 

(A) delay or make less likely the funding of the Financing (or satisfaction of
the conditions to the Financing) on the Closing Date, (B) adversely impact the
ability of Parent or its Affiliates to enforce its rights against the
Financing Parties or any other parties to the Debt Letters or the definitive
agreements with respect thereto or (C) adversely affect the ability of Parent
to timely consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby. In the event that new debt or equity commitment letters or fee letters
are entered into in accordance with any amendment, replacement, supplement or
other modification of the Debt Letters permitted pursuant to this _Section
5.04(e)_, such new commitment letters or fee letters shall be deemed to be a
part of the "Financing" and deemed to be the "Debt Letters" for all purposes
of this Agreement. Parent shall promptly deliver to the Company copies of any
termination, amendment, modification, waiver or replacement of the Debt
Letters.

 



 

(f) If funds in the amounts set forth in the Debt Letters, or any portion
thereof, become unavailable, Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates, as
promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event to (i) notify
the Company in writing thereof, (ii) obtain substitute financing sufficient to
enable Parent to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby in accordance with its terms (the " ** _Substitute Financing_** ") and
(iii) obtain a new financing commitment letter that provides for such
Substitute Financing and, promptly after execution thereof, deliver to the
Company true, complete and correct copies of the new commitment letter and the
related fee letters (in redacted form reasonably satisfactory to the Persons
providing such Substitute Financing removing only the fee amounts, pricing
caps, the rates and amounts included in the "market flex") and related
definitive financing documents with respect to such Substitute Financing;
_provided_ , _however_ , that any such Substitute Financing shall not, without
the prior written consent of the Company, (1) reduce the aggregate amount of
the Financing (including by increasing the amount of fees to be paid or
original issue discount), (2) impose new or additional conditions to the
Financing or otherwise expand or render more burdensome to Parent or its
Affiliates any of the conditions to the Financing or (3) otherwise expand,
amend, modify or waive any provision of the Debt Letters in a manner that in
any such case would reasonably be expected to (A) delay or make less likely
the funding of the Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to the
Financing) on the Closing Date, (B) adversely impact the ability of Parent or
its Affiliates to enforce its rights against the Financing Parties or any
other parties to the Debt Letters or the definitive agreements with respect

securities of the type described in the Debt Letters, or as may otherwise be
required pursuant to applicable Law or the rules or regulations of any
national securities exchange in connection with the Merger or any alternative
financing therefor, and provide customary management letters in connection
with the foregoing;

such period, other than as provided by _Section 5.05(a)(ii)_ or (3) any
financial information with respect to a month or fiscal period that has not
yet

 



      
 

 



 

ended or has ended less than 40 days (or, in the case of a fiscal year, 60
days) prior to the date of such request.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement
(including this _Section 5.05_): (i) nothing in this Agreement (including

defense of any such Claim from Parent within ten (10) Business Days after
receipt by Parent from the Company Indemnified Party of a request therefor;
_provided_ that any Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an
undertaking, if and only to the extent required by applicable Law or the
Surviving Corporations Organizational Documents, to repay such advances if it
is ultimately determined by final adjudication that such person is not
entitled to indemnification and (ii) the Surviving Corporation shall cooperate
in good faith in the defense of any such matter.

 



 

(b) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall cause proper
provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, assume the covenants and agreements
set forth in this _Section 6.09_.

 



 

(c) For a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall either cause to be maintained in effect the
current policies of directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance maintained by the Company or its Subsidiaries or provide
substitute policies for the Company and its current and former directors and
officers who are currently covered by the directors and officers and
fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently maintained by the Company, in
either case, of not less than the existing coverage and having other terms not
less favorable to the insured persons than the directors and officers
liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently
maintained by the Company with respect to claims arising from facts or events
that occurred on or before the Effective Time (with insurance carriers having
at least an "A" rating by A.M. Best with respect to directors and officers
liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance), except that in no
event shall the Surviving Corporation be required to pay with respect to such
insurance policies in respect of any one policy year more than 300% of the
aggregate annual premium most recently paid by the Company prior to the date
of this Agreement (the " ** _Maximum Amount_** "), and if the Surviving
Corporation is unable to obtain the insurance required by this _Section
6.09(c)_ it shall obtain as much comparable insurance as possible for the
years within such six (6) year period for an annual premium equal to the
Maximum Amount, in respect of each policy year within such period. In lieu of
such

 



      
 

 



 

insurance, prior to the Closing Date the Company may, at its option but
following consultation with Parent, purchase a "tail" directors and officers
liability insurance policy and fiduciary liability insurance policy for the
Company and its current and former directors, officers and employees who are
currently covered by the directors and officers and fiduciary liability
insurance coverage currently maintained by the Company, such tail to provide
coverage in an amount not less than the existing coverage and to have other
terms substantially comparable (and not less favorable) to the insured persons
than the directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability
insurance coverage currently maintained by the Company with respect to claims
arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the Effective Time for
a period of not less than six (6) years; _provided_ that in no event shall the
cost of any such tail policy in respect of any one policy year exceed the
Maximum Amount. The Surviving Corporation shall maintain such policies in full
force and effect, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder.

 



 

(d) The provisions of this _Section 6.09_ (i) shall survive consummation of
the Merger, (ii) are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be
enforceable by, each indemnified or insured party (including the Company
Indemnified Parties), his or her heirs and his or her representatives and
(iii) are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have by contract or
otherwise.

 



 

(e) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall guarantee the prompt
payment of the obligations of the Surviving Corporation and the Company
Subsidiaries under this _Section 6.09_.

 



 

SECTION 6.10 _Employee Matters_.

 



 

(a) During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the two
(2) year anniversary of the Effective Time (the " ** _Continuation Period_**
"), Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide each
individual who is employed by the Company or a Company Subsidiary immediately
prior to the Effective Time and who remains employed thereafter by the
Surviving Corporation, Parent or any of their Affiliates (each, a " **
_Company Employee_** ") who is not covered by a Company Union Contract and who
remains a Company Employee with (i) a base salary or wage rate that is no less
favorable than that provided to the Company Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time, (ii) aggregate incentive compensation opportunities that are
substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to those provided to the Company
Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time and (iii) employee benefits
that are substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to those provided to the
Company Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time. During the three-
year period following the Continuation Period, Parent shall, or shall cause
the Surviving Corporation or its other Affiliates to, treat Company Employees
with respect to the payment of base salary or wage rate, incentive
compensation opportunities, employee benefits and severance benefits no less
favorably in the aggregate than similarly situated employees of the Parent and
its Affiliates. Prior to the third anniversary of the Closing Date, Parent
shall not, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to not, terminate or
amend in any manner that is materially adverse to the participants therein,
any of the Company Benefit Plans listed on _Section 6.10(a)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter. During the three-year period following the third
anniversary of the Closing Date, subject to _Section 6.10(d)(ii)_, Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, treat retirees of the
Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to the provision of post-retirement
welfare benefits no less favorably than similarly situated retirees of the
Parent and its Affiliates. As soon as practicable following the end of the
fiscal year in which the Effective Time occurs, Parent shall, or shall cause
the Surviving Corporation or its other Affiliates to, pay each Company
Employee who remains employed with the Surviving Corporation, Parent or any of
their Affiliates through the applicable payment date an annual cash bonus for
such fiscal year in an amount determined based on the level of attainment of
the applicable performance criteria under the bonus plan in which such Company
Employee participated as of immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) With respect to each Company Employee who is covered by a Company Union
Contract, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, continue
to honor the Company Union Contracts, in each case as in effect at the
Effective Time, in accordance with their terms (it being understood that this
sentence shall not be construed to limit the ability of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation to amend or terminate any such Company Union Contract,
to the extent permitted by the terms of the applicable Company Union Contract
and applicable Law). The provisions of this _Section 6.10_ shall be subject
to any applicable provisions of the Company Union Contracts and applicable Law
in respect of such Company Employee, to the extent the provisions of this
_Section 6.10_ are inconsistent with or otherwise in conflict with the
provisions of any such Company Union Contract or applicable Law.

 



 

(c) At the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, assume and honor in accordance with their terms all of the
Companys and all of the Company Subsidiaries employment, severance,
retention, termination and change-in-control plans, policies, programs,
agreements and arrangements (including any change-in-control severance
agreement or other arrangement between the Company and any Company Employee)
maintained by the Company or any Company Subsidiary, in each case, as in
effect at the Effective Time, including with respect to any payments, benefits
or rights arising as a result of the Merger (either alone or in combination
with any other event), it being understood that this sentence shall not be
construed to limit the ability of Parent or the Surviving Corporation to amend
or terminate any such plans, policies, programs, agreements, or arrangements,
to the extent permitted by the terms of the applicable plan, policy, program,
agreement or arrangement. For purposes of any Company Benefit Plan or Company
Benefit Agreement containing a definition of "change in control," "change of
control" or similar term that relates to a transaction at the level of the
Company, the Closing shall be deemed to constitute a "change in control,"
"change of control" or such similar term.

 



 

(d) With respect to all employee benefit plans of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their Affiliates, including any "employee benefit plan"
(as defined in _Section 3(3)_ of ERISA) (including any vacation, paid time-
off and severance plans), each Company Employees service with the Company or
any Company Subsidiary (as well as service with any predecessor employer of
the Company or any such Company Subsidiary, to the extent service with the
predecessor employer was recognized by the Company or such Company Subsidiary
and is accurately reflected within a Company Employees records) shall be
treated as service with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
Affiliates for all purposes, including determining eligibility to participate,
level of benefits, vesting and benefit accruals, except (i) to the extent that
such service was not recognized under the corresponding Company Benefit Plan
immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) for purposes of any defined
benefit retirement plan, any retiree welfare benefit plan, any grandfathered
or frozen plan or any plan under which similarly situated employees of Parent
and its Affiliates do not receive credit for prior service or (iii) to the
extent that such recognition would result in any duplication of benefits for
the same period of service.

 



 

(e) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to waive, or cause to be waived, any pre-
existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively at work requirements and
waiting periods under any welfare benefit plan maintained by Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates in which Company Employees
(and their eligible dependents) will be eligible to participate from and after
the Effective Time, except to the extent that such pre-existing condition
limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods
would not have been satisfied or waived under the corresponding Company
Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall, or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, use commercially reasonable efforts to
recognize the dollar amount of all co-payments, deductibles and similar
expenses incurred by each Company Employee (and his or her eligible
dependents) during the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs for
purposes of satisfying such years deductible and co-payment limitations under
the

 



      
 

 



 

relevant welfare benefit plans in which they will be eligible to participate
from and after the Effective Time.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the provisions of this
_Section 6.10_ are solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement,
and no provision of this _Section 6.10_ is intended to, or shall, constitute
the establishment or adoption of or an amendment to any employee benefit plan
for purposes of ERISA or otherwise and no Company Personnel or any other
individual associated therewith shall be regarded for any purpose as a third-
party beneficiary of this Agreement or have the right to enforce the
provisions hereof including in respect of continued employment (or resumed
employment). Nothing contained herein shall alter the at-will employment
relationship of any Company Employee.

 



 

SECTION 6.11 _Merger Sub_.

 



 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall not engage in any activity
of any nature except for activities related to or in furtherance of the
Merger.

 



 

(b) Parent hereby (i) guarantees the due, prompt and faithful payment
performance and discharge by Merger Sub of, and compliance by Merger Sub with,
all of the covenants and agreements of Merger Sub under this Agreement and
(ii) agrees to take all actions necessary, proper or advisable to ensure such
payment, performance and discharge by Merger Sub hereunder.

 



 

SECTION 6.12 _Takeover Statutes_. If any Takeover Statute or similar statute
or regulation becomes applicable to this Agreement or the Merger, the Company
and the Company Board shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are
reasonably appropriate to ensure that the Merger may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

SECTION 6.13 _Stock Exchange De-Listing_. Prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall cooperate with Parent and use reasonable best efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things,
reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable Laws
and rules and policies of the NYSE to enable the delisting by the Surviving
Corporation of the Company Common Stock from the NYSE and the deregistration
of the Company Common Stock under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable
after the Effective Time.

 



 

SECTION 6.14 _Resolution of Impediments_.

 



 

(a) In the event that, prior to the End Date, any Required Statutory Approval
has been denied or has been obtained but has or would be reasonably likely to
have a Burdensome Effect, or any Legal Restraint has been imposed with respect
to any Required Statutory Approval (each, a " ** _Failed Condition_** "), then
the Parties shall promptly confer in good faith regarding and, from the date
of such occurrence until the earlier of the End Date or the date that is sixty
(60) days following such occurrence, shall use reasonable best efforts to
promptly agree upon a strategy to cause the conditions specified in _Section
7.01_ to be satisfied, which may include appropriate changes to this Agreement
or to the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that no
Party shall in any circumstances be obligated to alter or change the amount or
form of the Merger Consideration. Following written agreement, if any, of the
Parties with respect to changes to this Agreement or to the transactions
contemplated hereby to address a Failed Condition, the Parties shall use their
reasonable best efforts to promptly give effect to and implement such
agreement, cause the conditions specified in _Section 7.01_ to be satisfied,
and effect the Closing as promptly as reasonably practicable. Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement, no Party shall have the right to
terminate this Agreement on the basis of a Failed Condition (i) during the
period specified in the first sentence of this _Section 6.14(a)_, or (ii) if
such Party has failed to comply with

 



      
 

 



 

its obligations under this _Section 6.14(a)_, or (iii) following written
agreement, if any, of the Parties with respect to changes to this Agreement or
to the transactions contemplated hereby to address such Failed Condition,
except as expressly provided in such written agreement.

 



 

(b) In the event that Parent determines in good faith that any Required
Statutory Approval that is required as a result of any business or assets of
the Company and its Subsidiaries that generated less than ten percent (10%) of
the consolidated revenues of the Company in its most recent fiscal year is not
reasonably likely to be obtained prior to the End Date (as extended pursuant
to any other provision of this Agreement), or if obtained is reasonably likely
to impose conditions or requirements that are materially burdensome in
relation to the financial contributions of such business or assets, then upon
the written request of Parent the Company shall, and shall cause the Company
Subsidiaries to, reasonably cooperate with Parent to structure and pursue a
disposition (whether by liquidation, dissolution, merger, consolidation,
equity sale, asset sale, reorganization, recapitalization or otherwise) of
such business or assets, to be effected only upon or following the Closing.
Parent shall use its reasonable efforts to structure and arrange for such a
disposition as promptly as reasonably practicable.

or no later than three (3) Business Days after the date of such termination of
this Agreement by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.01(d)(i)_.

 



 

(iii) If (1) either (A) Parent or the Company terminates this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 8.01(b)(iii)_, prior to the Company Shareholders
Meeting a Company Takeover Proposal shall have been publicly disclosed, and as
of the Company Shareholders Meeting such Company Takeover Proposal shall not
have been withdrawn, or (B) Parent or the Company terminates this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 8.01(b)(i)_, prior to such termination a Company
Takeover Proposal shall have been publicly disclosed, and as of such
termination the Company Shareholders Meeting shall not have been held and such
Company Takeover Proposal shall not have been withdrawn, or (C) Parent
terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01(d)(ii)_ (solely with
respect to breach of or failure to perform a covenant), prior to such
termination a Company Takeover Proposal shall have been publicly disclosed,
and as of such termination such Company Takeover Proposal shall not have been
withdrawn, and (2) within nine (9) months after the termination of this
Agreement, the Company shall have entered into a definitive agreement with
respect to, or consummated, a Company Takeover Proposal (whether or not the
same Company Takeover Proposal referred to in clause (1)), then the Company
shall pay the Company Termination Fee to Parent (to an account designated in
writing by Parent) within two (2) Business Days after the earlier of the date
the Company enters into such definitive agreement or consummates such Company
Takeover Proposal. For purposes of clause (2) of this _Section 8.02(b)(iii)_,
the term "Company Takeover Proposal" shall have the meaning assigned to such
term in _Section 5.01_, except that the applicable percentage in the
definition of "Company Takeover Proposal" shall be "more than 50%" rather than
"20% or more."

 



      
 

 



 

(c) The Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in _Section
8.02(b)_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the parties would not enter
into this Agreement. If Parent (or the Guarantor pursuant to the Guarantee)
fails to promptly pay an amount due pursuant to _Section 8.02(b)(i)_, or the
Company fails to promptly pay an amount due pursuant to _Section 8.02(b)(ii)_
or _Section 8.02(b)(iii)_, and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent, on
the one hand, or the Company, on the other hand, commences a Claim that
results in a Judgment against the Company for the amount set forth in _Section
8.02(b)(ii)_ or _Section 8.02(b)(iii)_, or any portion thereof, or a Judgment
against Parent (or the Guarantor pursuant to the Guarantee) for the amount set
forth in _Section 8.02(b)(i)_, or any portion thereof, the Company shall pay
to Parent, on the one hand, or Parent (or the Guarantor pursuant to the
Guarantee) shall pay to the Company, on the other hand, its costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees and the fees and expenses of any expert
or consultant engaged by the Company) in connection with such Claim, together
with interest on the amount of such payment from the date such payment was
required to be made until the date of payment at the "U.S. Prime Rate" as
quoted by the Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such payment was
required to be made. Any amount payable pursuant to _Section 8.02(b)_ shall
be paid by the applicable Party by wire transfer of same-day funds prior to or
on the date such payment is required to be made under _Section 8.02(b)_.

 



 

(d) Without limiting any rights of the Company under _Section 9.10_ prior to
the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01_, if this
Agreement is terminated under circumstances in which Parent (or the Guarantor
pursuant to the Guarantee) is obligated to pay the Parent Termination Fee
under _Section 8.02(b)(i)_, upon payment of the Parent Termination Fee and,
if applicable, the costs and expenses of the Company pursuant to _Section
8.02(c)_ in accordance herewith, neither Parent nor the Guarantor shall have
any further liability with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby to the Company or the holders of the Company Common Stock,
and payment of the Parent Termination Fee and such costs and expenses by
Parent (or the Guarantor pursuant to the Guarantee) shall be the Companys
sole and exclusive remedy for any Claims, losses, liabilities, damages,
judgments, inquiries, fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including
attorneys fees and disbursements, suffered or incurred by the Company, the
Company Subsidiaries or any other Person in connection with this Agreement,
the transactions contemplated hereby (and the termination thereof) or any
matter forming the basis for such termination, and the Company shall not have,
and expressly waives and relinquishes, any other right, remedy or recourse
(whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, or whether at law (including at
common law or by statute) or in equity) with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, including against any Financing Source
Party; _provided_ that, regardless of whether Parent pays or is obligated to
pay the Parent Termination Fee, nothing in this _Section 8.02(d)_ shall
release Parent from liability for a Willful Breach of this Agreement. If this
Agreement is terminated under circumstances in which the Company is obligated
to pay the Company Termination Fee under _Section 8.02(b)(ii)_ or _Section
8.02(b)(iii)_, upon payment of the Company Termination Fee and, if applicable,
the costs and expenses of Parent pursuant to _Section 8.02(c)_ in accordance
herewith, the Company shall have no further liability with respect to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby to Parent, Merger Sub or any
of their respective Affiliates or Representatives, and payment of the Company
Termination Fee and such costs and expenses by the Company shall be Parents
sole and exclusive remedy for any Claims, losses, liabilities, damages,
judgments, inquiries, fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including
attorneys fees and disbursements, suffered or incurred by Parent, Parents
Affiliates and any other Person in connection with this Agreement, the
transactions contemplated hereby (and the termination thereof) or any matter
forming the basis for such termination, and Parent and Merger Sub shall not
have, and each expressly waives and relinquishes, any other right, remedy or
recourse (whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, or whether at law
(including at common law or by statute) or in equity) with respect to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. The Parties acknowledge and
agree that in no event

 



      
 

 



 

shall the Company or Parent, as applicable, be required to pay the Company
Termination Fee or the Parent Termination Fee, as applicable, on more than one
occasion.

 



 

(e) For purposes of this Agreement, " ** _Willful Breach_** " means a breach
that is a consequence of an act or omission undertaken by the breaching Party
with the Knowledge that the taking of or the omission of taking such act
would, or would reasonably be expected to, cause or constitute a material
breach of this Agreement; _provided_ that, without limiting the meaning of
Willful Breach, the Parties acknowledge and agree that any failure by any
Party to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby
after the applicable conditions to the closing set forth in _Article VII_
have been satisfied or waived (except for those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, which conditions would be capable
of being satisfied at the time of such failure to consummate the Merger) shall
constitute a Willful Breach of this Agreement. Parent and Merger Sub
acknowledge and agree that, without in any way limiting the Companys rights
under _Section 9.10_, recoverable damages of the Company hereunder shall not
be limited to reimbursement of expenses or out-of-pocket costs but shall also
include the benefit of the bargain lost by the shareholders of the Company
(including "lost premium"), taking into consideration relevant matters,
including the total amount payable to the Companys shareholders under this
Agreement and the time value of money, which, in each case, shall be deemed in
such event to be damages of the Company and shall be recoverable by the
Company on behalf of its shareholders.

 



 

SECTION 8.03 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties at any
time before or after receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (a) after receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval, there
shall be made no amendment that by Law requires further approval by the
shareholders of the Company without the further approval of such shareholders,
(b) no amendment shall be made to this Agreement after the Effective Time, (c)
except as provided above, no amendment of this Agreement shall require the
approval of the shareholders of Parent or the shareholders of the Company and
(d) no amendments to or waivers of any DFS Provision shall be effective
without the written consent of the Financing Parties. This Agreement may not
be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the
Parties.

 



 

SECTION 8.04 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the
parties may, subject to _Section 8.03(a)_, (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties, (b)
waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein
or in any document delivered pursuant to this Agreement, (c) waive compliance
with any covenants and agreements contained herein or (d) waive the
satisfaction of any of the conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the
part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such Party. The failure
of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this
Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.

 



 

SECTION 8.05 _Procedure for Termination, Amendment, Extension or Waiver_. A
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01_, an amendment of
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.03_ or an extension or waiver pursuant
to _Section 8.04_ shall, in order to be effective, require, in the case of
the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, action by its respective board of directors
or the duly authorized designee of its board of directors. Termination of this
Agreement prior to the Effective Time shall not require the approval of the
shareholders of the Company. The Party desiring to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 8.01_ shall give written notice of such termination to
the other Parties in accordance with _Section 9.02_, specifying the provision
of this Agreement pursuant to which such termination is effected.

SECTION 9.04 _Interpretation_.

 



 

(a) _Time Periods_. When calculating the period of time before which, within
which or following which any act is to be done or step taken pursuant to this

shall be excluded and (ii) if the last day of such period is a not a Business

(d) _Articles, Sections and Headings_. When a reference is made herein to an
Article or a Section, such reference shall be to an Article or a Section of
this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents and headings
contained herein are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any
way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

 



 

(e) _Include_. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are
used herein, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation."

 



 

(f) _Hereof_. The words "hereof," "hereto," "hereby," "herein" and "hereunder"
and words of similar import when used herein shall refer to this Agreement as
a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement.

degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and such phrase shall not
mean simply "if."

 



 

(h) _Contracts; Laws_. Any Contract or Law defined or referred to herein means
such Contract or Law as from time to time amended, modified or supplemented,

(j) _Exhibits and Disclosure Letters_. The Exhibits to this Agreement and the

integral part of this Agreement. Each of the Company and Parent may, at its
option, include in the Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure
Letter, respectively, items that are not material in order to avoid any
misunderstanding, and such inclusion, or any references to dollar amounts
herein or in the Disclosure Letters, shall not be deemed to be an

purposes of this Agreement or otherwise. Any matter set forth in any section
of the Disclosure Letters shall be deemed to be referred to and incorporated
in any section to which it is specifically referenced or cross-referenced and

accrual or other similar item underlying a number on such balance sheet or
financial statement reasonably related to the subject matter of such
representation or (ii) such item and the amount thereof is otherwise
reasonably identified on such balance sheet or financial statement (or the

SECTION 9.05 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule or Law, or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any Party or such Party waives its rights under
this _Section 9.05_ with respect thereto. Upon any determination that any
term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced,
the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that transactions contemplated by this Agreement
are fulfilled to the extent possible.

 



 

SECTION 9.06 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts (including by means of facsimile or email in.pdf format), all of
which shall be considered one and the same agreement, and shall become
effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the

SECTION 9.07 _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement,
taken together with the Company Disclosure Letter, the Gurantee and the
Confidentiality Agreement, constitutes the entire agreement, and supersedes
all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between or
among the Parties with respect to the Merger. Except (a) for the right of the
Company on behalf of its shareholders to pursue damages (including claims for
damages contemplated by the last sentence of _Section 8.02(e)_) in the event
of Parents or Merger Subs breach of this Agreement (whether or

 



      
 

 



 

not this Agreement has been terminated pursuant to _Article VIII_), and (b)
after the Effective Time, for _Section 2.01_, _Section 2.02_, _Section
2.03_, the last sentence of _Section 6.02(a)_ and _Section 6.09_, each Party
agrees that (i) their respective representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements set forth herein are solely for the benefit of the other Parties,
in accordance with and subject to the terms of this Agreement and (ii) this
Agreement is not intended to, and does not, confer upon any Person other than
the Parties any rights or remedies hereunder, including the right to rely upon
the representations and warranties set forth herein. The Financing Parties and
each of their respective Affiliates and their respective current, former and
future direct or indirect equity holders, controlling persons, stockholders,
agents, Affiliates, members, managers, general or limited partners, assignees
or representatives (collectively, the " ** _Financing Source Parties_** ")
shall be express third-party beneficiaries with respect to _Section 8.02(d)_,
_Section 8.03_, this _Section 9.07_, _Section 9.08_, _Section 9.11(b)_,
_Section 9.12_ and _Section 9.14_ (collectively, the " ** _DFS Provisions_**
").

 



 

SECTION 9.08 _Governing Law_. This Agreement, and all Claims or causes of
action of the Parties (whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, or whether
at law (including at common law or by statute) or in equity) that may be based
on, arise out of or relate to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution,
performance or subject matter hereof, shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to
principles of conflict of laws; _provided_ , that, except as otherwise set
forth in the Debt Letters as in effect as of the date of this Agreement, all
matters relating to the interpretation, construction, validity and enforcement
(whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort, or otherwise) against any of
the Financing Source Parties in any way relating to the Debt Letters or the
performance thereof or the Financing, shall be exclusively governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the domestic Law of the State of New York
without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule
whether of the State of New York or any other jurisdiction that would cause
the application of Law of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York.

 



 

SECTION 9.09 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or
in part, by operation of law or otherwise, by any of the Parties without the
prior written consent of the other Parties. Any purported assignment without
such consent shall be void; _provided_ that Parent may make as assignment of
its rights (but not its obligations) under this Agreement to any Financing
Party without the prior written consent of the Company. Subject to the
preceding sentences, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit
of, and be enforceable by, the Parties and their respective successors and
assigns.

 



 

SECTION 9.10 _Specific Enforcement_. The Parties acknowledge and agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached and that monetary damages, even if available, would not be
an adequate remedy therefor. It is accordingly agreed that, at any time prior
to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VIII_, the Parties
shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the performance of terms and provisions
of this Agreement, including the right of a Party to cause each other Party to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, in any court referred to in _Section 9.11_, without proof of
actual damages (and each Party hereby waives any requirement for the securing
or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy), this being in addition
to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. The
Parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is
unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any reason, nor to
assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy for
any such breach. If any Party brings any Claim to enforce specifically the
performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement when expressly
available to such Party pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, then,
notwithstanding

 



      
 

 



 

anything to the contrary herein, the End Date shall automatically be extended
by the period of time between the commencement of such Claim and the date on
which such Claim is fully and finally resolved.

 



 

SECTION 9.11 _Jurisdiction; Venue_.

 



 

(a) All Claims arising from, under or in connection with this Agreement shall
be raised to and exclusively determined by the Court of Chancery of the State
of Delaware or, if such court disclaims (or does not have) jurisdiction, the
U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, to whose jurisdiction and
venue the Parties unconditionally consent and submit. Each Party hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of venue of
Claim arising out of this Agreement in such courts and hereby further
irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agree not to plead or claim in any
such court that any such Claim brought in any such court has been brought in
an inconvenient forum. Each Party further agree that service of any process,
summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to the respective
addresses set forth in _Section 9.02_ hereof shall be effective service of
process for any Claim brought against such Party in any such court.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement (including this
_Section 9.11_), each Party agrees that it will not bring or support any
action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind
or description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise, against the Financing Source Parties in any way relating to this
Agreement, including any dispute arising out of the Debt Letters or the
performance thereof or the Financing, in any forum other than the Supreme
Court of the State of New York, County of New York, or, if under applicable
law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the Federal courts, the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York (and of the appropriate
appellate courts therefrom).

 



 

SECTION 9.12 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. ** EACH PARTY HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE
FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL
BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE MERGER (INCLUDING ANY PROCEEDING AGAINST THE FINANCING SOURCE
PARTIES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, THE
DEBT LETTERS, THE FINANCING OR THE PERFORMANCE OF SERVICES WITH RESPECT
THERETO). EACH PARTY (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY
OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH PARTY
WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE
FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HAVE BEEN
INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVER
AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 9.12.**

 



 

SECTION 9.13 _Construction_. Each of the Parties has participated in the
drafting and negotiation of this Agreement. If an ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement must be construed as if it is
drafted by all the Parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise
favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of authorship of any of the
provisions of this Agreement.

 



 

SECTION 9.14 _Financing Sources_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, except for claims by Parent or the Merger Sub
against the Financing Source Parties pursuant to the Debt Letters and any
definitive documents related thereto, (a) none of the Parties nor any of their
respective Subsidiaries, Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents,
partners, managers, members or stockholders shall have any rights or claims
against any Financing Source Party, in any way relating to this Agreement or
any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or in respect of any
oral representations made or alleged to have been made in connection herewith
or therewith, including

 



      
 

 



 

any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt Letters or the
performance thereof or the financings contemplated thereby, whether at law or
equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise and (b) no Financing Source Party
shall have any liability (whether in contract, in tort or otherwise) to any
Party or any of their respective subsidiaries, Affiliates, directors,
officers, employees, agents, partners, managers, members or stockholders for
any obligations or liabilities of any Party under this Agreement or for any
claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby or in respect of any oral representations made or alleged
to have been made in connection herewith or therewith, including any dispute
arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt Letters or the performance
thereof or the financings contemplated thereby, whether at law or equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise.

 



 

SECTION 9.15 _Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other such Taxes and fees (including penalties and interest)
incurred in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement shall be paid by Parent and Merger Sub when due.
