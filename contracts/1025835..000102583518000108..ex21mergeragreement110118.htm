AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement") is dated as of November
1, 2018, by and among Enterprise Financial Services Corp, a Delaware
corporation ("Parent"), Enterprise Bank and Trust, a Missouri state-chartered
trust company with banking powers and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent
("Parent Bank"), Trinity Capital Corporation, a New Mexico corporation
("Company"), and Los Alamos National Bank, a national banking association and
wholly-owned subsidiary of Company ("Company Bank").

W I T N E S S E T H:

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of each of Parent and Company have
(i) determined that this Agreement and the business combination and related
transactions contemplated hereby are fair to and in the best interests of
their respective entities and shareholders; and (ii) determined that this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby are consistent with and in
furtherance of their respective business strategies;

WHEREAS, in accordance with the terms, and subject to the conditions, of this
Agreement, (i) Company will merge with and into Parent, with Parent as the
surviving entity (the "Merger"), and thereafter (ii) Company Bank will merge
with and into Parent Bank, with Parent Bank as the surviving entity (the "Bank
Merger");

WHEREAS, for federal income Tax purposes, the parties intend that the Merger
shall qualify as a reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a) of
the Code (a "368 Reorganization") and intend for this Agreement to constitute
a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Section 1.368-2(g) of the
Regulations;

WHEREAS, as a material inducement and as additional consideration to Parent to
enter into this Agreement, each of the directors and certain officers of
Company and principal holders of the Company Common Stock, solely in their
capacity as shareholders of Company, have entered into a voting agreement with
Parent dated as of the date hereof, the form of which is attached hereto as
Exhibit A (collectively, the "Voting Agreements"), pursuant to which each such
Person has agreed, among other things, to vote all shares of Company Stock
owned by such Person in favor of the approval of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement and the Voting Agreements;

WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and
agreements in connection with the transactions described in this Agreement and
to prescribe certain conditions thereto; and

WHEREAS, the parties desire that capitalized terms used herein shall have the
definitions ascribed to such terms when they are first used herein or as
otherwise specified in Article 8 hereof.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises herein contained and
for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows: ARTICLE 1.

THE MERGER

Section 1.01 The Merger. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, at the Effective Time, Company shall merge with and into Parent in
accordance with the DGCL and the NMBCA. Upon consummation of the Merger, at
the Effective Time the separate corporate existence of Company shall cease and
Parent shall survive and continue to exist as a corporation incorporated under
the laws of the State of Delaware (Parent, as the surviving entity in the
Merger, sometimes being referred to herein as the "Surviving Entity").

Section 1.02 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws. The certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Entity upon consummation of the
Merger at the Effective Time shall be the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws of Parent as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time.

Section 1.03 Directors and Officers of Surviving Entity.

(a) Subject to the provisions of Section 1.03(b), the directors and officers
of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, from and after the
Effective Time, serve as directors and officers of the Surviving Entity.

(b) Subject to compliance with applicable Law (including, to the extent
applicable, the continued listing requirements of NASDAQ), prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to take all
necessary corporate or other action so that from and after the Effective Time,
at the election of Parent, either (i) the size of the board of directors of
Parent (the "Board of Parent") is increased by two members, (ii) the size of
the Board of Parent is increased by one member and one of the then incumbent
directors resigns from the Board of Parent, or (iii) two of the then incumbent
directors resign from the Board of Parent, and in either case two members of
the Company Board who are independent with respect to Parent for purposes of
the listing requirements of NASDAQ, selected by mutual agreement of Company
and Parent (the "Company Directors"), are elected or appointed to the Board of
Parent to fill the vacancies on the Board of Parent created by such increase
or resignation, as applicable. Parent, through the Board of Parent and subject
to the Board of Parent's fiduciary duties to the shareholders of Parent, shall
take all necessary action to nominate the Company Directors for election to
the Board of Parent in the proxy statement relating to the first annual
meeting of the shareholders of Parent following the Closing. Until the
Effective Time, the Company shall cause the Company Board to maintain at least
two directors who are members of the Company Board on the date of this
Agreement and who are independent with respect to Parent for purposes of the
listing requirements of NASDAQ.

Section 1.04 Bank Merger.

(a) At such time following the Effective Time as Parent may determine, Company
Bank will be merged with and into Parent Bank upon the terms and with the
effect set forth in the Plan of Bank Merger, the form of which is attached
hereto as Exhibit B. (b) Subject to the provisions of Section 1.04(c), the directors and officers
of Parent Bank immediately prior to the effective time of the Bank Merger
shall, from and after such effective time, serve as directors and officers of
the Surviving Bank.

(c) Subject to compliance with applicable Law, prior to the effective time of
the Bank Merger, Parent Bank shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to take
all necessary corporate or other action so that from and after the effective
time of the Bank Merger, at the election of Parent Bank, either (i) the size
of the board of directors of Parent Bank (the "Board of Parent Bank") is
increased by one member or (ii) one of the then incumbent directors resigns
from the Board of Parent Bank, and in either case one member of the Company
Board, selected by mutual agreement of Company and Parent (the "Bank
Director"), is elected or appointed to the Board of Parent Bank to fill the
vacancy on the Board of Parent Bank created by such increase or resignation,
as applicable. Parent Bank, through the Board of Parent Bank and subject to
the Board of Parent Bank's fiduciary duties to its sole shareholder, shall
take all necessary action to nominate the Bank Director for election to the
Board of Parent Bank as promptly as practicable following the Closing.

Section 1.05 Effective Time; Closing.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Parent and Company
will make all such filings as may be required by applicable Laws to consummate
the Merger. The Merger shall become effective upon filing a certificate of
merger (the "Certificate of Merger") with the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware on the Closing Date, in such form as required by, and executed in
accordance with, the relevant provisions of the DGCL (the "Effective Time").

(b) The Bank Merger shall become effective as set forth in the Plan of Bank
Merger. Company Bank shall execute such certificates or articles of
combination and such other documents and certificates as may be reasonably
requested by Parent to effectuate the Bank Merger.

(c) The closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the
"Closing") shall take place on such date and at such time as Parent and
Company mutually agree, which such date shall be no later than fifteen (15)
days after all of the conditions to the Closing set forth in Article 6 (other
than conditions to be satisfied at the Closing, which shall be satisfied or
waived at the Closing) have been satisfied or waived in accordance with the
terms hereof (such date, the "Closing Date") remotely via the electronic
exchange of documentation between the parties (via electronic transmission or
other similar means for exchanging documentation), or at such place as Parent
and Company may mutually agree.

Section 1.06 Additional Actions. If, at any time after the Effective Time,
Parent shall consider or be advised that any further deeds, documents,
assignments or assurances in Law or any other acts are necessary or desirable
to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, Company and Company Subsidiaries
shall be deemed to have granted to Parent an irrevocable power of attorney to
execute and deliver, in its official corporate capacity, all such deeds,
assignments or assurances in Law or any other acts as are necessary or
desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, and the officers and
directors of Parent are authorized in the name of Company, Company Bank and
their respective Subsidiaries to take any and all such action. Section 1.07 Reservation of Right to Revise Structure. At Parent's election,
without the approval of Company, the business combination contemplated by this
Agreement may alternatively be structured so that (i) Company is merged with
and into any other direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent, (ii)
any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent is merged with and
into Company, (iii) Company Bank is merged with and into any other direct or
indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent Bank, (iv) any direct or indirect
wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent Bank is merged with and into Company Bank,
or (v) the Bank Merger is delayed or abandoned and each of Company Bank and
Parent Bank continue to operate as separate banking Subsidiaries of Parent;
provided, however, that no such change shall (i) alter or change the Merger
Consideration, (ii) impede or delay consummation of the Merger (including any
Closing Regulatory Approval), (iii) adversely or alter or change the federal
income Tax treatment of holders of Company Stock in connection with the Merger
from what such treatment would have been absent such change (including, but
not limited to, any such change that would result in the Merger failing to
qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1)(a) of
the Code), (iv) require submission to or approval of Company's shareholders
after the plan of merger set forth in this Agreement has been approved by
Company's shareholders, or (v) otherwise adversely affect Company, Company
Bank or any shareholder of Company in any material respect. In the event that
Parent elects to make such a change, the parties agree to execute appropriate
documents reasonably requested to reflect the change.


ARTICLE 2.

MERGER CONSIDERATION; EXCHANGE PROCEDURES

Section 2.01 Merger Consideration. Subject to the provisions of this
Agreement, at the Effective Time, automatically by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of Parent, Company, or any shareholder of
Company:

(a) Each share of Parent Common Stock that is issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain issued and outstanding
following the Effective Time and shall be unchanged by the Merger.

(b) Each share of Company Common Stock owned directly by Parent, Company or
any of their respective Subsidiaries, as treasury stock or otherwise (other
than shares in trust accounts, managed accounts and the like for the benefit
of customers), immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and
retired at the Effective Time without any conversion thereof, and no payment
shall be made with respect thereto.

(c) Subject to the other provisions of this Article 2, each share of Company
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than Company Common Stock to be cancelled pursuant to Section 2.01(b)
and Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive (i) the
Per Share Cash Consideration and (ii) 0.1972 (the "Exchange Ratio") shares of
Parent Common Stock (the "Per Share Stock Consideration" and, together with
the Per Share Cash Consideration, the "Merger Consideration"). Section 2.02 Cancellation of Company Stock. After the Effective Time, all
shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be issued and outstanding and
shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, except as to
Dissenting Shares, and shall thereafter represent only the right to receive
the Merger Consideration (and any cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant
to Section 2.04 and any dividends and other distributions pursuant to Section
2.08(d)) and each holder of a Certificate or a Book-Entry Share will cease to
have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration (and any cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section
2.04 and any dividends and other distributions pursuant to Section 2.08(d)).

Section 2.03 Stock-Based Awards.

(a) Unless otherwise noted, the provisions of this Section 2.03 pertain to all
restricted stock units and other stock-based awards granted by Company,
including but not limited to awards granted under the Company Stock Plans,
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively,
the "Company Stock Awards").

(b) Parent and Company shall take all actions necessary so that, at the
Effective Time,

(i) each Company Stock Award that is unvested immediately prior to the
Effective Time and will not vest at the Effective Time pursuant to its terms
(the "Assumed Stock Awards") shall be converted into an award consisting of
that number of restricted stock units of Parent Common Stock equal to the sum
of (x) the product of (A) the number of shares of Company Stock subject to
such Assumed Stock Award and (B) the Per Share Stock Consideration and (y) the
product of (A) the number of shares of Company Stock subject to such Assumed
Stock Award and (B) the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the Per Share Cash
Consideration, by (ii) the Average VWAP as of the Closing Date (such sum
rounded down to the nearest whole share);

(ii) the Assumed Stock Awards shall have the same vesting schedule (including
any acceleration of vesting as provided in the Company Stock Plan and any
applicable award agreement evidencing such grant) as the Company Stock Award
and otherwise shall have the same terms and conditions as such Company Stock
Award; provided, that Parent shall convert Company Stock Awards into Assumed
Stock Awards in such a manner as to ensure that the Assumed Stock Awards are
not subject to, or are compliant with, Section 409A of the Code as a result of
the assumption and conversion; and

(iii) each Company Stock Award that is unsettled or unvested immediately prior
to the Effective Time and will vest at the Effective Time pursuant to its
terms shall vest and be free of any restrictions and be exchanged for the
Merger Consideration.

Section 2.04 Fractional Shares. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, no
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock and no certificates or scrip
therefor, or other evidence of ownership thereof, will be issued in the Merger. Each holder of shares of Company Common
Stock exchanged pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled
to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after taking into
account all Certificates and Book-Entry Shares delivered by such holder) shall
receive, in lieu thereof, an amount of cash (without interest and rounded to
the nearest whole cent) determined by multiplying the fractional share
(rounded to the nearest one hundredth of a share) by the Average VWAP as of
the Closing Date.

Section 2.05 Plan of Reorganization. It is intended that the Merger shall
constitute a 368 Reorganization, and that this Agreement shall constitute a
"plan of reorganization" as that term is used in Sections 354 and 361 of the
Code. From and after the date of this Agreement and until the Closing, each
party hereto shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to cause the Merger to
qualify as a 368 Reorganization.

Section 2.06 Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, shares of Company Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time and held by a shareholder who has not voted in favor of
the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who has complied with the
applicable provisions of the NMBCA ("Dissenting Shares") shall not be
converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration, unless such
shareholder fails to perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses his, her or its
right to appraisal. From and after the Effective Time, a shareholder who has
properly exercised such appraisal rights shall not have any rights of a
shareholder of Company or the Surviving Entity with respect to shares of
Company Stock, except those provided under applicable provisions of the NMBCA
(any shareholder duly making such demand being hereinafter called a
"Dissenting Shareholder"). A Dissenting Shareholder shall be entitled to
receive payment of the appraised value of each share of Company Stock in
accordance with the applicable provisions of the NMBCA, unless, after the
Effective Time, such shareholder fails to perfect or withdraws or loses the
right to appraisal, in which case such shares of Company Stock shall be
converted into and represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration (and any cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section
2.04 and any dividends and other distributions pursuant to Section 2.08(d))
for such shares, without interest thereon, upon surrender of the shareholder's
Certificates pursuant to Section 2.08. Parent shall have the right to
participate in all discussions, negotiations and proceedings with respect to
any such demands for appraisal. Company shall not, except with the prior
written consent of Parent, voluntarily make, or offer to make, any payment
with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demand for appraisal.
Company shall not waive any failure to timely deliver a written demand for
appraisal or the taking of any other action by such Dissenting Shareholder as
may be necessary to perfect appraisal rights under the NMBCA. Any payments
made in respect of Dissenting Shares shall be made by Parent as the Surviving
Entity.

Section 2.07 Deposit of Merger Consideration.

(a) At or before the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to
be deposited, with the Exchange Agent (i) stock certificates or, at Parent's
option, evidence of shares in book entry form, representing the number of
shares of Parent Common Stock sufficient to issue the Aggregate Stock
Consideration, and (ii) an aggregate amount of cash sufficient to pay (A) the
Aggregate Cash Consideration, plus (B) any cash payable in lieu of fractional
shares pursuant to Section 2.04 and any dividends and other distributions payable pursuant to
Section 2.08(d) (collectively, the "Exchange Fund"), and Parent shall instruct
the Exchange Agent to timely pay the Merger Consideration in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement.

(b) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed as of the first
anniversary of the Closing Date (as well as any interest or proceeds from any
investment thereof) shall be delivered by the Exchange Agent to Parent. Any
former shareholders of Company who have not theretofore complied with Section
2.08 shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the Merger
Consideration (and any cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section
2.04 and dividends and other distributions pursuant to Section 2.08(d)), in
each case without any interest thereon. If any Certificate or Book-Entry Share
has not been surrendered prior to the time that is immediately prior to the
time at which the Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate or Book-
Entry Share would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Authority, any such shares, cash, dividends or distributions in
respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and
clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.
Neither the Exchange Agent nor any party to this Agreement shall be liable to
any holder of Company Common Stock represented by any Certificate or Book-
Entry Share for any Merger Consideration (and any cash in lieu of fractional
shares pursuant to Section 2.04 and dividends and other distributions pursuant
to Section 2.08(d)) which is paid to a public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.

Section 2.08 Exchange Procedures.

(a) Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent, as soon as practicable after the
Effective Time but in no event later than ten (10) days thereafter, to mail to
each holder of a Certificate and each holder of a Book-Entry Share(s), (i) a
letter of transmittal ("Letter of Transmittal"), which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates and
Book-Entry Shares shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to
the Exchange Agent or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, upon adherence to the
procedures set forth in the Letter of Transmittal, and (ii) instructions for
use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or, in the case of Book-
Entry Shares, the surrender of such shares, for payment of the Merger
Consideration. The Letter of Transmittal shall be subject to the approval of
Company (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(b) Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate or Book-Entry
Share(s), together with the Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other customary
documents as may be reasonably required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of
such Certificate or Book-Entry Share(s) shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor (i) a certificate (or evidence of shares in book-entry form,
as applicable) representing the number of shares of Parent Common Stock that
such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article
2, and (ii) a check in the amount (after giving effect of any Tax withholding
as provided in Section 2.08(e)) equal to (A) the cash consideration such
holder is entitled to receive pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.01(c),
plus (B) the amount of any cash payable in lieu of any fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.04, plus (C) any dividends and other distributions that such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to Section 2.08(d). No interest shall be paid or accrued for
the benefit of holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the Merger
Consideration payable in respect of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.08(b), each Certificate
and each Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time
to represent only the right to receive, upon surrender, the Merger
Consideration (and any cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section
2.04 and dividends and other distributions pursuant to Section 2.08(d)).

(c) In the event a transfer of ownership of a Certificate is not registered in
the stock transfer records of Company, the Merger Consideration (and any cash
in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.04 and dividends and other
distributions pursuant to Section 2.08(d)) payable with respect to such
Certificate shall be issued or paid to a Person other than the Person in whose
name the Certificate is registered if (i) such Certificate shall be properly
endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer, (ii) the Person
requesting such payment or issuance shall pay any transfer or other similar
Taxes required by reason of the payment or issuance to a Person other than the
registered holder of the Certificate or establish, to the reasonable
satisfaction of Parent, that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable, and
(iii) the Person requesting such payment or issuance shall have complied with
the provisions of the Letter of Transmittal. In the event of a dispute with
respect to ownership of any shares of Company Common Stock represented by any
Certificate, Parent and Exchange Agent shall be entitled to tender to the
custody of any court of competent jurisdiction any Merger Consideration (and
any cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.04 and dividends
and other distributions pursuant to Section 2.08(d)) represented by such
Certificate and file legal proceedings interpleading all parties to such
dispute, and will thereafter be relieved with respect to any claims thereto.

(d) If a dividend or other distribution is declared by Parent in respect of
the Parent Common Stock, the record date for which is at or after the
Effective Time, such declaration shall include dividends or other
distributions in respect of all shares of Parent Common Stock issuable
pursuant to this Agreement. No dividends or other distributions in respect of
the Parent Common Stock shall be paid to any holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares until such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares
are surrendered for exchange in accordance with this Article 2. Subject to
applicable Laws, following surrender of any such Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares and the issuance of Parent Common Stock in exchange therefor, there
shall be paid to the holder of such Parent Common Stock, (i) at the time of
such surrender, the dividends or other distributions with a record date after
the Effective Time but prior to such surrender payable with respect to such
Parent Common Stock and not paid and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the
dividends or other distributions payable with respect to such Parent Common
Stock with a record date after the Effective Time but with a payment date
subsequent to surrender.

(e) Parent (through the Exchange Agent, if applicable) shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder of Company Common Stock such amounts as Parent is
required to deduct and withhold under applicable Law. Any amounts so deducted
and withheld shall be remitted to the appropriate Governmental Authority and
upon such remittance shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to such holder of Company Common Stock in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made by Parent or the Exchange Agent, as
applicable.

Section 2.09 Anti-Dilution Provisions. In the event that before the Effective
Time Parent changes (or establishes a record date for changing) the number of,
or provides for the exchange of, shares of Parent Common Stock issued and
outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a stock split, reverse
stock split, stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization,
reclassification, exchange or similar transaction with respect to the
outstanding Parent Common Stock, the Merger Consideration will be
appropriately and proportionately adjusted to provide the holders of Company
Common Stock and Company Stock Awards the same economic effect as contemplated
by this Agreement based on the shares of Parent Common Stock issued and
outstanding prior to such event; provided, that for the avoidance of doubt, no
such adjustment shall be made with regard to the Parent Common Stock if (a)
Parent repurchases outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock, (b) Parent
issues additional shares of Parent Common Stock and receives consideration for
such shares in a bona fide third party transaction, or (c) Parent issues
employee or director stock options, restricted stock awards, grants or similar
equity awards or Parent issues Parent Common Stock upon exercise or vesting of
any such options, grants or awards.

Section 2.10 Lost, Stolen, or Destroyed Certificates. In the event any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by Parent or the Exchange
Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as
Parent may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange
Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate
the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this
Agreement.

30, 2018 and the date hereof, reflecting any gain or loss with respect to any
OREO sold.

(d) Except as would not reasonably be expected to be material, each Loan held
in Company's, Company Bank's or any of their respective Subsidiaries' loan
portfolio (each a "Company Loan") (i) is evidenced by notes, agreements or
other evidences of indebtedness that are true, genuine and what they purport
to be, (ii) to the extent secured, is and has been secured by valid Liens

Contract with (or otherwise obligated to) any Person which obligates Company
or any Company Subsidiary to repurchase from any such Person any Loan or other

to maintain, protect and/or permit the use of such Company Intellectual
Property by Company or a Company Subsidiary, and (ii) there is no default or

or agreements of any kind with respect to the patents, trademarks, service
marks, trade names, copyrights, trade secrets, licenses, information,
proprietary rights and processes of any other Person.

Property used to carry on the business of Company and the Company Subsidiaries
as currently conducted. Neither Company nor any Company Subsidiary has
embedded or permitted to be embedded any open source, copyleft or community
source code in any of its products or services generally available or in
development, including but not limited to any libraries, that provide for or
permit such code or any of Company Intellectual Property's proprietary code to
be distributed or made available in source form or dedicated to the public. In
addition, Company and each Company Subsidiary has taken reasonable steps to
maintain, protect and preserve the Company Intellectual Property.

or a Company Subsidiary is valid and enforceable and has not been cancelled,
forfeited, expired or abandoned, and neither Company nor any Company
Subsidiary has received any written or, to Company's Knowledge, oral notice
challenging the validity or enforceability of any Company Intellectual
Property.

a result of the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the performance by
Company and Company Bank of its obligations hereunder, in violation of any
material Contracts to which Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party and
pursuant to which Company or any Company Subsidiary is authorized to use any
third-party patents, trademarks, service marks, copyrights, trade secrets,
computer software or other intellectual property. Neither Company nor any
Company Subsidiary has received notice challenging Company's or any Company
Subsidiary's license or legally enforceable right to use any such third-party
intellectual property rights. The consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby will not result in the loss or impairment of the right of
Company or any Company Subsidiary (or Parent or any Parent Subsidiary post-
Closing) to own or use any material Company Intellectual Property. (e) With respect to any Company Intellectual Property that is an intent-to-use
trademark application ("ITU"), this Agreement provides for the assumption of
the entire business of Company to which that respective ITU pertains, such
business of Company will be ongoing and existing immediately upon consummation

is or may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction. There are no Liens for
Taxes (other than Taxes not yet due and payable) upon any of the assets of
Parent or any Parent Subsidiary.

(b) No foreign, federal, state, or local Tax audits or administrative or
judicial Tax proceedings are currently being conducted or, to Parent's
Knowledge, pending with respect to Parent or any Parent Subsidiary. Other than
with respect to audits that have already been completed and resolved, neither
Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has received from any foreign, federal,
state, or local taxing authority (including jurisdictions where Parent and
Parent Subsidiaries have not filed Tax Returns) any written (i) notice
indicating an intent to open an audit or other review, (ii) request for
information related to Tax matters, or (iii) notice of deficiency or proposed
adjustment for any amount of Tax proposed, asserted, or assessed by any taxing
authority against Parent or any Parent Subsidiary.

all examination reports and statements of deficiencies assessed against or
agreed to by Parent with respect to income Taxes filed for the years ended
December 31, 2017 and 2016. Parent has timely and properly taken such actions
in response to and in compliance with written notices that Parent has received
from the IRS in respect of information reporting and backup and nonresident

agreed to any extension of time with respect to a Tax assessment or
deficiency, which such waiver or extension is still valid and in effect.

distributed by another Person in a transaction that was purported or intended
to be nontaxable and governed in whole or in part by Section 355 or Section
361 of the Code.

(f) Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has been a member of an
affiliated group filing a consolidated federal income Tax Return (other than a
group the common parent of which was the Parent). Neither the Parent nor any
Parent Subsidiary has any liability for a material amount of Taxes of any
individual, bank, corporation, partnership, association, joint stock company,
business trust, limited liability company, or unincorporated organization
(other than the Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries) under Regulations Section
1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local, or foreign Law), as a
transferee or successor, by contract, or otherwise.

(g) The unpaid Taxes of Parent (i) did not, as of December 31, 2017, exceed
the reserve for Tax liability (which reserve is distinct and different from
any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences
between book and Tax income) set forth in the consolidated audited balance
sheets of Parent and Parent Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2017, and the
related consolidated audited statement of operations, shareholders' equity and
cash flows for the year then ended (rather than in any notes thereto), and (ii) do not exceed that reserve
as adjusted for the passage of time in accordance with the past custom and
practice of Parent in filing its Tax Returns. Since January 1, 2018, Parent
has not incurred any liability for Taxes arising from extraordinary gains or
losses, as that term is used in GAAP, outside the Ordinary Course of Business.

(h) Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has taken or agreed to take any
action, or is aware of any fact or circumstance, that would prevent the Merger

(b) (i) Each Parent Material Contract is valid and binding on Parent and/or a
Parent Subsidiary and, to the Knowledge of Parent, each other party thereto,
and is in full force and effect and enforceable in accordance with its terms,
except to the extent that validity and enforceability may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar Laws
affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally or by general
principles of equity or by principles of public policy and except where the
failure to be valid, binding, enforceable and in full force and effect, would
not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on
Parent; and (ii) neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary is in default under
any Parent Material Contract. No material power of attorney or similar
authorization given directly or indirectly by Parent or any Parent Subsidiary
is currently outstanding.

Section 4.15 Employee Benefit Plans.

("Parent 401(a) Plan"), has received a favorable determination or opinion
letter from the IRS. None of Parent, any Parent Subsidiary, or any of Parent's
related organizations described in Sections 414(b), (c) or (m) of the Code
("Parent Controlled Group Members") has engaged in a transaction with respect
to any Parent Benefit Plan, including a Parent 401(a) Plan, that could subject
Parent, any Parent Subsidiary or any Parent Controlled Group Member to a
material Tax or material penalty under Section 4975 of the Code or Section
502(i) of ERISA. No Parent 401(a) Plan has been submitted under or been the

or contribute to, or have ever sponsored, maintained, administered or

Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended).

(f) Parent may amend or terminate any such Parent Benefit Plan at any time in
accordance with its terms without incurring any material liability thereunder
for future benefits coverage at any time after such termination, except for

Knowledge, threatened.

Section 4.21 Loans.

(a) Except as would not reasonably be expected to be material, each Loan held
in Parent's, Parent Bank's or any of their respective Subsidiaries' loan
portfolio (each a "Parent Loan") (i) is evidenced by notes, agreements or

to be, (ii) to the extent secured, is and has been secured by valid Liens
which have been perfected and, (iii) to Parent's Knowledge, is a legal, valid and

any currently outstanding Parent Loan have been asserted in writing against
Parent or Parent Bank for which there is a reasonable probability of an

repurchase such Loans or interests therein solely on account of a payment
default by the obligor on any such Loan.

any gain or loss with respect to any OREO sold.

Section 4.22 Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses. Parent's reserves, allowance
for loan and lease losses and carrying value for real estate owned as
reflected in the Parent Reports, were, in the opinion of management, as of the
applicable dates thereof, adequate in all material respects to provide for

nor any Parent Subsidiary has received notice challenging the validity or
enforceability of any such Parent Intellectual Property.

(c) Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary is, and none of them will be as a
result of the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the performance by
Parent or Parent Bank of its obligations hereunder, in violation of any
material Contracts to which Parent or any Parent Subsidiary is a party and
pursuant to which Parent or any Parent Subsidiary is authorized to use any
third-party patents, trademarks, service marks, copyrights, trade secrets,
computer software or other intellectual property. Neither Parent nor any
Parent Subsidiary has received notice challenging Parent's or any Parent
Subsidiary's license or legally enforceable right to use any such third-party

Property. (d) To Parent's Knowledge, neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has
interfered with, infringed upon, misappropriated, or otherwise conflicted with

the Parent Leased Property. Except as has not had, and would not reasonably be
expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent, all buildings,
structures, fixtures, building systems and equipment, and all components

Parent Leased Property, are sufficient for the operation of the business of
Parent and Parent Subsidiaries as currently conducted.

postponement is required by applicable Law in order to ensure that any
required supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement-Prospectus is provided
to the holders of Company Common Stock with a reasonable amount of time in

inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law. Company shall
keep Parent updated with respect to the proxy solicitation results in
connection with the Company Meeting as reasonably requested by Parent.

(c) Except to the extent provided otherwise in Section 5.10, the Company shall
adjourn or postpone the Company Meeting, if, as of the time for which the
Company Meeting is originally scheduled there are insufficient shares of
Company Common Stock represented (either in Person or by proxy) to constitute
a quorum necessary to conduct the business of such meeting or, if on the date
of the Company Meeting, Company has not received proxies representing a

Commercially Reasonable Efforts to deliver to Parent such financial statements
and related analysis of Company as may be required by Law in order to file the
Registration Statement and any other report required to be filed by Parent
with the SEC, in each case, in compliance with applicable Laws and shall
provide Parent with any other information concerning itself that Parent may reasonably request in connection with the drafting and preparation of the

information supplied or to be supplied by it for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in (i) the Registration Statement will, at the time it is filed with
the SEC, at any time it is amended or supplemented, or at the time it becomes
effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading and (ii) the Proxy
Statement-Prospectus will, at the date of mailing to shareholders, at the time

required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
the light of the circumstances under which such statement was made, not
misleading. Each of Parent and Company further agrees that if it becomes aware
that any information furnished by it would cause any of the statements in the
Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement-Prospectus to be false or
misleading with respect to any material fact, or to omit to state any material
fact necessary to make the statements therein not false or misleading, to
promptly inform the other party thereof and to take appropriate steps to
correct the Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement-Prospectus. Parent
will advise Company, promptly after Parent receives notice thereof, (A) of the
time when the Registration Statement has become effective or any supplement or
amendment has been filed, (B) of the issuance of any stop order or the

any jurisdiction or of the initiation or threat of any proceeding for any such
purpose, and (C) of any request by the SEC for the amendment or supplement of
the Registration Statement or upon the receipt of any comments (whether
written or oral) from the SEC or its staff. Parent will provide Company and
its counsel with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on (and will
consider such comments in good faith) (x) the Registration Statement
(including the Proxy Statement-Prospectus) prior to its being filed with the
SEC, (y) all amendments and supplements to the Registration Statement
(including the Proxy Statement-Prospectus) and, (z) except to the extent such
response is submitted under confidential cover, all responses to requests for
additional information and replies to comments of the SEC, prior to their
being filed with, or sent to the SEC, and reasonable good faith consideration
shall be given to any comments made by Company and its counsel. Parent will
provide Company and its counsel with a copy of all such filings made with the
SEC. If at any time prior to the Company Meeting there shall occur any event
that should be disclosed in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement-
Prospectus or the Registration Statement, Parent shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to promptly
prepare and file such amendment or supplement with the SEC (if required under
applicable Law) and cooperate with Company to mail such amendment or
supplement to Company shareholders (if required under applicable Law).

(c) Parent agrees to use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to cause the shares
of Parent Common Stock to be issued in connection with the Merger to be
approved for listing on NASDAQ, subject to official notice of issuance, prior

all Permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of, all third parties and
Governmental Authorities necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, including without limitation, the Closing Regulatory
Approvals and the consents, approvals and notices under the Contracts set
forth on Section 3.05(c), (ii) to comply with the terms and conditions of such
permits, consents, approvals and authorizations and (iii) to cause the

Parent or any Parent Subsidiary (including Company and any Company Subsidiary
after Closing) to dispose of all or any material portion of its business or
assets, (C) cause any portion of any Company Regulatory Agreement to be
enforceable against Parent or Parent Bank after the Merger, or (D) be
reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Surviving Entity,
taken as a whole (together, the "Burdensome Conditions"). Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, as soon as practicable and in no event later than
sixty (60) days after the date of this Agreement, Parent and Company shall,
and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, each prepare and file any
applications, notices and filings required in order to obtain the Closing
Regulatory Approvals and any other Permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of any Governmental Authority necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger and the Bank Merger).

Regulatory Approvals (and its response thereto); provided, that in no event
shall Parent, Parent Bank, Company or Company Bank be obligated to provide or otherwise disclose to the other confidential
supervisory information regarding themselves, or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or Affiliates.

(b) Company will use Commercially Reasonable Efforts, and Parent shall
reasonably cooperate with Company at Company's request, to obtain all
consents, approvals, authorizations, waivers or similar affirmations with
respect to any Contracts set forth on Section 3.05(c) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule and all Leases set forth on Section 3.30(e) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule; provided, that, except as otherwise contemplated by this
Agreement, neither Company nor any Company Subsidiary will be required to make
any payment to or grant any concessions to any third party in connection
therewith. Each party will, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, notify
the other party promptly and promptly furnish the other party with copies of
notices or other communications received by such party or any of its
Subsidiaries from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person (or
another Person) is or may be required in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (and the response thereto from such party, its
Subsidiaries or its representatives). Company and Parent will reasonably
consult with each other and their respective representatives so as to permit
Company and Parent and their respective representatives to be knowledgeable
regarding the status of such effort, cooperate to take appropriate measures to
obtain such consents and avoid or mitigate any adverse consequences that may
result from the foregoing.

Section 5.08 Publicity. Parent and Company shall consult with each other
before issuing any press release with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue any such press release or
make any such public statement without the prior consent of the other party,
which shall not be unreasonably delayed or withheld; provided, however, that
Parent and Company may, without the prior consent of the other party (but
after such consultation, to the extent practicable in the circumstances),
issue such press release or make such public statements as may upon the advice
of counsel be required by Law or the rules and regulations of NASDAQ. It is
understood that Parent shall assume primary responsibility for the preparation
of joint press releases relating to this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby.

and warranties of Parent and Parent Bank and Company and Company Bank,
respectively, and preparing for the Merger and the other matters contemplated
by this Agreement, (i) upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable Laws,
afford the other party and its officers, employees, counsel, accountants and
other authorized representatives access, during normal business hours, to its
and its Subsidiaries' books, records (including, without limitation, Tax
Returns and, subject to the consent of the independent auditors, work papers
of independent auditors), information technology systems, properties and
personnel and to such other information as the other party may reasonably
request, and (ii) furnish to the other party, upon reasonable request, all
such other information concerning its business, properties, personnel and
Subsidiaries that is substantially similar in scope to the information
provided to the other party in connection with its diligence review prior to
the date of this Agreement. Any investigation pursuant to this Section 5.09 shall be conducted in such manner as not to interfere
unreasonably with the conduct of business of the other party or any of its
Subsidiaries.

(b) During the period from the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time

(c) During the period from the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time

matter hereafter arising which, if existing, occurring or known at the date of
this Agreement, would have been required to be set forth or described in the
Parent Disclosure Schedule or the Company Disclosure Schedule, as applicable,
or which is necessary to correct any information in such party's Disclosure
Schedule that has been rendered materially inaccurate thereby. Each such
notice shall include, or be accompanied by, a proposed supplement or amendment
to such party's Disclosure Schedule regarding such matter (a "Schedule
Supplement"). Each Schedule Supplement shall be deemed to be incorporated into
and to supplement and amend the Company Disclosure Schedule or Parent
Disclosure Schedule, as applicable, as of the date of this Agreement and as of
the Closing Date; provided, however, that if the matter which is the subject
of the Schedule Supplement constitutes or relates to something that could
provide Parent with a right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with
Section 7.01(e) and Parent does not elect to terminate this Agreement prior to
the earlier of (i) five (5) Business Days after the expiration of the
applicable cure period and (ii) the Expiration Date, then Parent shall be
deemed to have irrevocably waived any right to terminate this Agreement on
account of such matter.

(d) No investigation by a party or its representatives shall be deemed to
modify or waive any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the
other party or its Subsidiary bank set forth in this Agreement, or the
conditions to the respective obligations of Parent and Company to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby.

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.09 to the contrary, no party
shall be required to provide the other party with access or disclose
information where such access or disclosure would, in the reasonable opinion
of such party's counsel, jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the such
party, or contravene any binding Contract entered into by such party prior to
the date of this Agreement or any Law, Order or fiduciary duty applicable to
such party. In the event any of the restrictions in this Section 5.09(e) shall
apply, each party shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to make
appropriate alternate disclosure arrangements, including adopting additional
specific procedures to protect the confidentiality of sensitive material and
to ensure compliance with applicable Laws.

indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit, induce or knowingly encourage, or knowingly
take any action to facilitate the making of, any inquiry, offer or proposal which constitutes, or could
reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal; (ii) participate
in discussions or negotiations regarding any Acquisition Proposal or furnish,
or otherwise afford access, to any Person (other than Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary) any information or data with respect to Company or any Company
Subsidiary or otherwise in furtherance of an Acquisition Proposal; (iii)
release any Person from, waive any provision of, or fail to enforce any
confidentiality agreement or standstill agreement to which Company is a party
in furtherance of an Acquisition Proposal, unless, with respect to any such
standstill agreement, the Company Board reasonably determines in good faith,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the enforcement of, or
the failure to provide such release or waiver with respect to, any such
standstill agreement would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law; or (iv) enter into any agreement, agreement in principle or
letter of intent with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or approve or
resolve to approve any Acquisition Proposal or any agreement, agreement in
principle or letter of intent relating to an Acquisition Proposal (other than
a confidentiality agreement permitted by Section 5.10(b)); provided, however,
that nothing in this Section 5.10(a) shall prohibit Company, the Company Board
or any Company Representatives from making any inquiries with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal solely for the purpose of clarifying such Acquisition
Proposal to enable the Company Board to make the determination described in
Section 5.10(b). Any violation of the foregoing restrictions by Company or any
Company Representative, whether or not such Company Representative is so
authorized and whether or not such Company Representative is purporting to act
on behalf of Company or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a breach of this
Agreement by Company. Company and Company Subsidiaries shall, and shall cause
each of the Company Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any and all existing discussions, negotiations, and communications
with any Persons with respect to any existing or potential Acquisition
Proposal.

(a) Notwithstanding Section 5.10(a) or any other provision of this Agreement,
at any time prior to obtaining the Requisite Company Shareholder Approval,
Company may take any of the actions described in Section 5.10(a) if, but only
if, (i) Company has received a bona fide unsolicited written Acquisition
Proposal that did not result from a breach of this Section 5.10; (ii) the
Company Board reasonably determines in good faith, after consultation with its
outside financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that (a) such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior
Proposal and (b) the failure to take such actions would be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; and (iii) prior to furnishing or
affording access to any information or data with respect to Company or any
Company Subsidiary or otherwise relating to an Acquisition Proposal, Company
receives from such Person a confidentiality agreement with terms no less
favorable to Company than those contained in the confidentiality agreement
with Parent (it being understood that nothing therein shall have the effect of
a standstill provision). Company shall promptly provide to Parent any non-
public information regarding Company or Company Subsidiaries provided to any
other Person which was not previously provided to Parent, such additional
information to be provided no later than the date of provision of such
information to such other party.

(b) Company shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours notify Parent in
writing if any proposals or offers are received by, any information is
requested from, or any negotiations or discussions are sought to be initiated
or continued with, Company or the Company Representatives, in each case in connection with any Acquisition Proposal, and
such notice shall indicate the name of the Person initiating such discussions
or negotiations or making such proposal, offer or information request and the
material terms and conditions of any proposals or offers (and, in the case of
written materials relating to such proposal, offer, information request,
negotiations or discussion, providing copies of such materials (including
e-mails or other electronic communications), except to the extent that such
materials constitute confidential information of the party making such offer
or proposal under an effective confidentiality agreement or any such
disclosure would jeopardize attorney-client privilege). Company agrees that it
shall keep Parent informed, on a reasonably current basis, of the status and
terms of any such proposal, offer, information request, negotiations or
discussions (including any amendments or modifications of any material terms
to such proposal, offer or request).

(c) Subject to Section 5.10(e), neither the Company Board nor any committee
thereof shall (i) withhold, withdraw, change, qualify, amend or modify, or
publicly propose to withdraw, change, qualify, amend or modify, in a manner
adverse in any respect to the interest of Parent, or take any other action or
make any other public statement inconsistent with, the Company Recommendation;
(ii) fail to publicly affirm the Company Recommendation within five (5)
Business Days following a request by Parent (or such fewer number of days as
remains prior to the Company Meeting); (iii) approve or recommend, or publicly
propose to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal; (iv) resolve to
take, or publicly announce an intention to take, any of the foregoing actions
(each of (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) a "Company Subsequent Determination"); or
(v) enter into (or cause Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into) any
letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or other
agreement (a) related to any Acquisition Transaction (other than a
confidentiality agreement entered into in accordance with the provisions of
Section 5.10(b)) or (b) requiring Company to abandon, terminate or fail to
consummate the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement.

(d) Notwithstanding Section 5.10(d) or any other provision of this Agreement,
prior to obtaining the Requisite Company Shareholder Approval, the Company
Board (or any committee thereof) may make a Company Subsequent Determination
after the fifth (5th) Business Day following Parent's receipt of a notice (the
"Notice of Determination") from Company informing Parent that the Company
Board (or such committee) has determined in good faith, after consultation
with outside legal counsel and its financial advisor, that an Acquisition
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and the failure to make a Company
Subsequent Recommendation with respect to such Superior Proposal would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law (it being
understood that the initial determination under this clause will not be
considered a Company Subsequent Determination), but only if: (i) the Notice of
Determination includes or is accompanied by the material terms and conditions
of such Superior Proposal and the identity of the Person making such Superior
Proposal, including copies of any proposed material agreements providing for
such Superior Proposal; (ii) during the five (5) Business Day period after
receipt of the Notice of Determination (the "Notice Period"), Company and the
Company Board shall have negotiated in good faith with Parent, to the extent
Parent desires to negotiate, to make such adjustments, modifications or
amendments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would enable
Company to proceed with the Company Recommendation without a Company
Subsequent Determination; provided, however, that Parent shall not have any
obligation to propose any adjustments, modifications or amendments to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, and (iii) at the end of the Notice Period, after taking into
account any such adjusted, modified or amended terms, if any, as may have been
irrevocably proposed by Parent in writing before expiration of the Notice
Period, the Company Board has again in good faith, after consultation with
outside legal counsel and its financial advisor, made the determination that
such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and the failure to
make a Company Subsequent Determination with respect to such Superior Proposal
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law. In the
event of any material revisions to an Acquisition Proposal that is the subject
of a Notice of Determination and that occur prior to a Company Subsequent
Recommendation, Company shall be required to deliver a new Notice of
Determination to Parent and again comply with the requirements of this Section
5.10(e), except that the Notice Period shall be reduced to three (3) Business
Days.

(e) Nothing contained in this Section 5.10 shall prohibit Company or the
Company Board from complying with Company's obligations contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or making a statement contemplated by Item
1012(a) of Regulation M-A or Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act, or from
issuing a "stop, look and listen" statement pending disclosure of its position
thereunder, or from making any other disclosure to Company's shareholders that
is required by applicable Law; provided, however, that any such disclosure
relating to an Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed a change in the Company
Recommendation unless the Company Board reaffirms the Company Recommendation
in such disclosure, in which case, for the avoidance of doubt, such disclosure
will not be considered a Company Subsequent Determination.

Section 5.11 Indemnification.

(a) For a period of six years from and after the Effective Time, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law and the articles of incorporation
and bylaws of Company in effect on the date of this Agreement, and in any
event subject to the provisions of Section 5.11(b), Parent shall (i) indemnify
and hold harmless the present and former directors and officers of Company and
Company Bank (the "Indemnified Parties") against all costs or expenses
(including reasonable attorney's fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages, or liabilities incurred in connection with any actual or threatened
Legal Proceeding arising out of actions or omissions of such Persons in the
course of performing their duties for Company or any Company Subsidiary
occurring at or before the Effective Time (including in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement) (each a "Claim"), and shall
promptly advance expenses to each Indemnified Party from time-to-time as
incurred in connection with a Claim, to the same extent as the Indemnified
Parties have the right to expense advancement pursuant to applicable Law the
articles of incorporation and bylaws of Company in effect on the date of this
Agreement; provided, that each Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced
provides a reasonable and customary undertaking to repay such advances, if it
is ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to indemnification.

(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this Section
5.11 shall promptly notify Parent upon learning of any Claim, provided, that
failure to so notify shall not affect the obligation of Parent under this Section 5.11, unless, and
only to the extent that, Parent is materially prejudiced in the defense of
such Claim as a consequence. In the event of any such Claim (whether asserted
or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time), (i) (A) Parent shall
have the right to assume the defense thereof and Parent shall not be liable to
such Indemnified Party for any legal expenses for other counsel or any other
expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with
the defense thereof, unless such Indemnified Party is advised in writing by
counsel that the defense of such Indemnified Party by Parent would create an
actual or potential conflict of interest (in which case, Parent shall not be
obligated to reimburse or indemnify any Indemnified Party for the expenses of
more than one separate counsel in addition to one local counsel in the
jurisdiction where defense of any Claim has been or is to be asserted (if the
Claim involves more than one Indemnified Party, Parent shall only be obligated
to pay for one separate counsel and one local counsel for all Indemnified
Parties)), and (B) such Indemnified Party will cooperate in the defense of any
such matter, (ii) Parent shall not be liable for any settlement effected
without its prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) and Parent shall not settle any Claim without such
Indemnified Party's prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed), and (iii) Parent shall have no obligation
hereunder to any Indemnified Party if such indemnification would be in
violation of any applicable federal or state banking Laws or regulations, or
in the event that a federal or state banking agency or a court of competent
jurisdiction shall determine that indemnification of an Indemnified Party in
the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable Laws, whether or
not related to banking Laws.

(c) Subject to the terms described in this Section 5.11(c), Parent shall (i)
maintain in effect for a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time,
Company's current directors' and officers' liability insurance policies
covering the Indemnified Parties, (ii) obtain, as of the Effective Time,
"tail" insurance policies with a claims period of six (6) years following the
Effective Time with at least the same coverage and amounts and containing
terms and conditions that are no less advantageous to the Indemnified Parties
as the policies currently provided by Company, or (iii) purchase and provide
for a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time, directors' and
officers' liability insurance policies from a carrier assigned a claims paying
ability rating by A.M. Best Company, Inc. of "A (Excellent)" or higher with at
least the same coverage and amounts and containing terms and conditions that
are no less advantageous to the Indemnified Parties as the policies currently
provided by Company, in each case with respect to claims arising out of or
relating to events which occurred before or at the Effective Time; provided,
however, that in no event shall Parent be required to expend per year pursuant
to this Section 5.11(c) more than one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the
annual cost currently expended by Company with respect to such insurance (the
"Maximum DandO Premium"); provided, further, that if the amount of the annual
premium necessary to maintain or procure such insurance coverage exceeds the
Maximum DandO Premium, Parent shall maintain or procure the most advantageous
policies of directors' and officers' insurance (or "tail" coverage obtainable
for a premium equal to the Maximum DandO Premium. In connection with the
foregoing, Company agrees that in order for Parent to fulfill its obligations
pursuant to this Section 5.11(c), Indemnified Parties may be required to
provide such insurer or substitute insurer with such reasonable and customary
representations as such insurer may request. (d) If, following the Effective Time, Parent or any of its successors and
assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any Person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger, or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of its property and
assets to any Person, then, in each such case, proper provision shall be made
so that the successors and assigns of Parent shall assume the obligations set
forth in this Section 5.11.

(e) These rights shall survive consummation of the Merger and are intended to
benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party. After the
Effective Time, the obligations of Parent under this Section 5.11 shall not be
terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified
Party unless the affected Indemnified Party shall have consented in writing to
such termination or modification. If any Indemnified Party makes any claim for
indemnification or advancement of expenses under this Section 5.11 that is
denied by Parent, and a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the
Indemnified Party is entitled to such indemnification or advancement of
expense, in whole or in part, then Parent or the Surviving Entity shall pay
such Indemnified Party's costs and expenses, including legal fees and
expenses, incurred in connection with enforcing such claim against Parent.

(f) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors' and officers' insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to
Company or any Company Subsidiary for any of their respective directors,
officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that the
indemnification provided for in this Section 5.11 is not prior to or in
substitution for any such claims under such policies.

(g) Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as requiring Parent Bank to
indemnify, hold harmless, release, guarantee the obligations of, or purchase
or acquire assets or liabilities of, Parent or any Affiliate of Parent.

(h) Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as requiring Company Bank to
indemnify, hold harmless, release, guarantee the obligations of, or purchase
or acquire assets or liabilities of, Company or any Affiliate of Company.

Section 5.12 Employees; Benefit Plans.

(a) With respect to any Parent Benefit Plan in which any employee of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary on the Closing Date (the "Continuing
Employees") will participate, Parent shall, or shall cause the Company to,
recognize, for vesting and eligibility purposes, all service of the Continuing
Employees with the Company or any Company Subsidiary (including any
predecessors thereof) as if such service were with Parent; provided, however,
such service shall not be recognized to the extent that (i) such recognition
would result in a duplication of benefits or (ii) such service was not
recognized under the corresponding Company Benefit Plan.

(b) For a period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the first
anniversary of the Closing Date, Parent shall provide each Continuing Employee
with an annual base salary or wage level, as applicable, at least equal to
that provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date, provided that such Continuing Employee
remains in the same position following the Closing Date.

(c) Parent shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to (i) waive or cause to
be waived any waiting periods, evidence of insurability requirements, or pre-
existing condition limitations and similar limitations with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to the Continuing Employees
and (ii) provide each Continuing Employee with full credit for any co-payments
and deductibles paid prior to the Closing Date in satisfying any applicable
deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under such group health plan.

(d) Parent shall provide, or shall cause the Company to provide, severance
benefits to any Continuing Employee whose employment is terminated following
the Closing Date with severance benefits that are at least as favorable as
those that would have been payable to a similarly situated employee of Parent.

(e) This Section 5.12 shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of
each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this Section 5.12,
express or implied, shall confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies
of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Section 5.12. Nothing
contained herein, express or implied, shall be construed to establish, amend
or modify any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement. The parties
hereto acknowledge and agree that the terms set forth in this Section 5.12
shall not create any right in any Employee or any other Person to any
continued employment with the Company or its Subsidiaries, Parent or any of
their respective Affiliates or compensation or benefits of any nature or kind
whatsoever.

(f) Parent and Company shall cooperate in good faith to mitigate the impact of
Section 280G of the Code on the Company. The determination as to whether and
to what extent any payments to the Company's "disqualified individuals" would
constitute an excess "parachute payment" as those terms are defined in Section
280G of the Code shall be made by Hunton Andrews Kurth LLP, taking into
account the value of any reasonable compensation for services to be rendered
by any such individual before or after the Closing Date, including any
agreement not to render services to competitors pursuant to any non-
competition provisions that may apply to any such individual to the extent
permitted by Section 280G of the Code and the regulations promulgated
thereunder, with review and approval of such calculations and determinations
by counsel for Parent. Company and Parent shall cooperate with the Hunton
Andrews Kurth LLP in connection with the preparation and issuance of the
determinations and calculations contemplated by this Section 5.12(f).

Section 5.13 Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b). Prior to the
Effective Time, Company and Parent shall take all commercially reasonable
steps as may be required to cause any dispositions of Company Stock or Company
Stock Awards and any acquisitions of Parent Common Stock resulting from the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each director or officer of
Company who, immediately following the Merger, will be officers or directors
of the Surviving Entity subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a)
of the Exchange Act, to be exempt from liability pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under
the Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. Section 5.14 Notification of Certain Changes. Parent and Company shall
promptly advise the other party of any change or event (a) having, or which
could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect or (b) which it
believes would, or which could reasonably be expected to, cause or constitute
a material breach of any of its or its Subsidiary bank's representations,
warranties or covenants contained herein, which breach could reasonably be
expected to give rise, individually or in the aggregate, to the failure of a
condition in Article 6 to be satisfied on the Closing Date, provided, that any
failure to give notice in accordance with the foregoing with respect to any
change or event shall not be deemed to constitute a violation of this Section
5.14, or otherwise constitute a breach of this Agreement by the party failing
to give such notice, in each case, unless the underlying change or event would
independently result in a failure of any of the conditions set forth in
Section 6.02 or Section 6.03 to be satisfied on the Closing Date.

Section 5.15 Transition; Informational Systems Conversion. From and after the
date hereof, each of Parent and Company shall use its Commercially Reasonable
Efforts to facilitate the integration of Company and Company Subsidiaries with
the business of Parent and Parent Subsidiaries following consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, and shall meet on a regular basis to discuss
and plan for the conversion of the data processing and related electronic
informational systems of Company and Company Subsidiaries (the "Informational
Systems Conversion") in such a manner reasonably sufficient to provide
reasonable assurances that a successful Informational Systems Conversion will
occur. The Informational Systems Conversion will occur, at such date as may be
specified by Parent, subject to any applicable Laws, including Laws regarding
the exchange of information and other Laws regarding competition. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Company shall, subject to any such
applicable Laws: (i) reasonably cooperate with Parent to establish a project
plan as specified by Parent to effectuate the Informational Systems
Conversion; (ii) use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to have Company's outside
contractors continue to support both the Informational Systems Conversion
effort and its ongoing needs until the Informational Systems Conversion can be
established; (iii) provide, or use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to obtain
from any outside contractors, all data or other files and layouts reasonably
requested by Parent for use in planning the Informational Systems Conversion,
as soon as reasonably practicable; (iv) provide reasonable access to Company's
personnel and facilities and its outside contractors' personnel and
facilities, to the extent necessary to enable the Informational Systems
Conversion effort to be completed on schedule; and (v) give notice of
termination, conditioned upon the completion of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, of the Contracts of outside data, item and other processing
contractors or other third-party vendors to which Company or any Company
Subsidiary is bound, if requested to do so by Parent, to the extent permitted
by such Contracts; provided, that Company shall not be required to take any
action under this Section 5.15 that, after consultation with Parent regarding
Company's concerns in the matter, is reasonably likely to prejudice or
adversely affect in any material respect its rights under any such Contracts
in the event the Closing does not occur. Company shall pay any reasonable out
of pocket expenses due third parties incurred in connection with the actions
described in this Section 5.15. Such access as contemplated by this Section
5.15 shall be conducted by Parent in a manner which does not adversely affect
the normal operations of Company or Company Bank and neither Company nor
Company Bank shall be required to provide access to or disclose information
(i) which would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of Company or Company
Bank or contravene any binding Contract entered into prior to the date of this
Agreement or any Law, Order or fiduciary duty, (ii) except as otherwise provided in this Agreement,
relating to an Acquisition Proposal, a Superior Proposal, a Company Subsequent
Determination or any matters related thereto, or (iii) except as otherwise
provided in this Agreement, related to Company's or Company Bank's directors',
officers', employees', accountants', counsels', advisors' (including
investment bankers), agents', or other representatives', consideration of, or
deliberations regarding, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 5.16 No Control of Other Party's Business. Nothing contained in this
Agreement shall give Parent, directly or indirectly, the right to control or
direct the operations of Company or Company Subsidiaries prior to the
Effective Time, and nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Company,
directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations of
Parent or Parent Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the
Effective Time, each of Company and Parent shall exercise, consistent with the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, control and supervision over its and
its Subsidiaries' respective operations.

Section 5.17 Environmental Matters.

(a) Phase I Assessments. For any Company Owned Property, any Company OREO
Property and any Company Leased Property which is identified by Parent within
fifteen (15) days following the date of this Agreement, Parent may, at its
sole cost and expense, obtain, within sixty (60) days after the date of such
notice, written reports of a Phase I ESA for each such property, prepared by
an environmental consultant experienced in performing Phase I ESAs of real
property ("Environmental Consultant") and acceptable to Company. Each Phase I
ESA shall be delivered in counterparts to Parent and Company. The
Environmental Consultant will include customary language allowing both Parent
and Company to rely upon its findings and conclusions. The Environmental
Consultant will provide a draft of any Phase I ESA to Company and Parent for
review and comment prior to the finalization of such report. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, except as set forth in this Section, neither Parent nor the
Environmental Consultant will conduct or cause to be conducted any invasive,
intrusive or destructive inspections or other sampling or testing on the
Company Owned Property or Company Leased Property, including, without
limitation, of the air, soil, soil gas, vapors, surface water, groundwater,
building materials or other environmental media, thereon.

(b) Phase II Assessments. In the event any Phase I ESA (including a Phase I
ESA that Company or any Company Subsidiary caused to be performed within one
(1) year prior to the date of this Agreement) discloses such property may be
impacted or have its use restricted by any Recognized Environmental Condition
or Historical Recognized Environmental Condition (as each term is defined by
ASTM E1527-13) for which Parent or Parent Subsidiaries would be liable and
that, in the good faith reasonable belief of Parent, would result in a
material liability to Company or any Company Subsidiary following the
Effective Time and as such warrants further review or investigation, Parent
shall reasonably promptly give notice of the same (a "Phase I Notice") to
Company no later than five (5) Business Days following Parent's receipt of the
relevant Phase I ESA. Company may then, in its sole and absolute discretion
and without any obligation whatsoever to do so, within an additional twenty
(20) day period, retain the Environmental Consultant to conduct a Phase II
environmental site assessment in accordance with ASTM Standard E1903-11
("Phase II ESA") of the relevant property or facility; provided, however, that such Phase
II ESA shall be completed, and a written report of the Phase II ESA prepared,
no later than sixty (60) days after Company receives from Parent the Phase I
Notice for the relevant property; and provided further, that with respect to
any Company Leased Property, Company will use Commercially Reasonable Efforts
to obtain the relevant property owner's consent for such Phase II ESA. Parent
acknowledges and understands that such consent may not be able to be obtained.
The scope of the Phase II ESA shall be mutually determined by Parent and
Company in their reasonable discretion after consultation with the other
party, and all reasonable costs and expenses associated with such Phase II ESA
testing and report shall be borne by Parent. Company shall provide copies of
the draft and final Phase II ESA reports, if any, to Parent promptly following
the receipt of any such report by Company.

(c) Remediation Estimates. In the event any Phase II ESA confirms the presence
of any environmental contamination, including, without limitation, a release
or threat or release from an abandoned underground storage tank or the
presence of other Hazardous Substances, in each case in concentrations above
applicable standards under applicable Environmental Laws, or if Company
chooses not to conduct Phase II ESA as reasonably requested by Parent pursuant
to Section 5.17(b), Parent may elect to require Company to obtain, prior to
the Closing Date and as soon as reasonably practical but in no event more than
sixty (60) days after Parent receives the relevant Phase I ESA or Phase II
ESA, and at Company's sole cost and expense, from the Environmental Consultant
or another nationally recognized contractor mutually acceptable to the
parties, a written good faith estimate of the minimum cost and expense
necessary to further investigate, remediate, cleanup, abate, restore and
otherwise address such Recognized Environmental Condition, Historical
Recognized Environmental Condition, or environmental contamination to the
extent required or allowed by and in accordance with Environmental Laws,
including the NMVRA, and, to the extent required, to the satisfaction of any
relevant Governmental Authority, assuming the continued residential,
commercial or industrial use of the relevant property and employing risk-based
remedial standards and institutional controls where applicable (a "Remediation
Estimate"). Company shall provide to Parent any Remediation Estimate requested
within five (5) business days of Company's receipt thereof. Company shall,
upon Parent's reasonable request, cause all Remediation Estimates to be
updated through the Closing Date.

(d) Remediation Adjustment and Termination. Should the sum of all Remediation
Estimates (to the extent the costs reflected in such estimates will or are
reasonably expected to be incurred by Company or any Company Subsidiary, and
taking into account any tax credits, deductions or benefits or insurance
coverage, in each case, that the parties agree is reasonably likely to be
available to Company or any Company Subsidiary in connection with the
incurrence of such costs) exceed $250,000 in the aggregate, the Aggregate Cash
Consideration shall be decreased by the amount by which the sum of all
Remediation Estimates exceeds $250,000 (such amount, the "Remediation
Adjustment"). Should the sum of all Remediation Estimates (to the extent the
costs reflected in such estimates will or are reasonably expected to be
incurred by Company or any Company Subsidiary, and taking into account any tax
credits, deductions or benefits or insurance coverage, in each case, that the
parties agree is reasonably likely to be available to Company or any Company
Subsidiary in connection with the incurrence of such costs) exceed $2,500,000
in the aggregate (the "Environmental Limit"), Parent may elect (a) to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01(j) or (b) to decrease the Aggregate Cash Consideration by the
Remediation Adjustment.

(e) Cooperation. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.17 to the
contrary, Company shall keep Parent reasonably apprised of all activities and
actions contemplated by this Section 5.17, and Company and Parent shall
cooperate fully with one another with respect to the matters required by this
Section 5.17.

(f) Prior Disclosure. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, all matters that have been previously disclosed by Company to
Parent shall be disregarded for purposes of, and shall not constitute any type
of exception to, this Section 5.17 and shall have no effect on the
determination of any Remediation Estimate.

Section 5.18 Certain Litigation. Company shall promptly advise Parent orally
and in writing of any actual or threatened Legal Proceeding against Company
and/or the members of the Company Board related to this Agreement or the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Company
shall: (i) permit Parent to review and discuss in advance, and consider in
good faith the views of Parent in connection with, any proposed written or
oral response to such Legal Proceeding; (ii) furnish Parent's outside legal
counsel with all non-privileged information and documents which outside
counsel may reasonably request in connection with such Legal Proceeding; (iii)
consult with Parent regarding the defense or settlement of any such Legal
Proceeding, give due consideration to Parent's advice with respect to such
Legal Proceeding and not settle any such Legal Proceeding prior to such
consultation and consideration; provided, however, that Company shall not
settle any such Legal Proceeding if such settlement requires the payment of
money damages of $50,000 or more, without the written consent of Parent (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) unless the payment of any
such damages by Company is reasonably expected by Company, following
consultation with outside counsel, to be fully covered (disregarding any
deductible to be paid by Company) under Company's existing director and
officer insurance policies, including any tail policy.

Section 5.19 Director Matters; Board Packages. Company shall use Commercially
Reasonable Efforts to cause to be delivered to Parent resignations of all the
directors of Company and Company Subsidiaries, such resignations to be
effective as of the Effective Time. Company shall distribute by overnight mail
with an electronic copy by email, a copy of any Company or Company Bank board
package, including the agenda, any draft minutes and any reports (including
any internal management financial control reports showing actual financial
performance against plan and previous period, and reports relating to
financial performance and risk management), to Parent at the same time in
which it distributes a copy of such package to the Company Board and board of
directors of Company Bank, as the case may be; provided, however, that Company
shall not be required to disclose to Parent any documents (a) which would
jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of Company or Company Bank or
contravene any binding Contract entered into prior to the date of this
Agreement or any Law, Order or fiduciary duty, (b) except as otherwise

Triggering VWAP, for each such share of Company Common Stock as such holder
would have received had the Exchange Ratio been adjusted in accordance with
clause (A). If Parent makes such election to reinstate the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, no termination will occur

Closing Date, the failure of the condition set forth in Section 6.03(b) to be
satisfied, and which breach is not cured within thirty (30) days after receipt
by Company of written notice specifying the nature of such breach and requesting that it be

(g) Delay. By either Parent or Company if the Merger shall not have been

Regulatory Approvals, the Expiration Date shall be automatically extended for
one additional three-month period.

(h) Company Failure to Recommend; Etc. In addition to and not in limitation of

available funds to an account specified by Parent in the event of any of the
following: (i) in the event Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to
Section 7.01(h) or Company terminates pursuant to Section 7.01(i), Company
shall pay Parent the Termination Fee within two (2) Business Days after

that after the date of this Agreement and prior to the termination of this
Agreement, an Acquisition Proposal shall have been made known to the Company
Board or has been made directly to Company shareholders generally (and not
withdrawn) and (a) thereafter this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or
Company pursuant to Section 7.01(d) or Section 7.01(g) (without the Requisite
Company Shareholder Approval having been obtained) or if this Agreement is
terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 7.01(e)(i) or Section 7.01(f)(i), and
(b) prior to the date that is twelve (12) months after the date of such
termination, Company enters into any agreement to consummate, or consummates
an Acquisition Transaction (and such Acquisition Transaction relates to the
same Acquisition Proposal as that referred to above), then Company shall, on
the earlier of the date it enters into such agreement and the date of
consummation of such transaction, pay Parent the Termination Fee, provided,
that for purposes of this Section 7.02(a), all references in the definition of
Acquisition Transaction to "20%" shall instead refer to "50%".

(b) The parties hereto agree and acknowledge that if Parent terminates this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01(e)(i) or Section 7.01(f)(i) by reason of
Company's or Company Bank's material breach of the provisions of this
Agreement contemplated by Section 7.01(e)(i) or Section 7.01(f)(i) that is not
timely cured as provided in such sections, the actual damages sustained by
Parent, including the expenses incurred by Parent preparatory to entering into
this Agreement and in connection with the performance of its obligations under
this Agreement, would be significant and difficult to ascertain, gauged by the
circumstances existing at the time this Agreement is executed, and that in
lieu of Parent being required to pursue its damage claims in costly litigation
proceedings in such event, the parties agree that Company shall pay a
reasonable estimate of the amount of such damages, which the parties agree is
the sum of $2,000,000 (the "Liquidated Damages Payment"), as liquidated
damages to Parent, which payment is not intended as a penalty, within two (2)
Business Days after Parent's notification of such termination. Any payment
made under this Section 7.01(b) shall reduce on a dollar-for-dollar basis any
payment that may be due under Section 7.01(a).

(c) The parties hereto agree and acknowledge that if Company terminates this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01(e)(ii) or Section 7.01(f)(ii) by reason of
Parent's or Parent Bank's material breach of the provisions of this Agreement
contemplated by Section 7.01(e)(ii) or Section 7.01(f)(ii) that is not timely
cured as provided in such sections, the actual damages sustained by Company,
including the expenses incurred by Company preparatory to entering into this
Agreement and in connection with the performance of its obligations under this
Agreement, would be significant and difficult to ascertain, gauged by the
circumstances existing at the time this Agreement is executed, and that in
lieu of Company being required to pursue its damage claims in costly
litigation proceedings in such event, the parties agree that Parent shall pay
$2,000,000, which the parties agree is the Liquidated Damages Payment, as
liquidated damages to Company, which payment is not intended as a penalty,
within two (2) Business Days after Company's notification of such termination. (d) Company and Parent each agree that the agreements contained in this
Section 7.02 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, neither party would not enter
into this Agreement; accordingly, if a party fails promptly to pay any amounts
due under this Section 7.02, such party shall pay interest on such amounts
from the date payment of such amounts were due to the date of actual payment
at the rate of interest equal to the sum of (i) the rate of interest published
from time to time in The Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition (or any
successor publication thereto), designated therein as the prime rate on the
date such payment was due, plus (ii) 200 basis points, together with the costs
and expenses of the other party (including reasonable legal fees and expenses)
reasonably incurred in connection with such suit.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
parties agree that if Company pays or causes to be paid to Parent the
Termination Fee in accordance with Section 7.02(a), or, if applicable, the
Liquidated Damages Payment in accordance with Section 7.02(b), none of
Company, Company Bank, or any successor in interest, Affiliate, shareholder,
director, officer, employee, agent, consultant or representative of Company or
Company Bank, will have any further obligations or liabilities to Parent or
Parent Bank with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the payment of such amounts shall be Parent's sole and
exclusive remedy against Company, Company Bank and their respective
Affiliates, representatives or successors in interest. For the avoidance of
doubt, the parties agree that the fee payable under Section 7.02(a) shall not
be required to be paid more than once. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, the parties agree that if Parent pays or
causes to be paid to Company the Liquidated Damages Payment in accordance with
Section 7.02(c), none of Parent, Parent Bank, or any successor in interest,
Affiliate, shareholder, director, officer, employee, agent, consultant or
representative of Parent or Parent Bank, will have any further obligations or
liabilities to Company with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the payment of such amounts shall be
Company's sole and exclusive remedy against Parent, Parent Bank and their
respective Affiliates, representatives or successors in interest.

Section 7.03 Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant
to Section 7.01, this Agreement shall become void and of no effect without
liability of any party (or any shareholder, director, officer, employee,
agent, consultant or representative of such party or any of its Affiliates) to
the other party hereto, except as provided in Section 7.02(d); provided, that
nothing contained in this Agreement shall limit either party's rights to
recover any liabilities or damages arising out of the other party's willful
breach of any provision of this Agreement. The provisions of this Section 7.03
and Sections 5.21, 7.02, 9.03 and 9.04 shall survive any termination hereof

Section 9.06 Entire Understanding; No Third Party Beneficiaries. This
Agreement represents the entire understanding of the parties hereto and
thereto with reference to the transactions contemplated hereby, and this
Agreement supersedes any and all other oral or written agreements heretofore
made. Except for the Indemnified Parties' rights under Section 5.11 and
shareholders of Company with respect to Article 2 and this Section 9.06,
Parent and Company hereby agree that their respective representations,
warranties and covenants set forth herein are solely for the benefit of the
other applicable parties hereto, in accordance with and subject to the terms
of this Agreement, and this Agreement is not intended to, and does not, confer
upon any Person (including any Person or employees who might be affected by
Section 5.12), other than the parties hereto, any rights or remedies
hereunder, including, the right to rely upon the representations and
warranties set forth herein. The representations and warranties in this
Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties hereto and are for
the sole benefit of the parties hereto. Consequently, Persons other than the
parties hereto may not rely upon the representations and warranties in this
Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date
of this Agreement or as of any other date.

Section 9.07 Severability. In the event that any one or more provisions of
this Agreement shall for any reason be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable
in any respect, by any court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity,
illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions of this
Agreement and the parties shall use their Commercially Reasonable Efforts to
substitute a valid, legal and enforceable provision which, insofar as
practical, implements the purposes and intents of this Agreement.

Section 9.08 Enforcement of the Agreement; Jurisdiction. The parties hereto
agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that the provisions
contained in this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the
parties shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to seek to enforce specifically the terms and provisions
thereof in the State of Delaware, this being in addition to any other remedy
to which they are entitled in equity. Each party agrees that it will not seek
and will agree to waive any requirement for the securing or posting of a bond
in connection with the other party's seeking or obtaining such injunctive
relief. In addition, each of the parties hereto (a) consents to submit itself
to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court located
in the State of Delaware in the event any dispute arises out of this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (b) agrees that it will
not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other
request for leave from any such court.

Section 9.09 Interpretation.

(a) When a reference is made in this Agreement to sections, exhibits or
schedules, such reference shall be to a section of, or exhibit or schedule to,
this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents and captions
and headings contained in this Agreement are included solely for convenience
of reference and shall be disregarded in the interpretation of this Agreement.
Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this
Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation." The parties acknowledge and agree that if an unreasonable
condition is imposed on a consent, such consent will be deemed to have been
withheld.

(b) The parties hereto have participated jointly in the negotiation and
drafting of this Agreement and the other agreements and documents contemplated
herein. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation
arises under any provision of this Agreement or any other agreement or
document contemplated herein, this Agreement and such other agreements or
documents shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties thereto, and
no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any
party by virtue of authorizing any of the provisions of this Agreement or any
other agreements or documents contemplated herein.

(c) Any reference contained in this Agreement to specific statutory or
regulatory provisions or to any specific Governmental Authority shall include
any rule or regulation promulgated thereunder and any successor statute or
regulation, or successor Governmental Authority, as the case may be. Unless
the context clearly indicates otherwise, the masculine, feminine, and neuter
genders will be deemed to be interchangeable, and the singular includes the
plural and vice versa.

(d) Unless otherwise specified, the references to "Section" and "Article" in
this Agreement are to the Sections and Articles of this Agreement. When used
in this Agreement, words such as "herein", "hereinafter", "hereof", "hereto",
and "hereunder" refer to this Agreement as a whole, unless the context clearly
requires otherwise. When used in this Agreement, references to (i) "in respect
of debt previously contracted" and similar phrases include actions taken in
respect thereof such as foreclosure and similar proceedings and arrangements
and (ii) "foreclosure" include other similar proceedings and arrangements
including a deed in lieu.

Section 9.10 Assignment. No party may assign either this Agreement or any of
its rights, interests or obligations hereunder without the prior written
approval of the other party, and any purported assignment in violation of this Section 9.10 shall be void. Subject
to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall
inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns.

Section 9.11 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed and delivered by
electronic data file and in one or more counterparts, all of which shall be
considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when one or
more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the
other party, it being understood that all parties need not sign the same
counterpart. Signatures delivered by electronic data file shall have the same
effect as originals.

Section 9.12 Disclosure Schedules. The Company Disclosure Schedule or the
Parent Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to be a part of this Agreement and
are fully incorporated into this Agreement by reference. Any reference in a
particular section or subsection of either the Company Disclosure Schedule or
the Parent Disclosure Schedule shall only be deemed to be reference to, an
exception to or modification of (or, as applicable, a disclosure for purposes
of) (i) the representations and warranties or covenants, as applicable, of the
relevant party that are contained in the corresponding section or subsection
of this Agreement and (ii) any other section or subsection of the Company
Disclosure Schedule or the Parent Disclosure Schedule, as applicable (and
accordingly any other representations, warranties or covenants of such party
contained in the corresponding section or subsection of this Agreement), but
only if the relevance of that reference as a modification of or exception to
(or a disclosure for purposes of) such representations, warranties and
covenants of the relevant party, whether or not an explicit cross-reference
appears, if the applicability of such reference to the other section or
subsection is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure. The mere
inclusion of an item in either the Company Disclosure Schedule or the Parent
Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a representation, warranty or covenant
shall not be deemed to be an admission or evidence that such item represents a
material exception or material fact, event or circumstance or that such item
has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

 FORM OF VOTING AGREEMENT



VOTING AGREEMENT

This VOTING AGREEMENT (this "Agreement"), dated as of November 1, 2018, is
made and entered into between the undersigned shareholder ("Shareholder") of
Trinity Capital Corporation, a New Mexico corporation (the "Company"), and
Enterprise Financial Services Corp, a Delaware corporation ("Parent").

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, the Company and
Parent will enter, into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (as the same may be
amended from time to time, the "Merger Agreement"), providing for, among other
things, the merger (the "Merger") of Company with and into Parent;

WHEREAS, as a condition to its willingness to enter into the Merger Agreement,
Parent has required that Shareholder execute and deliver this Agreement; and

WHEREAS, in order to induce Parent and as additional consideration to Parent
to enter into the Merger Agreement, Shareholder is willing to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements with respect to the
shares of voting common stock, no par value, of the Company ("Company Common
Stock") beneficially owned by Shareholder and set forth below Shareholder's
signature on the signature page hereto (the "Original Shares" and, together
with any additional shares of Company Common Stock acquired pursuant to
Section 8 hereof, the "Shares").

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and for other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt, sufficiency and adequacy of which are
hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

| 
---|--- 

1.

|

Definitions. For purposes of this Agreement, capitalized terms used and not
defined herein shall have the respective meanings ascribed to them in the
Merger Agreement. 

| 
---|--- 

2.

|

Representations of Shareholder. Shareholder represents and warrants to Parent
that: 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

(i) Shareholder owns beneficially (as such term is defined in Rule 13d-3 under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, referred to as the "Exchange
Act") all of the Original Shares free and clear of all Liens, and (ii) except
pursuant hereto, there are no options, warrants or other rights, agreements,
arrangements or commitments of any character to which Shareholder is a party
relating to the pledge, disposition or voting of any of the Original Shares
and there are no voting trusts or voting agreements with respect to the
Original Shares. 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

Shareholder does not beneficially own any shares of Company Common Stock other
than (i) the Original Shares and (ii) any restricted stock units or other
rights to acquire any additional shares of Company Common Stock, or any
security exercisable for or convertible into shares of Company Common Stock,
set forth on the signature page of this Agreement (collectively, "RSUs"). 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

Shareholder has full legal capacity (and, if applicable, corporate, limited
partnership or other organizational power and authority) to enter into,
execute and deliver this Agreement and to 

 perform fully Shareholder's obligations hereunder. This Agreement has been
duly and validly executed and delivered by Shareholder and constitutes the
legal, valid and binding obligation of Shareholder, enforceable against
Shareholder in accordance with its terms, except in each case as enforcement
may be limited general principles of equity, whether applied in a court of law
or court of equity, and by bankruptcy, insolvency and similar Laws affecting
creditor's rights and remedies generally.

| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

None of the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Shareholder, the
consummation by Shareholder of the transactions contemplated hereby or
compliance by Shareholder with any of the provisions hereof will conflict with
or result in a breach, or constitute a default (with or without notice of
lapse of time or both) under any provision of, any trust agreement, loan or
credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage, indenture, lease or other agreement,
instrument or Law applicable to Shareholder or to Shareholder's property or
assets. 

| 
---|--- 

(e)

|

No consent, approval or authorization of, or designation, declaration or
filing with, any Governmental Authority or other Person on the part of
Shareholder is required in connection with the valid execution and delivery of
this Agreement or Shareholder's performance of his, her or its obligations
hereunder. No consent of Shareholder's spouse is necessary under any
"community property" or other Laws in order for Shareholder to enter into and
perform his, her or its obligations under this Agreement. 

| 
---|--- 

3.

|

Agreement to Vote Shares. Except as expressly permitted under Section 5.10 of
the Merger Agreement, Shareholder agrees during the term of this Agreement to
vote the Shares, and to cause any holder of record of Shares to vote (or
execute a written consent or consents if shareholders of the Company are
requested to vote their shares through the execution of an action by written
consent in lieu of any such annual or special meeting of Shareholders of the
Company): 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

in favor of the Merger, the Merger Agreement and any other matter necessary
for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by Merger Agreement, at
every meeting (or in connection with any action by written consent) of the
shareholders of the Company at which such matters are considered, at every
adjournment or postponement thereof or in any other circumstances upon which
their vote or other approval is sought; and 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

against (i) any Superior Proposal or any action which is a component of any
Superior Proposal, (ii) any Acquisition Proposal, (iii) any action, proposal,
transaction or agreement which would reasonably be expected to result in a
breach of any covenant, representation or warranty or any other obligation or
agreement of the Company under the Merger Agreement or of Shareholder under
this Agreement, (iv) any action, proposal, transaction or agreement that would
reasonably be expected to impede, interfere with, delay, discourage, adversely
affect or inhibit the timely consummation of the Merger or the fulfillment of
the Company's conditions under the Merger Agreement and (v) a change in any
manner to the voting rights of any class of shares of the Company (including
any amendments to the articles of incorporation or bylaws of the Company). 

 | 
---|--- 

4.

|

Irrevocable Proxy. Shareholder hereby appoints Parent and any designee of
Parent, and each of them individually, its proxies and attorneys-in-fact, with
full power of substitution and resubstitution, to vote or act by written
consent during the term of this Agreement with respect to the Shares in
accordance with Section 3. This proxy and power of attorney is given to secure
the performance of the duties of Shareholder under this Agreement. Shareholder
shall take such further action or execute such other instruments as may be
necessary to effectuate the intent of this proxy. This proxy and power of
attorney granted by Shareholder shall be irrevocable during the term of this
Agreement, shall be deemed to be coupled with an interest sufficient in Law to
support an irrevocable proxy and shall revoke any and all prior proxies
granted by Shareholder with respect to the Shares. The power of attorney
granted by Shareholder herein is a durable power of attorney and shall survive
the dissolution, bankruptcy, death or incapacity of Shareholder. The proxy and
power of attorney granted hereunder shall terminate upon the termination of
this Agreement. 

| 
---|--- 

5.

|

No Solicitation of Transactions. Except as otherwise contemplated or permitted
by the Merger Agreement, and subject to Section 11 hereof, Shareholder will
not, directly or indirectly (a) solicit, initiate or take any other action to
facilitate or knowingly encourage any Acquisition Transaction, (b) maintain,
continue or participate in any discussions or negotiations with any Person or
entity in furtherance of, or furnish to any Person any information, with
respect to any Acquisition Transaction or (c) agree or authorize any Person to
do any of the foregoing. 

| 
---|--- 

6.

|

No Voting Trusts or Other Arrangement. Shareholder agrees that Shareholder
will not, and will not permit any Person under Shareholder's control to,
deposit any of the Shares in a voting trust, grant any proxies with respect to
the Shares or subject any of the Shares to any arrangement with respect to the
voting of the Shares other than agreements entered into with Parent.
Shareholder and Parent intend that this Agreement not constitute a voting
trust within the meaning of Section 53-11-34 NMSA 1978. 

| 
---|--- 

7.

|

Transfer and Encumbrance. Shareholder agrees that during the term of this
Agreement, Shareholder will not, directly or indirectly, transfer, sell,
offer, exchange, assign, pledge or otherwise dispose of or encumber
("Transfer") any of the Shares or enter into any contract, option or other
agreement with respect to, or consent to, a Transfer of, any of the Shares or
Shareholder's voting or economic interest therein. Any attempted Transfer of
Shares or any interest therein in violation of this Section 7 shall be null
and void. This Section 7 shall not prohibit a Transfer of the Shares by
Shareholder to any member of Shareholder's immediate family, or to a trust for
the benefit of Shareholder or any member of Shareholder's immediate family, or
upon the death of Shareholder; provided, that a Transfer referred to in this
sentence shall be permitted only if, as a precondition to such Transfer, the
transferee agrees in a writing, reasonably satisfactory in form and substance
to Parent, to be bound by all of the terms of this Agreement. Further, this
Section 7 shall not prohibit a surrender of Shares to the Company in
connection with the vesting or settlement of RSUs to satisfy any withholding
for the payment of taxes incurred in connection with such vesting or
settlement. 

| 
---|--- 

8.

|

Additional Shares. Shareholder agrees that all shares of Company Common Stock
that Shareholder purchases, acquires the right to vote or otherwise acquires
beneficial ownership (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) of
after the execution of this Agreement, including, without limitation, any
Company Common Stock issued upon the exercise or conversion of any RSU, shall
be subject to the terms of this Agreement and shall constitute Shares for all
purposes of this Agreement. 

 | 
---|--- 

9.

|

Waiver of Appraisal and Dissenters' Rights. Shareholder hereby waives, and
agrees not to assert or perfect, any rights of appraisal or rights to dissent
from the Merger that Shareholder may have by virtue of ownership of the
Shares. 

| 
---|--- 

10.

|

Termination. This Agreement shall terminate upon the earliest to occur of (a)
the Effective Time; (b) the date on which the Merger Agreement is terminated
in accordance with its terms; and (c) the date of any mutual modification,
waiver or amendment of the Merger Agreement that adversely affects the
consideration payable to Shareholders of the Company pursuant to the Merger
Agreement as in effect as of the date hereof. 

| 
---|--- 

11.

|

Shareholder Capacity. Shareholder is entering this Agreement in Shareholder's
capacity as the record or beneficial owner of the Shares, and not in his or
her capacity as a director or officer, as applicable, of the Company or any of
its subsidiaries. Nothing in this Agreement (a) will limit or affect any
actions or omissions taken by Shareholder in Shareholder's capacity as a
director or officer, including in exercising rights under the Merger
Agreement, and no such actions or omissions shall be deemed a breach of this
Agreement or (b) will be construed to prohibit, limit or restrict Shareholder
from exercising Shareholder's fiduciary duties as an officer or director to
the Company or its shareholders. 

| 
---|--- 

12.

|

No Ownership Interest. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to
vest in Parent any direct or indirect ownership or incidence of ownership of
or with respect to any of the Shares. All rights, ownership and economic
benefits of and relating to the Shares shall remain vested in and belong to
Shareholder, and Parent shall not have any authority to direct Shareholder in
the voting of the Shares, except as otherwise set forth herein. 

| 
---|--- 

13.

|

Specific Performance. Shareholder acknowledges that (a) irreparable damage
would occur in the event that Shareholder fails to comply with any of its
obligations contained in this Agreement, (b) every obligation of Shareholder
herein is material, and (c) in the event of such failure, Parent will not have
an adequate remedy at law or in damages. Accordingly, Shareholder agrees that
Parent shall be entitled to seek an injunction to prevent a breach of this
Agreement and to seek to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof,
in addition to any other remedy to which Parent is entitled at law or in
equity. Shareholder agrees that it will not seek and will agree to waive any
requirement for the securing or posting of a bond in connection with Parent
seeking or obtaining such injunctive relief. 

| 
---|--- 

14.

|

Entire Agreement. This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements, written or
oral, between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof
and, together with the Merger Agreement, contains the entire agreement between
the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may not
be amended or supplemented, and no provisions hereof may be modified or
waived, except by an instrument in writing signed by both of the parties
hereto. No waiver of any provisions hereof by either party shall be deemed a
waiver of any other provisions hereof by such party, nor shall any such waiver
be deemed a continuing waiver of any provision hereof by such party. 

| 
---|--- 

15.

|

hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been given (a) when

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

Each of the parties hereto irrevocably agrees that any legal action or

proceeding with respect to this Agreement and the rights and obligations
arising hereunder, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in
respect of this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising hereunder (i)
any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above
named courts for any reason other than the failure to serve process in
accordance with this Section 16(b), (ii) any claim that it or its property is
exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process
commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior
to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment
or otherwise), and (iii) to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable
Law, any claim that (x) the suit, action or proceeding in such court is
brought in an inconvenient forum, (y) the venue of such suit, action or
proceeding is improper, or (z) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof,
may not be enforced in or by such courts. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
any civil action, arbitration or other legal proceeding is brought for the

recover reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs and all expenses even if not
taxable as court costs (including without limitation, all such fees, taxes,
