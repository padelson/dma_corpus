ARTICLE II

Section 2.1 _Conversion of Company Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, the Company or
Merger Sub or any holder of any securities of any of the foregoing:

(a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock of Merger Sub,
par value $0.10 per share, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into and become one (1) validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation, par value $0.10 per share.

(b) _Cancellation of Company Shares_. Each outstanding or issued Applicable
Company Share that is owned by Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, or by any
Subsidiary of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, immediately prior to the
Effective Time (except to the extent held by any such person on behalf of a
third party) (collectively, the " _Excluded Shares_ "), shall automatically
be canceled and shall cease to exist, and no cash, stock or other
consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor.

 

(c) _Conversion of Company Shares_.

 

(i) Each Common Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares) shall
automatically be converted into the right to receive cash in an amount,
without interest, equal to the Per Common Share Merger Consideration.

 

(ii) If the Charter Amendment becomes effective in accordance with _Section
2.3_, each Preferred Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares) shall
automatically be converted into the right to receive cash in an amount,
without interest, equal to the Per Preferred Share Merger Consideration.

(iii) As of the Effective Time, all of the Applicable Company Shares
referenced in subsections (i) and (ii) above shall no longer be outstanding
and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder
of a certificate representing any such Company Shares (a " _Certificate_ ") or
book-entry Company Shares (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") (other than Dissenting
Shares and Excluded Shares) shall cease to have any rights with respect to
such Company Shares, except, in all cases, the right to receive, with respect
to the Common Shares, the Per Common Share Merger Consideration and, if the
Charter Amendment becomes effective in accordance with _Section 2.3_, with
respect to the Preferred Shares, the Per Preferred Share Merger Consideration,
in each case without interest and in accordance with _Section 2.2_, and each
Certificate formerly representing Dissenting Shares (and each Dissenting Share
that is a Book-Entry Share) shall thereafter only represent the right to
receive the payment to which reference is made in _Section 2.2(i)_. The
right of any holder of any Company Share to receive either the Per Common
Share Merger Consideration or the Per Preferred Share Merger Consideration, if
and as applicable, shall be subject to and reduced by the amount of any
withholding that is required under applicable Tax Law.

(d) _Company Stock Awards_. The Company and the Company Board shall take all
requisite action, including adopting resolutions as are necessary to effect
the transactions in this _Section 2.1(d)_, so that:

plan of the Company, including the Companys 1996

 



3 ##### Table of Contents

  

 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended and restated, and any other plan,
agreement or arrangement of the Company (collectively, the " _Company Equity
Plan_ "), shall, automatically and without any required action on the part of
the holder thereof, be canceled and, in exchange therefor, each holder of any
such canceled Company Stock Option shall be entitled to receive, in
consideration of the cancellation of such Company Stock Option and in
settlement therefor, a payment in cash of an amount, equal to the product of
(i) the total number of Common Shares subject to such cancelled Company Stock
Option assuming all performance-based vesting conditions have been
fully satisfied and (ii) the excess, if any, of (A) the Per Common Share
Merger Consideration over (B) the exercise price per Common Share subject to
such canceled Company Stock Option, without interest (such amounts payable
hereunder, the " _Option Payments_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) any
such Company Stock Option with respect to which the exercise price per Common
Share subject thereto is equal to or greater than the Per Common Share
Merger Consideration shall be canceled in exchange for no consideration and
(ii) such Option Payments may be reduced by the amount of any required Tax
withholdings. The Option Payments shall be made in accordance with _Section
2.2(j)_, including any vesting schedule referred to therein. From and after
the Effective Time, no Company Stock Option shall be exercisable and each
Company Stock Option shall only entitle the holder thereof to the payment
provided for in this  _Section 2.1(d)(i)_.

(ii) Each award of Common Shares outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time that is subject to forfeiture or other restrictions ("
_Restricted Shares_ ") granted pursuant to a Company Equity Plan shall, at the
Effective Time, automatically and without any required action on the part of
the holder thereof, be converted into the right to receive the Per Common
Share Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)_, with respect to the
number of Common Shares subject to such award assuming all performance-based
vesting conditions have been fully satisfied (such amounts payable hereunder,
the " _Restricted Share Payments_ "). The Restricted Share Payments shall be
made in accordance with _Section 2.2(j)_, including any vesting schedule
referred to therein.

 

(iii) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company and the Company Board
shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions that are necessary to (x)
effectuate the treatment of the Company Stock Options and Restricted Shares
(collectively, the " _Company Equity Awards_ ") pursuant to _Section
2.1(d)(i)_ through _Section 2.1(d)(ii)_ and (y) cause the Company Equity
Plan to terminate at or prior to the Effective Time. The Company and the
Company Board shall take all actions necessary to ensure that from and after
the Effective Time neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation will be
required to deliver Common Shares or other capital stock of the Company to any
Person pursuant to or in settlement of Company Equity Awards.

 

(e) _Anti-Dilution_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, if, from the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, the
number of outstanding Applicable Company Shares shall have been changed into a
different number of Applicable Company Shares or different class by reason of
any reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock
split), recapitalization, business combination, tender or exchange offer,
readjustment or other similar transaction, or a stock dividend or stock
distribution thereon shall be declared with a record date within said period,
the Per Common Share Merger Consideration and/or Per Preferred Share Merger
Consideration, as and if applicable, shall be appropriately adjusted to
provide the holders of such Applicable Company Shares the same economic effect
as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event; _provided_ , _however_
, that (i) in no event shall the aggregate amount payable by Parent pursuant
to _Section 2.2_ after giving effect to any such event exceed the amount that
would have been payable pursuant to  _Section 2.2_ had such event not
occurred and (ii) nothing in this _Section 2.1_ shall permit the Company to
take any action with respect to its securities that is expressly prohibited by
the terms of this Agreement.

 

Section 2.2 _Disposition of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Closing, Parent shall appoint a U.S.-based
nationally recognized bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the
Company to act as paying agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the payment of the
Per Common Share Merger Consideration to the holders of the Common Shares and,
if the Charter 

 



4 ##### Table of Contents

  

 Amendment becomes effective in accordance with _Section 2.3_, the Per
Preferred Share Merger Consideration to the holders of Preferred Shares.
Parent will enter into a paying agent agreement with the Paying Agent (the "
_Paying Agent Agreement_ ") on terms reasonably acceptable to the Company
prior to the Closing. Prior to or at the Closing, Parent shall deposit with
the Paying Agent cash in immediately available funds in the amount necessary
for payment in accordance with _Section 2.1_ and this _Section 2.2_ of the
aggregate Per Common Share Merger Consideration and, if the Charter Amendment
becomes effective in accordance with  _Section 2.3_, Per Preferred Share
Merger Consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement (such total deposited
cash being hereinafter referred to as the " _Payment Fund_ "). The Paying
Agent shall make payments of the Per Common Share Merger Consideration and,
if the Charter Amendment becomes effective in accordance with _Section 2.3_,
Per Preferred Share Merger Consideration out of the Payment Fund in accordance
with this Agreement and the Paying Agent Agreement. The Payment Fund shall
not be used for any other purpose.

(b) _Stock Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books
of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further
registration of transfers of Applicable Company Shares on the records of the
Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates
and Book-Entry Shares representing ownership of Applicable Company Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have rights
with respect to such Applicable Company Shares except as otherwise provided
for herein. From and after the Effective Time, any Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares presented to the Paying Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation for
any reason (other than Certificates or Book-Entry Shares representing Excluded
Shares and Dissenting Shares) shall be canceled and exchanged for the Per
Common Share Merger Consideration or, if the Charter Amendment becomes
effective in accordance with _Section 2.3_, Per Preferred Share Merger
Consideration, as applicable, payable in respect of such Applicable Company
Shares pursuant to this _Article II_.

(c) _Payment Procedures_.

 

(i) As soon as possible after the Effective Time (and in any event within
three (3) Business Days thereafter), Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate
or Certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding Applicable Company Shares (other than Excluded Shares
and Dissenting Shares) (A) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass to the Paying Agent, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Paying Agent, and which letter
shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company

(including all exhibits, amendments and supplements thereto) required to be
filed or furnished by them with or to the United States Securities and
Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") since January 1, 2012 (all such forms,
reports, statements, schedules, certificates, documents, exhibits and other
information incorporated therein, collectively, the " _Company SEC Documents_
"). As of their respective 

 



13 ##### Table of Contents

  

 dates, or, if amended, as of the date of the last such amendment, each of
the Company SEC Documents complied in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "
_Securities Act_ "), the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 ("
_SOX_ "), and the applicable rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, as
the case may be, each as in effect on the date so filed or furnished, as
applicable. Except to the extent that information in any Company SEC Document
has been amended, revised or superseded by a Company SEC Document subsequently
filed or furnished (any such amendment, revision or superseding document with
respect to a Company SEC Document filed or furnished prior to the date hereof
having also been filing or furnished prior to the date hereof), none of the
Company SEC Documents contains any untrue statement of a material fact or
omits to state a material fact required to be stated or incorporated by
reference therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. No
Subsidiary of the Company is subject to the periodic reporting requirements
of the Exchange Act and neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of the Company
is subject to the periodic reporting or corporate governance requirements of
any foreign Governmental Entity that performs a similar function to that of
the SEC or the requirements of any securities exchange or quotation system,
other than the Companys obligations with respect to the listing of its
Company Shares or the NASDAQ Capital Market.

 

(b) The consolidated annual and quarterly financial statements of the Company
and its Subsidiaries (including any related notes thereto) that are included
in the Company SEC Documents (i) comply as to form in all material respects
with the published rules and regulations of the SEC applicable thereto and
(ii) present fairly in all material respects the consolidated
financial position of the Company and its Subsidiaries at the respective
dates thereof and the consolidated results of their operations, cash flows and
changes in stockholders equity for the periods indicated therein (subject, in
the case of unaudited financial statements, to notes and normal year-end
audit adjustments), in each case in conformity with United States generally
accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") applied on a consistent basis
throughout the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes
thereto).

(c) The Company (i) maintains "disclosure controls and procedures"
and "internal control over financial reporting" (as such terms are defined in
paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act)
as required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act and (ii) as of the date of
this Agreement, has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to
the date of this Agreement, to the Companys outside auditors and the audit
committee of the Company Board (A) any significant deficiencies and
material weaknesses in the design or operation of such internal control over
financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect in any
material respect the Companys ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial information and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the
Companys internal control over financial reporting. Copies of all such
disclosures referred to in clause (ii) of the preceding sentence since
January 1, 2015 (or written summaries, in the case of disclosures made orally)
have been made available to Parent. The Companys "disclosure controls and
procedures" are reasonably designed to ensure that all material information
required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or
furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded and reported on a timely basis to
the individuals responsible for the preparation of the Companys filings with
the SEC. The Companys management has completed an assessment of the
effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting in
compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of SOX, and based on Company
managements most recent such assessment prior to the date of this Agreement,
the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the Company
concluded that such controls were effective. The Companys system of
"internal control over financial reporting" (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f)
under the Exchange Act) is reasonably sufficient in all material respects to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with GAAP and includes policies and procedures that (i) pertain to
the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, (ii) provide reasonable assurance that Company transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the consolidated financial
statements of the Company and its Subsidiaries in accordance with GAAP, and
that receipts and expenditures of the Company and its Subsidiaries are being
made only in accordance with the authorization of management, and (iii)
provide

 reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the assets of the Company and
its Subsidiaries that would materially affect the consolidated financial
statements of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

under the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of SOX and the
statements contained in such certifications are accurate; such certifications
contain no qualifications or exceptions to the matters certified therein and
have not been modified or withdrawn; and neither the Company nor any of its
officers has received written notice from any Governmental Entity questioning
or challenging the accuracy, completeness, form or manner of filing or
submission of such certifications.

knowledge of any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim,
whether written or oral, regarding the accounting or auditing practices,
procedures, methodologies or methods of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or their respective internal accounting controls, including any material
complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices and
(ii) no attorney representing the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether
or not employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported
evidence of a material violation of securities Laws, breach of fiduciary duty
or similar violation by the Company or its Subsidiaries or any of their
officers, directors, employees or agents to the Company Board or
any committee thereof or to any director or executive officer of the Company.

material respects with (i) the applicable provisions of SOX and (ii) the
applicable listing and corporate governance rules and regulations of the
NASDAQ Capital Market.

written comment letters from the staff of the SEC received from January 1,

date of this Agreement, (i) there are no outstanding or unresolved comments in
comment letters received from the SEC staff with respect to any Company SEC
Documents and (ii) to the knowledge of the Company, none of the Company SEC
Documents (other than any confidential treatment requests) is under ongoing
SEC review. As of the date of this Agreement, to the knowledge of the Company,
there are no SEC inquiries or investigations or other governmental inquiries
or investigations pending or threatened, in each case regarding any
accounting practices or compliance with the Exchange Act, Securities Act or
other securities laws of the Company or its Subsidiaries.

applicable Law, and will not, on the date the Proxy Statement is first mailed
to holders of Company Shares or at the time of the Company Stockholders
Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact, or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein not misleading at the time and in light of the
circumstances under which such statement is made, except that no
representation or warranty is made by the Company with respect to statements
made or incorporated by reference therein based on information supplied by
Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion or incorporation by reference therein.

a Superior Proposal and, (z) the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside counsel) that failure to take an action described in

38 ##### Table of Contents

  

 Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with the Company Boards
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, the Company Board may, in connection
with such Intervening Event, prior to obtaining the Company Merger Approval,
make an Adverse Recommendation Change, _provided_ that the Company has first
complied with the provisions of _Section 5.3(f)_ in connection with such
Acquisition Proposal or Intervening Event, as applicable.

_clause (i)_ or _clause (ii)_ of _Section 5.3(e)(1)_ or _Section

that an Intervening Event has occurred, as applicable, and (B) in the case of
(1) a Superior Proposal, (x) specify the material terms and conditions of
such Acquisition Proposal, (y) identify the Person making such Superior
Proposal, and (z) enclose the most recent draft of any agreements intended to
be entered into with the Person making or providing such Superior Proposal
(or any Affiliate of such Person), or (2) an Intervening Event, provide a
reasonably detailed description of the Intervening Event;

 

(ii) caused the Company and its Representatives to negotiate, to the extent
Parent has requested that the Company negotiate, during such three (3)
Business Day period following delivery of the Notice of Superior Proposal or
Intervening Event (the " _Notice Period_ "), in good faith with Parent

in response to such Superior Proposal or Intervening Event, as applicable; and

(iii) after complying with  _clauses (i)_ and _(ii)_ of this _Section
5.3(f)_, in the case of a Superior Proposal, determined that such Acquisition
Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal, and that in the case of
a Superior Proposal or Intervening Event, the failure to take an action set
forth in _Section 5.3(e)_ continues to be inconsistent with the directors
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, in each case after giving due
consideration to any changes proposed to be made to this Agreement by Parent
in a signed writing that is binding and irrevocable;

_provided, however_ , that if during the Notice Period any revisions are made
to the Superior Proposal that is the subject of such Notice of Superior
Proposal and such revisions are material (it being understood and agreed that
any change to consideration with respect to such proposal is material), the
Company shall deliver to Parent a new notice (" _Superior Proposal Change
Notice_ ") describing such material revisions (and providing copies of the
most recent draft of any agreements implementing such material revisions
proposed to be entered into between the Company and the Person making or
providing such Superior Proposal (or any Affiliate of such Person)) and shall
comply with the requirements of _clause (ii)_ and _clause (iii)_ of this
_Section 5.3(f)_ with respect to such Superior Proposal as so revised
(substituting, for purposes of this proviso, the longer of (x) the time
remaining with respect to the original three (3) Business Day Notice Period
in respect of such Superior Proposal and (y) two (2) Business Days following
delivery by the Company of the Superior Proposal Change Notice for the
reference to "three (3) Business Days" in Section 5.3(f)(ii)).

(g) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.3_ shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board from complying with its disclosure obligations under United
States federal or state Law with regard to an Acquisition Proposal, including
(i) taking and disclosing a position contemplated by Item 1012(a) of
Regulation M-A, Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or Rule 14d-9 under the
Exchange Act or (ii) making any "stop, look and listen" communication to the
stockholders of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act;
_provided_ , however, that neither the Company nor the Company Board (or any
committee thereof) may effect an Adverse Recommendation Change except in
compliance with Section 5.3(e) and Section 5.3(f).

to the Company and its Subsidiaries (taken as a whole) first arising after the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Company Merger
Approval and that was not known to or reasonably foreseeable by the Company

SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or for
additional information and shall supply each other with copies of all
correspondence between such or any of its Representatives, on the one hand,
and the SEC or its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy
Statement or the Merger or the Charter Amendment. If the Company does receive
comments from the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement, the Company shall
use its reasonable best efforts (with the reasonable assistance of Parent) to
promptly provide responses to the SEC with respect to any comments received
on the Proxy Statement from the SEC and to have the Proxy Statement cleared by
the SEC as soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement.

 

(b) The Company and Parent each agrees, as to itself and its respective
Subsidiaries, that none of the information supplied or to be supplied by it
or its Subsidiaries for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy
Statement or any amendment or supplement thereto will, at the date of mailing
to stockholders and at the time of the meeting of stockholders of the Company
to be held in connection with the Merger or the Charter Amendment, contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not

any event occurs with respect to the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, Parent
or Merger Sub, or any change occurs with respect to other information to be
included in the Proxy Statement, which is required to be described in an
amendment of, or a supplement to, the Proxy Statement, or the Company or
Parent should otherwise discover any information relating to the Company
or Parent (or any of their respective Affiliates, directors, officers or
shareholders) that is required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement
to the Proxy Statement so that it would not include any misstatement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,

notify the other party of such event, change or discovery, and the Company
shall promptly file, with Parents cooperation, any necessary amendment or
supplement to the Proxy Statement. The Company will also advise Parent,
promptly after it receives notice thereof, of any request by the SEC for
amendment of the Proxy Statement.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to filing or mailing the Proxy
Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any
written comments of the SEC with respect thereto, the Company shall (i)
provide Parent an opportunity to review and comment on such document or
response, and (ii) consider in good faith all reasonable comments proposed by
Parent.

(d) The Company shall, as soon as reasonably practicable following the date of
SEC Clearance of the Proxy Statement, duly call, give notice of, convene and
hold a meeting of the holders of Company Shares (the

 " _Company Stockholders Meeting_ ") for the purpose of seeking the Company
Stockholder Approvals. The notice of such Company Stockholders Meeting shall
state that a resolution to adopt this Agreement will be considered at the
Company Stockholders Meeting. Unless the Company Board has effected an Adverse
Recommendation Change in accordance with _Section 5.3(e)_, (x) the Company
Board shall include the Company Determination and the Company Recommendation
in the Proxy Statement and (y) the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to solicit the Company Stockholder Approvals. The Company shall not
include in the Proxy Statement any proposal to vote upon or consider any
Acquisition Proposal (other than this Agreement and the Merger and the Charter
Amendment). Unless the Company Board has effected an Adverse Recommendation
Change in accordance with Section 5.3(e), the Company shall convene and hold
the Company Stockholders Meeting within twenty-five (25) Business Days
following SEC Clearance and shall not postpone or adjourn the Company
Stockholders Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent; provided,
that the Company may postpone or adjourn the meeting (i) to the extent
required by the SEC or the order of a court of competent jurisdiction, (ii) to
the extent otherwise required by Law or to allow reasonable additional time
for any supplemental or amended disclosure if the Company Board has
determined in good faith after consultation with outside counsel that the
failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law and then only for the minimum time as the Company Board
has determined in good faith after consultation with outside counsel is
reasonably necessary to give the stockholders of the Company the required time
to evaluate any applicable information or disclosure ( _provided_ , that this
_section (ii)_ shall not be applicable to disclosure related to or arising
from any of the matters set forth in _section (iii)_ ), or (iii) for not more
than seven (7) days (A) in the event of the failure of a quorum to be present
on the date scheduled for such meeting or (B) if the Company determines in
good faith that a postponement or adjournment of the Company Stockholders
Meeting is necessary or appropriate in order to obtain sufficient votes
to obtain the Company Stockholder Approvals.

Section 5.5 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

 

(a) From the date hereof to the Effective Time or the earlier termination of
this Agreement, subject to applicable Law and upon reasonable prior notice
(and solely to the extent not unreasonably disruptive to the business,
employees or management of any Acquired Company), the Company shall, and shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries to, and use its reasonable best efforts to
cause its Representatives to, afford to Parent, Merger Sub and their
respective Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours to
the Companys and its Subsidiaries officers, employees, properties, offices,
other facilities and books and records, and shall make available to Parent,
Merger Sub and their respective Representatives all financial, operating and
other data and information as Parent, Merger Sub and their respective
Representatives shall reasonably request,  _provided_ that the foregoing
shall not require the Company or its Subsidiaries (i) to permit any access or
inspection, or to disclose any information, that in the reasonable judgment of
the Company would result in the disclosure of any trade secrets of third
parties or (provided that the Company has used commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain the consent of such third party) violate any of its obligations with
respect to confidentiality owed to third parties, (ii) to disclose any
privileged information of it or any of its Subsidiaries, or (iii) allow any
environmental testing or sampling. All requests for access or information made
pursuant to this _Section 5.5_ shall be directed to the executive officer or
other Person designated by the Company. All such information shall be governed
by the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

(b) Each of Parent and Merger Sub will hold and treat and will cause its
Representatives to hold and treat in confidence all documents and information
concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries made available to Parent or Merger
Sub in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in
accordance with the Non Disclosure Agreement between the Company and Parent
dated December 2, 2016 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ") which
Confidentiality Agreement shall, subject to _Section 8.5_, remain in full
force and effect in accordance with its terms.

 

Section 5.6 _Further Action; Efforts_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each Party will
cooperate with each other Party and use (and cause their
respective Subsidiaries to use) their reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken,

 



42 ##### Table of Contents

  

 all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable Law to consummate the Merger, the Charter Amendment
and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as soon as reasonably
practicable. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each Party
hereto agrees (i) to make, if required, appropriate filings under any
Antitrust Law as promptly as reasonably practicable, and (ii) to reasonably
promptly provide to each and every federal, state, local or foreign court or
Governmental Entity with jurisdiction over enforcement of any applicable
Antitrust Law (" _Government Antitrust Entity_ ") all non-privileged
information and documents requested by any Government Antitrust Entity or that
are necessary, proper or advisable to permit the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(b) Each of Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the
other hand, shall, in connection with the efforts referenced in  _Section
5.6(a)_ to obtain all requisite approvals and authorizations for the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any Antitrust Law, use its
reasonable best efforts to (i) reasonably cooperate in all respects with each
other in connection with any filing or submission to and in connection with
any investigation or other inquiry by a Governmental Entity, (ii) keep the
other Party reasonably informed of the status of any notice, approval,
investigation or inquiry under Antitrust Law, or any other material
investigation or other inquiry by a Governmental Entity, relating to the
completion of the Merger or the Charter Amendment, including promptly
forwarding to the other Party any notices or any other communication received
by any of such Persons to it or its Subsidiary (or the Representatives of
either of them) from, or given by such Party to any U.S. or foreign
Governmental Entity, in each case regarding any of the
transactions contemplated hereby and, (iii) permit the other Party a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any substantive written
communication to be given to a Governmental Entity in connection with the
matters that are the subject of this Agreement and to have its comments
considered in good faith. Neither the Company nor Parent shall permit any of
its officers or any other Representatives to participate in any meeting or
substantive telephone discussion with any Governmental Entity in respect of
any filings, investigation or other inquiry with respect to the Merger or the
Charter Amendment or transactions contemplated by this Agreement unless to the
extent practicable (i) it consults with the other Party in advance and (ii)
to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, gives the other Party the
opportunity to attend and participate in such meeting or substantive telephone
discussion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company and Parent may, as
each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively
sensitive material provided to the other side under this _Section 5.6(b)_ as
" _Antitrust Counsel Only Material_." Such materials and the
information contained therein shall be given only to the outside counsel of
the recipient dealing with Antitrust Law matters, and will not be disclosed by
such outside counsel to employees, officers, directors or consultants of the
recipient or any of its Affiliates unless express permission is obtained in
advance from the source of the materials (the Company or Parent, as the case
may be) or its legal counsel. Each of the Company and Parent shall cause its
respective counsel regarding Antitrust Law to comply with this _Section
5.6(b)_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 5.6(b)_,
materials provided to the other Party or its counsel may be redacted to remove
references concerning the valuation of the Company and privileged
communications.

(c) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, without
limiting the generality of the other undertakings pursuant to _Section
5.6(a)_ and _Section 5.6(b)_, but subject to _Section 5.6(d)_, each of the
Company (in the case of _Section 5.6(c)(ii)_ set forth below) and Parent
(in all cases set forth below) agree to take or cause to be taken the
following actions:

(i) the prompt use of its reasonable best efforts to avoid the entry of any
permanent, preliminary or temporary injunction or other order, decree,
decision, determination or judgment under Antitrust Laws that would delay,
restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the defense through
litigation on the merits of any claim asserted in any court, agency or other
proceeding by any Person under Antitrust Laws, including any Governmental
Entity, seeking to delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit
consummation of such transactions; and

(ii) the prompt use of its reasonable best efforts to take, in the event that
any permanent, preliminary or temporary injunction, decision, order, judgment,
determination or decree under Antitrust Laws is entered, issued or enacted, or
becomes reasonably foreseeable to be entered, issued or enacted, in any
proceeding,

 



43 ##### Table of Contents

  

 review or inquiry of any kind that would make consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement unlawful or that would delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or
otherwise prohibit consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, any and all steps (including the appeal thereof, the posting of a
bond or the taking of the steps contemplated by this clause  _(ii)_ of
paragraph (c)) necessary to resist, vacate, modify, reverse, suspend, prevent,
eliminate, avoid or remove such actual, anticipated or threatened injunction,
decision, order, judgment, determination, decree or enactment so as to permit
such consummation on a schedule as close as possible to that contemplated by
this Agreement.

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, neither
Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be obligated, in connection with any
Antitrust Law (including in connection with any Action arising thereunder) or
by any Government Antitrust Entity, to (i) proffer to, agree to or become
subject to any order, judgment or decree to, sell, license or dispose of or
hold separate, before or after the Closing, any assets, businesses, product
lines or interest in any assets or businesses of Parent or any of
its Affiliates or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or to consent to
any sale, license, or disposition, or agreement to sell, license or dispose,
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, of any of their assets or
businesses or product lines, (ii) proffer to, agree to, or become subject to
any order, judgment or decree to make or accept, any changes, modifications,
limitations or restrictions in the operations of any assets or businesses of
Parent or the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries, or (iii)
proffer to or agree to any new concession, accommodation or liability;
_provided_ that, Parent shall be required to consent to the sale, license,
disposition, holding separate of, or an agreement to sell, license, dispose
of or hold separate, assets of the Company and the Companys Subsidiaries or
any changes, modifications, limitations or restrictions in the operations of
any assets or businesses of the Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries
or any concession, accommodation or liability, solely with respect to the
assets, businesses or product lines (or interests therein), or operations, of
the Company and its Subsidiaries (but not, for the avoidance of doubt, Parent
or its Subsidiaries (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries)), to the
extent that (A) such sale, license, disposition, holding separate, change,
modification, limitation, restriction, concession, accommodation or other
matter or agreement to sell, license, dispose of, hold separate, modify,
limit, restrict, make a concession or accommodation or incur a liability, or
other matter, is required by a Government Antitrust Entity in order to obtain
any consent or approval referred to in  _Section 6.1(b)_ and (B) such sale,
license, disposition, holding separate or agreement to sell, license, dispose
of, hold separate, change, modification, limitation, restriction, concession,
accommodation, liability or other matter (or agreement to do any of the
foregoing), taken together with all other such sales, licenses, dispositions,
holdings separate, changes, modifications, limitations, restrictions,
concessions, accommodations, liabilities or other matters (and agreements to
do any of the foregoing) Parent and its Subsidiaries have agreed or become
subject to pursuant to this proviso, would not materially diminish the value
of the Acquired Companies taken as a whole. Neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries shall proffer to, agree to or become subject to any of the
items set forth in clauses (i), (ii), and (iii) of the preceding sentence
without the prior written consent of Parent, and none of the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries shall be required to agree to any of the items set forth
in clauses (i), (ii), and (iii) of the preceding sentence (or contemplated by
the proviso thereof) that is not conditioned on the occurrence of the
Effective Time.

 

(e) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Antitrust Law_ " means the Sherman Act,
as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as
amended and all other Laws that are designed or intended to prohibit, restrict
or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or
restraint of trade or lessening of competition through merger or acquisition.

(f) In the event that Parent notifies the Company at least ten (10) Business
Days prior to the Effective Time that Parent has determined to repay,
effective at or after the Effective Time, all amounts outstanding under the
Credit Agreement or other outstanding indebtedness for borrowed money of any
of the Acquired Companies, the Company shall, at Parents request, and sole
cost, use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain customary payoff letters
and instruments of discharge to be delivered at, and effective at, the
Effective Time, providing for

 



44 ##### Table of Contents

  

 the payoff, discharge and termination in full of all obligations under, and
the release of all Liens and pledges of collateral securing obligations made
in connection with such Credit Agreement or other indebtedness for borrowed
money. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 5.6(f)_,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor any of their
Representatives, (i) shall be obligated to pay, repay, prepay or otherwise
retire any amounts outstanding under (or otherwise make any payment in
connection with) such Credit Agreement or other indebtedness for borrowed
money unless (x) the Company has received from Parent funds to pay in full
the payoff amount for such Credit Agreement or other indebtedness for
borrowed money and any fees or other amounts payable to the lenders or their
agents thereunder in connection with the matters contemplated by this _Section
5.6(f)_ and (y) to the extent required by the lenders or their agents under
the such Credit Agreement or other indebtedness for borrowed money pursuant to
the terms thereof, Parent has agreed to and has provided backstop letters of
credit or cash collateralized any existing letters of credit and guarantees
and hedging arrangements and other bank products thereunder in a manner
satisfactory to the lenders under the Credit Agreement or such other
indebtedness for borrowed money, to the extent applicable, or (ii) (without
limiting clause (i)) shall be required to enter into any definitive agreement
or have any liability or obligation under any certificate, document,
instrument, credit agreement or any related document or any other agreement
or document related to the retirement, payment, repayment or prepayment of
amounts outstanding under the such Credit Agreement or other indebtedness for
borrowed money, in each case that is not contingent upon the Effective Time
having occurred. Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its
Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives from and against any
damages, losses, costs, or expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred by
any of them as a result of or in connection with their performance under this
_Section 5.6(f)_.

(g) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company will
use its (and cause its Subsidiaries to use their) reasonable best efforts to
obtain all necessary consents, approvals or waivers in connection with the
Merger, the Charter Amendment and the transactions contemplated hereby
from third parties in connection with any Contracts to which any Acquired
Company is party or bound or any Permits necessary for it to own, lease,
operate or use its properties and to carry on its businesses as now conducted.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall require
Parent, any Acquired Company or Merger Sub to, and no Acquired Company shall
without the prior written consent of Parent, proffer or agree to any
concession or additional liability with any Contract counterparty or any of
its Affiliates in order to obtain any consent sought under any Contract.

 

Section 5.7 _Employee Benefits Matters_.

 

(a) During the period commencing as the Effective Time and ending on the
earlier of the first anniversary of the Closing Date or December 31, 2018
(the " _Continuation Period_ "), Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, provide each individual who is employed by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time and who remains
employed thereafter by the Surviving Corporation, Parent or any of their
Subsidiaries (each, a " _Continuing Employee_ ") with (i) at least the same
base salary, wage rate and cash incentive compensation opportunity as the
base salary, wage rate and cash incentive compensation opportunity provided to
each such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii)
employee benefits which are no less favorable in the aggregate (including
with respect to the proportion of employee cost) than the employee benefits
(excluding long term equity incentive opportunities and any defined benefit
pension plan) provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and (iii) long-term equity incentive opportunities that are
no less favorable than those provided to similarly situated employees of
Parent or its Subsidiaries. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
during the Continuation Period, Parent shall provide, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries to provide,
severance payments and benefits to each Continuing Employee whose employment
is terminated during such period that are no less favorable than the
severance payments and benefits that such Continuing Employee is eligible to
receive under any applicable severance plan, policy, practice or arrangement
sponsored or maintained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
in accordance with the terms of such arrangement as in effect immediately
prior to the date of this Agreement or, if greater, the severance payments and
benefits that are provided to similarly situated employees of Parent and its
Subsidiaries at the time of such termination.

 



45 ##### Table of Contents

  

(b) Following the Effective Time, Parent shall give each Continuing Employee
full credit for prior service with the Company or its Subsidiaries to the
extent such service would be recognized if it had been performed as an
employee of Parent for all purposes (including purposes of vesting,
eligibility to participate and level of benefits but not for any purpose with
respect to defined benefit pension plan or other plan providing for post-
employment benefits) under any Parent Employee Plan providing benefits to any
Continuing Employee after the Closing Date except where such credit would
result in a duplication of benefits. For the avoidance of doubt, no Continuing
Employee shall be retroactively eligible for any Parent Employee Plan,
including any such Parent Employee Plan that was frozen prior to the Effective
Time. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i)
each Continuing Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without
any waiting time, in any and all Parent Employee Plans (other than any defined
benefit pension plan) to the extent coverage under such plans is replacing
comparable coverage under a Company Plan in which such Continuing Employee
participated immediately before the Closing Date (such plans, collectively,
the " _Old Plans_ ") and (ii) for purposes of each Parent Employee Plan
providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any
Continuing Employee, Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause (x) all pre-existing condition
exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such Parent Employee Plan to
be waived for such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents, to
the extent such conditions were inapplicable or waived under the comparable
Old Plans of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in which such Continuing
Employee participated immediately prior to the Closing Date and (y) eligible
expenses incurred by any Continuing Employee and his or her
covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending
on the date such Continuing Employees participation in the corresponding
Parent Employee Plan begins to be taken into account under such Parent
Employee Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and
maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Continuing Employee and
his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts
had been paid in accordance with such Parent Employee Plan. For purposes of
this Agreement, the term " _Parent Employee Plan_ " means any "employee
pension benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA), "employee welfare
benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA), and any other formal
written plan or policy under which service with Parent is relevant to
eligibility, vesting and/or level of benefits, for the benefit of, or relating
to, the current employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries and with respect to
which eligibility has not been frozen.

(c) The Company shall take (or cause to be taken) all actions necessary or
appropriate to terminate, effective no later than the day immediately
preceding the Closing Date : (a) any Company Plan that contains a cash or
deferred arrangement intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code
(each, a " _Company Qualified Plan_ "); and (b) any Company Plan set forth on
_Section 5.7(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, unless Parent, in its sole
and absolute discretion, agrees to sponsor and maintain any such
Company Plans by providing the Company with written notice of such election
at least five (5) days before the Effective Time. Unless Parent so provides
notice to the Company, the Company shall deliver to Parent, prior to the
Closing Date, evidence that the Company Board has validly adopted resolutions
to terminate such Company Plans (the form and substance of which resolutions
shall be subject to review and approval of Parent, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed), effective no later than the date
immediately preceding the Closing Date. Prior to the Closing Date and
thereafter (as applicable), the Company and Parent shall take any and all
actions as may be required, including amendments to the Parent 401(k) Plan
(the " _Parent Qualified Plan_ "), to permit each Continuing Employee to make
rollover contributions of "eligible rollover distributions" (within the
meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code, but excluding any plan loans) in
an amount equal to the eligible rollover distribution portion of the account
balance distributable to such Continuing Employee from such Company Qualified
Plan to the corresponding Parent Qualified Plan; _provided_ , _however_  that
the Parent Qualified Plan will not be required to accept rollovers of Roth
contributions that were made to a Company Qualified Plan pursuant to Section
402A of the Code. If the Company Qualified Plan is terminated as described
herein, the Continuing Employee shall be eligible immediately upon the
Closing Date to commence participation in a Parent Qualified Plan.

(d) Without limiting the generality of _Section 5.7(a)_ or the actions
contemplated in _Section 5.7(c)_, from and after the Effective Time, Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor, in 

 



46 ##### Table of Contents

  

 accordance with their terms, all Company Plans set forth in _Section
3.11(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter; _provided_ , that nothing herein
shall prevent the Surviving Corporation from amending or terminating any such
Company Plan in accordance with its terms. Parent and the Company hereby agree
that the occurrence of the Closing shall constitute a "change in control" or
"change of control" (or similar term) of the Company under the terms of the
Company Plans, as applicable.

(e) Nothing contained herein shall be construed as requiring, and the Company
shall take no action that would have the effect of requiring, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation to continue any specific employee benefit plans or to
continue the employment of any specific person. The provisions of this 
_Section 5.7_ are for the sole benefit of the parties to this Agreement and
nothing herein, expressed or implied, is intended or shall be construed to (i)
constitute an amendment to any of the compensation and benefits
plans maintained for or provided to Continuing Employees prior to or
following the Effective Time, (ii) impede or limit Parent, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates from amending or terminating
any Company Plan following the Effective Time, or (iii) confer upon or give
to any Person (including for the avoidance of doubt any current or former
employees, directors, or independent contractors of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or on or after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation or
any of its Subsidiaries), other than the parties hereto and their respective
permitted successors and assigns, any legal or equitable or other rights or
remedies (with respect to the matters provided for in this  _Section 5.7_)
under or by reason of any provision of this Agreement.

Section 5.8 _Company Equity Awards_. The Company shall, after consultation
with Parent, deliver to the holders of Company Stock Options and Restricted
Shares, appropriate notices setting forth such holders rights pursuant to the
Company Equity Plans and this Agreement. Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any such
notices prior to the mailing or delivery thereof to the holders of Company
Stock Options and Restricted Shares, and the Company shall give reasonable
and good faith consideration to all additions, deletions, changes or other
comments suggested by Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel. The Company shall
also take the actions set forth on _Section 5.8_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter.

Section 5.9 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company and Parent
shall promptly notify each other of (a) the discovery of any fact or
circumstance that, or the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the
occurrence or non-occurrence of which, would cause or is reasonably likely to
result in any of the conditions to the Merger or Charter Amendment set forth
in _Article VI_ not being satisfied or satisfaction of those conditions being
materially delayed; provided, however, that the delivery of any notice
pursuant to this _Section 5.9_ shall not (i) cure any breach of, or non-
compliance with, any other provision of this Agreement or (ii) limit the
remedies available to the party sending or receiving such notice; and (b) the
receipt of any written communication received from any Person alleging that a
material consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or from any Governmental Entity in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company
shall promptly notify Parent if it receives written or material oral notice of
any material action, suit, proceeding or investigation brought against it or
any of its Subsidiaries. The Company shall also promptly notify Parent if
it receives comments from the SEC on any of its filings under the Securities
Act or the Exchange Act or if it or any of its Subsidiaries receive any
inquiry or communication from the SEC or any other Governmental Entity
regarding its compliance with the Exchange Act, Securities Act or other
securities laws. The Company will also keep Parent reasonably apprised of
communications it receives from or discussions it has with any stockholder
that (together with such stockholders Affiliates) beneficially owns 5% or
more of the Common Shares or the Preferred Shares, which discussions are
reasonably expected to be material to obtaining the Company Stockholder
Approval.

 

Section 5.10 _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_.

 

(a) Without limiting any additional rights that any director or employee may
have under the Company Constituent Documents, any agreement or Company Plan,
from and after the Effective Time through the sixth (6th) anniversary of the
date on which the Effective Time occurs, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law (and Parent

 



47 ##### Table of Contents

  

 shall also advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable Law, subject to the immediately following sentence), each
present and each former officer or director of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (and each Person who may become an officer or director of the
Company or a Company Subsidiary between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time) (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), against any
costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any Action,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or
related to such Indemnified Partys service as a director, officer or employee
of the Company or its Subsidiaries or services performed by such persons at
the request of the Company or its Subsidiaries at or prior to the Effective
Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time,
including (i) the Merger and the Charter Amendment and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) actions to enforce this  _Section
5.10_ or any other indemnification or advancement right of any Indemnified
Party. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein (but subject to any
superior rights contained in the Company Constituent Documents (or, as
relevant, those of the applicable Subsidiary of the Company) or applicable
indemnification agreements to which any Acquired Company is a party), prior to
making any advance in respect of the indemnification obligations set forth in
this  _Section 5.10_, the Person who is requesting such advance shall agree
to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Person is not
entitled to indemnification in respect of the matter for which such advance
was made.

 

(b) Except as may be required by applicable Law, Parent and the Company agree
that for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, all rights to
indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and rights to advancement of
expenses relating thereto now existing in favor of any Indemnified Party as
provided in the Company Constituent Documents (or, as relevant, the
organizational documents of any Company Subsidiary) or in any indemnification
agreement between such Indemnified Party and the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall survive the Merger and continue in full force and effect,
and for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time shall not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely
affect any right thereunder of any such Indemnified Party.

 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall and, if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective
Time to, obtain and fully pay the premium for the extension of (i) the
directors and officers liability coverage of the Companys existing
directors and officers insurance policies, and (ii) the Companys existing
fiduciary liability insurance policies, in each case for a claims reporting or
discovery period of at least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time
from one or more insurance carriers with the same or better credit rating as
the Companys insurance carrier as of the date hereof with respect to
directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance
(collectively, " _D andO Insurance_") with terms, conditions, retentions and
limits of liability that are at least as favorable to the insureds as the
Companys existing policies with respect to any actual or alleged error,
misstatement, misleading statement, act, omission, neglect, breach of duty or
any matter claimed against a director or officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries by reason of him or her serving in such capacity that existed or
occurred at or prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with
this Agreement or the transactions or actions contemplated hereby);
_provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the Company expend, nor shall
Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend, for such policies
pursuant to this sentence an amount in excess of 200% of the annual premiums
currently paid by the Company as of the date hereof for such insurance as set
forth on _Section 5.10(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter. If the Company
and the Surviving Corporation for any reason fail to obtain such "tail"
insurance policy as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall,
and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, continue to maintain in
effect for a period of at least six (6) years from and after the Effective
Time the DandO Insurance in place as of the date hereof with terms, conditions,
retentions and limits of liability that are at least as favorable to the
insureds as provided in the Companys existing policies as of the date
hereof, or the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, use reasonable best efforts to purchase comparable
DandO Insurance for such six (6)-year period with terms, conditions, retentions
and limits of liability that are at least as favorable as provided in the
Companys existing policies as of the date hereof; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to
expend for such policies pursuant to this sentence an annual premium amount in
excess of 200% of the annual

 



48 ##### Table of Contents

  

 premiums currently paid by the Company as of the date hereof for such
insurance as set forth on _Section 5.10(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter;
and _provided_ , _further_ , that if the annual premiums of such insurance
coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall obtain a policy
with the greatest coverage reasonably available for a cost not exceeding such
amount.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any Action (whether
arising before, at or after the Effective Time) with respect to which an
Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification is instituted against any
Indemnified Party on or prior to the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective
Time, then the provisions of this _Section 5.10_ shall continue in effect
until the final disposition of such Action.

(e) The indemnification provided for herein shall not be deemed exclusive of,
and shall be in addition to, any other rights to which an Indemnified Party is
entitled, whether under the organizational documents of any Acquired Company
or pursuant to Law, Contract or otherwise. The provisions of this _Section
5.10_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger and, notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement that may be to the contrary, expressly are
from and after the Effective Time intended to benefit, and shall be
enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and their respective heirs and
legal representatives.

(f) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or Parent or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or a majority
of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, shall succeed to the
obligations set forth in this _Section 5.10_.

Section 5.11  _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
take such steps as may be reasonably necessary or advisable hereto to cause
dispositions of Company Shares, Company Equity Awards, and any other equity
securities (including derivative securities) pursuant to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is a director or officer
of the Company, subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the
Exchange Act with respect to the Company, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

Section 5.12  _Anti-Takeover Statutes_. If any Takeover Law is or may become
applicable to the Merger or the Charter Amendment or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub and
their respective boards of directors shall grant all such approvals and take
all such actions as are reasonably necessary or appropriate so that such
transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable hereafter on the
terms contemplated hereby, and otherwise act reasonably to eliminate or
minimize the effects of such Law on such transactions.

Section 5.13  _Transaction Litigation_. The Company shall provide Parent with
prompt notice of and copies of all proceedings and correspondence relating to
any Action against the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective directors or officers by any stockholder, or other securityholder
of the Company arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any such Action,
shall give due consideration to Parents advice with respect to such Action

(d) Each of the Parties hereto acknowledges that the agreements contained in

that, nothing in this shall relieve any Person from liability under any
Voting and Support Agreement, Director Agreement or Warrant Acknowledgement
Agreement or from liability for willful or intentional breach of its covenants
or agreements set forth in this Agreement prior to such termination or
for fraud. In no event shall the Company be required to

 pay the Termination Fee or the Expense Reimbursement Amount more than once.
In the event that the Company becomes obligated to pay and pays the Expense
Reimbursement Amount to Parent and subsequently becomes obligated to pay and
pays the Termination Fee to Parent, the amount of the Termination Fee payable
to Parent shall be reduced by the Expense Reimbursement Amount (but not to
less than zero).

serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or
agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or

alleged action in an official capacity as a director, officer, employee or
agent, or in any other capacity while serving as a director, officer, employee
or agent, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to the
fullest extent authorized or permitted by applicable law, as the same exists
or may hereafter be amended, against all expense, liability and loss
(including, without limitation, attorneys fees, judgments, fines, ERISA
excise taxes and penalties and amounts paid in settlement) reasonably incurred
or suffered by such Covered Person in connection with such proceeding, and
such right to indemnification shall continue as to a person who has ceased to
be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of
his or her heirs, executors and administrators; provided, however, that,
except for proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification, the Corporation

this Article SEVENTH, will, unless otherwise required by law, be prospective
only (except to the extent such amendment or change in law permits the
Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights on a retroactive basis
than permitted prior thereto), and will not in any way diminish or adversely
affect any right or protection existing at the time of such repeal or
amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision in respect of any act or
omission occurring prior to such repeal or amendment or adoption of such
inconsistent provision. This Article SEVENTH shall not limit the right of the
Corporation, to the extent and in the manner authorized or permitted by law,
to indemnify and to advance expenses to persons other than Covered Persons.

 

EIGHTH: The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal
any provision contained in this Certificate of Incorporation, in the manner

3. _Waiver of Notice_.

Company and Warrantholder and, in the case of the Warrantholder, shall be
binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the Warrantholders successors,
assigns, representatives or agents. Parent and Merger Sub, for so long as the

so long as the Merger Agreement is in effect, or Alternative Purchaser, for
so long as any Alternative Purchase Agreement is in effect.

 

(b) This Warrant Acknowledgment Agreement shall be construed in accordance
with and governed by the internal laws of the State of Delaware (without
giving effect to principles of conflicts of laws). Each of the parties
irrevocably agrees that any legal action or proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Warrant Acknowledgment Agreement shall be brought and
determined in the Delaware Court of Chancery and any state appellate court
therefrom within the State of Delaware (unless the Delaware Court of Chancery
shall decline to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, in which case,
in any Delaware state or federal court within the State of Delaware), and
each of the parties hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction
of the aforesaid courts for itself and with respect to its property, generally
and unconditionally, with regard to any such action or proceeding arising out

contemplated hereby. Each of the parties agrees not to commence any action,
suit or proceeding relating hereto in any court other than the courts of the
State of Delaware, as described above, other than actions in any court of

such court. Each of the parties further agrees that notice as provided herein
shall constitute sufficient service of process and the parties further waive

 that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of the
State of Delaware, as described above, for any reason, (b) that it or its
property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any
legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice,
attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment,
execution of judgment or otherwise) and (c) that (i) the suit, action or
proceeding in any such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the
venue of such suit, action or proceeding is improper or (iii) this Warrant
Acknowledgment Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced
in or by such courts. EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY.

(c) When a reference is made in this Warrant Acknowledgment Agreement to
a Section, such reference shall be to a Section of this Agreement unless
otherwise indicated. All words used in this Agreement will be construed to be
of such gender or number as the circumstances require. The words
"include," "includes" and "including" and words of similar import when used
in this Agreement will mean "include, without limitation," "includes, without
limitation" or "including, without limitation," unless otherwise specified.
The word "or" shall not be exclusive. Each party agrees that it has been
represented by counsel in connection with this Warrant Acknowledgment
Agreement and that any rule of law or any legal decision that would
require interpretation of any claimed ambiguities in this Warrant
Acknowledgment Agreement against the drafting party has no application and is
hereby expressly waived.

 

(d) Whenever possible, each provision or portion of any provision of this
agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid
under applicable law, but if any provision or portion of any provision of this
agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under
any applicable law or rule in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality
or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision or portion of any
provision in such jurisdiction, and this agreement shall be reformed,
construed and enforced in such jurisdiction as if such invalid, illegal
or unenforceable provision or portion of any provision had never been
contained herein, so long as the economic or legal substance of the
transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate
in good faith to modify this agreement so as to effect the original intent of
the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the
transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to
the fullest extent possible.

(e) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event
that any of the provisions of this Warrant Acknowledgment Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.
Accordingly, each party shall be entitled to specific performance of the
terms hereof, including an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of
this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
