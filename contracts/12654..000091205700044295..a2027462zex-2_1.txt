-vi-       AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER   AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER
dated as of October 7, 2000, among Block Drug Company, Inc. a New Jersey
corporation (the "COMPANY"), SmithKline Beecham plc, a public limited company
organized under the laws of England and Wales ("PARENT"), and SB Acquisition
Corp., a New Jersey corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent
("PURCHASER").   WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent,
Purchaser and the Company have determined that it would be advisable and in
the best interests of their respective shareholders for Parent to acquire the
Company on the terms and conditions set forth herein;   WHEREAS, to
effectuate the acquisition, it is proposed that Purchaser commence a cash
tender offer as it may be amended from time to time as permitted under this
Agreement, (the "OFFER") to purchase all of the issued and outstanding shares
of Class A and Class B Common Stock, par value $.10 per share, of the Company
(the "CLASS A STOCK" and the "CLASS B STOCK", respectively, and collectively,
the "COMPANY COMMON STOCK"), in each case, at a purchase price of $53.00 per
share (the "OFFER PRICE"), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement;   WHEREAS, to effectuate the acquisition, it is
further proposed that following consummation of the Offer, Purchaser will be
merged with and into the Company, with (i) the Company continuing as the
surviving corporation in the merger; (ii) each outstanding share of Company
Common Stock not owned directly or indirectly by Parent or the Company being
converted into the right to receive the highest per share cash consideration
paid pursuant to the Offer; and (iii) the other effects provided herein and
set forth in Section 14A:10-6 of the New Jersey Business Corporation Act (the
"NJBCA") (the "MERGER");   WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company
has determined that the consideration to be paid for each share in the Offer
and the Merger is fair to all holders of such shares and has resolved to
recommend that the holders of such shares accept the Offer and adopt this
Agreement; and   WHEREAS, certain stockholders have executed and delivered
to Parent agreements pursuant to which they have agreed to take certain
actions with respect to the Offer (the "VOTING AND TENDER AGREEMENTS");  
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the
respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in
this Agreement, the parties hereto agree as follows:        ARTICLE
1  THE OFFER   SECTION 1.01 THE OFFER. (a) Provided that this Agreement
shall not have been terminated in accordance with Article 8 and none of the
events set forth in ANNEX A hereto shall have occurred and be continuing,
Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause Purchaser to, as promptly as
practicable after the date hereof (but in no event later than the tenth
Business Day after the public announcement of the terms of this Agreement)
commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2(a) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 as amended (the "EXCHANGE ACT")), the Offer to purchase any and all
of the Company Common Stock, in each case, for the Offer Price, net to the
seller in cash, subject to reduction for any applicable withholding taxes
and, but only if such payment is to be made other than to the registered
holder, any applicable stock transfer taxes payable by such holder. The Offer
will be made pursuant to an offer to purchase and related letter of
transmittal containing the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.
The initial expiration date of the Offer shall be the twentieth Business Day
from and after the date the Offer is commenced as determined in accordance
with Rule 14d-2(a) under the Exchange Act (the "INITIAL EXPIRATION DATE").
The obligation of Purchaser to accept for payment, purchase and pay for any
shares of Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer shall
be subject, except as provided in Section 1.01(b), only to the satisfaction
of (i) the condition that all of the Shares of Class B Stock and at least a
majority of the shares of Class A Stock and Class B Stock (taken together as
if a single class) outstanding on a fully-diluted basis (taking into account
any shares of Class A Stock and Class B Stock owned by Parent or Purchaser or
any affiliate of Parent or Purchaser on the date such shares are purchased
pursuant to the Offer) have been validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to
the expiration of the Offer (the "MINIMUM CONDITION"), (ii) the condition
that (A) any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act shall have expired
or been terminated and (B) any required approval under the EC Merger
Regulation shall have been received, in each case without the Parent, the
Purchaser or the Company being subject to an Unduly Burdensome Condition or
the Purchaser or Parent having to submit to any Unduly Burdensome Commitment
to any Governmental Entity (the "HSR/EC CONDITION"), and (iii) the other
conditions set forth in ANNEX A hereto; provided, however, that Purchaser
expressly reserves the right to waive any of the conditions to the Offer
(other than the Minimum Condition) and to make any change in the terms or
conditions of the Offer (other than the Minimum Condition) in its sole
discretion, subject to Section 1.01(b).   (b) Without the prior written
consent of the Company, neither Parent nor Purchaser will (i) decrease the
Offer Price, (ii) decrease the number of shares of Class A Stock or Class B
Stock sought in the Offer, (iii) change the form of consideration payable in
the Offer, (iv) impose conditions to the Offer in addition to the Minimum
Condition, the HSR/EC Condition and the other conditions set forth in ANNEX
A, (v) except as provided below or required by any rule, regulation,
interpretation or position of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC")
applicable to the Offer, change the expiration date of the Offer, or (vi)
otherwise amend or change any term or condition of the Offer in a manner
adverse to the holders of shares of Class A Stock or Class B
Stock. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, without
the consent of the Company, Purchaser shall have the right to extend the
Offer beyond the Initial Expiration Date in    -2-      the
following events: (i) from time to time, but in no event later than June
30, 2001, if, at the Initial Expiration Date (or extended expiration date of
the Offer, if applicable), one or more of the conditions to the Offer (other
than the Minimum Condition to which this clause does not apply) shall not
have been satisfied or waived, until such conditions are satisfied or waived;
(ii) for any period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or
position of the SEC or the staff thereof applicable to the offer or any
period required by applicable law; (iii) if all conditions to the Offer other
than the Minimum Condition are satisfied or waived, for one or more periods
not to exceed ten (10) Business Days each (but no more than an aggregate of
thirty (30) Business Days for all such extensions); or (iv) if all of the
conditions to the Offer are satisfied or waived but the number of shares of
each class of Company Common Stock validly tendered and not withdrawn is less
than ninety percent (90%) of the then outstanding number of shares of each
class of Company Common Stock, for one additional period of not less than
three (3) nor more than twenty (20) Business Days, provided that Purchaser
shall accept and pay for all securities tendered, as soon as reasonably
practical, prior to the date of such extension, shall otherwise meet the
requirements of Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act in connection with such
extension and shall waive any condition to the consummation of the Merger
other than the conditions in Section 7.01(c) that may fail to be satisfied
during such extension. In addition, Parent and Purchaser agree that Purchaser
shall, if requested by the Company, from time to time extend the Offer if at
the Initial Expiration Date (or any extended expiration date of the
Offer, including pursuant to this sentence, if applicable), no conditions to
the Offer other than the Minimum Condition, the HSR/EC Condition and/or the
conditions set forth in clause (a) or clause (b) of ANNEX A shall excuse
performance by Purchaser under ANNEX A, until the earlier of twenty (20)
Business Days after such previously scheduled expiration date or June 30,
2001. Upon the satisfaction or waiver of all the conditions to the Offer and
subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Purchaser will, and
Parent will cause Purchaser to, accept for payment, purchase and pay for, in
accordance with the terms of the Offer, all shares of Company Common Stock
validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as soon as
reasonably practicable after the expiration of the Offer.   (c) As soon as
reasonably practicable on the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and
Purchaser shall file or cause to be filed with the SEC a Tender Offer
Statement on Schedule TO (together with any amendments or supplements
thereto, the "SCHEDULE TO") with respect to the Offer, which shall contain or
incorporate by reference the offer to purchase, and forms of the related
letter of transmittal and such other ancillary documents and instruments
pursuant to which the Offer will be made (such Schedule TO and such documents
included therein pursuant to which the Offer will be made, together with any
supplements or amendments thereto, the "OFFER DOCUMENTS"). Parent
and Purchaser agree that the Offer Documents will comply as to form and
content in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the
federal securities laws. Parent, Purchaser and the Company each agree to
correct promptly any information provided by it for use in the Offer
Documents if and to the extent that such information shall have become false
or misleading in any material respect and to supplement the information
provided by it specifically for use in the Schedule TO or the other Offer
Documents to include any information that shall become necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. Parent and Purchaser agree to take all steps
necessary to cause the Offer    -3-      Documents as so corrected or
supplemented to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to holders of
shares of Company Common Stock, in each case as and to the extent required by
applicable federal securities laws. The Company and its counsel shall be
given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Offer Documents
prior to their being filed with the SEC. Parent and Purchaser agree to
provide to the Company and its counsel any comments or other communications
which Parent, Purchaser or their counsel may receive from the Staff of the
SEC with respect to the Offer Documents promptly after receipt thereof.  
(d) Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Purchaser on a timely
basis the funds necessary to accept for payment, and pay for, any shares of
Company Common Stock that Purchaser becomes obligated to accept for
payment, and pay for, pursuant to the Offer.   SECTION 1.02 COMPANY ACTION.
(a) The Company hereby consents to the Offer and represents and warrants that
the board of directors of the Company (the "BOARD OF DIRECTORS"), at a
meeting duly called and held, has (i) determined that this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including, without limitation, the Offer,
the Merger and the purchase of shares of Company Common Stock contemplated by
the Offer (collectively the "TRANSACTIONS"), are advisable and fair to and in
the best interests of the Company and the Company\'s shareholders, (ii)
approved of this Agreement and the Transactions in accordance with the
requirements of the NJBCA, and (iii) resolved to recommend that the
shareholders of the Company accept the Offer, tender their shares of Company
Common Stock pursuant to the Offer and approve and adopt this Agreement and
the Merger. Notwithstanding the foregoing, such recommendation may be
withdrawn, modified or amended as permitted by Section 6.05(c). The Company
hereby consents to the inclusion in the Offer Documents, the Schedule 14D-9
and the Proxy Statement (if any) of such recommendation of the Board of
Directors. The Company represents and warrants that the Board of Directors
has received the written opinion (the "GS FAIRNESS OPINION") of Goldman Sachs
and Co. ("GS"), stating that as of the date of such opinion, the proposed
consideration to be received by the holders of shares of Company Common Stock
pursuant to the Offer and the Merger is fair to such holders from a financial
point of view. The Company has been authorized by GS to permit, subject to
the prior review and consent by GS (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld), the inclusion of the GS Fairness Opinion (or a reference thereto)
in the Offer Documents and the Schedule 14D-9. The Company acknowledges that
Voting and Tender Agreements have been executed and delivered by holders of a
majority of the outstanding shares of Class A Stock and 100% of
the outstanding shares of Class B Stock and has also been advised by each of
its directors and by each corporate officer who, as of the date hereof, is
aware of the Transactions and is not a party to or bound by such Voting and
Tender Agreement, that each such person intends to tender pursuant to the
Offer all shares of Company Common Stock owned, of record or beneficially, by
such person which he or she may sell without liability under Section 16(b) of
the Exchange Act, unless the Company\'s recommendation shall have been
withdrawn or materially modified as permitted by Section 6.05(c).   (b) As
soon as reasonably practicable on the date of commencement of the Offer, the
Company shall file with the SEC and disseminate to holders of shares of
Company Common    -4-      Stock, in each case as and to the extent
required by applicable federal securities laws, a Solicitation/Recommendation
Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with any amendments or supplements
thereto, the "SCHEDULE 14D-9") that shall reflect the recommendation of the
Board of Directors referred to in clause (iii) of Section 1.02(a) hereof. The
Schedule 14D-9 will comply in all material respects with the provisions of
applicable federal securities laws and, on the date filed with the SEC and on
the date first published, sent or given to the Company\'s shareholders, shall
not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, except that no representation is made by the Company with
respect to information supplied by Parent or Purchaser in writing for
inclusion in the Schedule 14D- 9. The Company, Parent and Purchaser each
agree promptly to correct any information provided by it for use in
the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that it shall have become false
or misleading in any material respect and to supplement the information
provided by it specifically for use in the Schedule 14D-9 to include any
information that shall become necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The
Company agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so
corrected or supplemented to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to
holders of shares of Company Common Stock, in each case as and to the extent
required by applicable federal securities laws. Parent and its counsel shall
be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9
prior to its being filed with the SEC. The Company agrees to provide to
Parent and Purchaser and their counsel any comments or other communications
which the Company or its counsel may receive from the staff of the SEC with
respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt thereof. Parent,
Purchaser and the Company each hereby agree to provide promptly such
information necessary to preparation of the exhibits and schedules to the
Schedule 14D-9 and the Offer Documents which the respective party responsible
therefor will reasonably request.   (c) The Company will cause its transfer
agent promptly to furnish Parent and Purchaser with a list of the Company\'s
shareholders, mailing labels and any available listings or computer file
containing the names and addresses of all record holders of shares of Company
Common Stock and lists of securities positions of shares of Company Common
Stock held in stock depositories and to provide to Parent and Purchaser such
additional information (including, without limitation, updated lists of
shareholders, mailing labels and lists of securities positions) and such
other assistance as Parent or Purchaser or their agents may reasonably
request in connection with the Offer. Subject to the requirements of
applicable law, and except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate the
Offer Documents and any other documents necessary to consummate the
Transactions, Parent and Purchaser and each of their affiliates, associates
and agents will hold in confidence the information contained in any such
labels, listings and files, will use such information only in connection with
the Offer and the Merger and, if this Agreement is terminated, will deliver,
and will cause their agents to deliver, to the Company all copies and any
extracts or summaries from such information then in their possession or
control.   SECTION 1.03 DIRECTORS. (a) Promptly following the purchase of
and payment for a number of shares of Company Common Stock that satisfies
the Minimum Condition, and from    -5-      time to time thereafter,
Purchaser shall be entitled to designate for election as directors of the
Company a number of directors, equal to the next whole number, greater than
the product of (i) the total number of directors of the Company constituting
the whole Board of Directors (giving effect to any increase in the number of
directors in order to comply with this Section 1.03 and (ii) the percentage
that the voting power of shares of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by
Parent and Purchaser (including shares of Company Common Stock paid for
pursuant to the Offer), upon such acceptance for payment, bears to the total
voting power of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding, and the Company
shall take all action within its power to cause Purchaser\'s designees to be
elected or appointed to the Board of Directors, including,
without limitation, increasing the number of directors, and seeking and
accepting resignations of incumbent directors. At such time, the Company will
also, upon request of Parent or Purchaser, use its reasonable best efforts to
cause individual directors designated by Purchaser to constitute the number
of members, rounded up to the next whole number, on (i) each committee of the
Board of Directors other than any such committee of the Board of Directors
established to take action under this Agreement and (ii) each board of
directors of each Subsidiary of the Company, and each committee thereof, that
represents the same percentage as Purchaser\'s designees represent on the
Board of Directors. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that
Purchaser\'s designees are appointed or elected to the Board of Directors the

deemed to be Continuing Directors for all purposes of this Agreement.   (b)

Effective Time by virtue of the Merger and without any other action on the
part of the holder thereof:   (i) each share of Class A Stock and each
share of  Class B Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective  Time
shall be converted into the right to receive from the  Surviving Corporation,
in cash, without interest, upon the  surrender of the certificate
representing such shares the  price per share of Company Common Stock paid in
the Offer (in  each case, the "MERGER CONSIDERATION"); and   (ii) each
share of common stock of Purchaser  outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be  converted into and become one share of common stock
of the  Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and  privileges
as the shares so converted and shall constitute the  only outstanding shares
of capital stock of the Surviving  Corporation; and   (iii) each share of
Company Common Stock that is  owned by the Company as treasury shares and all

consideration therefor.   (b) At the Effective Time, holders of Company
Common Stock shall cease to be, and shall have no voting or other rights as,
shareholders of the Company, other than to receive the Merger Consideration
and any dividend or other distribution with respect to the Company Common
Stock with a record date occurring prior to the Effective Time. From and
after the Effective Time,    -8-      there shall be no transfers on
the stock transfer records of the Company of any shares of Company Common
Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.  
SECTION 3.02 PAYMENT FOR SHARES IN THE MERGER. (a) Prior to the Effective
Time, Parent shall appoint an agent (the "PAYING AGENT")
reasonably acceptable to the Company for the purpose of exchanging
certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock (the "CERTIFICATES")
for the Merger Consideration. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent or
Purchaser shall deposit with the Paying Agent, in trust for the benefit of
the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, cash in immediately available
funds sufficient to pay the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of all
shares of Company Common Stock then outstanding, other than those described
in Section 3.01(a)(iii) (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the
"PAYMENT FUND"); provided, however, that no such deposit shall relieve Parent
or Purchaser of its obligations to pay the Merger Consideration pursuant to
Section 3.01(a)(i). The Payment Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.
The Payment Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent
or the Surviving Corporation pending payment thereof by the Paying Agent to
the holders of record of shares of Company Common Stock. Earnings from such
investment shall be the sole and exclusive property of Parent and the
Surviving Corporation, and no part of such earnings shall accrue to the
benefit of holders of record of shares of Company Common Stock.   (b) As
soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent will cause
the Paying Agent to send to each holder of record of shares of Company Common
Stock at the Effective Time (other than holders of Shares of Company Common
Stock referred to in Section 3.01(a)(iii)) a letter of transmittal (which
shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent
and will be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent reasonably
specifies) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
Certificate(s) for payment of the Merger Consideration for the
shares represented thereby.   (c) Each holder of record of shares of
Company Common Stock that have been converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration will be entitled to receive, upon surrender to the
Paying Agent of one or more Certificates, together with a properly completed
letter of transmittal, the Merger Consideration in respect of each share of
Company Common Stock represented by such Certificates. Until so surrendered,
each such Certificate shall represent after the Effective Time for all
purposes only the right to receive such Merger Consideration. No interest
shall be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon surrender of any
Certificate.   (d) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid
to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate
is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that the Certificate
so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form
for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the
Paying Agent any transfer or other taxes required as a result of such payment
to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish
to the satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such tax has been paid or is not
payable.    -9-       (e) Each of the Surviving Corporation and
Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Article 3 such amounts as it
is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under any provision of federal, state, local or foreign tax law. If the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, so withholds amounts,
such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of
which the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, made such
deduction and withholding.   (f) If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond,
in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent will pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the
shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate, as
contemplated by this Article.   (g) At the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed there shall be no further
registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they
shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration provided for,
and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this Article 3.   (h)
Any portion of the Payment Fund (and any interest or other income earned
thereon) that remains unclaimed by the holders of shares of Company Common
Stock one year after the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent,
upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged shares of Company
Common Stock for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section
3.02 prior to that time shall thereafter look only to the Surviving
Corporation for payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of such shares
without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the
Paying Agent nor any party hereto shall be liable to any holder of shares of
Company Common Stock for any amount paid to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.   (i) The Surviving
Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses of the Paying Agent.  
SECTION 3.03 STOCK OPTIONS; SPECIAL STOCK UNIT PLAN; AND
EXTRAORDINARY DEFERRED COMPENSATION. The Company shall take all actions
necessary to provide that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, each then
outstanding option to purchase Class A Stock under any stock option plan or
arrangement of the Company (a "COMPANY STOCK OPTION"), shall be fully vested,
whether or not vested or exercisable, and after such vesting shall be
cancelled. In consideration for the cancellation of each Company Stock
Option, the Company shall make a cash payment to the holder at or promptly
after the Effective Time of an amount equal to the product of (i) the excess,
if any,    -10-      of the Merger Consideration per share of Class A
Stock over the exercise price of such Company Stock Option, and (ii) the
number of shares of Class A Stock covered by such Company Stock Option (to
the extent not previously terminated). Payments made in cancellation of
Company Stock Options will be subject to applicable tax withholding
requirements and will be in full satisfaction of all of the Company\'s
liabilities and obligations under any stock option plan or arrangement of the
Company and the Company Stock Options. The Company shall take such actions as
may be necessary to provide that, immediately prior to the Effective Time,
the accounts of all participants in the Company\'s Special Stock Unit Plan
will be fully vested and cashed out in full satisfaction of all of
the Company\'s liabilities and obligations under such plan and in respect of
such awards. The Company shall take such actions as may be necessary to
provide that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, all Extraordinary
Deferred Compensation Agreements specified in Schedule 4.12 of the Company
Disclosure Memorandum will be fully vested and cashed out.   SECTION 3.04
ADJUSTMENTS. Subject to Section 6.01(b), if, during the period between the
date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding
shares of capital stock of the Company shall occur by reason of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange
or readjustment of shares, or stock dividend thereon with a record date
during such period, the Merger Consideration and any other amounts payable
pursuant to this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted.   ARTICLE 4 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY   Except as set forth in the
disclosure memorandum delivered by the Company to Parent on or prior to the
date hereof (the "COMPANY DISCLOSURE MEMORANDUM") or in the Company SEC
Reports, as defined in Section 4.06(a) herein, the Company represents and
warrants to Parent and Purchaser as follows:   SECTION 4.01 ORGANIZATION AND
QUALIFICATION; SUBSIDIARIES. The Company and each of its Significant
Subsidiaries, as defined in Section 9.17(g), is a corporation duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction in
which it is incorporated and has the requisite corporate power and authority
to carry on its business as now being conducted. The Company and each of its
Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good
standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or
the ownership or leasing of its properties makes such qualification or
licensing necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where the failure to be
so qualified or licensed (individually or in the aggregate) would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. As
used in this Agreement, "MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT" means, with respect to any
Person, any change, effect, event, occurrence or state of facts (or any
development that has had or is reasonably likely to have any change or
effect) that is or is reasonably likely to be materially adverse to the
business, financial condition or results of operations of such Person and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or which would prevent or materially delay or
materially impair the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, none of the following shall be deemed in themselves,
either alone or in    -11-      combination, to constitute, and none
of the following shall be taken into account in determining whether there has
been a Material Adverse Effect: (i) any change in the market price or trading
volume of the capital stock of such Person after the date hereof, (ii)
changes, events or occurrences in the United States securities markets which
are not specific to such Person, (iii) any adverse changes, events,
developments or effects (A) arising from or relating to general business or
economic conditions which are not specific to such Person and
its Subsidiaries, or (B) affecting generally companies in the same business
as such Person and its Subsidiaries, except to the extent that such changes,
events or developments have an adverse effect on such Person and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole that is materially greater than the adverse
effect on comparable companies, (iv) any failure by such Person to meet
internal forecasts or projections or published revenue or earnings
predictions for any period ending (or for which revenues or earnings are
released) on or after the date of this Agreement, (v) any adverse change,
event, development or effect attributable to the announcement or pendency of
the Transactions (including any cancellations of or delays in customer
agreements, any reduction in sales, any disruption in supplier, distributor,
partner or similar relationships or any loss of employees), or resulting from
or relating to compliance with the terms of, or the taking of any action
required by, this Agreement, and (vi) any adverse change, event, development
or effect arising from or relating to any change in U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles. The term "SUBSIDIARY" means as to any Person any
corporation or other legal entity of which such Person controls (either alone
or through or together with any other Subsidiary), owns, directly or
indirectly, more than 50% of the capital stock or other ownership
interests the holders of which are generally entitled to vote for the
election of the Board of Directors or other governing body of such
corporation or other legal entity. Section 4.01 of the Company Disclosure
Memorandum lists each Subsidiary of the Company. Unless the context otherwise
requires, when used herein "Subsidiary" refers to each Subsidiary of the
Company. The Company has made available to Parent complete and correct copies
of its certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the certificates of
incorporation and bylaws (or comparable charter documents, in the case of any
foreign subsidiary of the Company) of its Significant Subsidiaries, in each
case as amended to the date hereof. All of the outstanding shares of capital
stock or other ownership interests of each such Subsidiary have been validly
issued and are fully paid and nonassessable and are owned by the Company, by
a wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company or by the Company and another
wholly-owned Subsidiary, in each case, free and clear of all pledges, claims,
liens, charges, encumbrances and security interests of any kind or nature
whatsoever (collectively, "LIENS"), and free of any restriction on the right
to vote, sell or otherwise dispose of such capital stock or other ownership
interests, except for restrictions imposed by applicable securities laws.
Other than director qualifying shares, there are no outstanding (i)
securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries convertible into or
exchangeable for shares of capital stock or other ownership interests in any
Subsidiary of the Company or (ii) options or other rights (including, without
limitation, any subscriptions, warrants, calls, stock appreciation rights,
commitments or agreements of any character) to acquire from the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, or other obligation of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to issue, any capital stock or other ownership interests in,
or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for any capital stock or
other ownership interests in, any Subsidiary. Other than ownership
securities representing an investment of less than $10,000 (at cost), in any
publicly traded company and an investment of $100,000 in the aggregate (at
cost) and the capital stock or other ownership interests of its  
-12-     Subsidiaries, the Company does not own, directly or indirectly,
any capital stock or other ownership interest in any corporation,
partnership, joint venture or other entity.   SECTION 4.02 CAPITALIZATION.
(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 60,000,000 shares
of common stock, $0.10 par value per share, of which 20,000,000 shares have

are no outstanding (i) shares of capital stock or voting securities of the
Company, (ii) securities of the Company convertible into or exchangeable for
shares of capital stock or voting securities of the Company or (iii) options
or other rights (including, without limitation, any subscriptions, warrants,
calls, stock appreciation rights, commitments or agreements of any character)
to acquire from the Company or other obligation of the Company to issue, any
capital stock, voting securities or securities convertible into or
exchangeable for capital stock or voting securities of the Company (the items
in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) being referred to collectively as the "COMPANY
SECURITIES"). There are no outstanding obligations of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any of the
Company Securities. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has adopted a shareholder rights plan
or similar plan or arrangement.   (c) There are no bonds, debentures, notes

Company, to which any shareholder who is a party to a Voting and Tender
Agreement of the Company, is a party.   SECTION 4.03 CORPORATE
AUTHORIZATION. The Company has the requisite corporate power and authority to
enter into this Agreement and, subject to approval, if necessary, of the
Merger by the Company\'s shareholders in accordance with the NJBCA, to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The execution and

of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate action on the part of the Company, subject to approval,

the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms,
except that such enforceability (i) may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,

creditors\' rights generally and (ii) is subject to general principles of
equity.   SECTION 4.04 GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORIZATION. No consent, approval,

Agreement.   SECTION 4.05 NON-CONTRAVENTION. The execution and delivery of
this Agreement by the Company does not, and performance by the Company of

Company and its Subsidiaries or (d) result in the creation or imposition of
any Lien on any asset of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except, in

a Material Adverse Effect on the Company or materially impair the ability of
the Company to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.   SECTION 4.06 SEC REPORTS; FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.   (a) The
Company has filed with the SEC all reports, schedules, forms, statements and

knowledge of the Company, threatened in writing against or affecting the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries that, individually or in the aggregate,
would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company
or would prevent or substantially delay any of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or otherwise prevent the Company from performing its
obligations hereunder (it being understood that this representation shall not
include any litigation of the nature described in paragraph (a) of ANNEX A),
nor is there any judgment, decree, injunction, rule or order of any
Governmental Entity or arbitrator outstanding against the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries having, or which, insofar as reasonably can be foreseen, in
the future would have, any such effect.   SECTION 4.10 COMPLIANCE WITH
LAWS. Except as disclosed in the Company SEC Reports, the Company and its
Subsidiaries are in compliance with all applicable statutes, laws,
ordinances, regulations, rules, judgments, decrees and orders of any
Governmental Entity applicable to their respective businesses or operations,
except for instances of possible noncompliance that, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company (provided that no representation or warranty is made in this
Section 4.10 with respect to Environmental Laws which are covered in Section
4.13). Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has in effect all Federal,
state, local and foreign governmental approvals,
authorizations, certificates, filings, franchises, licenses, notices, permits
and rights ("PERMITS") necessary for it to own, lease or operate its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as now conducted,
and    -16-      there has occurred no default under any such Permit,
except for the lack of Permits and for defaults under Permits which lack or
default individually or in the aggregate would not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.   SECTION 4.11 TAXES. (a)
The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has filed all income Tax Returns
which it has been required to file, has paid all Taxes which have become due
and payable by it and has made adequate provision in reserves established in
its financial statements and accounts for all Taxes which have accrued but
are not yet due and payable, except where the failure to file Tax Returns,
pay Taxes or provide adequate reserves for Taxes would not have a Material
Adverse Effect.   (b) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
waived any statute of limitations in respect of the assessment and collection
of Taxes or agreed to any extension of time with respect to a Tax assessment
or deficiency.   (c) None of the Company and its Subsidiaries is a party to
any Tax allocation or sharing agreement other than between or among
themselves.   (d) None of the Company and its Subsidiaries has been a member
of an affiliated group filing a consolidated U.S. federal Tax Return.   (e)
"TAXES" shall mean any and all taxes, charges, fees, levies or other
assessments, including income, gross receipts, excise, real or
personal property, sales, withholding, social security, retirement,
unemployment, occupation, use, goods and services, service use, license,
value added, capital, net worth, payroll, profits, withholding, franchise,
business, transfer and recording taxes, fees and charges, and any other
taxes, assessment or similar charges imposed by the IRS or any taxing
authority (whether domestic or foreign including any state, county, local or
foreign government or any subdivision or taxing agency thereof (including a
United States possession)) (a "TAXING AUTHORITY"), whether computed on a
separate, consolidated, unitary, combined or any other basis; and such term
shall include any interest whether paid or received, fines, penalties or
additional amounts attributable to, or imposed upon, or with respect to, any
such taxes, charges, fees, levies or other assessments. "TAX RETURN" shall
mean any report, return, document, declaration or other information or filing
required to be supplied to any Taxing Authority or jurisdiction (foreign or
domestic) with respect to Taxes, including information returns, any documents
with respect to or accompanying payments of estimated Taxes, or with respect
to or accompanying requests for the extension of time in which to file any
such report, return, document, declaration or other information.   SECTION
4.12 EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS. (a) Schedule 4.12 of the Company Disclosure
Memorandum lists each material "employee benefit plan," as defined in Section
3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
amended ("ERISA"), whether or not subject to ERISA, and each other material
employment, severance, consulting, confidentiality, deferred, incentive,
fringe benefit, change in control, retention, stock option or other equity
based or other compensatory or benefit plan, policy, agreement or arrangement
(including, without    -17-     limitation, any collective bargaining
agreement or national agreement governing any terms and conditions of
employment) that is (i) maintained, administered, contributed to or required
to be contributed to by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any entity
that, together with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, would be treated
as a single employer under Section 414 of the Code (an "ERISA Affiliate") or
to which the Company or any such Subsidiary or ERISA Affiliate is a party,
and (ii)covers any employee or former employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (collectively, the "EMPLOYEE PLANS"). Subject to data protection
or other law concerning the disclosure of personal data, the Company has made
available to Parent copies of the Employee Plans (and, if applicable, related
trust agreements or other funding arrangements) and all material amendments
thereto and material written interpretations thereof.   (b) The Company has
delivered or made available to Parent the most recent determination letter,
if any, of the IRS relating to each Employee Plan intended to qualify under
Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "CODE")
and to the knowledge of the Company, no event or condition has occurred or
exists since the date of such letter that could be reasonably expected to
result in the disqualification of any such plan. Each Employee Plan has been
administered in, and is in, compliance with its terms and with the
requirements of applicable law, including but not limited to ERISA, the Code,
and comparable legislation of a non-U.S. jurisdiction except where
the failure so to administer would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.  
(c) With respect to any Employee Plan covered by Title I of ERISA, no non-
exempt transaction prohibited by Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of
the Code or other misconduct has occurred which will cause the Company to
incur (directly or indirectly) a liability under ERISA, the Code or
comparable legislation of a non-U.S. jurisdiction that would reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. No "accumulated
funding deficiency," as defined in Section 412 of the Code, has been incurred
with respect to any Employee Plan subject to such Section 412, whether or not
waived. All material contributions required to be made under any Employee
Plan or any applicable law as of the date hereof have been made or adequately
provided for on the Company\'s financial statements. No "reportable event,"
within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA, other than a "reportable event"
that would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, and no event described
in Section 4062 or 4063 of ERISA, has occurred in connection with any
Employee Plan that is subject to Title IV of ERISA. Neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries sponsors or contributes to any "multiple employer
welfare arrangement" as defined in Section 3(40) of ERISA. Neither the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries, nor any ERISA Affiliate has engaged in, or
is a successor or parent corporation to an entity that has engaged in, a
transaction described in Sections 4069 or 4212(c) of ERISA or incurred, or
reasonably expects to incur prior to the Effective Time, any material
liability under Title IV of ERISA arising in connection with the termination
of, or a complete or partial withdrawal from, any plan covered or previously
covered by Title IV of ERISA or any material liability under Section 4971 or
4980B of the Code or to the Company\'s knowledge, any material penalty
or excise tax under laws of any non-U.S. jurisdiction that in any such case
could become or remain a liability of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries,
Parent or any    -18-      ERISA Affiliate after the Effective Time.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries contributes or has ever been
required to contribute to any "multiemployer plan," as defined in Section
3(37) of ERISA. The assets of the Company are not now, nor will they after
the passage of time be, subject to any lien imposed under Code Section 412(n)
by reason of a failure of the Company to make timely installments or other
payments required under Code Section 412 prior to the Effective Time.   (d)
No employee or former employee of the Company or any Subsidiary will become
entitled to any material bonus, retirement, severance, job security or other
payment, right or benefit (including any increased payment, award or benefit
or any acceleration of vesting payment or exercise of any award, amount or
benefit) as a result of the transactions contemplated hereby (whether
alone or in connection with additional events), and there is no contract,
plan or arrangement covering any employee or former employee of the Company
or any Subsidiary that, individually or collectively, could reasonably be
expected to give rise to a payment that would not be deductible by Parent,
the Company or any Subsidiary by reason of Sections 280G or 162(m) of the
Code.   (e) With respect to each Employee Plan, where applicable, the
Company has provided or made available to Parent, true and complete copies of
(i) the most recent IRS Form 5500 filing, (ii) the most recent financial
statement, and (iii) the most recent actuarial report and Form PBGC-1
filing.   (f) There are no actions, suits, claims or administrative
proceedings which have been asserted, instituted (other than routine claims
for benefits) or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened against the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to any Employee Plan or
against the assets of any Employee Plan which could reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect.   (g) Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any announced plan or legally binding commitment to create
any additional Employee Plans or to amend or modify any existing Employee
Plan, other than amendments required by law and amendments or incentive
awards expressly contemplated by Sections 3.03, 4.08, 4.12, 6.01 or 6.08 of
this Agreement or the related Sections of the Company Disclosure
Memorandum.   SECTION 4.13 ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS. (a) Except as would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company:   (i) no written notice, demand, request for
information,  citation, summons or order has been received, no penalty has
been  assessed, and no action, suit, proceeding or, to the knowledge of the 
Company, investigation is pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, 
threatened, which alleges a violation by the Company or any Subsidiary  of
the Company of any Environmental Law or seeks to impose liability  under any
Environmental Law (including, without limitation, Superfund 
liabilities);    -19-        (ii) the Company and its Subsidiaries
are, and have been  during the preceding five years, in compliance with all
applicable  Environmental Laws and all Environmental Permits;   (iii) in
connection with the real property owned, operated or  leased by the Company,
or the Company\'s activities or operations, no  release, emission, or
discharge into the environment of Hazardous  Substances has occurred or is
presently occurring, and no contamination  is present, that would require
notification, investigation or  remediation under any Environmental Law. No
Hazardous Substance has  been disposed of by the Company except in compliance
with applicable  Environmental Laws and, to the Company\'s knowledge, no
Hazardous  Substance resulting from the Company\'s activities or operations
has  been disposed of by any other Person except in compliance with 
applicable Environmental Laws; and   (iv) the Company has made available to
Purchaser all  assessments, audits, investigations, and sampling or similar
reports  relating to the environment and the presence or absence of any 
contamination or release of Hazardous Substances, to the extent  applicable
to the Company\'s activities or operations or the real  property which it
owns, operates or leases.   (b) As used herein,   (i) "ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS"
means any federal, state, local or  foreign law, regulation, rule, order,
decree or requirement relating  to: (a) pollution, contamination, cleanup,
preservation, protection, or  reclamation of the environment; (b) public or
employee health or  safety; (c) notification, investigation, monitoring, or

individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company and except as disclosed in the Company
SEC Reports:    -20-      (a) the Company and each of its Subsidiaries
owns, controls or is perpetually licensed to use (in each case, free and
clear of any Liens or restrictions), all Intellectual Property used in, or
necessary for the conduct of, its business as currently conducted or as
currently planned to be conducted;   (b) to the Company\'s knowledge, the

applicable license pursuant to which the Company or any Subsidiary acquired
the right to use any Intellectual Property;   (c) no Person has commenced a

Subsidiaries has received any written notice or otherwise has knowledge of

Intellectual Property owned, controlled, licensed or used by the Company or

action or proceeding which involves a claim of infringement of, or breach of
any license or agreement involving, any Intellectual Property of any third

Property of all rights to such contributions and Intellectual Property that
the Company or such subsidiary does not already own by operation of law;  
(h) subject to subparagraph (g) above, the Company and each of

of any implied warranties or representation, other than notices of claims
that have been settled or resolved by the Company and its Subsidiaries prior
to the date hereof and claims which, individually or in the aggregate, would
not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company.   SECTION 4.16 TITLE AND CONDITION OF PROPERTIES. The Company or
one of its Subsidiaries (a) has good and marketable title to or a valid
leasehold interest under a real property or a capitalized lease in all assets

disposed of in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice
since such date, (ii) Liens disclosed in the Company SEC Reports, (iii) Liens

wear and tear not caused by neglect, and are usable in the ordinary course of

INSURANCE. All material risks of the Company and its Subsidiaries in respect
of their business are covered by valid and currently effective insurance
policies or binders of insurance or programs of self-insurance in such types
and amounts as are reasonable in the context of the businesses and operations
engaged in by the Company and its Subsidiaries. The Company has paid all
premiums due under such policies and is not in default with respect to its
obligations under any such policies other than any default that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company.   SECTION 4.18 CERTAIN CONTRACTS. (a) As of
the date hereof, except as set forth in the Company SEC Reports or Schedule

thereto from engaging or competing in any line of business or in any
geographic area. As used in this Agreement "Material Contract" shall mean a
material contract as defined in Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K of the

other instrument to which the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries
is a party or by which the Company, any of its Significant Subsidiaries or
any of their respective assets is bound, except for such defaults as have not
had and are not reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect, and
there has not occurred any event that with the lapse of time or the giving of
notice or both would constitute such a default.   SECTION 4.19 EMPLOYMENT
MATTERS. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has experienced any
work stoppages, strikes, collective labor grievances, other collective

collective labor grievance, other collective bargaining dispute or claim of
unfair labor practices threatened against or involving the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries. To the knowledge of the Company, there is neither a
material labor negotiation in progress with any labor union, labor
organization, trade union, work council or other employee representative
body, nor an organizational effort presently being made or overtly threatened
by or on behalf of any labor union with respect to employees of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries.   SECTION 4.20 FINDERS\' FEES. Except for

transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   -23-      SECTION 4.21
OPINION OF FINANCIAL ADVISOR. The Company has received an opinion of Goldman
Sachs and Co. to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion, the
consideration to be received by the holders of shares of Company Common Stock
pursuant to the Offer and the Merger is fair to such holders from a financial
point of view.   SECTION 4.22 VOTING REQUIREMENTS. The affirmative vote of
the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of each of the Class A
Stock and Class B Stock, each voting as a separate class (the "COMPANY
SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL"), approving this Agreement is the only vote of the
holders of any class or series of the Company\'s capital stock necessary to
approve this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.   ARTICLE 5  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND

instrument binding upon Parent or Purchaser, except, in the case of clauses

WITHOUT SHAREHOLDER MEETING. (a) If required by applicable law to consummate

voted in favor of the Merger. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Purchaser or
any other subsidiary of Parent shall acquire at least ninety percent (90%) of

its staff and to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Company\'s
shareholders as promptly as practicable after responding to all such comments
to the satisfaction of the staff. The Company shall give Parent and its
counsel the opportunity to review the Proxy Statement and all amendments and
supplements thereto, prior to their being filed with the SEC. The Company
will notify Parent promptly of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or
its staff and of any request by the SEC or its staff for amendments or
supplements to the Proxy Statement or for additional information and will
supply Parent with copies of all correspondence between the Company or any of
its representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other
hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement or the Merger. If at any time prior
to the Company Shareholder Meeting there shall occur any event that should be
set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, the Company
will promptly prepare and mail to its shareholders such an amendment or
supplement. The Company will not mail any Proxy Statement, or any
amendment or supplement thereto, to which Parent reasonably objects.  
SECTION 6.04 ACCESS TO INFORMATION. (a) From the date hereof until
the Effective Time and subject to applicable law the Company shall and shall

the requirements of federal, state, local and foreign securities laws and
(iii) instruct the employees, counsel, financial advisors, auditors and other
authorized representatives of the Company and its Subsidiaries to cooperate
with Parent in its investigation of the Company and its Subsidiaries. Any
investigation pursuant to this section shall be conducted upon reasonable
notice to the Company, during regular business hours and in such manner as
not to interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the business of the Company
and its Subsidiaries.   (b) Except as required by law, Parent will hold, and
will cause its officers, directors, employees, accountants, counsel,
consultant, advisors and agents to hold, in confidence all documents and
information concerning the Company or any of its Subsidiaries furnished to
Parent or its affiliates in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement to the extent required by and in accordance with the terms of
the Confidentiality Agreement dated July 7, 2000 between the Company and
Parent (the "CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT").   SECTION 6.05 NO SOLICITATION;
OTHER OFFERS. (a) The Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its
Subsidiaries to, and shall use its best efforts to ensure that its officers,
directors or employees, or any investment bankers, consultants or other
agents retained by it or any of its Subsidiaries do not solicit, initiate,
encourage the submission of any Acquisition Proposal or engage   
-30-     in discussions or negotiations or furnish to any Person any
information with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or knowingly facilitate
any effort or attempt to make an Acquisition Proposal. The Company will
notify Parent within 48 hours of receipt by the Company of any Acquisition
Proposal or any request for nonpublic information relating to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries by any Person who, to the knowledge of the Company,
is making or considering making or who has made, an Acquisition Proposal. The
Company shall provide such notice orally and in writing including the terms
and conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal or request. The Company
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and the directors, employees and
other agents of the Company and its Subsidiaries to, cease immediately and
cause to be terminated all activities, discussions and negotiations, if any,
with any Persons conducted prior to the date hereof with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal and, to the extent within its power, to recover or cause
to be destroyed all information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries
in the possession of such Persons and their affiliates, representatives and
advisors. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Board of
Directors of the Company from complying with Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2 under
the Exchange Act with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or making any
disclosure to the Company\'s shareholders if, in the good faith judgment
of the majority of the disinterested members of the Board of Directors of
the Company, failure to so disclose would be inconsistent with applicable
law.   (b) Notwithstanding the first sentence of Section 6.05(a), the
Company may negotiate or otherwise engage in substantive discussions with,
and furnish nonpublic information to, any Person in response to an
unsolicited Acquisition Proposal by such Person if (i) the Company has
complied with the terms of this Section 6.05, (ii) a majority of the Board of
Directors of the Company reasonably determines in good faith that such
Acquisition Proposal could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior
Proposal and, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure
to take such action could reasonably be deemed to constitute a breach of its
fiduciary duties under applicable law, and (iii) such Person executes a
confidentiality agreement in substantially the form of the Confidentiality
Agreement (including the standstill provisions).   (c) Except as permitted
by the second sentence of this Section 6.05(c), neither the Board of
Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw or
modify, or publicly propose to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to
Parent, or take any action not explicitly permitted by this Agreement that
would be inconsistent with its approval of the Offer and the Merger,
(ii) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend,
any Acquisition Proposal or (iii) cause the Company to enter into any letter
of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or similar
agreement related to any Acquisition Proposal. The Board of Directors of the
Company shall be permitted (i) not to recommend to its shareholders
acceptance of the Offer and/or approval and adoption of this Agreement and
the Merger, (ii) to withdraw, or modify in a manner adverse to Parent, its
recommendation to its shareholders referred to in Section 1.02 hereof, (iii)
approve or recommend any Superior Proposal or (iv) terminate this Agreement
and in connection therewith enter into an agreement with respect to such
Superior Proposal, but only if (w) the Company has complied with the terms of
this Section 6.05, (x) the Company has received an Acquisition Proposal which
the Board of Directors determines in good faith constitutes a Superior
Proposal, (y) the Board of Directors of the Company determines in
good     -31-     faith, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, that the failure to take such action could reasonably be deemed to
be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law, and (z) no
such action is taken earlier than the third full Business Day following
Parent\'s receipt of written notice of the intention of the Company\'s Board
of Directors to do so.   (d) For purposes of this Agreement:  
"ACQUISITION PROPOSAL" means any offer or proposal for a  merger,
reorganization, consolidation, share exchange, business  combination, or
other similar transaction involving the Company or any  of its Subsidiaries
or any proposal or offer to acquire, directly or  indirectly, securities
representing more than 51% of the voting power of  the Company, or all or
substantially all of the assets of the Company  and its Subsidiaries taken as
a whole, other than the Offer and the  Merger contemplated by this
Agreement.   "SUPERIOR PROPOSAL" means any bona fide written Acquisition 
Proposal which (i) the Board of Directors of the Company determines in  good
faith (after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally  recognized
reputation and taking into account all the terms and  conditions of the
Acquisition Proposal) is more favorable to the  Company\'s shareholders (in
their capacities as shareholders) from a  financial point of view than the
Offer and Merger; and (ii) any  conditions to such Acquisition Proposal are
reasonably capable of being  satisfied promptly, including a conclusion that
financing for such  Acquisition Proposal, to the extent required, is then
committed or is in  the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the
Company,  reasonably available to the Person making such Acquisition
Proposal.   SECTION 6.06 BEST EFFORTS; NOTIFICATION. (a) Upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties
agrees to use their best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions,
and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other
parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and
make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Offer and the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
(i) the obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents
and approvals from Governmental Entities and the making of all necessary
registrations and filings (including filings with Governmental Entities, if
any) and the taking of all steps (subject to Section 6.06(g)) as may be
necessary to avoid an action or proceeding by any Governmental Entity and for
the avoidance of doubt, this shall include an obligation on Parent and
Purchaser to use their best efforts to submit all necessary commitments,
including commitments to divest, to any Governmental Entity, save that Parent
and Purchaser\'s obligation to use their best efforts to submit all necessary
commitments (as described in this Section 6.06(a)) shall not extend to the
submission of a commitment which would constitute an Unduly Burdensome
Commitment or the acceptance of an Unduly Burdensome Condition, (ii) the
obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third parties,
(iii) the defending of any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether
judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of
the    -32-    transactions contemplated hereby, including, without
limitation, seeking to have any stay or temporary restraining order entered
by any court or other Governmental Entity vacated or reversed and (iv) the
execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate
the transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of,
this Agreement. In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, the
Company and its Board of Directors shall, if any state takeover statute or
similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to the Offer, the
Merger, this Agreement or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, use their best efforts to ensure that the Offer, the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and
otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on the Offer,
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Nothing
herein shall limit or affect the Company\'s taking actions specifically
permitted by Section 6.05(b) and (c).   (b) In furtherance and without
limiting the above provisions, each of the Company and Parent shall, as
promptly as practicable following the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, (i) file with the United States Federal Trade Commission (the
"FTC") and the United States Department of Justice (the "DOJ") the
notification and report required by the HSR Act (but in no event later
than ten (10) Business Days after the date of this Agreement), (ii) file with
the European Commission under the EC Merger Regulation, the notification
required by the EC Merger Regulation (but in no event more than twenty eight
(28) days after the date of this Agreement) and (iii) file with the relevant
Governmental Entities in other jurisdictions, all other antitrust filings, if
any, required for consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby under
any applicable laws and regulations and, in each case, any supplemental
information requested in connection therewith pursuant to the HSR Act and the
EC Merger Regulation or such other laws or regulations. Any such notification
and report form and supplemental information shall be in substantial
compliance with the requirements of the HSR Act, the EC Merger Regulation and
other relevant law or regulation. Each of the Company and Parent shall
furnish to the other such necessary information and reasonable assistance as
the other may request in connection with its preparation of any filing or
submission which is necessary under the HSR Act, the EC Merger Regulation and
other relevant law or regulation. The Company and Parent shall keep each
other apprised of the status of any communications with, and any inquiries or
requests for additional information from, the FTC, the DOJ, the European
Commission or any other Governmental Entity, and shall comply promptly with
any such inquiry or request. Each of Parent and the Company shall use its
best efforts and take all other actions necessary to cause the expiration or
termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act and other
applicable law or regulation and the clearance decision under the EC Merger
Regulation and other applicable law or regulation as soon as practicable, and
to provide assistance to the other in any antitrust proceedings related to,
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   (c)
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in furtherance and not
in limitation of the covenants of the parties contained in Sections 6.06(a)
and 6.06(b), if any administrative or judicial action or proceeding,
including any proceeding by a private party, is instituted (or threatened to
be instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by
this Agreement    -33-    as violative of any applicable law, each of
the parties shall cooperate in all respects with each other and use its
respective best efforts in order to contest and resist any such action or
proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree,
judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   (d) If
any objections are asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby under any applicable law or if any suit is instituted by
any Governmental Entity or any private party challenging any of the
transactions contemplated hereby as violative of any applicable law, each of
the Company and Parent shall use its best efforts to resolve any such
objections or challenge such Governmental Entity or private party may have to
such transactions so as to permit consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.   (e) Parent and Purchaser, on the one hand,
and the Company, on the other hand, each hereby agrees promptly to provide
such information necessary to the preparation of the Offer Documents and the
Schedule 14D-1, respectively, which the respective party responsible therefor
shall reasonably request.   (f) The existence of the conditions set forth in
Section 7.01 and clauses (a) and (b) of ANNEX A shall not limit or diminish
Parent\'s or Purchaser\'s obligations pursuant to this Section 6.06 or
relieve Parent or Purchaser of any liability or damages that may result from
its breach of its obligations under this Section 6.06.   (g) Nothing in
this Section 6.06 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall require Purchaser or
Parent to agree to any Unduly Burdensome Condition or to submit any Unduly
Burdensome Commitment to any Governmental Entity in order to secure any
approval from, or in order to resolve any objection or challenge that may be
asserted by the FTC, the DOJ, the EC, any other Governmental Entity or any
private party with respect to the Offer, the Merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated hereby. For purposes of this Agreement
"Unduly Burdensome Condition" and "Unduly Burdensome Commitment" shall mean
(i) the imposition of conditions or the submission of commitments to any
Governmental Entity or (ii) the requirement of divestitures or the submission
of commitments to any Governmental Entity involving the making of
divestitures that, in the case of clauses (i) and (ii), would, individually
or in the aggregate, if offered or complied with, be reasonably likely to
have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company or a Material Adverse Effect on
the Parent; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, for the avoidance of doubt, it is agreed by
the Company and the Parent that any conditions or requirements for
divestitures or the commitments submitted to any Governmental Entity
including commitments to make divestitures that would, individually or in the
aggregate, had the same been in effect or have been completed by, or complied
with from and after the beginning of the most recently concluded fiscal year
of the Company or the Parent, as the case may be, reasonably be expected to
have resulted in a reduction of U.S. $30 million or more (at currency rates
used by the Company in preparing its financial statements for the fiscal year
ended March 31, 2000) in net sales of the Company and its consolidated
Subsidiaries or the Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries, in each case
for the most recently concluded fiscal year of the Company   
-34-     and its consolidated Subsidiaries or the Parent and its
consolidated Subsidiaries, as the case may be, from the net sales of the
Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries, or the Parent and its consolidated
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, as reported in the financial statements of
the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries, or the Parent and its
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, would constitute an Unduly Burdensome
Condition or Unduly Burdensome Commitment. For the avoidance of doubt, it is
also agreed by the Company and the Parent that any conditions or requirement
for divestitures that would, for or by the Company, the Parent and their
respective Subsidiaries in the aggregate, had the same been in effect or have
been completed by, or complied with from and after the beginning of the most
recently concluded fiscal year of the Company or the Parent, as the case may
be, reasonably be expected to have resulted in a reduction of less than U.S.
$30 million (at currency rates used by the Company in preparing its financial
statements for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2000) in net sales of the
Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries or the Parent and its consolidated
Subsidiaries, in each case for the most recently concluded fiscal year of the
Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries or the Parent and its consolidated
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, from the net sales of the Company and its
consolidated Subsidiaries, or the Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries,
as the case may be, as reported in the financial statements of the Company
and its consolidated Subsidiaries, or the Parent and its Subsidiaries, as the
case may be, would not constitute an Unduly Burdensome Condition or an Unduly
Burdensome Commitment.   SECTION 6.07 INDEMNIFICATION AND INSURANCE. (a) The
Company shall (to the fullest extent permitted by the NJBCA and regardless of
whether the Merger becomes effective), and after the Effective Time, the
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to (to the fullest extent
permitted by the NJBCA and subject to Section 6.07(d)), indemnify, defend and
hold harmless each Corporate Agent against all reasonable costs,
disbursements and attorneys\' fees, and any and all amounts in satisfaction
of settlements, judgments, fines and penalties, incurred or suffered by such
Corporate Agent in connection with any civil, criminal or arbitrative, suit,
action, proceeding or investigation by reason of his or her being or having
been such a Corporate Agent prior to and including the Effective Time
(including but not limited to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement). The Company\'s obligation under this Section 6.07(a)
shall continue for a period of six years following the Effective Time;
provided, however, that if any claims is asserted or any situation,
proceeding or investigation commenced within such six-year period, all rights
to indemnification with respect thereto shall continue until the final
disposition thereof, including appeals as used herein.   (i) "CORPORATE
AGENT" shall mean any person who is or was at any time prior to and including
the Effective Time (A) a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company,
or (B) a director, officer, trustee, employee or agent of any Other
Enterprise, serving as such at the request of the Company, or the legal
representatives of any such director, officer, trustee, employee or agent.  
(ii) "INDEMNIFIED PARTY" shall mean individually, and "INDEMNIFIED PARTIES"
shall mean collectively, the person or persons entitled to be indemnified,
defended and held harmless under this Section 6.07 or the
legal representative of such person or persons.    -35-      (iii)
"OTHER ENTERPRISE" shall mean any domestic or foreign corporation, other than
the Company, and any partnership, joint venture, sole proprietorship, trust,
or other enterprise (including any employee benefit plan), whether or not for
profit, served by a Corporate Agent.   (b) Parent and Purchaser agree that
all rights to indemnification existing in favor of the Indemnified Parties of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as provided in the Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries as
in effect as of the date hereof with respect to matters occurring prior to
the Effective Time shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force
and effect for a period of not less than the statutes of limitations
applicable to such matters, and Parent agrees to cause the Surviving
Corporation to comply fully with its obligations hereunder and thereunder.
The Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified and shall contain
indemnification and exculpation provisions which are no less favorable to the
Indemnified Parties than those provisions contained in the
Company\'s certificate of incorporation and bylaws as in effect immediately
prior to the date of this Agreement in any manner adverse to persons who, as
of the date hereof, are Indemnified Parties, without the prior written
consent of such persons, for a period of six years from and after the
Effective Time.   (c) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall
maintain, or cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain, policies of
directors and officers\' liability insurance comparable to those currently
maintained by the Company for the benefit of persons currently covered by the
Company\'s directors\' and officers\' liability insurance policies with
respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time (except to the
extent any provisions in such insurance are no longer generally available in
the market), provided that in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be
required in order to maintain such directors\' and officers\' liability
insurance policies to expend in any one year an amount in excess of 200% of
the aggregate annual premiums currently paid by the Company for such
insurance (the Company represents that the annual premium is
currently approximately $94,000), and provided further, that if the annual
premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving
Corporation shall only be obligated to obtain as much coverage as can be
obtained for a cost not exceeding such amount.   (d) In the event of any
suit, action, proceeding or investigation referred to in Section 6.07(a)
above, (i) the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall pay
the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel selected by the Indemnified
Parties, which counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Company or the
Surviving Corporation; provided, however, that neither the Company nor the
Surviving Corporation shall be obligated pursuant to this Section 6.07(d) to
pay the fees and disbursements of more than one counsel for all Indemnified
Parties in any single action except to the extent that, in the opinion of
counsel for the Indemnified Parties, two or more of such Indemnified Parties
have conflicting interests in the outcome of such action, and (ii) the
Company and the Surviving Corporation will cooperate in the defense of any
such matter; provided, however, that neither the Company nor the surviving
Corporation shall be liable for any settlement effected without its written
consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld).   
-36-      (e) In the event Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their successors or assigns merges into any other person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any person, then and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as
the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.07.
In the event the Surviving Corporation transfers any material portion of its
assets, in a single transaction or in a series of transactions, Parent will
either guarantee the indemnification obligations referred to in Section
6.07(a) or take such other action to ensure that the ability of the Surviving
Corporation to satisfy such indemnification obligations will not be
diminished in any material respect.   (f) This Section 6.07 shall survive
the consummation of the Merger at the Effective Time, is intended to benefit
the Company, Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Indemnified Parties,
and shall be binding on all successors and assigns of Parent and the
Surviving Corporation.   SECTION 6.08 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS. (a) For at least
two years from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall provide or cause to
be provided to the individuals who, immediately prior to the Effective Time,
are employed by the Company or any Subsidiary ("Company Employees")
compensation opportunities (consisting of base pay, commissions, bonus
opportunities) and employee benefits that are comparable, in the aggregate,
to the compensation and the benefits (exclusive of any such compensation and
benefits consisting of or based on any equity securities) provided under the
Employee Plans by the Company and its Subsidiaries to Company Employees
immediately prior to the Effective Time in the ordinary course of business
and not in contemplation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
The preceding sentence shall not preclude the Parent or the Surviving Entity
or its Subsidiaries at any time following the Effective Time from terminating
the employment of any Company Employee and shall, subject to the provisions
of any Employee Plan, require such compensation opportunities to be continued
to any such Company Employee only during his or her period of employment, so
long as any such terminated employee receives severance and other termination
benefits upon or in connection with such termination in an amount which is at
least equal to the severance and other termination benefits which would have
been provided to such employee if his or her employment had been terminated
for the same reason immediately prior to the Effective Time (determined with
regard to the applicable severance and other policies of the Company and its
Subsidiaries described on Section 6.08(a) of the Company Disclosure
Memorandum). Nothing contained herein shall be construed to limit, the rights
and obligations of the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company and any current
or former employee or other personnel (and where applicable, the dependents
and beneficiaries of any such employees or other personnel) under, each
Employee Plan.   (b) Each Company Employee shall be given full credit for
all service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective
predecessors under any plans or arrangements providing vacation, sick pay,
severance, retirement, pension or retiree welfare benefits maintained by
Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective affiliates in
which such Company    -37-    Employees participate for all purposes
that such service was recognized under any similar Employee Plan or other
plan or arrangement in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (other
than for benefit accrual purposes); provided, however, that any benefit
provided under such plans and arrangements maintained by Parent or the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective affiliates in respect of any
period of service prior to the Effective Time may be reduced in amount by the
benefit accrued by such Company Employee under any similar Employee Plan in
respect of the same period of service.   (c) In the event of any change in
the welfare benefits provided to Company Employees following the Effective
Time that become effective in the plan year that includes the Effective Time,
Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to (i) waive all
limitations as to pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods
with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to the
Company Employees under any such welfare benefits to the extent that such
conditions, exclusions or waiting periods would not apply in the absence of
such change and (ii) credit each Company Employee with any co-payments and
deductibles paid prior to any such change in satisfying any applicable
deductible or out-of-pocket requirements after such change for the relevant
plan year.   (d) Without limiting any of its other obligations hereunder,
Parent shall cause all of the individual agreements listed in Section
4.08(1)(A) and (B) of the Company Disclosure Memorandum to be honored in
accordance with their terms and shall assume the obligations of the Company
and its Subsidiaries thereunder. If Parent elects to terminate or cause the
termination of the Company\'s Employee Scholarship Program, then Parent shall
honor the commitments made under the Program with respect to the remaining
period of the covered education of those individuals who are affected by such
termination.   (e) Company and Parent shall give each other such assistance
as either may reasonably require in order to ensure compliance prior to the
Effective Time with any applicable law relating to any transfer of Company
Employees to Parent, including, without limitation, any collective
consultation, information provision or other statutory obligations and
requirements.   (f) The Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 will
not apply to this Section 6.08.   SECTION 6.09 PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS. Parent
and the Company will consult with each other before issuing any press release
or making any public statement (including any broadly issued statement or
announcement to employees) with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby and, except as may be required by applicable law or any
listing agreement with any national securities exchange, will not issue any
such press release or make any such public statement without the prior
consent of the other (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld).  
SECTION 6.10 FURTHER ASSURANCES. At and after the Effective Time,
the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation will be authorized
to execute and deliver, in the name and on    -38-     behalf of the
Company or Purchaser, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and
to take and do, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Purchaser, any
other actions and things to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise
in the Surviving Corporation any and all right, title and interest in, to and
under any of the rights, properties or assets of the Company acquired or to
be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in
connection with, the Merger.   SECTION 6.11 NOTICES OF CERTAIN EVENTS. Each
of the Company and Parent shall promptly notify the other of:   (a) any
representation or warranty made by it contained in this Agreement
(disregarding all qualifications and exceptions contained therein relating to
materiality or Material Adverse Effect or any similar standard
or qualification) which becomes untrue or incorrect in any respect
that individually or in the aggregate (when taken together with all
other representations and warranties that are untrue or incorrect) has had or
would be reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect;   (b) the
failure by it to perform, or comply with, in any material respect any of its
obligations, covenants, or agreements contained in this Agreement and such
failure, either individually or in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect;   (c) the Company obtaining
knowledge of a material breach by Parent, or Parent obtaining knowledge of a
material breach by the Company, of their respective representations,
warranties or covenants hereunder of which the breaching party has not
already given notice pursuant to clauses (a) or (b) above;   (d) any notice
or other communication from any Person alleging that the consent of such
Person is or may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement;   (e) any notice or other communication from any
Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement;   (f) any actions, suits, claims, investigations, orders,
decrees, complaints or proceedings commenced or, to its knowledge, threatened
against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting the Company, Parent
or any of their respective Subsidiaries that relate to the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; or   (g) the occurrence of
any other event which would reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company or cause any condition set forth in ANNEX A hereto to
be unsatisfied in any material respect at any time prior to consummation of
the Offer;    -39-     provided, however, that the delivery of any
notice pursuant to this Section 6.11 shall not limit or otherwise affect the
remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice.   SECTION
6.12 ISRA PROCEDURES.   (a) At its own cost and expense, the Company shall
comply with all obligations pursuant to ISRA resulting from the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement required to be complied with prior to the
Effective Time. At the Company\'s option, Company may seek a determination
from NJDEP that compliance with ISRA is not required by reason of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in the form of an application
for a letter of ISRA nonapplicability or deferral (an "LNA") for each
facility or place of business in New Jersey owned or operated by the Company.
If NJDEP approves an LNA for any site, the LNA shall fulfill any liability of
the Company for compliance with the provisions of this Agreement to ISRA for
such site (a "SITE"). If an LNA is denied for any Site or the Company elects
not to seek an LNA for any Site, then the Company shall seek and make all
filings necessary to obtain prior to Closing NJDEP approval of a remediation
agreement (as the term is used in ISRA) with respect to such Site (a
"REMEDIATION AGREEMENT"). The terms of any Remediation Agreement entered into
for a Site shall obligate the Company after the Effective Time to satisfy the
requirements of ISRA triggered by the Merger, and otherwise to investigate
and remediate the Site. NJDEP and the Company shall sign any such Remediation
Agreement prior to the Effective Time, and the Company will provide or commit
to provide any required remediation funding source. The Company shall provide
Purchaser with drafts of all submissions to NJDEP regarding ISRA exemption or
compliance at least three (3) business days in advance of submission to NJDEP
for review and approval by Parent or its designee, which approval shall not
be unreasonably withheld. From time to time, at the Company\'s request, the
Purchaser and the Parent shall execute such documents and take all other
lawful action as the Company may reasonably request to assist the Company in
obtaining an LNA or a Remediation Agreement as contemplated hereby.   (b)
Purchaser expressly waives any and all rights under ISRA and the Solid Waste
Management Act to void this Agreement and/or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby on, before or after the Effective Time.
Further, in no event shall any officer, director, shareholder or employee of
the Company have any liability to Parent, Purchaser or the Company for the
costs of compliance with ISRA or any Remediation Agreement.    (c) As used
herein,   (i) "ISRA" means collectively, New Jersey\'s Industrial Site 
Recovery Act, N.J.S.A. ss.13:1K-6 ET SEQ. and the Brownfield and 
Contaminated Site Remediation Act f/k/a the Hazardous Discharge Site 
Remediation Site Act, N.J.S.A. ss.58:10B-1 ET SEQ., both as amended,  and all
applicable regulations, orders or directives adopted thereunder  or
pertaining thereto.     -40-        (ii) "NJDEP" means the New
Jersey Department of Environmental  Protection, and its successors.   (iii)
"REMEDIATION AGREEMENT" shall have the meaning ascribed  to it in Section
6.12 of this Agreement.   ARTICLE 7  CONDITIONS TO THE MERGER   SECTION

have used best efforts (subject to Section 6.06(g)) to prevent the entry of
any such injunction or other order and to appeal as promptly as possible
any injunction or other order that may be entered; and   (d) the HSR/EC
Condition shall be satisfied; and   (e) if the Company has not sought and
obtained an LNA for any Site, approval of a Remediation Agreement covering

shall have withdrawn or modified in a manner  adverse to Parent or Purchaser
its approval or recommendation of the  Offer, the Merger or the Agreement, or
approved or recommended any  Acquisition Proposal or (B) the Company shall
have entered into any  agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal,
including a  Superior Proposal entered into in accordance with the second
sentence  of Section 6.05(c) of this Agreement.   SECTION 8.02 EFFECT OF

Company or Parent as provided in Section 8.01, this Agreement shall forthwith
become void and have no effect, without any liability or obligation on the
part of Parent, Purchaser or the Company, other than the provisions of

Title: Chairman         ANNEX A   CONDITIONS TO THE OFFER  
Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings given
to such terms in the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "AGREEMENT") of which

Company Common Stock and (subject to any such rules or regulations) may delay
the acceptance for payment of or the payment for any tendered shares of
Company Common Stock and (except as provided in the Agreement) amend or
terminate the Offer if (i) there are not validly tendered (and not properly

or any of its affiliates, will at least satisfy the Minimum Condition, (ii)
the HSR/EC Condition has not been satisfied or (iii) at any time on or after

on behalf of any Governmental Entity that has a reasonable likelihood of
success (i) challenging or seeking to make illegal, materially delay or
otherwise, directly or indirectly prohibit the making of the Offer, the
acceptance for payment of any Company Common Stock by Parent or Purchaser, or
the consummation of the Merger or (ii) seeking to require divestiture by
Parent or Purchaser of any Company Common Stock; or   (b) there has been any
statute, rule, regulation, injunction, order or decree, enacted, enforced,
promulgated, issued or deemed applicable to the Offer or the Merger, by any
Governmental Entity that results in any of the consequences referred to in
clauses (i) or (ii) of paragraph (a) above; or   (c) the Agreement shall
have been terminated in accordance with its terms or any event shall have
occurred which gives the Parent or Purchaser the right to terminate the
Agreement or not consummate the Merger; or   (d) (i) any representation or
warranty of the Company contained in the Agreement (disregarding all
qualifications and exceptions contained therein relating to materiality or
Material Adverse Effect or any similar standard or qualification), shall not
be true in any respect that, individually or in the aggregate (when taken
together with all other representations and warranties are not true and
correct), has had or would reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company, as of the date of determination, as if made at and as
of such time (except to the extent that any such representation or warranty,
by its terms, is expressly limited to a specific date, in which case such
representation or warranty shall not be true and correct as of such date),
provided that such    A-1      breaches are incapable of being cured
or have not been cured prior to the Initial Expiration Date (or such later
date upon which the Offer shall expire in accordance with Section 1.01(b) of
the Agreement); or   (e) the Company shall have failed to perform or comply
with, any of its obligations, covenants or agreements contained in the
Agreement, and such failure, either individually or in the aggregate, has had
or would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company, provided that such failures to perform are incapable of being cured
or have not been cured prior to the Initial Expiration Date (or such later
date upon which the Offer shall expire in accordance with Section 1.01(b) of
the Agreement); or   (f) there shall have occurred (i) any general
suspension of trading in, or limitation on prices for, securities on any
national securities exchange or in the over-the-counter market in the United
States (other than a shortening of trading hours or any coordinated trading
halt triggered solely as a result of a specified increase or decrease in a
market index), (ii) a declaration of a banking moratorium or any suspension
of payments in respect of banks in the United States, (iii) any limitation
(whether or not mandatory) by any governmental entity on, or other event that
materially and adversely affects, the extension of credit by banks or other
lending institutions, (iv) a commencement of a war or armed hostilities or
other national or international calamity directly or indirectly involving the
United States or (v) in the case of any of the foregoing existing at the time
of the execution of the Agreement, a material acceleration or worsening
thereof; or   (g) the Board of Directors of the Company or any
committee thereof, (i) shall have withdrawn or modified in a manner adverse
to Parent or Purchaser (including by amendment of the Schedule 14D-9) its
approval or recommendation of the Offer, the Merger or the Agreement or (ii)
shall have resolved to do any of the foregoing;   (h) the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries (or the Board of Directors, or any committee thereof) shall
have approved, recommended, authorized, or proposed any Acquisition Proposal,
or has resolved to do any of the foregoing; or   (i) there shall have
occurred and be continuing any event occurrence, development or state of
circumstances that, either individually or in the aggregate, has had or is
reasonably likely to have, a Material Adverse Effect provided that such
Material Adverse Effect is incapable of being cured or has not been cured
prior to the Initial Expiration Date (or such later date upon which the Offer
shall expire in accordance with Section 1.01(b) of this Agreement).   which
in the good faith judgment of Parent or Purchaser, in any such case, and
regardless of the circumstances giving rise to such condition, and provided
that Purchaser and Parent have performed all of their respective obligations
under Section 6.06 herein, makes it inadvisable to proceed with the Offer or
the acceptance for payment of or payment for the Company Common Stock.   
A-2       The foregoing conditions (x) are for the sole benefit
of Parent and Purchaser and, (y) may be asserted by Parent and Purchaser,
and except for the Minimum Condition, subject to the terms of the Agreement,
may be waived by Parent and Purchaser, in whole or in part, at any time and
from time to time, in the sole discretion of Parent and Purchaser. The
failure of Parent or Purchaser at any time to exercise any of the foregoing
rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right, and each right shall
be deemed a continuing right which may be asserted at any time and from time
to time.  Any determination by Parent or Purchaser to terminate the Offer
will be final and binding, but shall not affect any rights of any party under
the Agreement. Notwithstanding the fact that the Parent and Purchaser reserve
the right to assert the failure of a condition following acceptance for
payment but prior to payment in order to delay payment or cancel their
obligation to pay for properly tendered shares of Company Common Stock, the
Parent and Purchaser will either promptly pay for such Company Common Stock
or promptly return such Company Common Stock. Should the Offer be terminated
pursuant to the foregoing provisions, all tendered shares of Company Common
Stock not theretofore accepted for payment pursuant thereto shall forthwith
be returned to the tendering shareholders.     A-3       ANNEX
