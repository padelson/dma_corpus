SECTION 2.01 _The Merger_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, Merger Subsidiary shall be merged (the "Merger")
with and into the Company in accordance with the MBCA, whereupon the separate
existence of Merger Subsidiary shall cease, and the Company shall be the
surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation").

 

(b) Subject to the provisions of Article 9, the closing of the Merger (the
"Closing") shall take place in New York City at the offices of Nixon Peabody
LLP, 437 Madison Avenue, New York, New York 10022 ( _provided_ that documents
may be delivered and exchanged at the Closing by facsimile, PDF, or other
electronic means) as soon as possible, but in any event no 

 



11  later than two Business Days after the date the conditions set forth in
Article 9 (other than conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at
the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent permissible,
waiver of those conditions at the Closing) have been satisfied or, to the
extent permissible, waived by the party or parties entitled to the benefit of
such conditions, or at such other place or time as Parent and the Company may
mutually agree.

(c) At the Closing, the Company and Merger Subsidiary shall file articles of
merger with the Minnesota Secretary of State and make all other filings or

time as may be specified in such articles of merger).

(d) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
possess all the rights, powers, privileges and franchises and be subject to
all of the obligations, liabilities, restrictions and disabilities of the
Company and Merger Subsidiary, all as provided under the MBCA.

SECTION 2.02 _Conversion of Shares_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any further action on the part of Parent, Merger
Subsidiary, the Company, or any of the shareholders of the Company:

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 2.02 or Section 2.04, each
Share outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
into the right to receive (i) $3.62 in cash (the "Base Consideration"), plus
(ii) the Additional Consideration, if any (together with the Base
Consideration, the "Merger Consideration"), in each such case, without
interest. As of the Effective Time, all such Shares shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease
to exist, and each Share shall thereafter represent only the right to receive
the Merger Consideration to be paid in accordance with Section 2.03, without
interest.

 

(b) Each Share owned by Parent or Merger Subsidiary immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be canceled, and no payment shall be made with respect
thereto.

(c) Each Share held by any Subsidiary of either the Company or Parent (other
than the Merger Subsidiary) immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
canceled, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto.

(d) Each share of common stock of Merger Subsidiary outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one fully paid
and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation with the
same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted and shall
constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

SECTION 2.03  _Surrender and Payment_.

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall, at its sole cost and expense,
appoint the Companys transfer agent or another bank or trust company
reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as exchange agent (the "Exchange
Agent") for the purpose of exchanging for

 



12  the aggregate Merger Consideration (i) certificates representing Shares (the
"Certificates") or (ii) uncertificated Shares (the "Uncertificated Shares").
At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent or one of its Affiliates shall
deposit or cause to be deposited with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of
the holders of the Shares, the aggregate Merger Consideration to be paid
in accordance with this Article 2 other than Merger Consideration to be paid
in respect of Convertible Notes, which will be made available to the Exchange
Agent as and when needed.

 

(b) As reasonably promptly as practicable after the Effective Time (and in any
event within five Business Days after the Effective Time), Parent will cause
the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of Shares a form of letter
of transmittal (the "Letter of Transmittal") (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title with respect to the
Certificates and Uncertificated Shares shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates and Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange Agent, shall be in such
form and have such other provisions (including customary provisions
with respect to delivery of an "agents message" with respect to
Uncertificated Shares) as Parent may specify subject to the Companys
reasonable approval, and shall be prepared prior to the Closing), together
with instructions thereto.

(c) Each holder of a Share that has been converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive, upon (i) surrender to
the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly completed letter
of transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an "agents message" by the Exchange Agent
(or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Exchange Agent may
reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated
Shares, the Merger Consideration payable for each Share represented by a
Certificate or for each Uncertificated Share. Until so surrendered or
transferred, as the case may be, each Share represented by a Certificate or
Uncertificated Share shall represent after the Effective Time for all purposes
only the right to receive the Merger Consideration.

 

(d) If any portion of the aggregate Merger Consideration is to be paid to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the
transferred Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to
such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or
shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share
shall be properly transferred and (ii) the Person requesting such payment
shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other Taxes required as a
result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of the
Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

(e) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers of Shares. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the portion of the
aggregate Merger Consideration provided for, and in accordance with the
procedures set forth, in this Article 2\.

 

(f) Any portion of the aggregate Merger Consideration deposited with the
Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 2.03(a) (and any interest or other income
earned thereon) that remains unclaimed by the holders of Shares one year after
the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent or one of its Affiliates, upon
demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged its Shares for 

 



13  the applicable portion of the aggregate Merger Consideration in accordance
with this Section 2.03 prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent
for payment of the portion of the aggregate Merger Consideration in respect
of such Shares without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates shall be liable to any holder of
Shares for any amounts paid to a public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

(g) Any portion of the aggregate Merger Consideration deposited with
the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 2.03(a) to pay for Shares for which
appraisal rights have been perfected shall be returned to Parent or one of its
Affiliates upon demand.

 

SECTION 2.04 _Dissenting Shares._ Notwithstanding Section 2.02, each Share
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who
has not voted in favor of the Plan of Merger and who has properly demanded
appraisal for its Shares in accordance with Sections 302A.471 and 302A.473 of
the MBCA and who has otherwise complied with all applicable provisions
of Sections 302A.471 and 302A.473 of the MBCA, shall not be converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration, but the holder of such Share
shall be entitled only to such rights as are granted by Sections 302A.471 and
302A.473 of the MBCA ("Dissenting Shares"), unless such holder fails to
perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses the right to appraisal under Sections
302A.471 and 302A.473 of the MBCA. If, either before or after the Effective
Time, such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or loses the right to appraisal
under Sections 302A.471 and 302A.473 of the MBCA, each Share held by that
holder shall automatically be converted as of the Effective Time into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.02(a).
The Company shall give Parent notice within one Business Day of any demands
received by the Company for appraisal of Shares, and Parent shall have the
right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such
demands. Except with the prior written consent of Parent, the Company shall
not voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or offer to settle or
settle, any such demands.

 

SECTION 2.05 _Company Stock Options_.

 

(a) The Company shall take all action necessary to cause each option to
purchase Shares outstanding under any Employee Plan (each, a "Company Stock
Option") to be vested and exercisable at least 10 Business Days prior to the
Closing Date.

(b) At least 10 Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall
provide written notice to each holder of a Company Stock Option that such
holder shall, during the period beginning on the date of such notice and
ending two Business Days prior to the Closing Date (the "Exercise Period"),
have the right to exercise such Company Stock Option by providing the Company
with a notice of exercise and full payment of the applicable exercise price in
accordance with the terms of such Company Stock Option. Each Company Stock
Option that remains unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be canceled at the Effective Time. In consideration of such cancellation, each
holder shall have the right to receive a compensation payment for each Share
subject to such Company Stock Option equal to the Merger Consideration less
the per share exercise price of each option (if such exercise price is less
than the Merger Consideration) (the "Option Consideration"), less all
applicable Tax withholdings, and no such compensation payment shall be payable
if such exercise price equals

 



14  or exceeds the Merger Consideration. Subject to any Tax withholding
requirements, the Surviving Corporation shall pay each holder the Option
Consideration within two Business Days after Closing. 

SECTION 2.06 _Company Restricted Shares and Restricted Stock Units_.

 

(a) Each Share subject to vesting, repurchase or other lapse restrictions that
is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a "Restricted
Share") shall be vested and all restrictions thereon shall lapse. Subject to
any Tax withholding requirements applicable to such vesting, each Restricted
Share vesting in accordance with this Section 2.06 shall be treated as
provided in Section 2.02 and Section 2.03 of this Agreement and subject to the
terms and conditions applicable to Shares under this Agreement.

 

(b) Each restricted stock unit outstanding under the Companys equity
incentive plan(s) shall be vested and shall be settled by issuance of Shares
in accordance with such plan(s) immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Subject to any Tax withholding requirements applicable to such vesting and
settlement, each Share resulting from such vesting and settlement in
accordance with this Section 2.06 shall be treated as provided in Section
2.02 and Section 2.03 of this Agreement and subject to the terms and
conditions applicable to Shares under this Agreement.

 

SECTION 2.07 _Adjustments._ If, during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding Shares shall be changed
into a different number of shares or a different class (including by reason of
any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange
or readjustment of Shares, or stock dividend thereon with a record date
during such period, but excluding any change that results from any issuance
of Shares permitted by Section 6.01(c)), the Merger Consideration and any
other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be appropriately
adjusted.

 

SECTION 2.08 _Withholding Rights_. Notwithstanding any provision contained
herein to the contrary, each of the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation
and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Article 2 such amounts as it
is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under any applicable provision of Tax law. If the Exchange Agent, the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, so withholds amounts,
such amounts shall be remitted by the Exchange Agent, the Surviving
Corporation, or Parent, as the case may be, to the applicable Governmental
Authority and will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to such Person in respect of which the Exchange Agent, the Surviving
Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, made such deduction and
withholding.

SECTION 2.09 _Lost Certificates._ If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, an agreement, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Parent, to indemnify the Surviving Corporation
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate, the portion of the aggregate Merger Consideration to
be paid in respect of the Shares represented by such Certificate, as
contemplated by this Article 2\.

 



15 SECTION 2.10 _Determination of Additional Consideration_.

 

(a) _Cash Statement_. Within five Business Days after the Measurement Date,
the Company will prepare and deliver to Parent a statement setting forth the
amount of Cash as of the Measurement Date, which statement shall be certified

(b) _Net Cash_. Within five Business Days after the Measurement Date, the
Company shall deliver to Parent a statement certified by the Chief Financial

reasonably satisfactory to Parent from the administrative agent under
the Revolving Credit and Term Loan Facility stating all amounts payable or
otherwise outstanding in respect of the Revolving Credit and Term Loan

Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the Company
will immediately notify Parent of any borrowings under the Revolving Credit

supersede any previously-delivered Net Cash Statement and will be deemed to be

updated letter or other documentation reasonably satisfactory to Parent from
the administrative agent under the Revolving Credit and Term Loan Facility
stating all amounts payable or otherwise outstanding in respect of the

as applicable, will become final and binding at the end of such three
Business Day period or such earlier date as may be mutually agreed by the
Company and Parent. During such period, Parent and its representatives and
their advisors will be permitted to review all books, records, working
papers, materials and information used by the Company or its representatives
in preparing the Cash Statement or the Net Cash Statement, as applicable, and
the Company will make available such personnel as are reasonably necessary to
assist Parent in its review of the Cash Statement or Net Cash Statement, as
applicable. Any Notice of Objection must specify in reasonable detail the
basis for the objections set forth therein. Notwithstanding any provision of
this Agreement to the contrary, if required to resolve a dispute with respect
to the Cash Statement or Net Cash Statement, the Closing will be delayed
pending resolution of such dispute and the satisfaction of conditions to
Closing.

 

(ii) If Parent provides the Notice of Objection to the Company within such
three Business Day period, then Parent and the Company will, during the three
Business

 



16  Day period following the Companys receipt of the Notice of Objection,
attempt in good faith to resolve Parents objections. During such three
Business Day period, the Company and its representatives and their advisors
will be permitted to review the working papers of Parent and, if applicable,
Parents representatives, relating to the Notice of Objection and the basis
therefor. If Parent and the Company are unable to resolve all such objections
within such three Business Day period, the matters remaining in dispute that
were properly included in the Notice of Objection will be submitted to
PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLP (or, if such firm declines to act, to
another nationally recognized public accounting firm mutually agreed upon by
Parent and the Company in writing and, if Parent and the Company are unable to
so agree within one Business Day after the end of such three Business Day
period, then Parent and the Company will each select such a firm and such
firms will jointly select a third nationally recognized public accounting firm
to resolve the disputed matters (such selected firm being the "Independent
Expert")). Parent and the Company will instruct the Independent Expert to
render its reasoned decision as promptly as practicable but in no event later
than five Business Days after its selection. The resolution of disputed items
by the Independent Expert will be final and binding, and the determination of
the Independent Expert will constitute an arbitral award that is final,
binding and non-appealable and upon which a judgment may be entered by a court
having jurisdiction over the party against which such determination is to be
enforced. The fees and expenses of the Independent Expert will be paid by
Parent. Cash, as set forth in the Cash Statement, as adjusted pursuant to this
Section 2.10(c)(ii), and Net Cash, as set forth in the Net Cash Statement, so
adjusted, will be deemed to be the amounts of Cash and Net Cash for purposes
of calculating the Additional Consideration.

cancellation, acceleration or other change of any right or obligation or the
loss of any benefit to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
entitled under any provision of any Contract or other instrument binding upon
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any license, franchise, permit,
certificate, approval or other similar authorization affecting, or relating in
any way to, the assets or business of the Company and its Subsidiaries or
(iv) result in the creation or imposition of any Lien on any asset of the

made known to the Companys principal executive officer and its principal
financial officer, particularly during the periods in which the periodic

controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting the Companys
principal executive officer and principal financial officer to material
information required to be included in the Companys periodic and current
reports required under the 1934 Act. For purposes of this Agreement,
"principal executive officer" and "principal financial officer" shall have

(f) The Company and its Subsidiaries have established and maintain a system
of internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f)

Company financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP.

controls in connection with the Company Form 10-Q, to the Companys auditors
and audit committee (i) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses
in the design or operation of internal controls which are reasonably likely to
adversely affect the Companys ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial information, except as would not reasonably be expected to be
material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and (ii) any
fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees
who have a role in internal controls. The Company has made available to Parent
a summary of any such disclosure made by management to the Companys auditors
and audit committee since the Applicable Date.

named executive officers in connection with the Merger and in respect of the
approval of an increase in the conversion rate for the Convertible Notes in
connection with the Merger (the "Company Proxy Statement") or any amendment
or supplement thereto is first mailed to shareholders of the Company and at
the time such shareholders vote on approval and adoption of this Agreement,
the Company Proxy Statement, as supplemented or amended, if applicable, will
not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading.

(b) The representations and warranties contained in this Section 4.09 will
not apply to statements or omissions included or incorporated by reference in
the Company Proxy Statement based upon information supplied by Parent, Merger
Subsidiary or any of their respective representatives or advisors for use

(1) violate the terms of any confidentiality agreement or other Contract with
a Third Party ( _provided_ that the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain the required consent of such Third Party to such access or
disclosure); (2) result in the loss of any attorney-client privilege (
_provided_ that the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow
for such access or disclosure (or as much of it as possible) in a manner that
does not result in a loss of attorney-client privilege); or (3) violate any
Applicable Law ( _provided_ that the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to provide such access or make such disclosure in a manner that does
not violate Applicable Law). Nothing in this Agreement will require the
Company to provide any access or make any disclosure to Parent under
this Section 6.02 to the extent such access or information is reasonably
pertinent to a litigation where the Company or any of its Affiliates, on the
one hand, and Parent or any of its Affiliates, on the other hand, are adverse
parties. All information exchanged pursuant to this Section 6.02 is subject
to the Confidentiality Agreement.

SECTION 6.03 _Company Shareholder Meeting_.

(a) The Company shall cause a meeting of its shareholders (the "Company
Shareholder Meeting") to be duly called and notice thereof given as promptly
as practicable and in any event within 10 Business Days after, and convened
and held as promptly as reasonably practicable after, the SEC or its staff
advises that it has no further comments on the Company Proxy Statement or
that the Company may commence mailing the Company Proxy Statement for the
purpose of voting on (i) the approval and adoption of this Agreement
(including the Plan of Merger), (ii) the approval of an increase in
the conversion rate for the Convertible Notes in connection with the Merger,
and (iii) in accordance with Section 14A of the 1934 Act and the applicable
SEC rules issued thereunder, the approval of a non-binding, advisory
resolution to approve certain compensation that may become payable to the
Companys named executive officers in connection with the Merger. The Company
shall comply with all Applicable Law with respect to such meeting and the
solicitation of proxies in connection therewith. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, unless this Agreement has terminated in
accordance with its terms, this Agreement and the Merger shall be submitted to
the Companys shareholders at the Company Shareholder Meeting whether or not
(x) the Board of Directors shall have effected an Adverse Recommendation
Change or an Intervening Event Recommendation Change or (y) any Acquisition
Proposal shall have been publicly announced or otherwise communicated
or submitted to the Board of Directors or to the shareholders of the

 



46  Company. The Company shall cause the Company Proxy Statement to be mailed to
the shareholders of the Company as of the record date established for the
Company Shareholders Meeting as promptly as reasonably practicable
thereafter. Unless an Adverse Recommendation Change or an Intervening Event
Recommendation Change shall have occurred in compliance with Section 6.04 of
this Agreement, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to solicit
from the Companys shareholders proxies in favor of the adoption of this
Agreement and for approval of an increase in the conversion rate for the
Convertible Notes in connection with the Merger, including engaging a proxy
solicitor that is reasonably acceptable to Parent.

(b) Subject to Section 6.04, the Board of Directors shall make the Company
Board Recommendation and not effect an Adverse Recommendation Change or an
Intervening Event Recommendation Change.

(c) Any adjournment, delay or postponement of the Company Shareholder Meeting
shall require the prior written consent of Parent; _provided_ that the Company
shall be permitted to adjourn, delay or postpone the Company Shareholder
Meeting (i) with the consent of Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) for the absence of a quorum or (ii) after
consultation with Parent, solely to the extent necessary to ensure that any
legally required supplement or amendment to the Company Proxy Statement is
provided to the shareholders of the Company with adequate time to review.
Parent may require the Company to adjourn, delay or postpone the Company
Shareholder Meeting once for a period not to exceed 30 calendar days (but
prior to the date that is two Business Days prior to the End Date) to solicit
additional proxies necessary to obtain the Company Shareholder Approval. Once
the Company has established a record date for the Company Shareholder Meeting,
the Company shall not change such record date or establish a different record
date for the Company Shareholders Meeting without the prior written consent of
Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or
delayed), unless required to do so by Applicable Law or the Companys
organizational documents. Without the prior written consent of Parent, the
adoption of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including
the Plan of Merger) and the other proposals contemplated by Section 6.03
shall be the only matters (other than matters of procedure and matters
required by Applicable Law to be voted on by the Companys shareholders in
connection with the approval of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby) that the Company shall propose to be acted
on by the shareholders of the Company at the Company Shareholder Meeting.

 

SECTION 6.04 _No Solicitation; Other Offers_.

 

(a) _General Prohibitions_. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
shall, nor shall the Company or any of its Subsidiaries authorize or direct
any of its or their officers, directors, employees, investment bankers,
attorneys, accountants, consultants or other agents, representatives, or
advisors ("Representatives") to, directly or indirectly (i) solicit, initiate
or take any action to knowingly facilitate or encourage (including by way of
furnishing non-public information) the submission of any Acquisition Proposal
or any inquiry, proposal, request for non-public information or offer that
would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal (an
"Acquisition Inquiry"), (ii) enter into or participate in any discussions or
negotiations with, furnish any non-public information relating to the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or afford access to the business, properties,
assets, books or records of the Company

 



47  or any of its Subsidiaries to, otherwise cooperate in any way with, or
knowingly assist, participate in, facilitate or encourage any effort by any
Third Party that has made, or would reasonably be expected to make an
Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry, (iii) fail to make, withdraw or
modify in a manner adverse to Parent the Company Board Recommendation (or
recommend an Acquisition Proposal or take any action or make any public
statement inconsistent with the Company Board Recommendation) (any of the
foregoing in this clause (iii), an "Adverse Recommendation Change"), (iv)
grant any waiver or release under any standstill or similar Contract with
respect to any class of equity securities of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries ( _provided_ that the Company shall not be required to enforce,
and shall be permitted to waive, any provision of any such Contract that
prohibits or purports to prohibit a confidential proposal being made to the
Board of Directors), (v) approve any transaction under, or any Person (other
than Parent or Merger Subsidiary) becoming an "interested shareholder"
under, Section 302A.673 of the MBCA or (vi) enter into any agreement in
principle, letter of intent, term sheet, merger agreement, acquisition
agreement, option agreement or other similar instrument or Contract relating
to an Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry. It is agreed that any
violation of the restrictions on the Company set forth in this Section 6.04 by
any Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be a breach
of this Section by the Company.

 

(b) _Exceptions_. Notwithstanding Section 6.04(a), at any time after the date
of this Agreement and prior to the receipt of the Company Shareholder
Approval,

(i) the Company, directly or indirectly through its Representatives, may (A)
enter into or participate in negotiations or discussions with, or take or
fail to take any of the other actions described in Sections 6.04(a)(ii) and
6.04(a)(iv) with respect to, any Third Party and its Representatives that,
subject to the Companys material compliance with Section 6.04(a), has made
after the execution and delivery of this Agreement a _bona fide_ , written
Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors has in good faith determined
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors)
that (1) such Acquisition Proposal is or is reasonably likely to lead to a
Superior Proposal, and such Acquisition Proposal has not been withdrawn and
(2) the failure to take such action would be a breach of its fiduciary duties
under Applicable Law and (B) furnish to such Third Party or its
Representatives non-public information relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or afford access to the business, properties, assets, books or
records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, pursuant to an executed
confidentiality agreement (a copy of which shall be provided for informational
purposes only to Parent) with such Third Party with terms no less favorable to
the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_
that all such information (to the extent that such information has not been
previously provided or made available to Parent) is provided or made available
to Parent, as the case may be, prior to or substantially concurrently with
the time it is provided or made available to such Third Party; and

(ii) the Board of Directors may (1) make an Adverse Recommendation Change in
connection with a Superior Proposal or (2) other than in connection with an
Acquisition Proposal or a Superior Proposal, fail to make, withdraw or modify
in a manner adverse to Parent the Company Board Recommendation (an
"Intervening Event Recommendation Change") in response to an Intervening
Event, if, in either case, the Board of Directors has in good faith determined
after receipt of the Superior Proposal or the occurrence of

 



48  such Intervening Event, as applicable, and after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that the failure of the Board of
Directors to take such action would be a breach of its fiduciary duties under
Applicable Law.

In addition, nothing contained herein shall prevent the Board of Directors
from issuing a "stop, look and listen" communication pursuant to Rule 14d-9
under the 1934 Act or complying with Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) under the
1934 Act with regard to an Acquisition Proposal or from making any disclosure
to the Companys shareholders if the Board of Directors (after consultation
with outside legal counsel) concludes that its failure to do so would be a
breach of its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law, so long as any action
taken or statement made to so comply is consistent with this Section 6.04;
_provided_ that any such action taken or statement made (other than any "stop,
look and listen" statement) that relates to an Acquisition Proposal shall be
deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change unless the Board of Directors
reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation in such statement or in connection
with such action.

 

(c) _Required Notices_. The Board of Directors shall not take any of the
actions referred to in Section 6.04(b) unless the Company shall have
delivered to Parent a prior written notice advising Parent that it intends to
take such action and a reasonably detailed explanation of the basis therefor,
including of any Acquisition Proposal or Intervening Event, and, after taking
such action, (i) in the case of Section 6.04(b)(i) or Section 6.04(b)(ii)(1),
the Company shall continue to advise Parent on a current basis in all material
respects of the status and terms of any discussions and negotiations with
the Third Party and (ii) in the case of Section 6.04(b)(ii)(2), the Company
shall continue to advise Parent of any material facts, events, changes,
developments or changes in circumstances relating to such Intervening Event
that arise or occur thereafter. In addition, the Company shall notify Parent
orally within 24 hours, and in writing as promptly as reasonably practicable
(but in no event later than one Business Day), after receipt, by the Company
(or, to the Companys Knowledge, by any of its Representatives) of any
Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry. The Company shall provide such
notice in writing and shall identify the Third Party making, and the terms and
conditions of, any such Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry and shall
provide Parent with a copy of any such Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall
keep Parent informed, on a current basis in all material respects, of the
status and details of any such Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry
(including any material changes to the financial terms or other material terms
and conditions thereof) or any Intervening Event, and shall promptly (but in
no event later than one Business Day after receipt) provide to Parent copies
of all correspondence and written materials sent or provided to the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries that describes any terms or conditions of any
Acquisition Proposal (as well as written summaries of any oral communications
addressing such matters) or describes any Intervening Event. None of the
Company or the Board of Directors or any committee of the Board of Directors
shall enter into any Contract with any Person to limit or not give prior
notice to Parent of its intention to make an Adverse Recommendation Change or
an Intervening Event Recommendation Change or to terminate this Agreement in
light of a Superior Proposal or an Intervening Event.

 

(d) " _Last Look_ ". Further, the Board of Directors shall not make an Adverse
Recommendation Change or an Intervening Event Recommendation Change pursuant
to Section 6.04(b) (or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
10.01(d)(i)), unless (i) if (A)

 



49  any such Adverse Recommendation Change is to be taken in circumstances
involving or relating to an Acquisition Proposal, (1) such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, (2) the Company promptly provides
written notice to Parent at least five Business Days before taking such action
of its intention to do so and containing in the case of any action intended to
be taken in circumstances involving or relating to an Acquisition Proposal,
the material terms of such Acquisition Proposal, including the most current
version of the proposed Contract under which such Acquisition Proposal is
proposed to be consummated and the identity of the Third Party making
the Acquisition Proposal and (3) Parent does not make, within five Business
Days after its receipt of that written notification, an offer that in the case
of any action intended to be taken in circumstances involving or relating to
an Acquisition Proposal, is at least as favorable to the shareholders of the
Company as such Acquisition Proposal (it being understood and agreed that any
amendment to the financial terms or other material terms of such Acquisition
Proposal shall require a new written notification from the Company and a new
five-Business Day period under this Section 6.04(d)); and (B) any such
Intervening Event Recommendation Change is to be taken, the Company (1)
promptly provides written notice to Parent at least five Business Days before
taking such action of its intention to do so and specifying in reasonable
detail the circumstances involving or relating to the Intervening Event, (2)
prior to effecting such Intervening Event Recommendation Change and during
such period of at least five Business Days, the Company shall have negotiated
with Parent in good faith (if Parent desires to negotiate) to make such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement in such a manner
that such Intervening Event no longer necessitates such Intervening Event
Recommendation Change, and (3) at or following such period of at least five
Business Days, the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that such
Intervening Event continues to necessitate such Intervening Event
Recommendation Change (taking into account any revisions to this Agreement
made or proposed in writing by Parent) and that failure of the Board of
Directors to effect an Intervening Event Recommendation Change would be a
breach of its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law. The Company agrees that,
during any applicable five-Business Day period referred to in this Section
6.04(d), the Company and its Representatives shall negotiate in good faith
with Parent and its Representatives regarding any revisions proposed by Parent
to the terms of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. No
Adverse Recommendation Change or Intervening Event Recommendation Change
shall change the approval of the Board of Directors for purposes of causing
any Takeover Statute to be inapplicable to the Merger or any other transaction
involving Parent contemplated by this Agreement.

(e) _Definition of Superior Proposal_. For purposes of this Agreement,
"Superior Proposal" means a _bona fide_ , unsolicited written Acquisition
Proposal, which did not result from or arise out of a breach in any material
respect of this Section 6.04, made after the date of this Agreement for at
least a majority of the outstanding Shares or all or substantially all of the
consolidated assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries on terms that the
Board of Directors determines in good faith, after considering the advice of a
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and outside legal
counsel and taking into account all the terms and conditions of the
Acquisition Proposal, including any break-up fees, expense reimbursement
provisions, expected time to close, and conditions to consummation and all
legal, financial and regulatory aspects of such Acquisition Proposal, are
more favorable from a financial point of view to the Companys shareholders
than as provided hereunder (taking into account any proposal by Parent to
amend the terms of this Agreement pursuant to Section 6.04(d)), which the

 



50  Board of Directors determines is reasonably likely to be consummated and for
which financing, if a cash transaction (whether in whole or in part), is then
fully committed or reasonably determined to be available by the Board of
Directors.

(f) _Obligation of the Company to Terminate Existing Discussions_. The Company
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and shall direct its and their
Representatives to, cease immediately and cause to be terminated any and all
existing activities, discussions or negotiations, if any, with any Third Party
and its Representatives conducted prior to the date hereof with respect to
any Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry and shall request that, and
shall use its reasonable best efforts (to the extent not prohibited by an
applicable confidentiality agreement) to cause any such Third Party (and its
representatives) in possession of confidential information heretofore
furnished by or on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (and all
analyses and other materials prepared by or on behalf of such Person
that contains, reflects or analyzes that information) to return or destroy
all such information as promptly as practicable.

(g)  _Notification and Acknowledgment_. The Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to ensure that the Financial Advisor and the directors, officers,
and director-level employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries are aware of
the provisions of this Section 6.04.

SECTION 6.05 _Section 16 Matters. _Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any dispositions of
Shares (including derivative securities with respect to such shares) resulting
from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is
subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the 1934 Act with
respect to the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the
1934 Act.

SECTION 6.06 _Stock Exchange Delisting; 1934 Act Deregistration._ Prior to

delisting by the Surviving Corporation of the Shares from Nasdaq, the
deregistration of the Shares and any other securities of the Company under
the 1934 Act, and the termination of reporting requirements under the 1934 Act
with respect to any securities of the Company, as promptly as practicable
after the Effective Time.

 

SECTION 6.07 _Takeover Statutes._ The Company and the Board of Directors
shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, use their reasonable best
efforts (a) to grant all approvals and take all actions necessary or advisable
so that no Takeover Statute becomes applicable to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (b) if any such Takeover Statute is or
may become applicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to
grant all approvals and take all actions necessary or advisable so that the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated herein and otherwise to take all such
other actions as are reasonably necessary to eliminate or minimize the effects
of any such statute or regulation on the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

SECTION 6.08 _Company Public Debt and Credit Facilities._ The Company shall
take such action as may be reasonably requested by Parent to (A) on or prior
to the Closing Date, (i)

 



51  prepare (A) a notice of redemption or similar notice under and in compliance
with the relevant indentures for the redemption, repurchase or satisfaction
and discharge, as applicable, at or as promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time of all of the Companys outstanding 8.50% Notes and 10.875%

holders Secured Notes under and in compliance with the relevant indentures,
conditioned upon occurrence of the Closing; (B) on or prior to the Closing
Date, prepare a supplemental indenture, a notice of fundamental change, and

thereof, if applicable, and any right to receive cash in connection with any

reasonably requested by Parent pursuant to the indenture governing the
Convertible Notes; and (C) effective at the Effective Time, effect
the termination of the Revolving Credit and Term Loan Facility, payment of
all amounts outstanding or otherwise payable in respect thereto at the
Effective Time, and release and discharge of all Liens relating thereto,
including, without limitation, by providing, (i) no later than 10 days before

administrative agent thereunder without resulting in any premium or penalty),

at the Effective Time and to be conditioned on the effectiveness of the
Merger, and, to the extent practicable, (ii) Parent with a customary payoff
letter in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent providing for
such termination and release of Liens upon payment of all such amounts (a
"Payoff Letter"). The Company shall at any time prior to the Closing,
facilitate the delivery and recording at or as promptly as practicable after
the Effective Time of termination statements and instruments of discharge and
release of Liens as reasonably requested by Parent. In furtherance and without
limitation of the foregoing, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its
Representatives to, provide all cooperation that is customary in connection
with the redemption, repurchase, satisfaction and discharge, or conversion of
securities as may be reasonably requested by Parent and as permitted under
the relevant indentures or agreements.

SECTION 6.09 _Shareholder Litigation._ The Company will (a) promptly advise
Parent in writing of any action, suit, or proceeding commenced, asserted or,
to the Companys Knowledge, investigation threatened against it or any of its
directors or officers relating to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (b) give Parent the

ARTICLE 7

Covenants of Parent 

Parent agrees that:

 

SECTION 7.01 _Obligations of Merger Subsidiary._ Parent shall take all action
necessary to cause Merger Subsidiary to perform its obligations under this
Agreement and to consummate the Merger on the terms and conditions set forth

SECTION 7.03 _Director and Officer Liability._ Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation, and the Surviving Corporation hereby agrees, to do the
following:

(a) For six years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
indemnify and hold harmless the present and former officers, directors and
employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (each, an "Indemnified
Person") in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time to the fullest extent permitted by the MBCA or any other
Applicable Law or provided under the articles of incorporation and bylaws (or
comparable organizational documents) of the Company or its Subsidiaries in
effect on the date hereof; _provided_ that such indemnification shall be
subject to any limitation imposed from time to time under Applicable Law.

 



53 (b) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be
maintained in effect provisions in the Surviving Corporations articles of
incorporation and bylaws (or in such documents of any successor to the
business of the Surviving Corporation) regarding elimination of liability of
directors, indemnification of officers, directors and employees and
advancement of expenses that are no less advantageous to the intended
beneficiaries than the corresponding provisions in existence on the date of
this Agreement.

 

(c) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, either (i)
continue to maintain in effect for six years after the Effective Time the
Companys directors and officers insurance policies and fiduciary liability
insurance policies (collectively, "DandO Insurance") in place as of the date
hereof or (ii) purchase comparable DandO Insurance (including a run-off or tail
insurance policy) for such six-year period, in each case with respect to any
claim related to any period of time at or prior to the Effective Time with
terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are at least as
favorable as those contained in the Companys DandO Insurance policies in effect
as of the date hereof and with insurance carriers having at least an "A"
rating by A.M. Best with respect to DandO Insurance; _provided_ that in no
event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend for such

amount is set forth in Section 7.03(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule; and
_provided further_ that if the aggregate premiums of such insurance coverage
exceed such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a
policy with the greatest coverage available, with respect to matters occurring
prior to the Effective Time, for a cost not exceeding such amount.

 

(d) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger,
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or
the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations
set forth in this Section 7.03.

 

(e) The rights of each Indemnified Person under this Section 7.03 shall be in
addition to any rights such Person may have under the articles of
incorporation or bylaws of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, under the
MBCA or any other Applicable Law, or under any Contract of any Indemnified
Person with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. These rights shall
survive consummation of the Merger and are intended to benefit, and shall be
enforceable by, each Indemnified Person.

SECTION 7.04 _Employee Matters_.

(a) For a period of six months following the Effective Time (or, if shorter,
during the period of employment), Parent shall provide to each employee of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time who is based
in the United States and continues employment with the Surviving Corporation
or any of its Affiliates ("Continuing Employees") base salary or base wages
and benefits (other than equity-based compensation) that are comparable, in
the aggregate, to such salary, wages and benefits as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time.

 



54 (b) Following the Effective Time, Parent will, subject to Applicable Law, give
each Continuing Employee full credit for prior service with the Company and
its Subsidiaries as reflected in the records thereof for purposes of vesting
and eligibility to participate in employee benefit plans maintained by Parent
or its Affiliates for which the Continuing Employee is otherwise eligible to
participate (but such service credit shall not be provided for benefit accrual
purposes, except for vacation and severance, as applicable); _provided_ that
service of a Continuing Employee prior to the Effective Time shall not be
recognized for the purpose of any entitlement to participate in, or receive
benefits with respect to, any retiree medical programs or other retiree
welfare benefit programs maintained by Parent or its Affiliates in which any
Continuing Employee participates after the Effective Time. In no event shall
anything contained in this Section 7.04(b) result in any duplication of
benefits for the same period of service. In addition, Parent shall (A) waive,
or cause to be waived, any limitations on benefits relating to pre-existing
conditions to the same extent such limitations are waived under any comparable
plan of the Company or its Subsidiaries applicable to such Continuing Employee
prior to the Effective Time and (B) recognize, for purposes of annual
deductible and out-of-pocket limits under its medical and dental plans,
deductible and out-of-pocket expenses paid by Continuing Employees in the
calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs.

(c) The Company shall take all actions that may be necessary or appropriate to
cause (i) upon Parents request, the Companys 401(k) plan and (ii) upon
Parents reasonable request, such other Employee Plans, any such request to be

shall be subject to Parents prior review and approval.

(d) (i) Neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates shall be obligated to
continue to employ any Continuing Employee for any period of time following
the Effective Time, (ii) Parent or its Affiliates may revise, amend or
terminate any Employee Plan or any other employee benefit plan, program or
policy in effect from time to time, (iii) nothing in this Agreement shall be
construed as an amendment of any Employee Plan, and (iv) no provision of this
Section 7.04 shall create any third-party beneficiary rights in any Service
Provider or former Service Provider (including any beneficiary or
dependent of such Service Provider or former Service Provider) in respect of
continued employment (or resumed employment) or any other matter.

 

ARTICLE 8

Covenants of Parent and the Company

The parties hereto agree that:

 

SECTION 8.01 _Efforts_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company and
Parent shall use their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions and to do, or cause

 



55  to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under Applicable Law,
as promptly as practicable, to cause the conditions to Closing to be satisfied
and to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including

and in connection with resolving any investigation or other inquiry of any
Governmental Authority under Exon-Florio with respect to any such filing or
any such transaction. Each of the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable
best efforts to furnish to the other all information required for any such
filing or proceeding under Exon-Florio. To the extent permitted by Applicable
Law, each of the Company and Parent shall promptly inform the other of any
oral communication with, and provide copies of written communications with,
any Governmental Authority regarding any such filings or proceedings,
_provided_ , _however_ , that neither Parent nor Merger Subsidiary shall be
required by the terms of this Section 8.01(c) to disclose to the Company
nonpublic information about Parent or its Affiliates that Parent considers to
be confidential or proprietary. Neither the Company nor Parent shall
independently participate in any formal meeting with any Governmental
Authority in respect of any such filings, investigation or other
inquiry without giving the other party sufficient prior notice of the meeting
and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, the opportunity
for the other party to attend and/or participate in such meeting. Subject to
Applicable Law, each of the Company and Parent will consult and cooperate
with the other in connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations,
memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or
on behalf of the Company or Parent relating to proceedings under Exon-Florio.

reasonable best efforts to take such actions and agree to such requirements or
conditions to mitigate any national security concerns as may be requested or
required by CFIUS in connection with, or as a condition of, the satisfaction
of the CFIUS Condition; _provided, however,_ that, notwithstanding any

Company shall be required to agree to any term or take any action in
connection with the satisfaction of the CFIUS Condition that (i) is not
conditioned upon consummation of the Merger, (ii) it is excused from taking
pursuant to the proviso to the first sentence to Section 8.01(a), or (iii)

Company Material Adverse Effect ( _provided_ that, for purposes of this
Section 8.01(c), clause (E) in the definition of "Company Material Adverse
Effect" shall be inapplicable).

(d) To the extent permitted by Applicable Law and subject to the proviso to
the first sentence of Section 8.01(a), each of Parent and the Company shall

57  to (i) cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any
filing or submission and in connection with any investigation or other
inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a private party, (ii) promptly
inform the other party of any communication received from, or given to, any

review in advance any communication given by it to, and consult with each
other in advance of any meeting or conference with, any such
Governmental Authority or, in connection with any proceeding by a private
party, with any other Person, and, to the extent reasonably practicable and
not prohibited by the Governmental Authority or other Person, give the other
party the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and
conferences.

(e) In furtherance and not in limitation of Section 8.01(a), each of the
Company and Parent shall exercise its reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken (including, in the case of the Company, by its
Subsidiaries), all actions and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and
cooperate with the other parties to this Agreement in doing, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to satisfy the 60-Day Notice Condition,
including (i) the Company, as the registrant, shall submit to the DDTC the
ITAR 60-Day Notice relating to the Merger and the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement as promptly as reasonably practicable, but in no event later

the Company has properly registered as a manufacturer under the ITAR in
accordance with Section 122.2 of the ITAR, (ii) promptly and, in all events,
consistent with any deadline imposed under the ITAR or other Applicable Law,
comply with any request received by it or any of its Subsidiaries from any
Governmental Authority for any certification, additional information,
documents or other materials in respect of such notice or such transactions,
(iii) ensure that any information furnished by such party in respect of this
Section 8.01(e) is true, complete and correct in all material respects, and
(iv) cooperate with each other in connection with any such filing (including,
to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, providing copies, or portions
thereof, of all such documents to the non-filing parties to this Agreement
prior to filing and considering all reasonable additions, deletions or changes
suggested in connection therewith) and, in connection with resolving any
investigation or other inquiry of any Governmental Authority under the ITAR,
with respect to any such filing or any such transaction. Each of the Company
and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to furnish to the other
all information required to be provided by it or any of its Subsidiaries for
any such filing or proceeding under the ITAR. To the extent permitted by
Applicable Law, each of the Company and Parent shall promptly inform the other
of any oral communication with, and provide copies of written communications
with, any Governmental Authority regarding any such filings or proceedings,
_provided_ , _however_ , that neither Parent nor Merger Subsidiary shall be
required by the terms of this Section 8.01(e) to disclose to the Company
nonpublic information about Parent or its Affiliates that Parent considers to
be confidential or proprietary unless such information is required to be
included in the ITAR 60-Day Notice. Neither the Company nor Parent shall
independently participate in any formal meeting with any Governmental
Authority in respect of any such filings, investigation or other inquiry
without giving the other party sufficient prior notice of the meeting and,
to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, the opportunity for
the other party to attend or participate in such meeting. Subject to
Applicable Law, the Company and Parent will consult and cooperate with one
another in connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations,

 



58  memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or
on behalf of the Company or Parent relating to proceedings under the ITAR.
Without limiting the foregoing, each of Parent and the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to take such actions and agree to such requirements or
conditions to mitigate any ITAR concerns as may be requested or required by
DDTC in connection with, or as a condition of, the satisfaction of the 60-Day
Notice Condition; _provided, however,_ that, notwithstanding any provision of
this Agreement to the contrary, neither Parent nor the Company shall be
required to agree to any term or take any action in connection with the
satisfaction of the 60-Day Notice Condition that (x) is not conditioned upon
consummation of the Merger, (y) it is excused from taking pursuant to the
proviso to the first sentence to Section 8.01(a), or (z) would reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect ( _provided_ that, for purposes of this Section 8.01(e), clause (E) in
the definition of "Company Material Adverse Effect" shall be inapplicable).

(f) The Company shall consult, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to consult,
with Parent regarding the notifications, filings and submissions (if any)
that should be made with the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding potential
violations of the U.S. Department of Commerces regulations with respect to
the Subject Product businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries. The
Company shall inform, and shall cause it Subsidiaries to inform, Parent
promptly if it or any of its Subsidiaries determines that the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries exported any Subject Product, or other export-controlled
item without a Permit from the appropriate export control authority, or that
it violated any other Trade Control Law. To the extent not prohibited by
Applicable Law and the applicable Governmental Authority, the Company agrees
to, and to cause its Subsidiaries to, (a) give Parent and its counsel
reasonable advance notice of all meetings or telephone conferences with any
Governmental Authority relating to any voluntary disclosure process, (b) give
Parent and such counsel an opportunity to participate in each of such
meetings and conferences, (c) provide Parent and such counsel with a
reasonable advance opportunity to review and comment upon any comprehensive
disclosure report and all other written communications (including any
analyses, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals)
with a Governmental Authority regarding such voluntary disclosure process, and
(d) promptly provide Parent and its counsel with copies of all
written communications to or from any Governmental Authority relating to such
voluntary disclosure process.

(g) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 8.01 to the contrary, neither
Parent nor the Company will be required to share any information with the
other party to the extent it determines, after consultation with outside
counsel, that such disclosure or access would reasonably be likely to (i)
violate the terms of any confidentiality agreement or other Contract with a
Third Party ( _provided_ that Parent or the Company, as applicable, shall use
its reasonable best efforts to obtain the required consent of such
Third Party to such access or disclosure); (ii) result in the loss of any
attorney-client privilege ( _provided_ that Parent or the Company, as
applicable, shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow for such access or
disclosure (or as much of it as possible) in a manner that does not result in
a loss of attorney-client privilege); or (iii) violate any Applicable Law (
_provided_ that Parent or the Company, as applicable, shall use its reasonable
best efforts to provide such access or make such disclosure in a manner that
does not violate Applicable Law).

to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Company Proxy Statement
reasonably promptly after receipt thereof and (ii) a reasonable opportunity to
participate in the Companys response to those comments and to provide

shall be given), including by participating with the Company or its counsel in
any discussions or meetings with the SEC.

 

(c) The Company and Parent shall cooperate with one another (i) in connection
with the preparation of the Company Proxy Statement and responding to any
comments from the SEC on the Company Proxy Statement, and (ii) in taking such
actions or making any such filings, furnishing information required in
connection with the Company Proxy Statement and seeking timely to obtain
any such actions, consents, approvals or waivers. Parent will furnish all
information concerning Parent and its Affiliates to the Company, and provide
such other assistance as may be reasonably requested in connection with the
preparation, filing, and distribution of the Company Proxy Statement. The
Company Proxy Statement will include all information reasonably requested by
the Company or Parent to be included. If at any time prior to the Effective

Company under this Section 8.02 shall continue in full force and effect.

and material failure to fulfill a condition to the performance of the
obligations of the other party, or any intentional and material breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant in this Agreement (which the parties
acknowledge and agree shall not be limited to reimbursement of expenses or
out-of-pocket costs, and shall include the benefit of the bargain lost by a
partys shareholders (taking into consideration relevant matters, including
the total amount payable to such shareholders under this Agreement, lost
combination opportunities and the time value of money), which shall be deemed
in such event to be damages of such other party as a result of such fraud or
intentional and material failure or breach). The provisions of this Section
10.02, the last sentence of Section 6.02, and Article 11 shall survive any
termination hereof pursuant to Section 10.01.

 

(b) For purposes of this Agreement, a party will be deemed to have
intentionally breached this Agreement if the relevant breach is a consequence
of an act or omission undertaken by such party with the knowledge that the
taking of, or failure to take, such act would, or would be reasonably expected
to, cause or constitute a breach of this Agreement, it being acknowledged
and agreed that any failure by a party to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement after the applicable conditions
thereto have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, which conditions would be
capable of being satisfied at such time) shall constitute an intentional
breach of this Agreement.

67  preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies herein provided shall be
cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by Applicable
Law.

SECTION 11.04 _Expenses_.

 

(a) _General_. Except as otherwise provided herein, all costs and expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement shall be paid by the party
incurring such cost or expense. Filing fees incurred under the Required
Antitrust Laws, Exon-Florio or any comparable pre-merger or foreign ownership
notification filings, forms and submissions or other Required Antitrust
Approval with any foreign Governmental Authority that may be required by the
Applicable Laws of such foreign Governmental Authority, and the reasonable
fees and expenses of an economic advisory firm, shall be shared equally by
Parent and the Company.

 

(b) _Termination Fees_.

 

(i) If this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 10.01(c)(i)
or by the Company pursuant to Section 10.01(d)(i), then the Company shall pay
to Parent in immediately available funds $4,200,000 (the "Termination Fee"),
in the case of a termination by Parent, within two Business Days after such
termination and, in the case of a termination by the Company,
contemporaneously with and as a condition to such termination.

(ii) If (A) this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to
Section 10.01(b)(i), by Parent pursuant to Section 10.01(b)(iii), or by Parent
pursuant to Section 10.01(c)(ii), (B) after the date of this Agreement and
prior to such termination, an Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly
announced or otherwise communicated to the Board of Directors or directly to
its shareholders generally and not withdrawn and (C) within 12 months
following the date of such termination, (1) an Acquisition Proposal shall
have been consummated or (2) the Company shall have entered into a definitive
Contract with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or recommended to its
shareholders an Acquisition Proposal and, during or subsequent to such
12-month period, that Acquisition Proposal shall have been consummated (
_provided_ that for purposes of this clause (C), each reference to "15%" in
the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be a reference to
"50%"), then the Company shall pay to Parent in immediately available funds,
concurrently with the consummation of that Acquisition Proposal as described
in clause (C), the Termination Fee less the Parent Expenses (to the extent, if
any, previously paid pursuant to Section 11.04(b)(iv)).

(iii) The payment of the Termination Fee shall be a precondition to the
effectiveness of any termination of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to
Section 10.01(d)(i).

(iv) If this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section
10.01(b)(iii), then the Company shall pay to Parent in immediately available
funds the Parent Expenses contemporaneously with and as a condition to such
termination.

 

(v) If this Agreement is terminated (A) by Parent pursuant to Section
10.01(b)(i), (B) by the Company pursuant to Section 10.01(b)(i) on or after
December 1, 2016, or (C) by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section
10.01(b)(ii) (in each case under clause (A) or

 



68  (B), to the extent arising from the failure of a condition set forth in
Sections 9.01(c), 9.01(d) or 9.02(e) to be satisfied or waived by Parent in
connection with an Antitrust Law, or under clause (C), to the extent arising
in connection with any Antitrust Law) and, at the time of any such
termination, all of the conditions to Closing set forth in Sections 9.01,
9.02, and 9.03 have been satisfied or waived in writing (or, if the Closing
were to have taken place on the date of termination, such conditions would
have been satisfied), other than the conditions set forth in Sections 9.01(c)
or (d) or Section 9.02(e) (if the Applicable Law, action, or
proceeding relates to any Antitrust Law), then Parent will pay to the Company
an amount in cash equal to $4,200,000 within two Business Days after such
termination.

 

(c) _Other Costs and Expenses_. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger
Subsidiary acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 11.04
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
that, without these agreements, the Company, Parent and Merger Subsidiary
would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company or Parent
fails promptly to pay any amount required to be paid by that party under this
Section 11.04 (as applicable, the "Defaulting Party"), the Defaulting Party
shall also pay the reasonable costs and expenses incurred by Parent or
Merger Subsidiary (if the Company is the Defaulting Party) or the Company (if
Parent is the Defaulting Party) in connection with a legal action to enforce
this Agreement that results in a judgment against the Defaulting Party for
such amount, together with interest on the amount of any unpaid fee, cost or
expense at the publicly announced prime rate of Citibank, N.A. from the date
such fee, cost or expense was required to be paid to (but excluding) the
payment date.

 

(d) _Exclusive Remedy_. If the Termination Fee is payable and paid to Parent
in accordance with this Section 11.04, the receipt of the Termination Fee
will be deemed to be the sole and exclusive remedy available to Parent and
Merger Subsidiary with respect to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, and absent fraud, intentional and material failure to
fulfill a condition to the performance of the obligations of Parent or Merger
Subsidiary, or any intentional and material breach of any representation,
warranty or covenant of the Company, upon payment of the Termination Fee, the
Company (and the Companys Affiliates and its and their respective
shareholders) will have no further liability to Parent or Merger Subsidiary
under this Agreement; _provided, however_ , that the foregoing shall not
limit, diminish or impair any right, claim or chose in action against any
Third Party that has made an Acquisition Proposal. In no event will the
Company be obligated to pay the Termination Fee or the Parent Expenses on more
than one occasion.

 

SECTION 11.05 _Disclosure Schedule_. The parties hereto agree that any
reference in a particular Section of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall
only be deemed to be an exception to (or, as applicable, a disclosure for
purposes of) (i) the representations and warranties (or covenants, as
applicable) of the relevant party that are contained in the
corresponding Section of this Agreement and (ii) any other representations
and warranties of such party that are contained in this Agreement, but only if
the relevance of that reference as an exception to (or a disclosure for
purposes of) such representations and warranties to the extent that it is
reasonably apparent that such disclosure also qualifies or applies to such
other representations and warranties. Capitalized terms used in the Company
Disclosure Schedule and not otherwise defined therein have the meanings given
to them in this Agreement. The information contained in this Agreement and in
the Company Disclosure Schedule is disclosed solely for purposes of this

 



69  Agreement, and no information contained herein or therein will be deemed to
be an admission by any party hereto to any third party of any matter
whatsoever (including, without limitation, any violation of Applicable Law or
breach of Contract).

SECTION 11.06 _Binding Effect; Benefit; Assignment._

 

(a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to
the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and
assigns. Except as provided in Section 7.03, no provision of this Agreement is
intended to confer any rights, benefits, remedies, obligations or liabilities
hereunder upon any Person other than the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns.

(b) No party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or
obligations under this Agreement without the consent of each other party
hereto, except that Parent or Merger Subsidiary may transfer or assign its
rights and obligations under this Agreement, in whole or from time to time in
part, to (i) one or more of their Affiliates at any time and (ii) after the
Effective Time to any Person; _provided_ that such transfer or assignment
shall not relieve Parent or Merger Subsidiary of its obligations hereunder or
enlarge, alter or change any obligation of any other party hereto or due to
Parent or Merger Subsidiary.

SECTION 11.07 _Governing Law._ This Agreement and any action or proceeding
(whether in contract, tort, equity, or otherwise) arising out of this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of
Minnesota, without regard to the conflicts of law rules of such state.

SECTION 11.08 _Jurisdiction._ The parties hereby irrevocably submit to
the personal jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Minnesota located in
the County of Hennepin and the federal courts of the United States of America
located in the State of Minnesota solely in respect of the interpretation and
enforcement of the provisions of this Agreement and of the documents referred
to in this Agreement, and in respect of the transactions contemplated hereby,
and hereby waive, and agree not to assert, as a defense in any action, suit or
proceeding for the interpretation or enforcement hereof or of any such
document, that it is not subject thereto or that such action, suit or
proceeding may not be brought or is not maintainable in said courts or that
the venue thereof may not be appropriate or that this Agreement or any such
document may not be enforced in or by such courts, and the parties hereto
irrevocably agree that all claims with respect to such action or proceeding
shall be heard and determined in such a Minnesota state or federal court.
Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be served on any party
anywhere in the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of any such
court. Without limiting the foregoing, the parties hereby consent to and grant
any such court jurisdiction over the person of such parties and, to the
extent permitted by Applicable Law, over the subject matter of such dispute
and agree that mailing of process or other papers in connection with any such
action or proceeding in the manner provided in Section 11.01 or in such other
manner as may be permitted by Applicable Law shall be valid and sufficient
service thereof.

SECTION 11.09 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY.

 



70 SECTION 11.10 _Counterparts; Effectiveness; etc._ This Agreement may be signed
in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the
same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same
instrument. This Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto shall
have received a counterpart hereof signed by all of the other parties hereto.
This Agreement or any counterpart may be executed and delivered by facsimile
copies or delivered by electronic communications by portable document format
(PDF), each of which shall be deemed an original. Until and unless each party
has received a counterpart hereof signed by the other party hereto, this
Agreement shall have no effect and no party shall have any right or obligation
hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or written Contract or other
communication). No party to this Agreement may raise as a defense to the
formation or enforceability of this Agreement, and each party to this
Agreement forever waives any such defense, either (a) the use of a facsimile
or email transmission to deliver a signature or (b) the fact that any
signature was signed and subsequently transmitted by facsimile or email
transmission.

 

SECTION 11.11 _Entire Agreement._ This Agreement, the Confidentiality
Agreement, and the Voting Agreements constitute the entire agreement between
the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersede
all prior Contracts and understandings, both oral and written, between the
parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement.

 

SECTION 11.12 _Severability._ If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.

 

SECTION 11.13 _Specific Performance._ The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with the terms hereof or were otherwise breached and
that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically the performance of the
terms and provisions hereof in any federal court located in the State of
Minnesota or any Minnesota state court in the County of Hennepin, without the
requirement of the posting of a bond or other security, in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.
