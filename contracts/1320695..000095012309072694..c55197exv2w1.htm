at the Closing, Buyer agrees to purchase and acquire from the Shareholders, and each Shareholder
agrees to sell, convey, assign, transfer and deliver to Buyer, free and clear of all Liens, all of

Completion Costs (the amount obtained pursuant to the foregoing clauses (a)&nbsp;through (h), the
&#147;<U>Purchase Price</U>&#148;). Except to the extent that such are determined to be incorrect based
upon the various payments of such to be made at the Closing, in calculating the Purchase Price, the
amounts of the Debt, Transaction Costs and Project Completion Costs shall be determined as provided
in <U>Section&nbsp;1.5(a)</U> and shall be final and binding on the Parties. Solely for purposes of

necessary, all of such unvested Options to become vested and exercisable as of immediately prior to
the Closing. With respect to each Option (including those Options that are vested immediately
prior to the Closing pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence), the Company, acting through
the committee of the Board of Directors of the Company that administers the Option Plan, shall
exercise its right to purchase at the Closing each Option pursuant to Section&nbsp;8 of the Option Plan
for a portion of the Purchase Price equal to the product of the Common Share Price (less the
applicable per share exercise price thereof) multiplied by the number of shares of Common Stock
covered by such Option in accordance with the provisions of <U>Article&nbsp;I</U> (as to each Option,

sentences. From and after the Closing, (x)&nbsp;all Options shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of an Option shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except for the right to receive the Option
Consideration in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and (y)&nbsp;the Option Plan shall be

structure the Short-Form&nbsp;Merger such that (i)&nbsp;at the Effective Time each share of Optionholder
Common Stock is converted into the right to receive the same economic benefits, and the holder
thereof becomes subject to the same post-Closing obligations, that such share and holder would have
become entitled or subject to at and after the Closing if such share of Optionholder Common Stock
had been outstanding on the date of this Agreement and such holder were a Shareholder under this
Agreement and (ii)&nbsp;the post-Closing obligations (including the indemnification obligations
hereunder) and benefits of the Shareholders (including the holders of Optionholder Common Stock
acquired pursuant to the Short-Form&nbsp;Merger) shall be modified to the extent necessary so that such

street address or other location information for all Owned Real Property. Except as set forth on
<U>Company Disclosure Schedule&nbsp;3.6(a)</U>, the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company has good and
indefeasible, fee simple title in and to the Owned Real Property, free and clear of all Liens other
than Permitted Encumbrances. The Company has delivered or otherwise made available to Buyer true,
correct and complete copies of all deeds and the most current title reports, exception documents
and related documents and information and surveys for the Owned Real Property in the Company&#146;s or
any of its Subsidiaries&#146; possession. The Company or a Subsidiary of the Company has sufficient
title to such easements, rights of way and other rights appurtenant to each of the Owned Real
Properties as are necessary to permit ingress and egress to and from the Owned Real Property to a
public way. The material improvements on the Owned Real Property have access to such sewer, water,
gas, electric, telephone and other utilities as are necessary to allow the business of the Company
and each of its Subsidiaries operated thereon to be operated in the ordinary course as currently
operated, except where the failure to have such access would not have a Material Adverse Effect.
Except as set forth on <U>Company Disclosure Schedule&nbsp;3.6(a)</U>, the material improvements
located on the Owned Real Property are in sufficiently good condition (except for ordinary wear and
tear) to allow the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries to be operated in the ordinary
course as currently operated and as presently proposed to be operated. No condemnation proceeding
is pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened, which would preclude or materially
impair the use of any Owned Real Property for the uses for which it is intended. The current use
of the Owned Real Property by the Company and its Subsidiaries does not violate in any material
respect any restrictive covenants or easements of record affecting any of the Owned Real Property
or, to the Knowledge of the Company, other unrecorded agreements, or other Liens affecting any of
the Owned Real Property. Except as set forth on <U>Company Disclosure Schedule&nbsp;3.6(a)</U>,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is party to any leases, subleases, licenses,
concessions, contracts or other agreements, whether written or oral, granting to any party or
parties the right of use or occupancy of any portion of any parcel of Owned Real Property, and
there are no other parties other than the Company occupying the Owned Real Property.
