STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT 

   

 THIS STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ ") is entered into as of December 20, 2009, by and among TreeHouse Foods, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Buyer_ "), Sturm Foods, Inc., a Wisconsin corporation (the " _Company_ "), and each of the sellers listed on the signature pages hereto (each, a " _Shareholder_ " and, collectively, the " _Shareholders_ "). In addition, HMSF, L.P. joins in the execution and delivery of this Agreement solely for purposes of serving as Shareholders Agent hereunder. Unless defined herein, capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined in _Exhibit A_. 

  

WITNESSETH 

   

 WHEREAS, the Shareholders currently own all of the outstanding Common Stock of the Company. 

  

 WHEREAS, Buyer desires to purchase from the Shareholders, and the Shareholders desire to sell to Buyer, all of the outstanding Common Stock of the Company owned by the Shareholders in exchange for the consideration set forth herein, upon the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the Recitals, the mutual representations, warranties, covenants, agreements and conditions contained herein, and in order to set forth the terms and conditions of the stock purchase and the mode of carrying the same into effect, the Parties hereby agree as follows: 

  

ARTICLE I 

   

PURCHASE AND SALE OF COMMON STOCK  

  

 1.1 _Purchase and Sale_. On and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the Closing, Buyer agrees to purchase and acquire from the Shareholders, and each Shareholder agrees to sell, convey, assign, transfer and deliver to Buyer, free and clear of all Liens, all of the issued and outstanding Common Stock owned by such Shareholder. 

  

 1.2 _Purchase Price_. The aggregate consideration for the Common Stock to be purchased and acquired by Buyer hereunder, which shall be paid by Buyer to the Shareholders hereunder, shall equal (a) $660,000,000 (the " _Enterprise Value_ "), plus (b) the amount of Cash determined as provided for in this Agreement, minus (c) the sum of the amounts of the Debt and the Transaction Costs, minus (d) the amounts provided for in _Section 1.6(c)_, minus (e) the Income Tax Amount, increased or decreased (f) in respect of Net Working Capital as provided for in this Agreement, plus (g) the amount, if any, by which the amount of the Project Completion Costs exceeds $1,000,000, and minus (h) the amount, if any, by which $1,000,000 exceeds the amount of the Project Completion Costs (the amount obtained pursuant to the foregoing clauses (a) through (h), the " _Purchase Price_ "). Except to the extent that such are determined to be incorrect based upon the various payments of such to be made at the Closing, in calculating the Purchase Price, the amounts of the Debt, Transaction Costs and Project Completion Costs shall be determined as provided in _Section 1.5(a)_ and shall be final and binding on the Parties. Solely for purposes of determining the Closing Common Share Price 

   ##### 

  

 

payable at the Closing, the Purchase Price shall be increased in respect of
Estimated Cash as provided in _Section 1.5(a)_ and increased or decreased in
respect of Estimated Net Working Capital as provided in _Section 1.5(b)_. In
calculating the various adjustments to the Purchase Price under this
Agreement, no single item shall be given duplicative effect. 

   

 1.3 _Treatment of Options; Short-Form Merger_. 

  

 (a) With respect to each Option that is not vested in accordance with the terms of the Option Plan as of immediately prior to the Closing, the Company shall take all actions necessary to cause, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Option Plan or stock option agreement of the Company and including taking action to amend any such Option Plan or stock option agreement as is necessary, all of such unvested Options to become vested and exercisable as of immediately prior to the Closing. With respect to each Option (including those Options that are vested immediately prior to the Closing pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence), the Company, acting through the committee of the Board of Directors of the Company that administers the Option Plan, shall exercise its right to purchase at the Closing each Option pursuant to Section 8 of the Option Plan for a portion of the Purchase Price equal to the product of the Common Share Price (less the applicable per share exercise price thereof) multiplied by the number of shares of Common Stock covered by such Option in accordance with the provisions of _Article I_ (as to each Option, the " _Option Consideration_ "). The Company shall give Buyer prompt (within two Business Days) notice of such action taken by the Company pursuant to the two immediately preceding sentences. From and after the Closing, (x) all Options shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of an Option shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except for the right to receive the Option Consideration in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and (y) the Option Plan shall be automatically terminated. 

   

 (b) If any Options are exercised after the date of this Agreement, and prior to the Closing, to purchase Common Stock (the " _Optionholder Common Stock_ ") by any Option holder who prior to such exercise was not a Shareholder and all such Option holders do not execute and deliver a counterpart to this Agreement, then as part of the Closing Buyer shall, and shall cause the Company to, take all necessary and appropriate action (a) to cause a Subsidiary of Buyer (organized as a corporation under the laws of the State of Wisconsin) to be merged with and into the Company in accordance with Section 180.1104 of the WBCL (the " _Short-Form Merger_"), (b) to cause the Short-Form Merger to become effective on the Closing Date after the Closing occurs (the effective time of the Short-Form Merger being referred to herein as the " _Effective Time_ "), and (c) to structure the Short-Form Merger such that (i) at the Effective Time each share of Optionholder Common Stock is converted into the right to receive the same economic benefits, and the holder thereof becomes subject to the same post-Closing obligations, that such share and holder would have become entitled or subject to at and after the Closing if such share of Optionholder Common Stock had been outstanding on the date of this Agreement and such holder were a Shareholder under this Agreement and (ii) the post-Closing obligations (including the indemnification obligations hereunder) and benefits of the Shareholders (including the holders of Optionholder Common Stock acquired pursuant to the Short-Form Merger) shall be modified to the extent necessary so that such remain substantially unchanged from that described in this Agreement as if no Options were exercised after the date of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary that may be contained in this Agreement, the exercise 

   ##### 

  

   

of Options to purchase Optionholder Common Stock after the date of this
Agreement and prior to the Closing, and the issuance by the Company of an
aggregate number of shares of Optionholder Common Stock pursuant to such
Option exercises that does not exceed two percent (2%) of the number of
issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock as of immediately prior to the
Closing, shall not (A) constitute a breach of any representation, warranty or
covenant by the Company or the Shareholders, (B) give rise to or result in
the failure of a closing condition under this Agreement to be satisfied, (C)
give rise to, result in, or otherwise create a termination right by
Buyer under this Agreement or (D) constitute, give rise to or result in a
Material Adverse Effect. After the date of this Agreement and prior to the
Closing, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts (but excluding
any obligation to make any expenditures or payments) to cause any holder
of Optionholder Common Stock, who prior to purchasing Optionholder Common
Stock was not a Shareholder, to execute and deliver to Buyer a counterpart to
this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure by the Company to
obtain a signed counterpart to this Agreement by any holder of Optionholder
Common Stock shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement or the failure of
a Closing condition under this Agreement to be satisfied. Upon execution of
such counterpart to this Agreement, such holder shall be deemed to be a
Shareholder hereunder. 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any issued and outstanding shares of Optionholder Common Stock held by a Person (a " _Dissenting Shareholder_ ") who shall not have executed and delivered a counterpart to this Agreement at or prior to the Effective Time or otherwise contractually waived his dissenters rights and who shall have properly demanded dissenters rights in accordance with the provisions of Section 180.1323 of the WBCL concerning the right of holders of Optionholder Common Stock to dissent from the Short-Form Merger and demand payment for their Optionholder Common Stock (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not receive the consideration described in _Section 1.6(a)_ but shall have the right to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due to such Dissenting Shareholder pursuant to the WBCL. The Shareholders shall be responsible pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)_ for the excess, if any, of all reasonable third-party out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) arising out of, or incurred in connection with, the Companys negotiations or proceedings relating to any demand for payment of Dissenting Shares, including any payment required to be made to any Dissenting Shareholder with respect to the settlement or resolution of any appraisal proceeding relating thereto in excess of the aggregate amount of consideration that would have otherwise been payable with respect to such Dissenting Shares pursuant to _Section 1.6_ (such excess, being referred to as the " _Excess Dissenters Costs_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing provision, the Company shall not settle or resolve any demand for payment of Dissenting Shares for an amount in excess of the aggregate amount of consideration that would have otherwise been payable with respect to such Dissenting Shares pursuant to _Section 1.6_ without the Shareholders Agents consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. 

   

 1.4 _Definitions_. As used in this Agreement, the following terms shall have the meanings specified: 

  

 (a) " _Cash_ " means, as of immediately prior to the Closing (for the avoidance of doubt, without any reduction for payments made by the Company at the Closing pursuant to 

    ##### 

  

    

 _Section 1.6_), all cash and cash equivalents of the Company and its
Subsidiaries including deposits in transit. 

   

 (b) " _Closing Common Share Price_ " means an amount equal to the quotient (rounded to the tenth decimal place) of: (i) an amount equal to (A) the Purchase Price (determined for purposes of the Closing as provided in _Section 1.5_), minus (B) the Escrow Amount, and plus (C) the sum of the aggregate exercise prices of all Options outstanding immediately prior the Closing, divided by (ii) the Fully Diluted Common Stock. 

   

 (c) " _Closing Financial Statements_ " means a balance sheet of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the Closing prepared as set forth in this  _Section 1.4(c)_ and, as applicable, _Section 1.5_ or _Section 1.8_. The Parties agree that the Closing Financial Statements shall be prepared in accordance with this Agreement, and to the extent not inconsistent with this Agreement, in accordance with GAAP on a basis consistent with the Companys preparation of the March 31, 2009 Audited Financial Statements (i.e., using the same methodologies and judgments as were used by the Company in preparation of such Audited Financial Statements); provided, however, that spare parts inventory shall be accounted for and reflected in the Closing Financial Statements on a basis consistent with the Companys Latest Balance Sheet. 

   

 (d) " _Common Share Price_ " means an amount equal to the quotient (rounded to the tenth decimal place) of: (i) (A) the Purchase Price (determined giving effect to the adjustments provided in _Section 1.8_), plus (B) the sum of the aggregate exercise prices of all Options outstanding immediately prior to the Closing, divided by (ii) the Fully Diluted Common Stock, which amount shall be subject to adjustment (by increase or decrease), without duplication, for (1) the deposit of the Escrow Amount at the Closing pursuant to _Section 1.6(g)_, (2) the release, if any, of all or any portion of the Escrow Amount (and any interest, dividends and other income earned thereon) for distribution to the Shareholders pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, and (3) other amounts payable herein for distribution to the Shareholders pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. 

   

 (e) " _Debt_ " means, without duplication, as of immediately prior to the Closing the aggregate amount of: (i) all indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiaries (including the principal amount thereof or, if applicable, the accreted amount thereof and the amount of accrued and unpaid interest thereon), whether or not represented by bonds, debentures, notes or other securities, for the repayment of money borrowed, (ii) all obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries to pay rent or other payment amounts under a lease of real or personal property which is classified as a capital lease on the face of the Latest Balance Sheet, (iii) any outstanding reimbursement obligation of the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to letters of credit, bankers acceptances or similar facilities issued for the account of the Company or a Subsidiary thereof pursuant to which the applicable bank or similar entity has paid thereunder obligations for which the Company or a Subsidiary thereof is required to repay, (iv) any payment obligation of the Company and its Subsidiaries under any interest rate swap agreement, forward rate agreement, interest rate cap or collar agreement or other financial agreement or arrangement entered into for the purpose of limiting or managing interest rate risks, (v) all indebtedness for borrowed money secured by any Lien existing on property owned by the Company or a Subsidiary thereof, whether or not indebtedness secured thereby shall have been assumed, (vi) all 

   ##### 

  

   

guaranties, endorsements, assumptions and other contingent obligations of the
Company and its Subsidiaries in respect of, or to purchase or to otherwise
acquire, indebtedness for borrowed money of others the repayment of which is
guaranteed by the Company or a Subsidiary thereof, and (vii) all other short-

To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Buyer or the Company, such withheld amounts will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement and the Transaction Documents, as applicable, as having been paid to the Person in respect of whom such deduction and withholding were made by Buyer or the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no withholding shall be made under Section 1445 of the Code as to any Shareholder if, prior to the Closing, Buyer or the Company shall have received (i) a certification by the Company with respect to the shares of the Company which meets the requirements of Treasury Regulation Section 1.1445-2(c)(3), or (ii) a certificate of non-foreign status by such Shareholder which meets the requirements of Treasury Regulation Section 1.1445-2(b)(2).

Thereafter, the Closing Financial Statements and calculations of the Cash and Net Working Capital delivered to the Shareholders Agent shall be final and binding on the Parties unless the Shareholders Agent objects within thirty (30) days after receipt thereof by: (i) notifying Buyer in writing of each objection and (ii) delivering to Buyer a detailed statement describing the basis for each objection along with the Shareholders Agents Closing Financial Statements and calculations of the Cash and Net Working Capital. Any component of Buyers Closing Financial Statements and calculations of the Cash and Net Working Capital that is not the subject of an objection by the Shareholders Agent shall be final and binding on the Parties. If Buyer agrees with the objection(s) of the Shareholders Agent and the Shareholders Agents Closing Financial Statements and calculations of the Cash and Net Working Capital, then the Shareholders Agents Closing Financial Statements and calculations of the Cash and Net Working Capital shall be final and binding on the Parties and the Purchase Price shall be adjusted as set forth in _Section 1.8(e)_. If Buyer does not agree with the objection(s) of the Shareholders Agent or the Shareholders Agents Closing Financial Statements and calculations 

   ##### 

  

   

of the Cash and Net Working Capital, then Buyer shall, within fifteen (15)
days after receipt of the Shareholders Agents objection(s) and calculations,
notify the Shareholders Agent of its disagreement which shall contain a
detailed statement describing the basis for each objection. Following the
Closing Date, Buyer shall permit the Shareholders Agent and its counsel,
accountants and other advisors full access (with the right to make copies) to
the financial books and records of the Company for the purposes of the review
and objection right and dispute process contemplated in _Section 1.8_. 

   

 (c) The Parties shall use reasonable efforts to resolve any dispute arising under _Section 1.8(b)_ ; provided, that if they are unable to do so within thirty (30) days following Buyers notice to the Shareholders Agent that it disagrees with the Shareholders Agents Closing Financial Statements and calculations of Cash and Net Working Capital, then by notice from the Shareholders Agent or Buyer to the other the disagreement may be submitted for resolution to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP or such other firm of independent accountants of national standing to which the Parties agree (the " _Independent Accountants_ "). If issues are submitted to the Independent Accountants for resolution, the Shareholders Agent and Buyer shall enter into a customary engagement letter with the Independent Accountants at the time the issues remaining in dispute are submitted to the Independent Accountants. Within ten (10) Business Days after the Independent Accountants have been retained, the Shareholders Agent and Buyer shall furnish, at their own expense, to the Independent Accountants and the other party a written statement of their position with respect to each matter in dispute. Within five (5) Business Days after the expiration of such ten (10) Business Day period, the Shareholders Agent and Buyer may deliver to the Independent Accountants and to each other its response to the others position on each matter in dispute. With each submission, the Shareholders Agent and Buyer may also furnish to the Independent Accountants such other information and documents as they deem relevant or such information and documents as may be requested by the Independent Accountants with appropriate copies or notification being given to the other. The Independent Accountants may, at their discretion, conduct a conference concerning the disagreement with the Shareholders Agent and Buyer, at which conference the Shareholders Agent and Buyer shall each have the right to present additional documents, materials and other information and to have present its advisors, counsel and accountants. 

   

 (d) The Independent Accountants shall be directed to promptly, and in any event within thirty (30) days after their appointment pursuant to _Section 1.8(c)_, render their decision on the disputed items. The Independent Accountants determination as to each item in dispute shall be set forth in a written statement delivered to the Shareholders Agent and Buyer, which shall include the Independent Accountants determination of the disputed items of the Closing Financial Statements and their calculations of such disputed items, all of which shall be final and binding on the Parties. The Independent Accountants shall also determine the proportion of their fees and expenses to be paid by each of the Shareholders Agent and Buyer or the Company based primarily on the degree to which the Independent Accountants have accepted the positions of the respective Parties. 

    

(e) (i) If the sum of Cash plus the Net Working Capital as finally
determined pursuant to this _Section 1.8_ exceeds the sum of Estimated Cash
plus the Estimated Net Working Capital, then Buyer shall, or shall cause the
Company to, promptly pay to the Shareholders Agent the amount of such excess
plus 

   ##### 

  

   

interest thereon from the Closing Date through the payment date at the prime
rate of interest quoted in _The Wall Street Journal_ on the second Business
Day prior to the date of payment (the " _Applicable Rate_ "). Promptly after
the receipt of such funds the Shareholders Agent, shall distribute such funds
to the Shareholders based on each Shareholders Percentage Share thereof. In
addition, the Shareholders Agent shall have the right to request the Company
to distribute all or any part of such funds to any or all of the other
Shareholders and upon making such request and tendering such funds to the
Company, the Company shall promptly make such distribution to such
Shareholders based on each such Shareholders Percentage Share thereof and
the Shareholders Agent shall have no further liability or obligation as to
the distribution of such funds. 

   

 (ii) If the sum of Estimated Cash plus the Estimated Net Working Capital exceeds the amount of the sum of Cash plus Net Working Capital as finally determined pursuant to this _Section 1.8_, then Buyer and the Shareholders Agent shall provide a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent to deliver promptly from the Escrow Amount the amount of such excess to Buyer plus interest thereon from the Closing Date through the payment date at the Applicable Rate. To the extent that such excess and interest thereon from the Closing Date through the payment date at the Applicable Rate exceed the Escrow Amount, Buyer and the Company shall be deemed to have irrevocably waived any right to recover such unpaid excess and interest. 

  

 1.9 _Post-Closing Option Deduction Payment_. On each date an amount is (a) released from the Escrow Fund, (b) paid pursuant to _Section 1.8(e)(i)_, or (c) paid pursuant to  _Section 5.21(e)_, in each case, to, or for the benefit of, the Shareholders, Buyer shall pay to the Shareholders Agent for distribution to the Shareholders based on each Shareholders Percentage Share thereof the Post-Closing Option Deduction Payment with respect to the release or payment.

liabilities, obligations or contingencies that (i) have been incurred since
the date of the Latest Balance Sheet in the ordinary course of business

liability would constitute a breach or inaccuracy of such representation or
warranty. (By way of example, as to the foregoing sentence, pending and

 5.4 _Notification of Certain Matters_.

Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, unless Buyer provides the Company with a written termination notice pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)_ within two Business Days after the expiration of any applicable cure period in respect of a breach described in an updated _Company Disclosure Schedule_ delivered pursuant to this _Section 5.4_ and which uncured breach would otherwise give rise to a termination right by Buyer under  _Section 7.1(d)_, then Buyer, in respect of such uncured breach, shall be deemed to have waived its right to terminate this Agreement or prevent the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)_ or _Section 6.2_, as applicable, and to have accepted such updated _Company Disclosure Schedule_ for all purposes under this Agreement. Subject to the above termination right of Buyer, the delivery 

   ##### 

  

    

of any such updated _Company Disclosure Schedule_ will be deemed to have cured
any misrepresentation or breach of warranty that otherwise might have existed
hereunder by reason of such variance or inaccuracy. 

  

 5.5 _Termination of Certain Agreements_. At or prior to the Closing, but after the payment of the Advisor Fees as a part of the Transaction Costs as contemplated by _Section 1.6(f)_ of this Agreement, the Company shall take such action as may be necessary to cause the Advisory Agreements and the other agreements described in _Company Disclosure Schedule 5.5_ to be terminated and for the Parties thereto to release and waive any and all claims that any of them may have under such agreements; provided that such termination and release shall be effected in a manner so that all indemnification obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries under the Advisory Agreements shall survive such termination and release. 

  

 5.6 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Buyer shall give to the Company prompt written notice of: (a) the occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event of which it has Knowledge that would be reasonably likely to cause any representation or warranty of Buyer contained in this Agreement or in any other Transaction Document to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect at any time from the date of this Agreement to the Closing determined as if such representation or warranty were made at such time, (b) the failure of Buyer to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant to be complied with by it hereunder, (c) any written notice or other written communication from any Person alleging that the Consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (d) any written notice or other written communication from any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

independent auditors) with access to the facilities and properties of the
Company and each of its Subsidiaries and to all information, files, documents
and records (written and computer) that are not otherwise protected by legal
privilege relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries or any of their
businesses or operations for any and all periods prior to or including the
Closing Date that they may require with respect to any reasonable business
purpose (including any Tax matter) or in connection with any claim, dispute,
action, cause of action, investigation or proceeding of any kind by or
against any person, and shall (and shall cause the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries to) cooperate fully with the Shareholders Agent and its

representatives (including counsel and independent auditors), with regard to
any reasonable business purpose. 

  

 5.9 _Indemnification of Officers, Directors, Employees and Agents_. 

  

 (a) From and after the Closing, Buyer and the Company shall jointly and severally indemnify (which shall include the mandatory advancement of expenses as provided in this _Section 5.9_ ), defend and hold harmless each Person who is now, or has been at any time or who becomes prior to the Closing, a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Company Parties_ ") against all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys and other professionals fees and expenses), fines, liabilities or judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement, arising out of or relating to acts or omissions by them in their capacities as such, which acts or omissions occurred at or prior to the Closing, in each case to the fullest extent permitted under Applicable Laws and in the case of the Company, the terms of the Companys articles of incorporation and bylaws in effect on the date of this Agreement. In determining whether an Indemnified Company Party is entitled to indemnification under this _Section 5.9_, if requested by such Indemnified Company Party, such determination shall be made by special, independent counsel selected by the Company and approved by the Indemnified Company Party (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) and who has not otherwise performed services for the Company or its Affiliates within the last three years (other than in connection with such matter). 

   

 (b) The rights of an Indemnified Company Party under this _Section 5.9_ and the exculpation provisions contained in the Companys articles of incorporation, bylaws or other governing documents shall not be diminished by any amendment on or after the Closing Date to the Companys articles of incorporation, bylaws or other governing documents. 

   

 (c) Without limiting the foregoing, in the event of any claim for indemnification, Buyer and the Company shall jointly and severally, (x) periodically advance reasonable fees and expenses (including attorneys and other professionals fees and expenses) with respect to the foregoing and pay the reasonable fees and expenses of one counsel selected by each Indemnified Company Party, which counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to Buyer, promptly after statements therefor are received, provided that the Indemnified Company Party to whom fees and expenses are advanced or for which fees and expenses of counsel are paid provides an undertaking to repay such advances and payments if it is ultimately determined that such Indemnified Company Party is not entitled to indemnification, and (y) assist each 

    ##### 

  

    

Indemnified Company Party in such defense, and subject to the terms of this
_Section 5.9_ , Buyer and the Company shall cooperate in the defense of any
matter. 

   

 (d) The Indemnified Company Party shall have the right to retain one counsel of such Indemnified Company Partys own choice to represent such Person, which counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to Buyer; and such counsel shall, to the extent consistent with its professional responsibilities, reasonably cooperate with the Company and any counsel designated by the Company. Buyer and the Company shall be liable only for any settlement of any Claim against an Indemnified Company Party made with Buyer or the Companys written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Buyer and the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of an Indemnified Company Party, settle or compromise any claim, or permit a default or consent to the entry of any judgment in respect thereof, unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes, as an unconditional term thereof, the giving by the claimant to such Indemnified Company Party of an unconditional release from all liability and obligations (civil or criminal or monetary or otherwise) in respect of such claim. 

   

 (e) Prior to the Closing, the Company may obtain such "tail" policies in respect of existing policies of directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries and providing such coverage as may be determined appropriate by the Company; provided that the first $150,000 of the costs of such shall be disregarded (including by means of increasing the amount of the Cash or Net Working Capital, as applicable, by the amount of such $150,000 of the costs) in determining Cash or Net Working Capital, as applicable, it being the intent that Buyer bears the first $150,000 of such costs. 

   

 (f) If Buyer or the Company or any of their successors or assigns consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each case, to the extent not assumed by operation of law, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Company, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.9_. 

   

 (g) All rights to indemnification and/or advancement of expenses contained in the agreements with Indemnified Company Parties as in effect on the date hereof and set forth in _Company Disclosure Schedule 5.9_ with respect to matters occurring on or prior to the Closing (including the transactions contemplated hereby) shall survive the Closing and continue in full force and effect. Buyer and the Company shall indemnify any Indemnified Company Party against all reasonable costs and expenses (including attorneys and other professionals fees and expenses), such amount to be payable in advance upon request as provided in this _Section 5.9_, relating to the enforcement of such Indemnified Company Partys rights under this _Section 5.9_ or under any charter, bylaw, other governing document or other agreement, provided that such Indemnified Company Party provides an undertaking to repay any advances of costs and expenses if it is ultimately determined that such Indemnified Company Party is not entitled to indemnification hereunder or thereunder. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (h) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company or any of its officers, directors or employees, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this _Section 5.9_ is not prior to or in substitution for any such claims under such policies. 

   

 (i) The provisions of this _Section 5.9_ shall survive the Closing and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Persons identified in _Section 5.9(a)_ , their heirs and their personal representatives and shall be binding on all successors and assigns of Buyer and the Company and may not be terminated or amended in any manner adverse to such Persons without their prior written consent. 

   

 5.10 _HSR_. Subject to _Section 5.10_, from the date hereof through the date of termination of the required waiting period under the HSR Act, Buyer shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, take any action that could reasonably be expected to hinder or delay the obtaining of clearance or the expiration of the required waiting period under the HSR Act or any other applicable Antitrust Law. 

  

 5.11 _Governmental Consents_. 

  

 (a) Promptly following the execution of this Agreement, but in no event later than fifteen (15) Business Days following the date of this Agreement, the Parties shall file, or cause to be filed by their respective "ultimate parent entities," with the FTC and the DOJ the notifications and other information (if any) required to be filed under the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated in the Transaction Documents. In addition, the Company and Buyer shall promptly proceed to prepare and file with the appropriate Governmental Entities such additional requests, reports or notifications as may be required or, in the opinion of Buyer or the Company, advisable, in connection with this Agreement. With respect to each of the above filings, the Buyer and the Company shall diligently and expeditiously prosecute, and shall cooperate fully with each other in the prosecution of, such matters including subject to Applicable Law, by permitting counsel for the other to review in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the other in connection with any such filing or any proposed written communication with any Governmental Entity and by providing counsel for the other with copies of all filings and submissions made by such Party and all correspondence between such Party (and its advisors) with any Governmental Entity and any other information supplied by such Party and such Partys Subsidiaries to a Governmental Entity or received from such a Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that (i) materials may be redacted before being so provided (X) to remove (A) references concerning the valuation of the Company, or any of its Subsidiaries and (B) individual customer pricing information, (Y) as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements, and (Z) as necessary to avoid disclosure of other competitively sensitive information or to address reasonable privilege or confidentiality concerns, and (ii) copies of documents filed by a party hereto pursuant to Item 4(c) of the Notification and Report Form filed with the FTC and the DOJ shall not be required to be provided to any other Party hereto. Each of Buyer and the Company shall furnish to the other such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other may reasonably request in connection with its preparation of any such filing or submission. Buyer and the Company shall keep each other apprised of the status of any 

    ##### 

  

    

communications with, and any inquiries or requests for additional information
from, the FTC or the DOJ. In the event a suit is threatened or instituted
challenging the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as violative of
the HSR Act, as amended, the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as
amended, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended or any other federal,
state or foreign law or regulation or decree designed to prohibit, restrict
or regulate actions for the purpose or effect of foreign ownership,
monopolization or restraint of trade (collectively, " _Antitrust Laws_ "),
Buyer shall take all commercially reasonable actions as may be required to
avoid the filing of or resist or resolve such suit. Buyer will be entitled to
determine strategy, lead all proceedings and coordinate all activities with
respect to seeking any actions, consents, approvals or waivers of any
Governmental Entity as contemplated by this _Section 5.11(a)_ , and the
Company and its Subsidiaries will take such actions as reasonably requested
by Buyer in connection with obtaining such consents, approvals or waivers.
Notwithstanding Buyers rights to lead all proceedings as provided in the
prior sentence, Buyer shall not require the Company to, and the Company shall
not be required to, take any action with respect to satisfying any Antitrust
Laws which would bind the Company or its Subsidiaries irrespective of whether
the Closing occurs. In addition, Buyer shall take all commercially reasonable
actions as may be required by any federal or state court of the United States
or any foreign court or tribunal, in any suit brought by any Governmental
Entity or any other person challenging the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as violative of the Antitrust Laws, in order to avoid the entry
of any permanent injunction or other permanent order which has the effect of
preventing the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement prior to the Termination Date, and in the event that any permanent
or preliminary injunction or other order is entered or becomes reasonably
foreseeable to be entered in any proceeding that would make consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement unlawful or that would prevent or delay consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, Buyer shall promptly take any and all steps
necessary to vacate, modify or suspend such injunction or order so as
to permit such consummation prior to the Termination Date. 

   

 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, neither Buyer, the Company, nor any of their respective Affiliates shall be required (i) to hold separate (including by trust or otherwise) or divest any of their respective businesses or assets, (ii) to agree to any limitation on the operation or conduct of their respective businesses or (iii) to waive any of the conditions set forth in _Article VI_ of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, neither Buyer nor the Company shall have any liability for a failure to obtain any Consent from a Governmental Entity that satisfies the foregoing requirements as long as Buyer or the Company, as the case may be, complies with its obligations set forth in this  _Section 5.11_. 

   

 5.12 _Return of Company Information_. The Company shall immediately exercise its contractual rights to request the return or destruction of any information relating to the Company that had been previously furnished by the Company to any Person who has been provided access to the Companys electronic data room for purposes of evaluating a potential Acquisition Transaction. Except in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, after the date of this Agreement, the Company shall not provide any information to any Person with respect to a potential Acquisition Transaction. 

   ##### 

  

  

 5.13 _Financing_. 

  

 (a) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide to Buyer, and to cause the officers, employees and representatives of the Company to provide to Buyer, all cooperation reasonably requested by Buyer that is necessary or reasonably required in connection with the Financing, including using commercially reasonable efforts in respect of the following: (i) to cause the Companys senior officers and other representatives to participate in meetings, presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions (including accounting due diligence sessions), drafting sessions and sessions with rating agencies; (ii) assisting with the preparation of appropriate and customary materials for rating agency presentations, offering documents, bank information memoranda and similar documents reasonably required in connection with the Financing; (iii) to assist with the preparation of any pledge and security documents, any loan agreement, currency or interest hedging agreement, any equity financing document, other definitive financing documents or other certificates, legal opinions or documents as may be reasonably requested by Buyer; (iv) to facilitate the pledging of collateral; (v) to furnish on a confidential basis to Buyer and their financing sources, as promptly as practicable, financial and other pertinent information regarding the Company as may be reasonably requested by Buyer, including pursuant to  _Section 5.15_ the S-X Business Financials and other financial data required by the documents used in connection with the Financing; (vi) if the Delivery Date is after February 1, 2010, to furnish Buyer with such information as Buyer may reasonably request relating to the financial performance and condition of the Company as of dates and for periods ended after December 31, 2009, including any information necessary to prepare a "Recent Developments" section of any offering document used in connection with the Financing; (vii) pursuant to _Section 5.14_, providing monthly financial statements (excluding footnotes) within the time such statements are customarily prepared; and (viii) to authorize the Companys independent accountants to cooperate with and assist Buyer in preparing customary and appropriate information packages and offering materials as the parties participating in the Financing may reasonably request for use in connection with the offering and/or syndication of debt or equity securities, loan participations and other matters for purposes of the Financing; _provided_ that nothing in this Agreement shall require such cooperation to the extent it would, in the Companys reasonable judgment, interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the Company; _provided_ _further_ that notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, until the Closing, (1) the Company shall not (x) be required to pay any commitment or other similar fee, (y) execute or have any liability or obligation under any loan agreement or any related document or any other agreement or document related to the Financing or (z) be required to incur any other liability in connection with the Financing and (2) the Board of Directors of the Company shall not be required to adopt resolutions approving any agreements or documents related to the Financing; and _provided_   _further_ that, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company shall be under no obligation to provide Buyer with any audited financial statements of the Company for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2010. 

   

 (b) Buyer shall, promptly upon written request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs to the extent such costs are incurred by the Company in connection with such cooperation provided by the Company, its officers, employees and other representatives pursuant to the terms of this _Section 5.13_ or in connection with compliance with its obligations under this _Section 5.13_ and Buyer shall 

    ##### 

  

    

indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its officers, employees and
representatives from and against any and all liabilities or losses suffered
or incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of the Financing and
any information utilized in connection therewith (other than arising from
information provided by the Company), except in the event such liabilities or
losses arose out of or result from the willful misconduct of the Company or
any of its officers, employees or representatives. The Company hereby
consents to the use of its logos in connection with the Financing; _provided_
that such logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended
or reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company or the reputation or
goodwill of the Company and their marks. The foregoing indemnification
obligation shall survive the Closing and any termination of this Agreement.
The foregoing reimbursement obligation of Buyer, to the extent unpaid as of
the Closing, shall be considered an outstanding accounts receivable for
purposes of determining the Net Working Capital hereunder. 

   

 5.14 _Financial Information_. Within twelve (12) Business Days following the end of each calendar month beginning with the calendar month of January 2010 until the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Buyer (a) a true and correct copy of the unaudited balance sheet and statement of income of the Company as of, and for the calendar month then ended, prepared consistently with GAAP (provided that such balance sheet and statement of income shall not be required to contain all footnotes required under GAAP and shall be subject to normal year-end adjustments); and (b) a schedule of the amount and purpose of the cash capital expenditures made by the Company during such calendar month. 

  

 5.15 _Regulation S-X Compliant Financial Statements_. 

  

 (a) The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide all of the S-X Business Financials on or before February 1, 2010 and may deliver financial statements comprising all or part of the S-X Business Financials at varying times on or before February 1, 2010. At such time as the Company shall reasonably believe that it has delivered to Buyer any such component of the S-X Business Financials, it may deliver to Buyer a written notice to that effect, in which case the Company shall be deemed to have complied with its obligations under this _Section 5.15(a)_ with respect to such delivered S-X Business Financials component unless Buyer reasonably believes the Company has not completed delivery of such S-X Business Financials component and, within two Business Days after such notice delivers a written notice to the Company to that effect (stating with specificity the deficiencies in the delivered S-X Business Financials). 

   

 (b) After the date hereof, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide Buyer with such information as Buyer may reasonably request in connection with Buyers preparation of pro forma financial information for purposes of its reports or other filings (including any registration statement, any amendment thereto, or any prospectus or prospectus supplement in connection therewith) with the SEC. 

   

 (c) In the event the SEC has comments or questions on any of the S-X Business Financials, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to assist and reasonably cooperate with Buyer, Buyers independent accountants and the SEC to resolve any such issues and questions regarding such S-X Business Financials and take such commercially reasonably actions with respect to such S-X Business Financials as are necessary for Buyer to 

    ##### 

  

    

satisfy its obligations under Regulation S-X. The Parties hereby agree that
the receipt of any comments or questions from the SEC or any changes to the
S-X Business Financials made in response to such comments or questions shall
in no event create any presumption or other basis for asserting that the
covenants set forth in this _Section 5.15_ are breached or not satisfied. 

   

 (d) The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Buyers reasonable requests in connection with Buyers compliance with Applicable Laws with respect to the transactions hereunder, including (i) providing access to its management upon reasonable prior notice during normal business hours to assist with SEC reporting obligations of the transactions hereunder, including the preparation by Buyer of pro forma financial statements, addressing purchase accounting issues and preparation of any SEC waiver letters and (ii) allowing access to the Companys independent accountants (including to the extent required by such accountants, consent to the release of their work papers to Buyer or Buyers independent accountants), and discussing with and obtaining from the independent accountants appropriate consents to fulfill Buyers reporting requirements, including financial statements and the notes thereto. 

   

 5.16 _Reasonable Efforts; Further Assurances_. Subject to _Section 5.11_ which shall govern the subject matter thereof, prior to the Closing, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, Buyer, each Shareholder and the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable (subject to any Applicable Laws) to consummate the Closing and the other transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable. In addition, no Party shall take any action after the date of this Agreement to materially delay the obtaining of, or result in not obtaining, any Consent from any Governmental Entity necessary to be obtained prior to the Closing. 

  

 5.17 _Resignations_. At the Closing and prior to the adopting of any resolutions relating to the Financing, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the resignation of each Director of the Company, in his capacity as such, and to the extent that such resignations are not obtained, the Shareholders shall take action to effect the removal of such directors. Any actual or constructive termination of employment of any employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that may arise or result from any such Director resignation shall be deemed to occur after the Closing for all purposes hereunder. 

  

 5.18 _Obtaining Financing_. Buyer shall take all commercially reasonable actions as may be necessary to obtain the Debt Financing as well as with respect to any other financing, which together with the Debt Financing shall provide Buyer with sufficient cash in immediately available funds at the Closing to make the payments contemplated by _Section 1.6_. Such additional financing and the Debt Financing are collectively referred to herein as the " _Financing_ ". Buyer acknowledges that obtaining the Financing is not a condition precedent to Buyers obligations hereunder. 

  

 5.19 _No Transfer_. Prior to the termination of this Agreement, no Shareholder shall voluntarily transfer or assign any share of Common Stock owned of record by such Shareholder. If, after the date of this Agreement, any Shareholder should exercise any Options owned by such Shareholder, then such Shareholder shall execute and deliver to the Parties such documents and 

   ##### 

  

    

instruments as may be necessary to cause the shares of Common Stock issued as
a result of such exercise to be subject to this Agreement. 

  

 5.20 _No Other Representations or Warranties_. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that it has relied solely on the representations and warranties of the Company and the Shareholders expressly and specifically set forth in _Article III_ of this Agreement. Buyer agrees that, except for the representations and warranties that are expressly set forth in _Article III_ of this Agreement, none of the Company, the Shareholders or any of their respective Affiliates or representatives has made and shall not be deemed to have made to Buyer or to any of its representatives any representation or warranty of any kind. Except as expressly set forth herein, no Person has been authorized by the Company or the Shareholders to make any representation or warranty relating to the Company or any Subsidiary thereof or their respective businesses or operations, or otherwise in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and, if made, such representation or warranty may not be relied upon. 

  

 5.21 _Tax Matters_. 

  

 (a) Buyer shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and filed (after taking into account all appropriate extensions), all Tax Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries required to be filed after the Closing Date for all Pre-Closing Periods and all Straddle Periods. All such Tax Returns shall be prepared on a basis consistent with past practice, procedures and accounting methods, except to the extent otherwise required by Applicable Law. For purposes of filing Tax Returns and computing the Income Tax Amount, the Estimated Income Tax Amount and the Final Income Tax Amount, the Parties shall (i) treat all payments to the holders of the Options on the release of the Escrow Fund, pursuant to _Section 1.8(e)(i)_, and _Section 5.21(e)_ as being deducted when the Escrow Fund is released or when the payments are made under _Section 1.8(e)(i)_ or _Section 5.21(e)_ and (ii) treat all Severance Costs as being deductible by the Company and its Subsidiaries in the Tax year beginning on the date following the Closing Date. For purposes of computing the Final Income Tax Amount, the Transaction Deductions shall be taken into account in accordance with the procedures set forth in this _Section 5.21_. For purposes of this _Section 5.21_, a Tax position shall be considered to be consistent with Applicable Laws if it is "more likely than not" that such position will be sustained if challenged by the applicable Governmental Entity. If a position is not "more likely than not" to be sustained, (A) Buyer shall compute the Income Tax Amount and file Tax Returns using the position that is "more likely than not" to be sustained or (B) if no position is "more likely than not" to be sustained, Buyer shall take a position, which in its good faith determination, would have the greatest success of being sustained if challenged by the Governmental Entity. 

   

 (b) No more than sixty (60) days prior to the due date (after taking into account appropriate extensions) for filing of any Income Tax Return for the Company and its Subsidiaries required to be filed after the Closing Date for any Pre-Closing Period or Straddle Period, Buyer shall deliver a copy of such Income Tax Return to the Shareholders Agent for the Shareholders Agents review and comment. No more than sixty (60) days prior to the due date (after taking into account appropriate extensions) of the U.S. federal Income Tax Return for the taxable period ending on the Closing Date, Buyer shall compute the Income Tax Amount based on the amounts shown on the Income Tax Returns, or drafts thereof, for Pre-Closing Periods (and a reasonable estimate of what will be reflected on Income Tax Returns of the Company and 

    ##### 

  

    

its Subsidiaries for Straddle Periods that is properly allocated to the
portion of the period ending on the Closing Date under _Section 5.21(h)_)
and shall submit such computation, together with a draft of any Income Tax
Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Periods or
Straddle Periods not previously provided, to the Shareholders Agent for
the Shareholders Agents review. No failure or delay in timely providing the
computation or Income Tax Return pursuant to the prior sentence shall reduce
the obligations of the Shareholders with respect to Taxes under this
Agreement, except to the extent such failure or delay shall
materially prejudice the Shareholders. The Income Tax Amount prepared by
Buyer shall be final and binding on the Parties unless the Shareholders Agent
objects within thirty (30) days after receipt thereof by: (i) notifying Buyer
in writing of each objection and (ii) delivering to Buyer a detailed
statement describing the basis for each objection along with the Shareholders
Agents computation of the Income Tax Amount. Any component of Buyers
computation of the Income Tax Amount that is not the subject of an objection
by the Shareholders Agent shall be final and binding on the Parties. If Buyer
agrees with the objection(s) of the Shareholders Agent, then the Shareholders
Agents computation of the Income Tax Amount shall be final and binding on
the Parties. If Buyer does not agree with the objection(s) of the
Shareholders Agent or the Shareholders Agents computations of the Income Tax
Amount, then Buyer shall, within fifteen (15) days after receipt of the
Shareholders Agents objection(s) and computations, notify the Shareholders
Agent of its disagreement that shall contain a detailed statement describing
the basis for each objection. 

   

 (c) No more than ten (10) days prior to the due date for filing of any material non-income Tax Return for the Company or any Subsidiary for any Pre-Closing Period or Straddle Period, Buyer shall submit a draft of the Tax Return to the Shareholders Agent for the Shareholders Agents review. No failure or delay in timely providing the Tax Return pursuant to the prior sentence shall reduce the obligations of the Shareholders with respect to Taxes under this Agreement, except to the extent such failure or delay shall materially prejudice the Shareholders. The Tax Return provided by Buyer pursuant to the prior sentence shall be final and binding on the Parties unless the Shareholders Agent objects within five (5) days after receipt thereof by: (i) notifying Buyer in writing of each objection and (ii) delivering to Buyer a detailed statement describing the basis for each objection. Any component of the Tax Return prepared by the Buyer that is not the subject of an objection by the Shareholders Agent shall be final and binding on the Parties. If Buyer agrees with the objection(s) of the Shareholders Agent, then the Shareholders Agents method for preparing the Tax Return shall be final and binding on the Parties. If Buyer does not agree with the objection(s) of the Shareholders Agent, then Buyer shall, within two (2) days after receipt of the Shareholders Agents objection(s), notify the Shareholders Agent of its disagreement that shall contain a detailed statement describing the basis for each objection. 

   

 (d) Following the Closing Date, Buyer shall permit the Shareholders Agent and its counsel, accountants and other advisors full access (with the right to make copies) to the financial books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries and to their respective officers, employees and any third party tax return preparers engaged by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for the purposes of the review and objection right and dispute process contemplated in _Section 5.21(b)_ or  _Section 5.21(c)_. Buyer and the Shareholders Agent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve any disputes arising under _Section 5.21(b)_ or _Section 5.21(c)_;  _provided_ , _however_ , that if they are unable to do so within ten (10) days following Buyers notice 

    ##### 

  

    

to the Shareholders Agent that it disagrees with the Shareholders Agents
computation, Buyer and the Shareholders Agent shall resolve their dispute by
submitting such dispute to the Independent Accountants in accordance with the
dispute provisions of _Section 1.8_ which shall be applicable mutatis
mutandis; _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that if Buyer and the
Shareholders Agent are in a dispute as to whether a position is "more likely
than not" to be sustained, Buyers position shall be binding unless the
Shareholders Agent, at its sole cost and expense, can deliver an opinion
addressed to Buyer (or its designee) from a nationally recognized law firm or
accounting firm in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
Buyer concluding that the Shareholders Agents position is "more likely than
not" to be sustained. 

   

 (e) To the extent that the Estimated Income Tax Amount exceeds the Final Income Tax Amount, as finally determined pursuant to _Section 5.21(b)_, Buyer shall pay to the Shareholders Agent the amount of such excess. Promptly after the receipt of such funds, the Shareholders Agent shall distribute such funds to the Shareholders based on each Shareholders Percentage Share thereof. In addition, the Shareholders Agent shall have the right to request the Company to distribute all or any part of such funds to any or all of the other Shareholders and upon making such request and tendering such funds to the Company, the Company shall promptly make such distribution to such Shareholders based on each such Shareholders Percentage Share thereof and the Shareholders Agent shall have no further liability or obligation as to the distribution of such funds. 

   

 (f) To the extent the Final Income Tax Amount, as finally determined pursuant to _Section 5.21(b)_ , exceeds the Estimated Income Tax Amount, then Buyer and the Shareholders Agent shall provide a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent to deliver promptly from the Escrow Fund the amount of such excess to Buyer. To the extent that such excess exceeds the then remaining Escrow Amount, Buyer and the Company shall be deemed to have irrevocably waived any right to recover such excess. 

   

 (g) Buyer and the Shareholders Agent shall, and shall cause its respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates to, provide to each other such cooperation and information, as and to the extent reasonably required, in connection with the filing of any Tax Return, amended Tax Return, claim for refund, or in conducting any audit, litigation, or other proceedings with respect to Taxes. 

   

 (h) If the Company and its Subsidiaries are required, or permitted, under Applicable Laws to have their Tax year end on the Closing Date, the parties shall have the Company or the applicable Subsidiary file a Tax Return for the Pre-Closing Period. If the Company or its Subsidiaries are not required or permitted to have a period end on the Closing Date, the allocation of Taxes for a period beginning before and ending after the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ ") between the portion of the period ending on the Closing Date and the portion of the period beginning on the day after the Closing Date shall be made using the following conventions: 

   

 (i) If the Tax is an Income Tax or relates to an actual transaction, the allocation shall be made based on an interim closing of the books as of the end of the Closing Date, provided that amounts shown on such return for the entire period that are determined on a 

   ##### 

  

    

daily basis (such as depreciation deductions and the impact of marginal rates)
shall be applied pro rata to each day within the period. 

  

 (ii) For any other Tax such as a property Tax, the allocation shall be determined as if the Tax was incurred ratably over the entire period. 

  

 (i) Any and all Tax sharing or Tax allocation agreements with respect to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party shall be terminated prior to the Closing Date such that neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall have any obligations to make any payments thereunder. 

   

 (j) To the extent that amounts are disclosed with respect to _Section 3.7(c)_ on  _Company Disclosure Schedule 3.7_ or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries are going to otherwise make any payment (including any payment on account of accelerated vesting) that, not taking into account any payments made under compensatory arrangements entered into by the Buyer with any of the Companys employees on or prior to the Closing Date, would (absent appropriate shareholder approval) be nondeductible under Code Section 280G or subject to an excise tax under Code Section 4999 (collectively, the " _Parachute Payments_ "), the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts prior to the Closing Date to (i) obtain from each appropriate "disqualified person" (as defined in Code Section 280G(c)) a waiver such that after giving effect to the waiver (and assuming shareholder approval is not obtained) the amount of the Parachute Payments to such person (absent shareholder approval) are less than three times such persons "base amount" (as defined in Code Section 280G(b)(3)) and (ii) submit for separate shareholder vote the Parachute Payments (accompanied by adequate disclosure) in a manner such that if more than seventy-five percent (75%) of the shareholders of the Company approve the Parachute Payments that are the subject of the vote, and all Parachute Payments are paid, none of the Parachute Payments will be nondeductible under Code Section 280G or subject to an excise tax under Code Section 4999. If taking into account any payments made under compensatory arrangements entered into by Buyer with any of the Companys employees, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries are going to make a Parachute Payment, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts prior to the Closing Date to (i) obtain from each appropriate "disqualified person" a waiver such that after giving effect to the waiver (and assuming shareholder approval is not obtained) the amount of the Parachute Payments to such person (absent shareholder approval) are less than three times such Persons "base amount" and (ii) submit for separate shareholder vote the Parachute Payments (accompanied by adequate disclosure) in a manner such that if more than seventy-five percent (75%) of the shareholders of the Company approve the Parachute Payments that are the subject of the vote, and all Parachute Payments are paid, none of the Parachute Payments will be non-deductible under Code Section 280G or subject to an excise tax under Code Section 4999\. Buyer shall bear any costs incurred (including any reasonable attorneys fees) in connection with obtaining such waivers and effecting the shareholder vote. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the failure of the Company to obtain such waivers or to effect such shareholder vote shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement or the failure of a closing condition under this Agreement to be satisfied. 

   

 (k) Unless required by Applicable Law or except as set forth below, no amended Tax Return with respect to a Pre-Closing Period or Straddle Period shall be filed by or 

    ##### 

  

    

on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries without consent of the
Shareholders Agent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned. 

   

 (l) The amount of any refunds of Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Period shall be for the account of the Shareholders. The amount of any refund of Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries for any Straddle Period shall be for the account of the Shareholders to the extent they are apportioned to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date in accordance with the principles set forth in _Section 5.21(h)_. Buyer agrees to file and prosecute or cause the Company to file and prosecute any available claims for refund for Taxes with respect to any Pre-Closing Period and/or Straddle Period as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in no case later than 30 days in the case of any claims for refund of which the Shareholders Agent notifies Buyer in writing) and provide prompt notice to Shareholders Agent of any opportunities to obtain such refunds and of any actions taken by Buyer or any Governmental Entity with respect to such claims for refund. Buyer shall consult with Shareholders Agent concerning any actions taken with respect to such claim for refund. The Buyer shall or shall cause the Company to pay to the Shareholders Agent the amount of any Tax refund allocated to the Shareholders hereunder within thirty (30) days after such refund is received, net of any Taxes and reasonable costs or expenses incurred by such the Company or its Affiliates in procuring such refund. The obligations to make payments under this _Section 5.21(l)_ shall be reduced to the extent the refund was included as an asset (or offset to a liability) in the computation of the Net Working Capital, as finally determined. 

   

 (m) Assuming the representations and warranties set forth in _Section 3.7_ are true and correct, if Buyer takes any action that would cause any deductions of the Company claimed in a Pre-Closing Period to be disallowed under Code Section 280G, the Income Tax Amount, the Estimated Income Tax Amount and the Final Income Tax Amount shall be computed assuming that such deductions are not subject to Code Section 280G. 

   

 5.22 _Real Estate Matters_. 

  

 (a) The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that no later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing, Buyer shall have obtained the following:

 (b) Buyer shall pay the costs and expenses of the Title Commitments, Title Policies, Surveys and Zoning Reports, whether or not the transactions contemplated under this Agreement are consummated; and Buyer shall pay any and all title search, escrow and closing fees charged by the Title Company in connection with the Closing.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the failure by the Company to obtain a Landlord Estoppel Letter with respect to any or all of the Leased Real Property shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement or the failure of a closing condition under this Agreement to be satisfied. 

   

 5.23 _Pre-Closing Project_. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall continue to develop and implement the Pre-Closing Project in the ordinary course of business. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall be solely responsible for the Pre-Closing Project, including the establishment of milestones and performance goals for completion thereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that (a) the Company shall keep Buyer reasonably informed of the status of the Pre-Closing Project and make information (including the amount and nature of capital expenditures incurred by the Company) regarding the Pre-Closing Project reasonably available to Buyer, (b) the Company shall reasonably consult with Buyer as to the development, timing and implementation of the Pre-Closing Project, (c) the Company shall not incur Project Completion Costs in excess of $1,000,000 without prior consultation with Buyer, and (d) the Company and Buyer otherwise shall reasonably cooperate with each other in furtherance of the Pre-Closing Project.

In addition, the Company may, in response to a Permitted Default, seek an amendment to, or a consent, forbearance or waiver under, either or both of the First Lien Credit Agreement or the Second Lien Credit Agreement (including the payment of any fee, default interest or other amounts in connection therewith, if such payments are made on or prior to the Closing so as to result in an adjustment to the Purchase Price under this Agreement), and notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, no breach of any representation, warranty or covenant by the Company and no closing condition under this Agreement shall fail to be satisfied or termination right by Buyer under this Agreement shall arise or result from, or otherwise be created by, the taking of any such action or payment by the Company.

ARTICLE VIII 

   

INDEMNIFICATION  

  

 8.1 _The Shareholders  Indemnification Obligations_. Subject to the provisions of this  _Article VIII_, after the Closing, the Shareholders, severally and not jointly and in accordance with their respective interests in the Escrow Fund pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement, agree to defend, reimburse, indemnify, and hold harmless the Buyer Indemnified Parties against and in respect of all Adverse Consequences that may be incurred by or imposed on any Buyer Indemnified Party that result from, relate to, or arise out of: 

  

 (a) any breach of a representation or warranty made by the Company or the Shareholders in this Agreement; 

   

 (b) any breach by the Company, the Shareholders or the Shareholders Agent of any of its covenants or agreements in this Agreement or any other Transaction Document; 

   

 (c) any Tax for any Pre-Closing Period or portion of any Straddle Period ending on or before the Closing Date that (i) in the case of a non-Income Tax, was not accrued as a current liability in the computation of the Net Working Capital as finally determined, and (ii) in the case of an Income Tax, was not included in the computation of the Final Income Tax Amount; and 

   

 (d) any Excess Dissenters Costs. 

   

 8.2 _Buyer s Indemnification Obligations_. Subject to the provisions of this _ Article VIII_, after the Closing, Buyer agrees to defend, reimburse, indemnify, and hold harmless the Shareholder Indemnified Parties against and in respect of any Adverse Consequences that may be incurred or suffered by or imposed on any Shareholder Indemnified Party that result from, or relate to, or arise out of: 

  

 (a) any breach of a representation or warranty made by Buyer in this Agreement; and 

   

 (b) any breach by Buyer of any of its covenants or agreements in this Agreement or any other Transaction Document. 

   

 8.3 _Indemnification Procedure_. 

  

 (a) If, subsequent to the Closing, any Person entitled to indemnification under this Agreement (an " _Indemnified Party_ ") asserts a claim for indemnification for or receives notice of the assertion or commencement of any Third Party Claim as to which such Indemnified Party intends to seek indemnification under this Agreement, such Indemnified Party shall give reasonably prompt written notice of such claim to the Party from whom indemnification is to be sought (an " _Indemnifying Party_ "), together with a statement of any available information 

    ##### 

  

    

regarding such claim. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, upon
written notice to the Indemnified Party (the " _Defense Notice_ ") within 15
days after receipt from the Indemnified Party of notice of such claim, by
which notice the Indemnifying Party shall specify the counsel it will appoint
to defend such claim (" _Defense Counsel_ "), to conduct at its expense
the defense against such Third Party Claim in its own name, or if necessary
in the name of the Indemnified Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to approve the Defense Counsel, which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The Parties agree to
cooperate fully with each other in connection with the defense,
negotiation or settlement of any Third Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party
delivers a Defense Notice to the Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party
will cooperate with and make available to the Indemnifying Party such
assistance and materials as may be reasonably requested by the Indemnifying
Party, all at the expense of the Indemnifying Party. 

   

 (b) If the Indemnifying Party shall fail to give a Defense Notice, it shall be deemed to have elected not to conduct the defense of the subject Third Party Claim, and in such event the Indemnified Party shall have the right to conduct such defense in good faith. If the Indemnified Party defends any Third Party Claim, then the Indemnifying Party shall reimburse the Indemnified Party for the costs and expenses of defending such Third Party Claim upon submission of periodic bills. If the Indemnifying Party elects to conduct the defense of the subject Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party may participate, at his or its own expense, in the defense of such Third Party Claim; provided, however, that such Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in any such defense with separate counsel at the expense of the Indemnifying Party (i) if so requested by the Indemnifying Party to participate or (ii) in the reasonable opinion of counsel to the Indemnified Party, a conflict or potential conflict exists between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party that would make such separate representation advisable; and _provided_ ,  _further_ , that the Indemnifying Party shall not be required to pay for more than one counsel for all Indemnified Parties in connection with any Third Party Claim. 

   

 (c) Regardless of which Party defends a Third Party Claim, the other Party shall have the right at its expense to participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim, assisted by counsel of its own choosing. The Indemnified Party shall not compromise, settle, default on, or admit liability with respect to a Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The Indemnifying Party shall not compromise or settle a Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. 

   

 (d) Subject to the other terms of this _Article VIII_ and the terms of the Escrow Agreement, once all disputes concerning the Indemnifying Partys indemnification obligations as to a particular claim or amount has been resolved by a final decision, judgment or award rendered by a Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction and the expiration of the time in which to appeal therefrom, or the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall have arrived at a mutually binding agreement with respect to an indemnification claim hereunder, the Indemnifying Party shall be required to pay all indemnification amounts so due and owing to the Indemnified Party by wire transfer of immediately available funds within ten (10) Business Days after the date of such notice (which, in the case of the Shareholders being the Indemnifying 

    ##### 

  

    

Party, such amounts being paid solely from and limited by the amounts then
being held in the Escrow Fund). 

   

 (e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this _Section 8.3_, if any Governmental Entity commences a Third Party Claim that relates to the Taxes for which the Shareholders are obligated to indemnify Buyer for under this Agreement (1) Buyer shall notify the Shareholders Agent within thirty (30) days of receipt of any written communication from the Governmental Entity regarding the Third Party Claim and (2) the Company or the applicable Subsidiary shall control the contest of the Third Party Claim, provided that (i) the Shareholders Agent shall, at the sole cost and expense of the Shareholders, have the right to participate in the contest of any Third Party Claim relating to the Tax for which the Shareholders are obligated to indemnify for under this Agreement and (ii) Buyer shall not allow the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to settle, resolve, or otherwise dispose of a Third Party Claim relating to the Tax for which the Shareholders would have an obligation to pay or indemnify for under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the Shareholders Agent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed, or conditioned). 

   

 8.4 _Direct Claims_. It is the intent of the Parties that all direct claims by an Indemnified Party against a Party not arising out of Third Party Claims shall be subject to and benefit from the terms of this _Article VIII_. Any claim under this _Article VIII_ by an Indemnified Party for indemnification other than indemnification against a Third Party Claim (a " _Direct Claim_ ") will be asserted by giving the Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt written notice thereof, and the Indemnifying Party will have a period of 20 days within which to satisfy such Direct Claim. If the Indemnifying Party does not so respond within such 20-day period, the Indemnifying Party will be deemed to have rejected such claim, in which event the Indemnified Party will be free to pursue such remedies as may be available to the Indemnified Party under this  _Article VIII_. 

  

 8.5 _Failure to Give Timely Notice_. A failure by an Indemnified Party to give timely, complete, or accurate notice as provided in _Section 8.3_ or _8.4_ shall not affect the rights or obligations of any Party hereunder except to the extent that, as a result of such failure, any Party entitled to receive such notice was deprived of its right to recover any payment under its applicable insurance coverage or was otherwise materially adversely affected or damaged as a result of such failure to give timely, complete, and accurate notice. 

  

 8.6 _Reduction of Adverse Consequences_. 

  

 (a) Any Adverse Consequences of an Indemnified Party shall be reduced by receipt of applicable payment under insurance policies or from third parties (net of the expenses of the recovery thereof) not affiliated with the Indemnified Party. If indemnification payments shall have been received prior to the collection of such proceeds, the Indemnified Party shall remit to the Indemnifying Party the amount of such proceeds (net of the cost of collection thereof) to the extent of indemnification payments received in respect of such Adverse Consequences. The Parties shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to collect the proceeds of any insurance that would have the effect of reducing any Adverse Consequences. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (b) Any Adverse Consequences of an Indemnified Party shall be reduced by any Tax benefit that the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates actually realizes as a result of the event giving rise to indemnification. If indemnification payments shall have been received prior to the realization of such Tax benefit, the Indemnified Party shall remit to the Indemnifying Party, within thirty (30) days of the filing of the Tax Return on which such Tax benefit is actually realized, the amount of such Tax benefit. The Parties shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to realize any Tax benefit that would have the effect of reducing any Adverse Consequences. For purposes of this _Section 8.6(b)_, a Tax benefit shall equal the actual reduction in Income Taxes payable by the Indemnified Party and its Affiliates on their Tax Returns for the Tax year of the event giving rise to indemnification and shall be computed by comparing the Income Taxes the Indemnified Party and its Affiliates paid for such Tax year with the amount of Income Taxes the Indemnified Party and its Affiliates would have paid for the same Tax year if the event giving rise to indemnification had not occurred. 

   

 8.7 _Limitations on Indemnities_.

 (e) The Shareholders shall not have any liability pursuant to _Section 8.1_ in respect of any item or any Adverse Consequences that have been reflected as a deduction in determining the Purchase Price hereunder or as otherwise reflected as a reserve in Net Working Capital as finally determined pursuant to _Section 1.8_ or any reserve for post-retirement obligations reflected in the Latest Balance Sheet.

   ##### 

  

  

 9.15 _Rules of Construction_. 

  

 (a) Any rule of law or any legal decision that would require interpretation of any ambiguities in this Agreement against any Party that drafted it is of no application and is hereby expressly waived. 

   

 (b) The inclusion of any information in the Company Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed an admission or acknowledgment, in and of itself and solely by virtue of the inclusion of such information in the Company Disclosure Schedule, that such information is required to be listed in the Company Disclosure Schedule or that such items are material to the Company. The headings, if any, of the individual sections of each of the Company Disclosure Schedules are inserted for convenience only and shall not be deemed to constitute a part thereof or a part of this Agreement. The Company Disclosure Schedule is arranged in sections corresponding to those contained in  _Article III_ merely for convenience, and the disclosure of an item in one section of the Company Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a particular representation or warranty shall be deemed adequately disclosed as an exception with respect to all other representations or warranties to the extent that the relevance of such item to such representations or warranties is reasonably apparent on the face of such item, notwithstanding the presence or absence of an appropriate section of the Company Disclosure Schedule with respect to such other representations or warranties or the presence or absence of a reference thereto in either the Company Disclosure Schedule or in the particular representation or warranty. 

   

 (c) The specification of any dollar amount in the representations and warranties or otherwise in this Agreement or in the Company Disclosure Schedule is not intended and shall not be deemed to be an admission or acknowledgment of the materiality of such amounts or items, nor shall the same be used in any dispute or controversy between the Parties to determine whether any obligation, item or matter (whether or not described herein or included in any schedule) is or is not material for purposes of this Agreement (other than with respect to any representation, warranty or provision of this Agreement in which such specification occurs). 

   

 (d) The inclusion of any information in the Buyers Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed an admission or acknowledgment, in and of itself and solely by virtue of the inclusion of such information in the Buyers Disclosure Schedule, that such information is required to be listed in the Buyers Disclosure Schedule or that such items are material to Buyer. The headings, if any, of the individual sections of each of the Buyers Disclosure Schedules are inserted for convenience only and shall not be deemed to constitute a part thereof or a part of this Agreement. The Buyers Disclosure Schedule is arranged in sections corresponding to those contained in _Article IV_ merely for convenience, and the disclosure of an item in one section of the Buyers Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a particular representation or warranty shall be deemed adequately disclosed as an exception with respect to all other representations or warranties contained in  _Article IV_ to the extent that the relevance of such item to such representations or warranties is reasonably apparent on the face of such item, notwithstanding the presence or absence of an appropriate section of the Buyers Disclosure Schedule with respect to such other representations or warranties or a reference thereto in either the Buyers Disclosure Schedule or in the particular representation or warranty in _Article IV_. 

    ##### 

  

     

 9.16 _Power of Attorney by Shareholders and Release_.

The appointment of the Shareholders Agent is coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable by any Shareholder in any manner or for any reason. This power of attorney shall not be affected by the death, illness, dissolution, disability, incapacity or other inability to act of the principal pursuant to any Applicable Law. This power of attorney shall automatically terminate as of the Closing. 

   

 (b) Effective as of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, each Shareholder releases and forever discharges the Company, Buyer and each of their respective Affiliates, and their respective past and present officers and directors (collectively, the " _Releasees_ ") from any and all claims, demands, actions, arbitrations, audits, hearings, investigations, litigations, suits (whether civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or informal), causes of action, orders, obligations, contracts, agreements, debts and liabilities whatsoever, whether known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, contingent or otherwise, both at law and in equity, of any kind, character or nature whatsoever (" _Claims_ ") which such Shareholder now has or has ever had against the Releasees relating to such Shareholders ownership of Common Stock, _provided_ _that_ the foregoing release and discharge shall not (i) relieve any Releasee of his, her or its obligations or liabilities to the Shareholder pursuant to this Agreement, (ii) relieve the Company of any indemnification obligations of the Company to such Shareholder pursuant to this Agreement, the Companys certificate of incorporation or bylaws or any written agreement between the Company and such Shareholder, or (iii) be deemed to constitute a waiver of the availability of insurance to cover Claims. Each Shareholder understands and agrees that he, she or it is expressly waiving all Claims against the Releasees covered by this release and discharge, including those Claims that he, she or it may not know of or suspect to exist, which if known, may have materially affected the decision to provide this release and discharge. 

   

 (c) Effective as of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, the Company releases and forever discharges each Shareholder from any and all Claims which the Company now has or has ever had against such Shareholder relating to such Shareholders ownership of Common Stock; _provided_ _that_ the foregoing release and discharge shall not relieve such Shareholder of his, her or its obligations or liabilities to the Company pursuant to this Agreement. The Company understands and agrees that it is expressly waiving all Claims against each Shareholder covered by this release and discharge, including those Claims that it may not know of or suspect to exist, which if known, may have materially affected the decision to provide this release and discharge.

 (b) In the event that the Shareholders Agent, with the advice of counsel, is of the opinion that it requires further authorization or advice from the Shareholders on any matters concerning this Agreement, the Shareholders Agent shall be entitled to seek such further authorization from the Shareholders prior to acting on their behalf. In such event, each Shareholder (including the Shareholders Agent in its capacity as a Shareholder) shall have a number of votes equal to such Shareholders Percentage Share and the authorization of a majority of such number of votes shall be binding on all of the Shareholders and shall constitute the authorization of the Shareholders. 

   

 (c) Buyer shall be fully protected in dealing with the Shareholders Agent under this Agreement and may rely upon the authority of the Shareholders Agent to act as the agent of the Shareholders. 

   

 (d) The Shareholders Agent may resign from its capacity as Shareholders Agent at any time by written notice delivered to Buyer and the Shareholders. If there is a vacancy at any time in the position of Shareholders Agent for any reason, such vacancy shall be filled by a Shareholder vote pursuant to _Section 9.17(b)_. 

   

 (e) The Shareholders Agent hereby accepts such appointment and designation. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (f) The Shareholders Agent shall not be liable to Buyer, the Company or the Shareholders in its capacity as Shareholders Agent for any error of judgment, or any act done or step taken or omitted by it in good faith or for any mistake in fact or law, or for anything which it may do or refrain from doing in connection with this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents, except for its own willful misconduct. In no event shall the Shareholders Agent, in the capacity as Shareholders Agent, be liable to Buyer for any breach of this Agreement by the Company or any Shareholder. The Shareholders Agent may seek the advice of legal counsel in the event of any dispute or question as to the construction of any of the provisions of this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents or its duties hereunder or thereunder, and it shall incur no liability in its capacity as Shareholders Agent to Buyer, the Company or the Shareholders and shall be fully protected with respect to any action taken, omitted or suffered by it in good faith in accordance with the opinion of such counsel. 

   

 (g) Any expenses incurred by the Shareholders Agent in connection with the performance of its duties under this Agreement shall not be the personal obligation of the Shareholders Agent but shall be payable at the Shareholders Agents election: (i) as a Transaction Cost if incurred and ascertainable prior to the Closing, (ii) out of distributions to the Shareholders pursuant to this Agreement or (iii) by the Shareholders based on each Shareholders Percentage Share (as such existed immediately prior to the Closing) of such expenses. The Shareholders Agent may from time to time submit invoices to the Shareholders covering such expenses and, upon the request of any Shareholder, shall provide such Shareholder with an accounting of all expenses paid. 

   

 (h) Each Shareholder, severally, shall indemnify the Shareholders Agent up to, but not exceeding, an amount equal to the aggregate portion of the amounts received by such Person under  _Article I_ of this Agreement, which indemnification shall be paid by such Shareholder pro rata in accordance with the portion of the aggregate amounts received by such Person under  _Article I_ of this Agreement, against all damages, liabilities, claims, obligations, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys, accountants and other experts fees and the amount of any judgment against it, of any nature whatsoever, arising out of or in connection with any claim, investigation, challenge, action or proceeding or in connection with any appeal thereof; relating to the acts or omissions of the Shareholders Agent hereunder, under this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents or otherwise, except for such damages, liabilities, claims, obligations, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys, accountants and other experts fees and the amount of any judgment against the Shareholders Agent that arise from the Shareholders Agents willful misconduct. The foregoing indemnification shall not be deemed exclusive of any other right to which the Shareholders Agent may be entitled apart from the provisions hereof. In the event of any indemnification under this _Section 9.17(h)_, each Shareholder shall promptly deliver to the Shareholders Agent full payment of his, her or its ratable share of such indemnification claim. 

   

 (i) All of the indemnities, immunities and powers granted to the Shareholders Agent under this Agreement shall survive the Closing and/or any termination of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. 

   

 9.18 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, the Shareholders, the Company and Buyer shall each pay all of their own fees, costs and expenses (including (i) fees, 

   ##### 

  

 

costs and expenses of legal counsel, investment bankers, advisors,
accountants, brokers or other representatives and consultants, (ii) appraisal
fees, costs and expenses and (iii) transfer Taxes) incurred by such Person in
connection with the preparation, negotiation, execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, the performance of their
respective obligations hereunder and thereunder, and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. In addition, the Parties
acknowledge that the Transaction Costs may include, and the Company shall
bear and pay at Closing, certain fees and expenses of the Shareholders or
the Shareholders Agent. 

   

 9.19 _Enforcement_.
