C. Pursuant to the Merger, among other things, the issued and outstanding

D. Parent, Holdco, Sub and Acquiror desire to make certain representations,
warranties, covenants and other agreements in connection with the Merger as
set forth herein. 

  

E. As promptly as practicable following the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, Parent shall duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting
of Parent Shareholders to secure the necessary approval of this Agreement and
the principal terms of the Merger from the Parent Shareholders in accordance
with (i) the provisions of Parents organizational and other
governance documents, (ii) the OGCL and (iii) any other applicable Legal
Requirements. Any corresponding approval of the Holdco Shareholders shall

conditions set forth in this Agreement, and without any action on the part of

(i) _Holdco Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, each share of Holdco Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other
than Dissenting Shares and shares owned by Holdco) shall be automatically
converted into the right to receive, subject to and in accordance with
_Section 1.10(a)_, an amount of cash (without interest) equal to the

receive for the shares of Holdco Common Stock held by such Holdco Shareholder
shall be rounded to the nearest cent. 

  

(ii) _Holdco Options_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Holdco Board shall
have adopted appropriate resolutions and taken all other actions necessary
and appropriate to provide that each unexpired and unexercised vested Holdco
Option shall be cancelled effective as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time, and, in exchange therefor, each former holder of any such cancelled
Holdco Option that has vested as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be entitled to receive from the Disbursement Agent, in consideration of
the cancellation of such vested Holdco Option and in settlement therefor, an
amount in cash (without interest and subject to any applicable withholding or

otherwise paid by Holdco, including any fringe benefit tax) equal to the
product of (A) the total number of shares of Holdco Common Stock previously
subject to the vested portion of such Holdco Option, and (B) the excess, if
any, of the Per Share Amount over the exercise price per share of Holdco
Common Stock previously subject to the vested portion of such Holdco

    ##### 

  

  

(iii) _Total Merger Consideration_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, in no event shall the aggregate consideration
paid by Acquiror to the Holdco Equity Holders exceed the Net Total Merger
Consideration. 

  

(iv) _Capital Stock of Sub_. Each share of capital stock of Sub that is
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by
virtue of the Merger and without further action on the part of the sole
shareholder of Sub, be converted into and become 100 shares of common stock
of the Surviving Corporation, and the shares of Surviving Corporation into
which the shares of Sub capital stock are so converted shall be the only
shares of the Surviving Corporations capital stock that are issued and
outstanding immediately after the Effective Time. Each certificate evidencing
ownership of shares of Sub common stock shall evidence ownership of such
shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

(b) _Treatment of Holdco Common Stock Owned by Holdco_. At the Effective
Time, all shares of Holdco Common Stock that are owned by Holdco as treasury
stock immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and
extinguished without any conversion thereof. 

  

(c) _Dissenters  Rights_. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the
contrary, any Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into the right to
receive the cash amount provided for in _Section 1.9(a)_, but shall instead
be converted into the right to receive such consideration as may be
determined to be due with respect to any such Dissenting Shares pursuant
to the OGCL. Each holder of Dissenting Shares who, pursuant to the provisions
of the OGCL, becomes entitled to payment thereunder for such shares shall
receive payment therefor from the Disbursement Agent in an amount that does
not exceed the amount that otherwise would have been paid under  _Section
1.9_ if such shares were not Dissenting Shares and in accordance with the OGCL
(but only after the value therefor shall have been agreed upon or finally
determined pursuant to such provisions). If, after the Effective Time, any
Dissenting Shares shall lose their status as Dissenting Shares, then any such
shares shall immediately be converted into the right to receive the cash
payable pursuant to _Section 1.9(a)_ in respect of such shares as if such
shares never had been Dissenting Shares, and the Disbursement Agent shall
issue and deliver to the holder thereof, at (or as promptly as reasonably
practicable after) the applicable time or times specified in _Section
1.10(c)_, following the satisfaction of the applicable conditions set forth
in  _Section 1.10(c)_, the amount of cash to which such holder would be
entitled in respect thereof under this _Section 1.9_ as if such shares never
had been Dissenting Shares. Holdco shall give Acquiror prompt notice of any
demands for appraisal or purchase received by Holdco, withdrawals of such
demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to the OGCL and received
by Holdco. Holdco shall not, except with the prior written consent of
Acquiror, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, or as otherwise
required under the OGCL, voluntarily make any payment or offer to make any
payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any claim or demand
in respect of any Dissenting Shares. The payout of consideration under this
Agreement to the Holdco Shareholders (other than to holders of Dissenting
Shares who shall be treated as provided in this  _Section 1.9(c) _ and under
the OGCL) shall not be affected by the exercise or potential exercise of
appraisal rights under the OGCL by any other Holdco Shareholder. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(d) _Rights Not Transferable_. The rights of the Holdco Equity Holders at the
Effective Time are personal to each such security holder and shall not be
transferable for any reason otherwise than by operation of law, will or the
laws of descent and distribution or with the prior written consent of
Acquiror. Any attempted transfer of such right by any holder thereof
(otherwise than as permitted by the immediately preceding sentence) shall be
null and void.

Payments_. 

  

(a) _Funding of Escrow_. At the Closing, Acquiror shall transfer directly to
the Escrow Agent in immediately available funds the Escrow Cash. The Escrow

Equity Holders pursuant to _Article VIII_, and shall be held in and
distributed in accordance with the provisions of the Escrow Agreement.

Agreement. 

   

(c) _Exchange Procedures for Share Certificates and Holdco Options_. 

  

(i) At or prior to the Effective Time, Holdco shall mail or cause to be mailed
to every Holdco Shareholder that has not previously delivered its
Certificates together with a properly completed and duly executed letter of
transmittal in the form supplied by the Disbursement Agent (the " _Letter of
Transmittal_ "), to each Holdco Shareholder who is a holder of shares of the
Holdco Common Stock as reflected in the stock records of Holdco but to whom
Certificates have not been issued by Holdco, and to each Holdco Optionholder

Letter of Transmittal in effecting the surrender of certificates or
instruments, if any, which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented issued and outstanding Holdco Common Stock or outstanding Holdco

(the " _Certificates_ ") in exchange for such cash. The Letter of Transmittal
shall specify that delivery of Certificates shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to Certificates shall pass, only upon receipt thereof by the
Disbursement Agent, together with a properly completed and duly
executed Letter of Transmittal, duly executed on behalf of each Person

Disbursement Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly completed and
duly executed Letter of Transmittal and any other documentation required by
the Letter of Transmittal, (A) the holder of record of such Certificate shall

or wire transfer, to an account designated by such holder pursuant to
the Letter of Transmittal, representing the cash amount that such holder has
the right to receive pursuant to _Section 1.9(a)_ in respect of such
Certificate, less such Holdco Equity Holders Pro Rata Share of the Escrow
Cash in respect of such Certificate, and (B) such Certificate shall
be canceled. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(d) _No Interest; U.S. Funds_. No interest shall accumulate on any cash
payable in connection with the Merger (other than pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement and the Disbursement Agreement). All amounts paid by Acquiror
hereunder shall be made in U.S. Dollars. 

  

(e) _Transfers of Ownership_. If any cash amount payable pursuant to
_Section 1.9(a)_ is to be paid to a Person other than the Person to which the
Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a
condition of the payment thereof that the Certificate so surrendered shall be
properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the
Person requesting such exchange shall have paid to the Disbursement Agent or
any agent designated by it any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of
the payment of cash in any name other than that of the registered holder of
the Certificate surrendered, or established to the satisfaction of Acquiror
or any agent designated by it that such Tax has been paid or is
not payable. 

  

(f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
_Section 1.10_ , none of Acquiror, the Surviving Corporation or any party
hereto shall be liable to any Person for any amount properly paid to a public
official pursuant to any applicable unclaimed funds, abandoned property,
escheat or similar law.

held by the Disbursement Agent that remain undistributed to the Holdco

1.10_ shall, after such delivery of funds to the Surviving Corporation, look

1.11 _No Further Ownership Rights in the Holdco Common Stock or Holdco
Options_. All cash paid or payable following the surrender for exchange of
all shares of Holdco Common Stock and Holdco Options in accordance with the
terms hereof shall be so paid or payable in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to all shares of Holdco Common Stock and Holdco Options including
any rights to declared but unpaid dividends, and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of
shares of Holdco Common Stock which were issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, a Certificate is
presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, such Certificate shall
be canceled and exchanged as provided in this _Article I_. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

1.12 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Disbursement Agent shall issue

the Edgetech Entities in the Edgetech Employee Plans (as defined below) as of
the Closing Date, Holdco and Parent make the following representations: 

  

(a) _Schedule 2.20_ to the Disclosure Letter lists, with respect to the
Edgetech Entities and any trade or business (whether or not incorporated)
which is treated as a single employer with the Edgetech Entities (an " _ERISA
Affiliate_ ") within the meaning of Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the
Code, (i) all "employee benefit plans" within the meaning of Section 3(3)

collectively, the " _Edgetech Employee Plans_ "). 

  

(b) Parent and Holdco have provided or made available to Acquirors counsel a
true, correct and complete copy of each of the Edgetech Employee Plans and
related plan documents (including trust documents, insurance policies or

most recent financial statements, the most recent actuarial reports, if any,
and the most recent determination letter received from the Internal Revenue
Service with respect to each Edgetech Employee Plan intended to qualify under
Section 401(a) of the Code) and has, with respect to each Edgetech Employee
Plan which is subject to ERISA reporting requirements, provided to
Acquirors counsel true, correct and complete copies of the most recent Form
5500 reports filed. Each Edgetech Employee Plan that is intended to qualify
under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a determination letter from the
Internal Revenue Service and no condition exists that could be reasonably
expected to cause the loss of a Tax-qualified status of any Edgetech Employee
Plan subject to Section 401(a) of the Code. Parent and Holdco have also
provided or made available to Acquiror all registration statements
and prospectuses prepared in connection with each Edgetech Employee Plan.
Except as provided on  _Schedule 2.20_ to the Disclosure Letter, the
Edgetech Entities neither sponsor nor maintain any self-funded employee
benefit plan. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(c) None of the Edgetech Employee Plans promises or provides retiree medical
or other retiree welfare benefits to any person other than as required under
the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended ("
_COBRA_ ") or similar state law. There has been no material "prohibited
transaction" (within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of
the Code and not exempt under Section 408 of ERISA and regulatory guidance
thereunder) with respect to any Edgetech Employee Plan. Each Edgetech
Employee Plan has been administered in all material respects in accordance
with its terms and in compliance with the requirements prescribed by any and
all statutes, rules and regulations (including ERISA and the Code). Each of
the Edgetech Entities and each ERISA Affiliate has performed all material
obligations required to be performed by it under, is not in material default
under or in violation of, and has no knowledge of any material default or
violation by any other party to, any of the Edgetech Employee Plans. Neither
the Edgetech Entities nor any ERISA Affiliate is subject to any Liability or
penalty under the Code or Title I of ERISA with respect to any of the
Edgetech Employee Plans and no fact or event exists that could reasonably be
expected to give rise to any such liability. No Edgetech Employee Plan is
covered by, and neither the Edgetech Entities nor any ERISA Affiliate has
incurred or expects to incur any Liability under Title IV of ERISA or Section
412 of the Code. Each Edgetech Employee Plan can be amended, terminated or
otherwise discontinued after the Effective Time in accordance with its
terms and applicable Legal Requirements, without Liability to Acquiror, the
Surviving Corporation (other than ordinary administrative expenses typically
incurred in a termination event). Except as provided on _Schedule 2.20_ to
the Disclosure Letter, with respect to each Edgetech Employee Plan subject to
ERISA as either an employee pension benefit plan within the meaning of Section
3(2) of ERISA or an employee welfare benefit plan within the meaning of
Section 3(1) of ERISA, the Edgetech Entities have prepared in good faith and
timely filed all requisite governmental reports (which were true, correct and
complete as of the date filed), including any required audit reports, and has
properly and timely filed and distributed or posted all notices and reports to
employees required to be filed, distributed or posted with respect to each
such Edgetech Employee Plan. No suit, administrative proceeding, action or
other litigation is pending, or to the knowledge of Parent or Holdco, is
threatened, against or with respect to any such Edgetech Employee
Plan, including any audit or inquiry by the Internal Revenue Service or
United States Department of Labor. 

  

(d) With respect to each Edgetech Employee Plan, the Edgetech Entities have
complied in all material respects with (i) the applicable health care
continuation and notice provisions of COBRA and the regulations (including
proposed regulations) thereunder, (ii) the applicable requirements of the

regulations) thereunder, (iii) the applicable requirements of the Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and the regulations

the Edgetech Employee Plans reflect the financial condition and funding of
the Edgetech Employee Plans as of the dates of such financial statements and
actuarial reports and no adverse change has occurred with respect to the
financial condition, cost, expense or funding of the Edgetech Employee Plans
since the dates of such financial statements and actuarial reports. 

  

(f) Neither the Edgetech Entities nor any current or former ERISA Affiliate
currently maintains, sponsors, participates in, has liability under, or
contributes to, or has ever maintained, established, sponsored, participated
in, had liability under, or contributed to, any pension plan (within the
meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA) which is subject to Part 3 of Subtitle B of
Title I of ERISA, Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code. 

  

(g) Except as provided on _Schedule 2.20_ to the Disclosure Letter, neither
the Edgetech Entities nor any ERISA Affiliate is a party to, or has made any
contribution to or otherwise incurred any obligation under, any
"multiemployer plan" as such term is defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA or any
"multiple employer plan" as such term is defined in Section 413(c) of the
Code. None of the Edgetech Entities or any ERISA Affiliate has withdrawn from
any multiemployer plan. No event has occurred or circumstance exists that
presents a material risk of the occurrence of any withdrawal from, or the
termination, reorganization, or insolvency of, any multiemployer plan
that could result in any liability of the Edgetech Entities or any ERISA
Affiliate with respect to a multiemployer plan. No multiemployer plan with
respect to the Edgetech Entities or any ERISA Affiliate is the subject of any
proceeding brought by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation and none of
the Edgetech Entities or any ERISA Affiliate has received any current notice
from any multiemployer plan that (A) such multiemployer plan is in endangered
status or critical status, as defined in Section 432 of the Code, (B)
increased contributions may be required to avoid a reduction in plan benefits
or the imposition of an excise tax or (C) such multiemployer plan intends to
terminate or has terminated. 

  

(h) Each Edgetech Employee Plan maintained or contributed to by the Edgetech
Entities under the law or applicable custom or rule of the relevant
jurisdiction outside of the United States (each such Edgetech Employee Plan,
a " _Foreign Plan_ ") is listed in _Schedule 2.20_ to the Disclosure Letter.
As regards each Foreign Plan, (i) such Foreign Plan is in compliance with
the provisions of the Legal Requirements of each jurisdiction in which such
Foreign Plan is maintained, to the extent those Legal Requirements are
applicable to such Foreign Plan, (ii) the Edgetech Entities are in compliance
with the provisions of the Legal Requirements of each jurisdiction in which
they maintain a Foreign Plan, to the extent these Legal Requirements impose an
obligation on the Edgetech Entities in relation to a Foreign Plan, (iii) all
contributions to, and material payments from, such Foreign Plan which may
have been required to be made in accordance with the terms of such Foreign
Plan, and, when applicable, the Legal Requirements of the 

 

    ##### 

  

   

jurisdiction in which such Foreign Plan is maintained, have been timely made
or shall be made by the Closing Date, and all such contributions to such
Foreign Plan, and all payments under such Foreign Plan, for any period ending
before the Closing Date that are not yet, but will be, required to be made,
are reflected as an accrued liability on the Balance Sheet, (iv) the Edgetech
Entities and each ERISA Affiliate have materially complied with all
applicable reporting and notice requirements, and such Foreign Plan has
obtained from the Governmental Entity having jurisdiction with respect to
such Foreign Plan any required determinations, if any, that such Foreign Plan
is in compliance with the Legal Requirements of the relevant jurisdiction if
such determinations are required in order to give effect to such
Foreign Plan, (v) such Foreign Plan has been administered in all respects at
all times in accordance with its terms and applicable Legal Requirements,
(vi) to the knowledge of Parent or Holdco, there are no pending
investigations by any governmental body involving such Foreign Plan, and no
pending claims (except for claims for benefits payable in the normal
operation of such Foreign Plan), suits or proceedings against such Foreign
Plan or asserting any rights or claims to benefits under such Foreign Plan,
(vii) the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will
not by themselves create or otherwise result in any Liability with respect to
such Foreign Plan, and (viii) except as required by applicable Legal
Requirements, no condition exists that would prevent the Edgetech Entities
from terminating or amending any Foreign Plan at any time for any reason
in accordance with the terms of each such Foreign Plan without the payment of
any fees, costs or expenses (other than the payment of benefits accrued on
the Balance Sheet and any normal and reasonable expenses typically incurred
in a termination event). The benefits available under all Foreign Plans in
the aggregate do not provide materially greater benefits to employees of
the Edgetech Entities participating in such plans than the benefits available
under the Edgetech Employee Plans for employees of the Edgetech Entities in
the United States. No Foreign Plan has unfunded Liabilities that will not be
offset by insurance or that are not fully accrued on the financial statements
of the Edgetech Entities. 

  

(i) No current or prior Edgetech UK Employee has ever participated in any
Parent or Holdco share incentive, share option or other equity incentive
scheme.

custom to provide any retirement, death, disability, accident or sickness
pension or payment to an employee or person claiming through them; or (iii) a
party to any proposal, whether agreed, announced or implied, to establish or
contribute to any other such scheme or arrangement or fund.

Acquiror and these are sufficient to allow the Acquiror to determine the
extent of the Edgetech Entities obligations and liabilities in respect of
them.

employment to any of the Edgetech Entities under the UK Transfer of

has any legal entitlement to benefits in excess of those to which he is
entitled to by virtue of his membership of the relevant Foreign Plan,
including, without limitation to the foregoing, a defined benefit on early
retirement or redundancy, or has retired early on terms which are less
favorable than early retirement terms which would have applied to him under
the pension arrangement of which he was a member prior to such transfer. 

  

(q) Except as provided for in _Schedule 2.20_ to the Disclosure Letter, there
are no circumstances which exist which would or might expose any of the

each employee of the Edgetech Entities who is not fully available to perform

each such employee, the basis of such disability or leave and the anticipated
date of return to full service. 

  

(s) Except as set forth in _Schedule 2.20_ to the Disclosure Letter, none of
the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the consummation of the Merger
or any other transaction contemplated hereby or any termination of employment
or service as a consequence thereof will, individually or together with the

becoming due to any Person, (ii) materially increase or otherwise enhance any

in employment, terms and conditions of employment, worker classification

authority; and are not liable for any arrears of wages, compensation, Taxes,
social security contributions, penalties or other sums for failure to comply
with any of the foregoing. The Edgetech Entities have paid in full to all

with respect to any former employees or qualifying beneficiaries thereunder.
Except as set forth in  _Schedule 2.20_ to the Disclosure Letter, there are

suit, proceeding, claim, arbitration or investigation before any Governmental
Entity. 

  

(u) _Schedule 2.20_ to the Disclosure Letter sets forth a true, correct and
complete list as of the Agreement Date of all severance Contracts and
employment Contracts to which the Edgetech Entities are a party or by which

officer, other than obligations (i) for which the Edgetech Entities have
established a reserve for such amount on the Balance Sheet, and (ii) pursuant

ever been a party to or bound by any collective bargaining agreement or other
labor union Contract, no collective bargaining agreement is being negotiated
by the Edgetech Entities and none of the Edgetech Entities has a duty to
bargain with any labor organization. There is no pending demand for
recognition or any other request or demand from a labor organization
for representative status with respect to any Person employed by the Edgetech
Entities. Neither Parent nor Holdco has any knowledge of any activities or
proceedings of any labor union or to organize its employees. There is no
labor dispute, strike or work stoppage against the Edgetech Entities pending
or, to the knowledge of Parent or Holdco, threatened which could reasonably be
expected to interfere with the business activities of the Edgetech Entities.

Entities, and there is no charge or complaint against the Edgetech Entities
by the National Labor Relations Board or any comparable Governmental Entity

violation of any term of any employment agreement, patent disclosure
agreement, non-competition agreement, or any restrictive covenant to a former
employer relating to the right of any such employee to be employed by the
Edgetech Entities because of the nature of the business conducted by the
Edgetech Entities or to the use of trade secrets or proprietary information
of others. No employee of the Edgetech Entities has given written notice to,
or received written notice from, any Edgetech Entity, nor does Parent or
Holdco otherwise have knowledge, that any such employee or Edgetech Entity
intends to terminate his or her employment with any Edgetech Entity. The
employment of each of the employees of the Edgetech Entities is "at will"
(except for non-U.S. employees of the Edgetech Entities located in a
jurisdiction that does not recognize the "at will" employment concept) and
the Edgetech Entities do not have any obligation to provide any particular
form or period of notice prior to terminating the employment of any of its
employees. As of the Agreement Date, the Edgetech Entities have not, and to
the knowledge of Parent or Holdco, no other Person has, other than offers of

letters; all forms of employment agreements and severance agreements; all
forms of services agreements and agreements with current and
former consultants and/or advisory board members; all forms of

subject thereto); the most current management organization chart(s); all
agreements and/or insurance policies providing for the indemnification of any
officers or directors of the Edgetech Entities; summary of Liability for
termination payments to current and former directors, officers and employees
of the Edgetech Entities; and a schedule of bonus commitments made to

(z) The Edgetech Entities are in compliance in all respects with the Worker
Adjustment Retraining Notification Act of 1988, as amended (" _WARN Act_ "),
or any similar state or local law. In the past two years, (i) the Edgetech
Entities have not effectuated a "plant closing" (as defined in the WARN Act)
affecting any site of employment or one or more facilities or operating units
within any site of employment or facility of its business; (ii) there has not
occurred a "mass layoff" (as defined in the WARN Act) affecting any site
of employment or facility of the Edgetech Entities; and (iii) the Edgetech
Entities have not been affected by any transaction or engaged in layoffs or
employment terminations sufficient in number to trigger application of any
similar state, local or foreign law or regulation. The Edgetech Entities have
not caused any of its employees to suffer an "employment loss" (as defined in
the WARN Act) during the 90 day period prior to the Agreement Date. 

  

(aa) Within a period of one year before the Agreement Date, (i) no Edgetech
Entity has given notice of any redundancies to the UK Department of Business
Innovation and Skills pursuant to s193 of the Trade Union and Labour
Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 (" _TULRCA 1992_ ") or
started consultations with any independent trade union or unions or other
employee representatives under Part XI ERA and no Edgetech Entity has failed
to comply with any obligation under such Part XI; and (ii) no Edgetech Entity
has been a party to any relevant transfer as defined in the Transfer
of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006 and no Edgetech
Entity has failed to comply with any duty to inform and consult any
independent trade union or other employee representatives under such
legislation. 

  

(bb) There is no agreement, plan, arrangement or other Contract covering any
current or former employee or other service provider of the Edgetech Entities
or ERISA Affiliate to which any Edgetech Entity is a party or by which any
Edgetech Entity is bound that, considered individually or considered
collectively with any other such agreements, plans, arrangements or other
Contracts, will, or could reasonably be expected to, as a result of the
transactions contemplated hereby (whether alone or upon the occurrence of any
additional or subsequent events), give rise directly or indirectly to the
payment of any amount that would be non-deductible under Section 162 of
the Code (or any corresponding or similar provision of state, local or
foreign Tax law) or characterized as a "parachute payment" within the meaning
of Section 280G of the Code (or any corresponding or similar provision of
state, local or foreign Tax law). _Schedule 2.20_ to the Disclosure Letter
lists each Person who is, with respect to the Edgetech Entities and/or
any ERISA Affiliate, a "disqualified individual" (within the meaning of
Section 280G of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder), as
determined as of the Agreement Date. 

  

(cc) _Schedule 2.20_ to the Disclosure Letter lists all "nonqualified
deferred compensation plans" (within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code)
to which any Edgetech Entity is a party. Each such nonqualified deferred
compensation plan to which any Edgetech Entity is a party complies with the
requirements of Section 409A(a) of the Code by its terms and has
been operated in accordance with such requirements. No event has occurred
that would be treated by Section 409A(b) of the Code as a transfer of
property for purposes of Section 83 of the Code. The exercise price of all
Holdco Options is at least equal to the fair market value of the
Holdco Common Stock on the date such Holdco Options were granted and (i) no
Edgetech Entity has incurred, and (ii) neither the Edgetech Entities nor
Acquiror will incur, any liability under Section 409A of the Code upon the
vesting of any Holdco Options. No payment pursuant to any Employee Plans
or other arrangement to any "service provider" (as such term is defined in
Section 409A of the Code and the United States Treasury Regulations and IRS
guidance thereunder), including the grant, vesting or exercise of any stock
option, would subject any Person to tax pursuant to Section 409A(a)(1) of the
Code, whether pursuant to the consummation of the Arrangement, any other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise.

terminating party, whether before or after the Holdco Shareholder Approval:

or Holdco shall have materially breached any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement contained herein and such breach shall not have been
cured within 10 Business Days after receipt by Parent and Holdco from
Acquiror of written notice of such breach ( _provided_ , _however_ , that no
such cure period shall be available or applicable to any such breach which by
its nature cannot be cured) and if not cured within the timeframe above and
at or prior to the Closing, such breach would result in the failure of any of
the conditions set forth in _Section 6.1_ or  _Section 6.3_ to be
satisfied, (ii) Parent or Holdco shall have (A) breached _Section 5.1_ or (B)

, _however_ , that no such cure period shall be available or applicable
to any such breach which by its nature cannot be cured) and if not cured
within the timeframe above and at or prior to the Closing, such breach would
result in the failure of any of the conditions set forth in _Section 6.1_ or
_Section 6.2_ to be satisfied. 

  

7.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this Agreement as
provided in _Section 7.1_, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and
there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of Acquiror, Sub,

partys representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained
herein. 

  

7.3 _Amendment._ Subject to the provisions of applicable Legal Requirements,
the parties hereto may amend this Agreement by authorized action at any time
before or after the Holdco Shareholder Approval pursuant to an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto (provided that after
such Holdco Shareholder Approval, no amendment shall be made which by law
requires further approval by the Holdco Shareholders without such further
Holdco Shareholder Approval). To the extent permitted by applicable Legal
Requirements, Acquiror and the Holdco Equity Holders Agent may cause this
Agreement to be amended at any time after the Closing by execution of an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of Acquiror and the Holdco Equity
Holders Agent.

hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made
to such party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto,

acts of the other, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations
and warranties made to such party contained herein or in any document
delivered pursuant hereto, and (iii) waive compliance with any of the
agreements or conditions for the benefit of such Person contained herein. Any

Agent to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such Person. Without limiting the
generality or effect of the preceding sentence, no delay in exercising any
right under this Agreement shall constitute a waiver of such right, and
no waiver of any breach or default shall be deemed a waiver of any other
breach or default of the same or any other provision in this Agreement.

ARTICLE VIII 

   

ESCROW FUND AND INDEMNIFICATION  

  

8.1 _Survival of Representations, Warranties, Covenants and Agreements_. If
the Merger is consummated, all of the representations and warranties of
Parent and Holdco contained in this Agreement and in any certificates
delivered by or on behalf of Parent or Holdco at the Closing shall survive
the Closing and remain in full force and effect until the date that is 18
months following the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
representations and warranties of Parent and Holdco contained in _Section
2.1_ (Organization, Standing and Power), _Section 2.4_ (Authority and
Enforceability), _Section 2.8_ (Capital Structure) and _Section 2.19_
(Taxes), and in any certificate delivered to Acquiror regarding any
matter set forth in such sections of this Agreement pursuant to any provision
of this Agreement, will remain operative and in full force and effect until

months following the Closing Date (such 18-month period, such period ending
30-days after the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations or such

_Survival Period_ "). No right to indemnification pursuant to _Article VIII_
in respect of any claim that is set forth in an Officers Certificate
delivered to the Escrow Agent prior to the expiration of the applicable
Survival Period shall be affected by the expiration of such representations
and warranties. Such expiration shall not affect the rights of any
Indemnified Person under _Article VIII_ or otherwise to seek recovery of
Damages arising out of any fraud or intentional misrepresentation by Parent or
Holdco until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. If the
Merger is consummated, the representations and warranties of Acquiror
contained in this Agreement and the other certificates contemplated hereby
shall expire and be of no further force or effect as of the Closing, except
for the representation of Acquiror set forth in _Section 3.1_ which shall
survive for 18 months following the Closing Date. If the Merger is
consummated, all covenants and agreements of the parties (including the
covenants and agreements set forth in _Article IV_ and _Article V_ ) shall
expire and be of no further force or effect as of the Closing, except to the
extent such covenants and agreements provide that they are to be performed
after the Closing;  _provided_ , _however_ , that no right to indemnification
pursuant to _Article VIII_ in respect of any claim based upon any breach of a
covenant or agreement shall be affected by the expiration of such covenant. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

8.2 _Indemnification_. 

  

(a) Subject to any limitations set forth in _Section 8.2(c)_, Acquiror and
its Subsidiaries and Affiliates, and each of their other respective officers,
directors, members, agents, employees, successors and assigns (each of the
foregoing being referred to individually as an " _Indemnified Person_ " and
collectively as " _Indemnified Persons_ ") shall be indemnified out of
the Escrow Fund from and against any and all Damages incurred by an
Indemnified Person, directly or indirectly, whether or not due to a third-
party claim, arising out of, or resulting from: 

  

(i) the failure of any representation or warranty (except for those set forth
in _Section 2.1_ (Organization, Standing and Power), _Section 2.4_
(Authority and Enforceability),  _Section 2.8_ (Capital Structure), and
_Section 2.14_ (Litigation)), made by Parent or Holdco in this Agreement or
in the Disclosure Letter to be true and correct as of the Agreement Date and
as of the Closing Date as though such representation or warranty were made as
of the Closing Date (except in the case of representations and warranties
which by their terms speak only as of a specific date or dates, which
representations and warranties shall be true and correct as of such date or
dates); 

  

(ii) the failure of any representation or warranty made by Parent or Holdco in
any certificate delivered to Acquiror pursuant to any provision of this
Agreement, to be true and correct as of the date such certificate is
delivered to Acquiror; 

  

(iii) any breach of the covenants or agreements made by Parent or by Holdco
(to the extent that Holdco was obligated to comply with such covenant or
agreement at or prior to the Effective Time) in this Agreement, except for
_Section 5.10_ (Covenant Not to Compete), _Section 5.11_ (Non-Solicitation),
_Section 5.16_ (Indebtedness) and _Section 5.17_ (Liquidation; Sale of
Parent); or 

  

(iv) any payments paid with respect to Dissenting Shares to the extent that
such payments, in the aggregate, exceed the value of the amounts that
otherwise would have been payable pursuant to  _Section 1.9_ upon the
exchange of such Dissenting Shares. 

  

(b) Subject to any limitations set forth in _Section 8.2(c)_, the Indemnified
Persons shall be indemnified solely from Parent (and its successors and
assigns), and Parent so indemnifies the Indemnified Persons, from and against
any and all Damages incurred by an Indemnified Person, directly or
indirectly, whether or not due to a third-party claim, arising out of, or
resulting from: 

  

(i) the failure of any representation or warranty set forth in _Section
2.1_ (Organization, Standing and Power), _Section 2.4_ (Authority and
Enforceability), _Section 2.8_ (Capital Structure), and _Section 2.14_
(Litigation) made by Parent or Holdco in this Agreement or in the Disclosure
Letter to be true and correct as of the Agreement Date and as of the Closing
Date as though such representation or warranty were made as of the Closing
Date (except in the case of representations and warranties which by their
terms speak only as of a specific date or dates, which representations and
warranties shall be true and correct as of such date or dates); 

  

(ii) any breach of the covenants or agreements by Parent or Holdco, as

5.11_ (Non-Solicitation),  _Section 5.16_ (Indebtedness) or _Section 5.17_
(Liquidation; Sale of Parent) of this Agreement; 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(iii) any matter set forth on _Schedule 2.14_ to the Disclosure Letter or
that is or would be an exception to the representations and warranties made
on each date in _Section 2.14_ (Litigation); 

   

(iv) the fraud or intentional misrepresentation of Parent or Holdco; 

  

(v) the Edgetech Remediation; or 

  

(vi) any liability or obligations of any entity, whether or not incorporated,
which is or was part of a controlled group or under common control with the
Edgetech Entities prior to the Closing Date or otherwise treated as a "single
employer" with the Edgetech Entities within the meaning of Section 414(b),
(c), (m) or (o) of the Code or under Section 4001 of ERISA prior to the
Closing Date, with respect to any "employee benefit plan" of that entity (as
defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA) established, maintained, sponsored or
contributed to by such entity, including, but not limited to (A) liabilities
for complete and partial withdrawals under any "multiemployer plan"
(as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA) pursuant to Section 4203 or 4205 of
ERISA, respectively, and (B) liabilities to the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation (including without limitation, liabilities for premiums and
terminations). 

  

(c) The entitlement of any Indemnified Persons to be indemnified shall be
subject to the following: 

  

(i) Any amounts payable to the Indemnified Persons pursuant to _Section
8.2(a)_ shall be payable solely out of the Escrow Fund; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that for the period from 18 months following the Closing Date to
on or before 36 months following the Closing Date, new claims for Damages
made against the Escrow Fund may only be made as a result of the failure of
any representation or warranty in _Section 2.18_ (Environmental Matters) to
be true and correct. 

  

(ii) In the event that any Indemnified Person obtains a payment of an amount
from the Escrow Fund as a result of a breach of the first sentence of
_Section 2.26_ (Accounts Receivable) with respect to an uncollected
receivable or portion thereof, and such amount is subsequently collected on
such receivable by the Indemnified Person within 18 months from the Closing
Date, then the Indemnified Person shall remit such subsequently collected
amount to the Escrow Fund. 

  

(iii) Any amounts payable to the Indemnified Persons pursuant to _Section
8.2(b)_ shall be payable by Parent or its permitted successors or assigns. 

  

(iv) No claim for the recovery of Damages pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)_ may be
asserted by any Indemnified Person against the Escrow Fund after the
expiration of the applicable Survival Period; _provided_ , _however_ , that
claims first asserted in writing prior to such expiration in an Officers
Certificate shall survive expiration of the applicable Survival Period. 

  

(v) No claim for Damages shall be made pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)(i)_, 
_8.2(a)(ii)_ or _8.2(a)(iii)_ , unless the aggregate of all Damages for which
all claims are made hereunder by the Indemnified Persons exceeds $500,000
(the " _Threshold_ "). If the total amount of such Damages exceeds the
Threshold, then the Indemnified Persons shall be entitled to be indemnified
against and compensated and reimbursed for the portion of such Damages
exceeding the Threshold. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(vi) No Holdco Equity Holder shall have any personal liability beyond the
possible loss of his, her or its share of the Escrow Fund for any Damages
incurred by any of the Indemnified Persons. 

  

(vii) The amount of any Damages that are subject to indemnification under this
_Article VIII_ shall be calculated net of the amount of any insurance
proceeds or other third party indemnification proceeds actually received by
the Indemnified Persons in connection with such Damages or any of the events
or circumstances giving rise or otherwise related to such Damages, net of all
deductibles, co-payments, retro-premium obligations and premium increases
attributable thereto and all costs of collection of any such proceeds.
Acquiror shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any such
proceeds. If any such proceeds are received by any Indemnified Person after
receiving payment or reimbursement for any Damages hereunder, Acquiror shall
cause to be paid to the Holdco Equity Holders, pro rata in proportion to their
respective interests in the Escrow Fund, or to Parent, as the case may be, an
amount equal to the lesser of such proceeds or the amount of such Damages
previously paid or reimbursed. 

  

(viii) Qualifications as to materiality using the term "material" (or any
variation thereof) or Material Adverse Effect in any representation, warranty
or covenant shall only be taken into account in determining whether a breach
of such representation, warranty or covenant (or failure of any
representation or warranty to be true and correct) exists, and shall not be
taken into account in determining the amount of any Damages with respect to
such breach, or failure to be true and correct. 

  

(ix) Except with respect to Damages actually awarded to a third party in an
action brought against an Indemnified Person, no Indemnified Person is
entitled to reimbursement from the Escrow Fund pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)_
or from Parent pursuant to _Section 8.2(b)_ for punitive damages, or for
lost profits, consequential, exemplary or special damages. 

  

8.3 _Escrow Fund_. The Escrow Cash shall be deposited by Acquiror with PNC
Bank National Association (or another institution selected by Acquiror and
reasonably satisfactory to Parent and Holdco) as escrow agent (the " _Escrow
Agent_ "), such deposit, together with any interest that may be earned
thereon, to constitute an escrow fund (the " _Escrow Fund_ ") and to be
governed by the provisions set forth herein and in the Escrow Agreement. The
Escrow Fund shall be available to compensate Acquiror (on behalf of itself or
any other Indemnified Person) for Damages pursuant to the indemnification
obligations set forth in this _Article VIII_. 

  

8.4 _Indemnification of Parent_. Acquiror will indemnify and hold harmless
Parent and its successors and assigns and its officers, employees and
directors (collectively, the " _Parent Indemnified Persons_ ") from and
against any and all Damages incurred by the Parent Indemnified Persons
arising out of the breach by Acquiror of the representation of Acquiror set
forth in  _Section 3.1_. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

8.5 _Claims_. 

  

(a) If Acquiror determines in good faith that any Indemnified Person has a
bona fide claim for indemnification pursuant to this _Article VIII_,
Acquiror may deliver to Parent and (if the Acquiror is making a claim against
the Escrow Fund) the Escrow Agent a certificate signed by any officer of
Acquiror (any certificate delivered in accordance with the provisions of
this  _Section 8.5(a)_, an " _Officer s Certificate_"): 

  

(i) stating that an Indemnified Person has a claim for indemnification
pursuant to this  _Article VIII_; 

  

(ii) stating the amount of such Damages (which, in the case of Damages not yet
incurred, paid, reserved or accrued, may be the maximum amount reasonably
anticipated by Acquiror in good faith to be incurred, paid, reserved or
accrued); and 

  

(iii) specifying in reasonable detail (based upon the information then
possessed by Acquiror) the material facts known to the Indemnified Person
giving rise to such claim. 

  

No delay in providing such Officers Certificate within the applicable
Survival Period shall affect an Indemnified Persons rights hereunder, unless
(and then only to the extent that) the Holdco Equity Holders Agent, the
Holdco Equity Holders or Parent are materially prejudiced thereby. 

  

(b) If the Acquiror is making a claim against the Escrow Fund, at the time of
delivery of any Officers Certificate to the Escrow Agent, a duplicate copy
of such Officers Certificate shall be delivered to the Holdco Equity
Holders Agent by or on behalf of Acquiror (on behalf of itself or any other
Indemnified Person) and for a period of 30 days after such delivery to the
Escrow Agent of such Officers Certificate, the Escrow Agent shall make no
payment pursuant to this _Section 8.5_ unless the Escrow Agent shall have
received written authorization from the Holdco Equity Holders Agent to make
such delivery. After the expiration of such 30-day period, the Escrow
Agent shall make delivery of cash from the Escrow Fund to Acquiror in
accordance with this _Section 8.5_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such
delivery may be made if and to the extent the Holdco Equity Holders Agent
has raised bona fide good faith objections in a written statement to any
claim or claims made in the Officers Certificate, and such written statement
shall have been delivered to the Escrow Agent and the Acquiror prior to the
expiration of such 30-day period. 

  

(c) If the Acquiror is making a claim against Parent, Parent shall also have a
period of 30 days to raise good faith objections in a written statement to
any claims or claims made in the Officers Certificate, provided that such
written statement must be delivered to the Acquiror prior to the expiration
of such 30-day period. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

8.6 _Resolution of Objections to Claims_. 

  

(a) If the Holdco Equity Holders Agent or Parent raises bona fide good faith
objections in writing to any claim or claims by Acquiror made in any
Officers Certificate within such 30-day period, Acquiror and the Holdco
Equity Holders Agent or Parent, as applicable, shall attempt in good faith
for 45 days after Acquirors receipt of such written objection to resolve
such objection. If Acquiror and the Holdco Equity Holders Agent or Parent,
as applicable, shall so agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement
shall be prepared and signed by both parties and, if a claim is being made by
the Acquiror against the Escrow Fund, delivered to the Escrow Agent. The
Escrow Agent shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any such memorandum it
receives and the Escrow Agent shall distribute cash from the Escrow Fund in
accordance with the terms of such memorandum. 

  

(b) If no such agreement can be reached during the 45-day period for good
faith negotiation, but in any event upon the expiration of such 45-day
period, either Acquiror, the Holdco Equity Holders Agent or Parent, as
applicable, may bring suit to resolve the matter. 

  

(c) Judgment upon any award rendered by the trial court may be entered in any
court having jurisdiction. For purposes of this _Section 8.6(c)_, in any
suit hereunder in which any claim or the amount thereof stated in the
Officers Certificate is at issue, Acquiror shall be deemed to be the non-
prevailing party unless the trial court awards Acquiror at least one-half
of the amount in dispute, in which case the Escrow Fund or Parent, as
applicable, shall be deemed to be the non-prevailing party. The non-
prevailing party to a suit shall pay its own fees and expenses and the fees
and expenses of the prevailing party, including attorneys fees and
costs, reasonably incurred in connection with such suit. 

  

8.7 _Holdco Equity Holders  Agent_. 

  

(a) At the Closing, Kevin E. Gray shall be constituted and appointed as the
Holdco Equity Holders Agent. Kevin E. Gray hereby accepts his appointment as
the Holdco Equity Holders Agent. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "
_Holdco Equity Holders  Agent_" means the agent for and on behalf of the
Holdco Equity Holders to: (i) give and receive notices and communications to
or from Acquiror (on behalf of itself of any other Indemnified Person)
relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions and other matters
contemplated hereby or thereby (except to the extent that this Agreement
expressly contemplates that any such notice or communication shall be given or
received by such Holdco Equity Holders individually); (ii) authorize
deliveries to Acquiror of cash from the Escrow Fund in satisfaction of claims
asserted by Acquiror (on behalf of itself or any other Indemnified Person,
including by not objecting to such claims); (iii) object to such
claims pursuant to _Section 8.5_; (iv) consent or agree to, negotiate, enter
into settlements and compromises of, and comply with orders of courts with
respect to, such claims; (v) consent or agree to any amendment to this
Agreement, and (vi) take all actions necessary or appropriate in the judgment
of the Holdco Equity Holders Agent for the accomplishment of the foregoing,
in each case without having to seek or obtain the consent of any Person under
any circumstance. The Person serving as the Holdco Equity Holders Agent may
be replaced from time to time by the holders of a majority in interest of the
cash then on deposit in the Escrow Fund upon not less than ten days prior
written notice to Acquiror. No bond shall be required of the Holdco Equity
Holders Agent, and the Holdco Equity Holders Agent shall receive no
compensation for his services. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(b) The Holdco Equity Holders Agent shall not be liable to any former Holdco
Equity Holder for any act done or omitted hereunder as the Holdco Equity
Holders Agent without gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith (and
any act done or omitted pursuant to the bona fide good faith advice of
counsel shall be conclusive evidence of good faith). To the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, Parent shall indemnify the Holdco
Equity Holders Agent and hold him harmless against any loss, liability or
expense incurred without gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith on
the part of the Holdco Equity Holders Agent and arising out of or
in connection with the acceptance or administration of his duties hereunder,
including any out-of-pocket costs and expenses and legal fees and other legal
costs reasonably incurred by the Holdco Equity Holders Agent. If not paid
directly to the Holdco Equity Holders Agent by Parent, such losses,
liabilities or expenses may be recovered by the Holdco Equity Holders Agent
from the Escrow Fund otherwise distributable to the Holdco Equity Holders
(and not distributed or distributable to an Indemnified Person or subject to
a pending indemnification claim of an Indemnified Person) after the
expiration of the applicable Survival Period, pursuant to the terms hereof
and of the Escrow Agreement, at the time of distribution, and such recovery
will be made from the Holdco Equity Holders according to their respective pro
rata shares of the Net Total Merger Consideration. 

  

(c) Any notice or communication given or received by, and any decision,
action, failure to act within a designated period of time, agreement,
consent, settlement, resolution or instruction of, the Holdco Equity Holders
Agent that is within the scope of the Holdco Equity Holders
Agents authority under _Section 8.7(a)_ shall constitute a notice or
communication to or by, or a decision, action, failure to act within a
designated period of time, agreement, consent, settlement, resolution or
instruction of all the Holdco Equity Holders and shall be final, binding and
conclusive upon each such Holdco Equity Holder; and each Indemnified Person
shall be entitled to rely upon any such notice, communication, decision,
action, failure to act within a designated period of time, agreement,
consent, settlement, resolution or instruction as being a notice
or communication to or by, or a decision, action, failure to act within a
designated period of time, agreement, consent, settlement, resolution or
instruction of, each and every such Holdco Equity Holder. 

  

(d) In connection with the performance of his obligations hereunder and under
the Escrow Agreement, the Holdco Equity Holders Agent shall have the right
at any time and from time to time to select and engage, at the cost and
expense of the Holdco Equity Holders, attorneys, accountants, investment
bankers, advisors, consultants and clerical personnel and obtain such other
professional and expert assistance, and maintain such records, as the Holdco
Equity Holders Agent may deem necessary or desirable and incur other out-of-
pocket expenses related to performing his services hereunder. 

  

(e) All of the immunities and powers granted to the Holdco Equity Holders
Agent under this Agreement shall survive the Closing and/or any termination
of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. The grant of authority provided
for in this _Section 8.7_: (i) is coupled with an interest and shall be
irrevocable and survive the death, incompetence, bankruptcy or liquidation
of the respective Holdco Equity Holder and shall be binding on any successor
thereto and (ii) shall survive the delivery of an assignment by any Holdco
Equity Holder of the whole or any fraction of his, her or its interest in the
Escrow Fund. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

8.8 _Third-Party Claims_. 

  

(a) In the event Acquiror or another Indemnified Person becomes aware of a
third-party claim which Acquiror believes may result in a claim for
indemnification pursuant to this _ARTICLE VIII_ by or on behalf of an
Indemnified Person, Acquiror shall promptly deliver to the Holdco Equity
Holders Agent and Parent a written notice, notifying the same of such third-
party claim (each, a " _Notice_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, no delay
in providing such Notice within the applicable Survival Period shall affect
an Indemnified Persons rights hereunder, unless (and then only to the extent
that) the Holdco Equity Holders or Parent are materially prejudiced thereby. 

  

(b) Except with respect to third-party claims relating to customers, suppliers
and Intellectual Property, other than the existing claim relating to Gerhard
Reichert (" _Special Claims_ "), the Holdco Equity Holders Agent and Parent
shall have the right, exercisable by written notice to Acquiror, within 30
days of receipt of a Notice, to assume and conduct the defense of such claim
with counsel selected by the Holdco Equity Holders Agent or Parent, as
applicable, and reasonably acceptable to Acquiror. The Holdco Equity Holders
Agent or Parent, as applicable, will be entitled to defend and, subject to
the provisions of _Section 8.7(a)_ and only so long as such settlement is
only for monetary damages, settle such claim and use the Escrow Fund, but
only for such claims for which indemnification may be made from the Escrow
Fund under _ARTICLE VIII_ , and the Holdco Equity Holders Agent or Parent,
as applicable, and Acquiror, shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to
release funds held under the Escrow Agreement for this purpose in accordance
with the provisions of the Escrow Agreement. Except as otherwise provided
for herein, if the Holdco Equity Holders Agent or Parent, as applicable, has
assumed such defense as provided in this _Section 8.8(b)_, the Holdco Equity
Holders Agent or Parent, as applicable, will not be liable for any legal
expenses subsequently incurred by any Indemnified Person in connection with
the defense of such claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, such Indemnified
Person has the right to employ counsel separate from the counsel employed by
the Holdco Equity Holders Agent or Parent, as applicable, in the defense of
any claim that the Holdco Equity Holders Agent or Parent, as applicable, is
defending and to participate in such defense, but the fees and expenses of
such counsel will be at the Indemnified Persons own expense unless such
Indemnified Person has obtained separate counsel by reason of the existence
of a conflict of interest or a reasonably foreseeable conflict of interest
between such Indemnified Person and Parent, the Holdco Equity Holders or the
Holdco Equity Holders Agent, as applicable, and in such an instance,
the fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be included in the
potential Damages for which such Indemnified Person may seek indemnification
subject to the limitations set forth in  _ARTICLE VIII_. The party not
conducting the defense of such claim shall have the right to receive from the
party conducting the defense of such claim copies of all pleadings, notices
and communications with respect to the third-party claim and shall be
entitled to participate in, but not to determine or conduct, any defense of
the third-party claim or settlement negotiations with respect to the third-
party claim. If the Holdco Equity Holders Agent or Parent, as
applicable, does not assume the defense of any third-party claim in
accordance with this _Section 8.8(b)_ , Acquiror or any other Indemnified
Person may defend such claim and any Special Claim and settle or resolve any
such claim and the cost and expenses incurred by Acquiror or by any
such Indemnified Person in connection with such defense, settlement or
resolution (including reasonable attorney fees, other professionals and
expert fees and court or arbitration costs) shall be included in the
potential Damages for which an Indemnified Person may seek indemnification
subject to the limitations set forth in this _ARTICLE VIII_. The Indemnified
Person will not consent to a settlement of, or the entry of any judgment 

 

    ##### 

  

   

arising from, any such claim, without the prior written consent of the Holdco
Equity Holders Agent or Parent, as applicable, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. Except with the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Person (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed),
neither Holdco Equity Holders Agent nor Parent, as applicable, in the
defense of any such claim, shall consent to the entry of any judgment or
enter into any settlement that (i) provides for injunctive or other
nonmonetary relief affecting the Indemnified Person or (ii) does not include
as an unconditional term thereof the giving by each claimant or plaintiff
respecting such claim to such Indemnified Person of a release from
all liability with respect to such claim or litigation. With respect to the
defense or resolution of any such third-party claim, the Holdco Equity
Holders Agent or Parent, as applicable, shall keep the Indemnified Person
reasonably apprised of all proceedings associated therewith and shall provide
to the Indemnified Person all information reasonably requested by the
Indemnified Person in connection therewith. 

  

(c) The party responsible for the defense of any third-party claim (the "
_Responsible Party_ ") shall promptly notify the other party of each
settlement offer with respect to a third-party claim. Such other party shall
notify the Responsible Party with reasonable promptness whether or not
such party is willing to accept the proposed settlement offer. The
Responsible Party shall not consent to any settlement of any third-party
claim without obtaining the prior written consent (not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) of the other party. 

  

(d) From and after the Closing, and subject to applicable law, each party
hereto, upon the receipt of reasonable notice from the Responsible Party,
shall (i) give or cause to be given to the Responsible Party, and their
representatives, full and complete access, during normal business hours, to
the assets, properties, books, records, agreements and employees of such
party, (ii) cooperate with the Responsible Party and their representatives
and (iii) permit the Responsible Party and their representatives to make such
inspections, in each case described in clauses (a) through (c) of this
_Section 8.8(d)_, as such Responsible Party may reasonably require to permit
such Responsible Party to evaluate, defend or participate in the defenses or
settlement of any claim by a third-party against any Indemnified Person for
which indemnification is available hereunder and that may result in Damages
payable to such Indemnified Person. The Responsible Party shall, and shall
cause its representatives to, hold in confidence and not disclose or use
any information acquired pursuant to the foregoing sentence except as may be
necessary to defend or participate in the defense or settlement of any such
claim. 

  

8.9 _Treatment of Indemnification Payments._ All indemnification payments made
pursuant to this _ARTICLE VIII_ shall be treated by the parties as
adjustments to the Total Merger Consideration unless otherwise required by
applicable law.

(a) When a reference is made in this Agreement to Articles, Sections or
Exhibits, such reference shall be to an Article or Section of, or an Exhibit
to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The headings contained in this
Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. The words "include,"
"includes" and "including" when used herein shall be deemed in each case to
be followed by the words "without limitation." Any undefined accounting term
shall have the meaning assigned to it pursuant to GAAP. Unless the context of
this Agreement otherwise requires: (i) words of any gender include each other
gender; (ii) words using the singular or plural number also include the
plural or singular number, respectively; and (iii) the terms "hereof,"
"herein," "hereunder" and derivative or similar words refer to this entire
Agreement. 

  

(b) The disclosures in the Disclosure Letter relate only to the representation
and warranties in the section or paragraph of the Agreement to which they
expressly relate and not to any other representation or warranty in this
Agreement. If there is any inconsistency between the statements in the body
of this Agreement and those in the Disclosure Letter (other than an exception
expressly set forth as in the Disclosure Letter with respect to a
specifically identified representation or warranty), the statements in the
body of this Agreement will control. 

  

9.3 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same
instrument and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been
signed by each of the parties hereto and delivered to the other parties
hereto; it being understood that all parties hereto need not sign the same
counterpart. 

  

9.4 _Incorporation of Exhibits, Disclosure Letter and Other Schedules_.
The Exhibits, Disclosure Letter and other Schedules identified in this
Agreement are incorporated herein by reference and made a part hereof. 

  

9.5 _Entire Agreement; Nonassignability; Parties in Interest_. This
Agreement and the documents and instruments and other agreements specifically
referred to herein or delivered pursuant hereto, including all the Exhibits
attached hereto, the Schedules, including the Disclosure Letter, (a)
constitute the entire agreement among the parties hereto with respect to
the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the parties hereto with respect
to the subject matter hereof, except for the Confidentiality Agreement, which
shall continue in full force and effect, and shall survive any termination of
this Agreement, in accordance with its terms, (b) are not intended to confer,
and shall not be construed as conferring, upon any Person other than the
parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder (except that _Article VIII_
is intended to benefit Indemnified Persons) and (c) shall not be assigned by
operation of law or otherwise except as otherwise specifically provided
herein. 

  

9.6 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests
or obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or delegated, in whole or
in part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties hereto
without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto, and any such
assignment without such prior written consent shall be null and void, except
that Acquiror may assign this Agreement to any direct or indirect wholly owned
subsidiary of Acquiror without the prior consent of Parent and Holdco;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Acquiror shall remain liable for all of its
obligations under this Agreement. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable
by, the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

9.7 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or
the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement shall continue in full force and effect and shall be interpreted so
as reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties hereto
shall use all reasonable efforts to replace such void or unenforceable
provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision that
shall achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other
purposes of such void or unenforceable provision. 

  

9.8 _Remedies Cumulative_. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and
all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party hereto shall be deemed
cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by
law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party hereto of any one
remedy shall not preclude the exercise of any other remedy and nothing in
this Agreement shall be deemed a waiver by any party of any right to
specific performance or injunctive relief. It is accordingly agreed that the
parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions
hereof, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity, and the parties hereby waive the requirement of
any posting of a bond in connection with the remedies described herein. 

  

9.9 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed
in accordance with the laws of the State of Ohio without reference to such
states principles of conflicts of law. 

  

9.10 _Rules of Construction_. The parties hereto have been represented
by counsel during the negotiation, preparation and execution of this
Agreement and, therefore, hereby waive, with respect to this Agreement, each

agreement or other document shall be construed against the party drafting such
agreement or document. 

  

9.11 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER

representations or warranties relating to Holdco or the Edgetech Entities or
otherwise in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby other than

or any memoranda or offering materials or presentations, including, without
limitation, any memoranda and materials provided by any representative of
Parent or Holdco are not and shall not be deemed to be or to include
representations or warranties of Parent or Holdco.
