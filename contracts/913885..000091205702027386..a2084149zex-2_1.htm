 **2.5.2 Infineon Corporate Contracts.**  The parties recognize that of the
quotations and commitments described in Section 2.5.1, some (identified as
such on  Schedule 2.5.1) are made under Infineon corporate contracts that
are partly unrelated to the Vanessa Transferred Business and that are
not transferred under Section 2.5.1. The parties will work together in good
faith to transfer the business relationships with end user customers
represented by those quotes and commitments, to Purchaser and TriQuint. If
necessary to satisfy the customers involved, Purchaser and TriQuint will
fulfill the specific quotations and commitments under the general procedures
of section 2.5.5 (provided that neither Purchaser nor TriQuint will be
obligated to fulfill any commitments not identified on Schedule 2.5.1, as
for example, volume purchase discount commitments otherwise applicable to
Infineon corporate contracts). Infineon and its Affiliates will not quote
further Vanessa Transferred Business parts under its Infineon corporate
contracts after the signature date of this Agreement (except, until the
Effective Date, under the procedures contemplated in Section 2.5.1). Further,
Infineon has obligations with respect to the supply of parts listed on s
Schedules 1.21 and 1.10, under Infineon corporate distributorship contracts
listed on Schedule 2.5.2. Those contracts cannot, by their nature, be
transferred to TriQuint, and Infineon has obligations under them to continue
to supply at least some of the parts listed on Exhibit- Schedules 1.21 and
1.10 for periods ranging from one to six months after a notice that the part
will no longer be available. These rules will apply to the Schedule
2.5.2 contracts:

  

 **(a) Termination of Supply.**  At or before the Effective Date, Infineon
will give notice under the respective contracts that terminates the
purchaserÂ’s ability to acquire parts listed on s Schedules 1.21 or 1.10, in
accordance with the requirements of the particular contract. The notice
will refer those parties to TriQuint for inquiries regarding further supply,
and copies will be provided to TriQuint as they are sent.

  

 **(b) Supply for Tail Period.**  Infineon may as necessary to comply with
its contract obligations under distributorship contracts listed in  Schedule
2.5.2, continue to supply parts listed on s Schedules 1.21 or 1.10 during the
termination period associated with the particular contract.

  



  

9      
   



  

 **(c) Reports.** Infineon shall supply TriQuint with monthly reports,
delivered within fifteen days following the last day of each calendar month
after the Effective Date, that detail the parts delivered, and to which
customer the parts have been delivered, under this Section 2.5.2.

  

 **(d) Credit against Purchase Obligation.**  For purposes of TriQuintÂ’s
obligation to order parts and for purposes of establishing whether minimum
order obligations have been met under any of the Ancillary Agreements, parts
delivered by Infineon under paragraph (b) above shall be credited to
TriQuint, as if ordered by TriQuint from Infineon at the prices applicable
between the parties, and as if delivered by Infineon to TriQuint on the date
delivered to the Customer.

  

 **(e) Economic Credit for Margin.**  TriQuint shall receive, for each part
sold under this Section 2.5.2, an amount equal to the price at which TriQuint
would be able to purchase that part from Infineon as defined in
Schedule 1(b) to the Interim Supply Agreement, which is itself Exhibit
2.6.1(b) to this Agreement. Unless the parties agree on a different
mechanism, TriQuint shall collect those amounts through an offset (credit) it
declares against amounts otherwise due Infineon under the Ancillary Agreement
or this Agreement. To the extent amounts owing make it possible to do so, the
credits will be declared against amounts owing under the Interim Supply
Agreement (Exhibit 2.6.1(b).) 2.6.1(b)).

  

 **(f) End Customers.**  The parties will work together in good faith to
transfer the business relationships with end user customers that distributor
orders represent to Purchaser and TriQuint.

  

 **2.5.3 Vanessa Transferred Business Customer Records.** Sellers shall
deliver to Purchaser on the Effective Date records of Vanessa Transferred
Business specific Customer relationships, to the extent those records have
been, as a matter of standard business practice, kept within the systems
resident on site in the Vanessa Transferred Business locations. To
the extent Customer records relevant to the Vanessa Transferred Business
are located elsewhere in Infineon or its Affiliates, Infineon will make
copies of them available to TriQuint or Purchaser on request as needed,
subject to InfineonÂ’s right to impose reasonable confidentiality restrictions
with respect to portions of records unrelated to the Vanessa Transferred
Business.

  

 **2.5.4 Acceptance of Purchaser.** The Purchaser will accept this
transfer and assignment and will assume the benefits, liabilities,
obligations and risks transferred under Section 2.5.1, as of the Effective
Date.

  

 **2.5.5 Consent of Third Parties.**  The Parties shall use their best
efforts to obtain the consent of third parties if such consent is necessary
in order for the transfers referred to Section 2.5.1 to be effective, and in
general to transfer the business relationships within the field of the
Vanessa Transferred Business that the contracts, commitments and quotations
listed on Schedule 2.5.1 represent.  If any necessary consents are not
granted or if it appears impracticable to obtain them, the Parties shall,
within the internal relationship, conduct themselves in economic terms and
also, if it is legally permissible to do so, in legal terms as if the third
party had consented to the transfer of the contract as at the Effective Date.
If legally permissible, this shall, in particular, mean that Purchaser shall
perform and handle the relevant contracts in SellersÂ’ name but on its own
account or that Seller shall grant licences to Purchaser in respect of the
rights of usage and other rights granted to it in the relevant contracts.

  

 **2.5.6 Vanessa-Unique Contracts with Infineon AP. ** Infineon will
undertake that its Affiliates will transfer at the Effective Date all
contracts, which relate exclusively to the Infineon APÂ’s Vanessa Transferred
Business and listed in Schedule 2.5.1. The stipulations of this Section 2.5
shall apply accordingly.

 **2.6.1 Interim Agreements.**  As of the Effective Date the agreements
attached hereto as Exhibits and/or Schedules 2.6.1(a) through 2.6.1(f)
2.6.1(g) (the Interim Agreements) shall come into effect, and Infineon and
Purchaser or TriQuint, as appropriate, shall deliver its signature on each of
them.  Here is an abstract of those agreements. The text of the Ancillary

rights and limitations on identification of such equipment.

  

 **(b) SiGe Foundry Services Agreement **for SiGe production from Infineon.

  

 **2.7 (Reserved.)**

  

 **2.8 Transfer of Employees.**

  

 **2.8.1 Betriebsteil Employees.**  As the German-located aspects of the
Vanessa Transferred Business represent a part-business ("Betriebsteil")
within the meaning of

  



  

11      
   



  

Section 613a of the German Civil Code (BGB), the employment contracts with
the employees of the Betriebsteil, as well as all rights and obligations
associated with them, shall, as of the Effective Date, pass to Purchaser
provided that the employees concerned do not oppose the transfer of their
employment contracts with legal effect. The employees employed in the
Betriebsteil at the time of entering into this contract are shown in Schedule
2.8.1. Consequently if any individual employees of the Betriebsteil oppose
the transfer of their employment contracts with legal effect, such employment
contracts shall remain with Infineon.

  

 **2.8.2 Procedure for Identifying Objecting Employees.** Infineon shall,
upon PurchaserÂ’s request prior to Effective Date, and in any case
definitively at least three days before the scheduled time for the Effective
Date, identify to Purchaser all Betriebsteil employees who have opposed the
transfer of their employment contracts with legal effect.

  

 **2.8.3 Pension Obligations for Returning Employees.** In the event of
employees returning to Infineon within three years of Effective Date, without
any break in terms of time, and having a pension entitlement from Purchaser
which is still capable of lapsing or an entitlement to a six-month transfer
payment, the following shall be agreed: the pension commitment or the
commitment to a six-month transfer payment shall remain in existence, and all
obligations resulting herefrom shall be taken over in a tripartite agreement
between Purchaser, Infineon and the employee concerned by way of a
discharging takeover of debt from Infineon (change of debtor pursuant to
Sections 414 and 415 BGB and Section 4 of the German Industrial Constitution
Act (BetrAVG)). In exchange, Purchaser shall transfer to Infineon assets in
the sum of the target reserve as shown on Schedule 6.12 which had accumulated
as at the leaving date. Additionally, Purchaser shall hand over to Infineon
the documents in respect of the commitment in question. If an employee
declines the re-transfer of his or her pension liability as outlined above,
the above provision shall not apply in his or her case.

  

 **2.8.4 Betriebsteil Employees Employment Contracts and Records.** Within
the internal relationship, Infineon and Purchaser shall conduct themselves as
if the employment contracts with the employees employed in the German
Vanessa Transferred Business were transferred as of the Effective Date
itself. Purchaser shall receive copies of all such employment agreements at
Effective Date.  By "employment agreements" here is meant any and all
documents constituting the legally binding obligations of Sellers to the
Betriebsteil employees who join Purchaser, and the legally binding
obligations of those employees also to Infineon or its Affiliates that
transfer with the Betriebsteil, whether those are individually signed, or are
inherited in the form of obligations under laws governing the WorkerÂ’s
Council ("Betriebsrat").

  

 **2.8.5 Vanessa Employees Offered US Transfer.** As of the Effective Date,
TriQuint shall offer employment within its appropriate divisions or
operations to the employees listed in Schedule 2.8.5. TriQuint commits to
make offers suitable for employees of comparable grade and position elsewhere
in TriQuintÂ’s operations. Infineon AG and TriQuint shall cooperate to
communicate offers, and secure agreement on employment terms from the listed
employees, prior to the Effective Date. If the employees accept the offer,
Infineon will terminate the existing contract. TriQuint understands each such
employee will retain the right to reject the offer, and that InfineonÂ’s
obligations with respect to employees who reject the offer will be
independent of this Agreement. The offers shall be effective with respect to
each employee on the dates called for in the Process Transfer Plan attached
as Schedule 2.6.1(e).

  

 **2.8.6 Vanessa Transferred Business Employees Outside Germany.** As of the
Effective Date, Infineon US shall terminate the employment of the employees
listed in Schedule 2.8.6. In connection with such terminations,
TriQuint shall offer employees listed on  Schedule 2.8.6 employment within
its appropriate divisions or operations as of the Effective Date, which
employment shall be offered, and (in the respective employeeÂ’s discretion)
may be accepted, conditioned upon close. TriQuint commits to

  



  

12      
   



  

make offers suitable for employees of comparable grade and position elsewhere
in TriQuintÂ’s operations. Without limiting the foregoing, such offers shall be
for the same base salary and with employee benefits which, taken as a whole,
are substantially equivalent to those provided by Infineon US to
such employees. Sellers and TriQuint shall cooperate to communicate offers
and secure acceptance of employment by TriQuint from the listed employees.
Such cooperation shall include cooperation prior to the Effective Date.

  

 **2.8.7 **In case of a shutdown or in other cases of "Betriebsanderung"
according to Â§ 111 BetrVG within the period of 4 years the Purchaser waives
its right to refuse a "sozialplan" according to Â§ 112a II BetrVG. TriQuint
shall be jointly and severally liable with Purchaser for any claims of the
employees under the "sozialplan".

  

 **2.9 Process Transfer. **TriQuint will transfer InfineonÂ’s pHEMT process to
TriQuint and re-qualify such process at one of TriQuintÂ’s, or
its AffiliatesÂ’, facilities. Infineon will support TriQuint in the transfer
of the pHEMT process. InfineonÂ’s and TriQuintÂ’s commitments concerning the
transfer of processes are captured in Schedule 2.6.1(e).

  

 **2.10 Covenant Not to Compete; Employee Covenants.** For a term beginning
on the Effective Date (except, with respect to the Hi Rel portion of the
Vanessa Transferred Business, beginning on the effective date on which the
acquisition of that portion of the business closes) and ending September 30,
2005, Infineon and its Affiliates (and Infineon will cover its Affiliates Â—
for the sake of clarity Siemens AG shall not be deemed to be an Affiliate of
Sellers, and Affiliates of Siemens AG who are not also Affiliates of Sellers
shall not be deemed to be an Affiliate of Sellers) will not engage in or
carry out any Competitive Activities.

  

 **2.10.1 Acquired Enterprises.**  This Covenant Not to Compete shall however
not apply to enterprises acquired by Infineon directly or indirectly after
the Effective Date, the [***] from Competitive Activities within which is
less than [***]% of the [***] of the whole acquired business, subject to the
following agreements.

  

 **(a) Commitment to Offer for Sale.**  If the acquired enterprise has
Galliumarsenide Device production capabilities, Infineon will, so far as it
lawfully may, offer the sale of such production capabilities to TriQuint at
[***] prices and terms and conditions to be negotiated.

  

 **(b) Commitment Not to Assist. **Infineon until September 30, 2005, refrain
from integrating the acquired Competitive Activities with InfineonÂ’s other
design, development, marketing, and sales activities, or otherwise materially
lending InfineonÂ’s marketing assistance to such acquired Competitive
Activities.

  

 **2.10.2 No Solicitation of Employees for Covenant Period.** From the date
of signing of this Agreement until the expiration of the period of the
Covenant Not to Compete just described, neither Infineon nor any Affiliate of
Infineon will solicit for employment outside of the Vanessa Transferred
Business, directly or indirectly, through one or more other persons or
entities, any person listed on Schedules 2.8.1, 2.8.5, or 2.8.6, and employed
by TriQuint or its Affiliates, except with TriQuintÂ’s written consent. In
case of a breach of the regulations of the sentence above, Infineon
will [***] TriQuint [***] rehired. The parties agree that after [***] from
the Effective Date, nothing contained herein shall prevent Infineon or its
Affiliates from hiring or employing any person who responds to an
advertisement in a newspaper or other media of general circulation, whether
or not that hiring would be mandated by the Betriebsvereinbarung, Sozialplan,
or by policies adopted consistent with it, provided that the provisions
associated with Key Employees in Section 2.10.4 shall still apply.

  

 **2.10.3 No Transfer between Signing and Effective Date.** Between the
signing date of this Agreement and the Effective Date, Infineon will not
transfer any employee

  



  

13      
   



  

listed on  Schedule 5.8.5 to any other business unit than the Vanessa
Transferred Business.

  

 **2.10.4 Recruiting Fee for Key Employees until End of Earnout
Period.** TriQuint hereby gives its written consent to InfineonÂ’s extension
of employment opportunities to Betriebsteil employees covered by the
applicable Betriebsvereinbarung, to the extent mandated by that document, and
further gives its written consent to InfineonÂ’s treatment of non-Betriebsteil
employees listed on Exhibit- Schedules 2.8.1 and 2.8.5 as if they were part
of the Betriebsteil. However, with respect to key employees and senior
managers identified on Schedule 5.8.5 (collectively Key Employees) who as of
closing have not opposed transfer, these rules shall apply. If Infineon or
any of its Affiliates employes employs a Key Employee under the consent given
in this paragraph before September 30, 2004, Infineon will pay TriQuint three
times the total annual salary of the specific Key Employee rehired.

  

 **2.10.5 Exceptions to Fees.**  No fee shall be due under paragraphs 2.10.2
or 2.10.4 in these cases: a) If at the time the employee in question was
rehired by Infineon or its Affiliate, the employee had been employed in good
faith by someone other than TriQuint or its Affiliate for a period of at
least 90 days; b)  If TriQuint consents to waive the fee; c) If TriQuint has
terminated the employee in question, and d) In the case of  key employees
identified in  Schedule 5.8.5b, if the employee has returned to Infineon or
an Affiliate after the employee has been employed by TriQuint or its
Affiliate at a location outside Germany for at least one year.

  

 **2.10.6 Settlement of Fees.**  Amounts due under Sections 2.10.2 and 2.10.4
shall be finally settled at the time of final settlement of the portion of
the Purchase Price determined from Earnout Revenues.

  

 **3. (Reserved.)**

  

 **4. Consideration.**

  

 **4.1 Total Consideration.**  The total consideration to be paid for the
Vanessa Transferred Business being acquired hereunder (exclusive of acquired
tangible assets and assumed liabilities) is: the actual Earnout Revenues as
calculated under Section 4.7, but not less than the minimum purchase price,
and not more than EUR 124,000,000 (such amounts to include amounts set aside
for the warranty reserve,) plus the market value for tangible assets as set
forth in Schedule 2.2, less the value of the liabilities assumed set forth in
Schedule 6.12. Amounts for VAT if applicable, tangible assets as set forth in
Schedule 2.2, and assumed liabilities as set forth in  Schedule 6.12, will
be settled at the Effective Date as a deduction/addition to the initial
payment, and will not otherwise affect the calculation of minimum or maximum
payments.The payment terms are based on the assumption that TriQuint and
TriQuintÂ’s Affiliates will realise Earnout Revenues of EUR 82,000,000 (in
words: eighty-two million EUROs), and the agreement of the parties that
TriQuint will provide suitable balance sheet reserves and bank assurances
related to that figure, in lieu of escrow accounts.

  

 **4.1.1 Minimum.** The minimum purchase price shall be EUR 45,000,000, which
amount shall include amounts set aside for the warranty reserves (i.e. EUR
5,000,000).

  

 **4.1.2 TriQuint Design Incentive Minimum Adjustment.** The parties
recognize that the key Vanessa Related Product for purposes of TriQuintÂ’s
realization of revenue and therefor of InfineonÂ’s realization of Earnout in
2003-04 will be a power amplifier. Details of the agreement between the
parties with respect to the design of the power amplifier are set forth in
the System House Agreement between the parties.  If TriQuint is unable to
deliver the specified part based on such specifications and time schedules as
defined in the System House Agreement then the minimum purchase price will be
raised from EUR 45,000,000 to EUR 50,000,000 (including amounts set aside for
the warranty reserve.)

  



  

14      
   



  

 **4.2 Purchase Price Allocation. **The purchase price is allocated as shown
in Schedule 4.2.

  

 **4.3 Payment Terms. **TriQuint and Purchaser shall deliver EUR
50,000,000 (in words: fifty million EURO), of the purchase price defined
under Section 4.1 plus Value Added Tax if applicable, plus the market value
for tangible assets as set forth in Schedule 2.2, less the value of the
liabilities assumed set forth in  Schedule 6.12, at the Effective Date by
wire transfer to the following account:

  

to Infineon Technologies AG

  

[***]

  

 **4.4 Purchase Price Adjustment regarding governmental funding. **At the end
of September 2003, TriQuint will report to Infineon the amount of
governmental grants to TriQuint or its affiliates announced by the official
funding institutions of the German government for the period October 1, 2002
until September 30, 2003 in the "Zustellungsbescheid." As
the "Zustellungsbescheid" shows the announced grants on a calendar year
basis, the announced grants shall then be adjusted on a pro rata basis,
provided that no credit shall be given for grants received by Infineon before
closing, as to which funds or credits were not transferred to TriQuint or
Purchaser at closing. If the sum reported (as adjusted and confirmed by
audit, if timely requested by Infineon) is less than EUR [***], then Infineon
shall pay TriQuint the amount of the shortfall, up to EUR [***]. Payments
under this section shall be made no later than [***].

  

 **4.5 ** [***]

  

 **4.6 Payments After Warranty Reserve claims.**  One year after the
Effective Date, Purchaser or TriQuint shall further deliver to Infineon EUR
5,000,000, less the amounts involved in the allowed or still contested
claims, as described below. With respect to amounts held back against
contested claims, Purchaser or TriQuint shall promptly deliver amounts as to
which the claim has been withdrawn (as described below) following
the withdrawal.

  

 **4.6.1 Warranty Claims Process**.  During the first year following the
Effective Date, Purchaser or TriQuint shall be entitled to present to
Infineon claims for damages to either based on breach of warranties or
covenants contained in this Agreement. To present a claim, Purchaser or
TriQuint shall deliver a Claims Notice, consisting of a statement of the
basis for the claim, the amount of the claim if known or the maximum amount
claimed if the precise amount is not yet known, and the section of this
Agreement on which the claim is based. The Claims Notice may also include
such other information as Purchaser or TriQuint believes Infineon will find
useful in assessing the claim.  No claim may be increased, or first
presented, after the end of the first year following the Effective Date.

  

 **4.6.2 Contested, Allowed, Compromised, and Withdrawn Claims**. A claim
once made shall be considered contested until allowed by Infineon by notice,
or

  



  

15      
   



  

withdrawn by Purchaser or TriQuint by notice. A claim that is compromised
between the parties shall be documented as compromised in writing, and shall
be considered allowed in the compromised amount, and withdrawn as to the
balance. A claim that is resolved through arbitration shall be considered
allowed, withdrawn, or compromised in accordance with the outcome of the
arbitral decision.

  

 **4.6.3 Timing of Claims Resolution**.  Unless the time is extended by the
parties, a contested claim shall be deemed allowed unless an arbitration has
been filed thereon within three months following the end of the warranty
claims period. The parties shall work together in good faith to resolve
all claims before that date.

  

 **4.7 Earnout Revenue Contingency Adjustment**.  The parties agree that the
final purchase price shall be determined as of the close of InfineonÂ’s fiscal
year ending September 30, 2004, in accordance with the following procedure:

  

 **4.7.1 Reports.** Promptly following the end of each month between [***],
TriQuint will report to Infineon on the total revenues TriQuint and its
Affiliates have realized in the month then ending in revenues generated from
the sale of Vanessa Originated Products. Promptly following the end of each
month between [***], TriQuint will report to Infineon on the total revenues
TriQuint and its Affiliates have realized in the month then ending in
revenues generated from the sale of Vanessa Related Products (provided that
[***] revenues will be counted at [***]%). For this purpose, "revenues" means
revenues with customers in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, as consistently applied by TriQuintÂ’s independent auditors, from
those sources. The sum of the revenues thus generated and reported shall be
the Earnout Revenues, subject to these limitations and procedural rules:

  

 **(a) Level at which Revenue Determined. **For this purpose, revenues shall
be counted at the level of the smallest units independently offered for
general sale by TriQuint or TriQuintÂ’s third party vendor, whether or not
such units are separately priced for purposes of a particular sale, with
[***] revenues being counted at [***]% of the revenue thus determined. If
such units are combined into a single unit bearing one unified price (e.g., a
module), the price of that module shall be allocated among its constituent
parts according to the cost of those units, using TriQuintÂ’s standard costing
methodology.

  

 **Module Example for Vanessa Originated Products Year:** For example, in the
October 2002 to September 2003 year, TriQuint may sell for a single price
modules that contain a mixture of Vanessa Originated Products and other
products.  Though the modules are not Vanessa Originated Products, Infineon
shall receive revenue credit for the portion of the unit revenue allocable on
a [***] to the included Vanessa Originated Products.

  

 **Example for Vanessa Related Products Year:** Likewise in the October 2003
to September 2004 year, TriQuint may sell for use in a design that
incorporates Infineon wireless chipsets, modules that contain a mixture of
TriQuint-originated parts, Vanessa Originated Parts, and third party
originated parts. In that year, Infineon shall receive revenue credit for the
portion of the module revenues allocable on a [***] to all parts other
than the Vanessa Originated Parts and the third party originated parts.
Again, in determining Earnout Revenues, [***] revenues will be counted at
[***]%.

  

 **(b) Limit on Vanessa Related Products Revenue.** The Vanessa Related
Products Revenue which are counted as Earnout Revenue to reconcile the
purchase price in between [***] are limited to not more than the [***]
Systems House Units times [***] Vanessa Related Products Unit Revenue. Those
terms are defined as follows:

  



  

16      
   



  

Â• **02/03 Systems House Units:** Total number of chipsets (i.e., the set
of chips needed for one GSM cellular phone) for which Infineon received
revenue in Infineon [***] for reference design GSM cellular phone builds.

  



  

Â• **03/04 Vanessa Related Products Unit Revenue:**  The average revenue
TriQuint receives for each Infineon reference design cellular phone into
which TriQuint sells parts in the year [***] (with [***] revenues counted at
[***]%).

  

 **4.7.2 Reconciliation of Purchase Price**.  With the final monthly report,
Purchaser or TriQuint shall deliver to Infineon the difference obtained by
subtracting EUR [***] from the Earnout Revenues (provided that if that
difference is less than zero, the difference shall be considered zero.) Upon
receipt of the final monthly report, if the Earnout Revenues are less than
EUR [***], then Infineon shall deliver to TriQuint the difference obtained by
subtracting the greater of the applicable minimum purchase price or the
Earnout Revenues, from EUR [***]. All amounts to be reconciled hereunder
shall be reconciled no later than [***], provided that if the calculation of
Earnout Revenues earned through [***] shows a net balance earned by Infineon
as of that date, that net balance will be paid as an interim payment on or
before [***], and credited against the amounts finally due under this
paragraph. If the total Earnout Revenues calculated under Section 4.7.1
exceeds EUR [***] as of the time of the interim payment, then to the extent
of that excess, TriQuint may at its option make the interim payment here
required through the methods and procedures of Section 4.7.4 (Option
to Deliver Earnout in shares.).

  

 **4.7.3 Audit Confirmation**.  Infineon shall have the right to request
audit of the Earnout Revenues. Such audit, if requested, shall be performed
by KPMG Peat Marwick, or other independent auditors mutually satisfactory to
both parties. Infineon shall be entitled to receive, as the results of that
audit, only the auditorÂ’s final figures for Earnout Revenues in each quarter.
Infineon shall pay for the cost of such audit procedures. However, if the
audit reveals TriQuint has under-reported the twelve month total of such
revenues, TriQuint shall pay the costs of the audit. The audit results shall
be final and binding on both parties.

  

 **4.7.4 Option to Deliver Earnout in Shares** _._ If the total Earnout
Revenues calculated under Section 4.7.1 exceeds EUR [***], then to the extent
of that excess, TriQuint may deliver the amounts due under Section 4.7.2
either in cash, or in equivalent value TriQuint stock, or in a mix of such
consideration, at TriQuintÂ’s option. For this purpose, the cash owed will
be converted to dollars and thence to TriQuint stock using prices in effect
on the last trading day ending on or before the third calendar day preceding
the delivery date (the Valuation Date). The TriQuint stock shall be valued
at the closing price of TriQuint common stock on the NASDAQ exchange on the
Valuation Date.  The Dollar shall be valued at the average of the closing
selling and buying exchange rates for the Valuation Date, as reported in the
Wall Street Journal on the following business day.  The Euro-denominated
value of a share of TriQuint stock thus determined shall be called the
"TriQuint Delivery Euro Value".

  

 **(a) Obligation to Register.**  TriQuint may further deliver stock in lieu
of cash only if TriQuint no later than [***] files a registration statement
covering those shares with the Securities and Exchange Commission, notifies
Infineon in writing that it has filed such registration statement, and
thereafter causes that registration statement to become effective.

  

 **(b) Right to re-tender if registration delayed.** If the registration
statement has not become effective within [***] days following the date on
which the shares were delivered, Infineon shall thereafter have the option,
up until the registration statement becomes effective, to tender the shares
back for payment of the required cash

  



  

17      
   



  

instead. If Infineon makes that tender, TriQuint shall promptly accept it,
and transmit instead the required cash to Infineon (which, as for the
original debt, is payable in Euros.)

  

 **(c) No Market Risk from Registration.**  If the registration statement
becomes effective after the [***], Infineon shall not have market risk for
the period between the [***] and the [***]. Instead, the TriQuint
Euro Delivery Value shall be recomputed as if the [***] were the [***], and
the resulting number of TriQuint shares compared.  If the new value would
require the delivery of more TriQuint shares, TriQuint shall make up the
difference in cash.  If the new value would require the delivery of fewer
TriQuint shares, Infineon shall return the balance.

  

 **(d) Fractional Shares.**  Any fractional share shall be rounded down to
the nearest whole share, and the difference paid in cash, and the applicable
value for the settlement date.

Schedule 6.11, to the knowledge of Sellers the Vanessa Assets constitute all
of the assets necessary for the conduct of the Vanessa Transferred Business
as heretofore conducted by Infineon and Infineon US. Except as identified on
Schedule 6.11, Infineon knows of no item of intellectual property not
licensed within the Vanessa Assets, that is held by Infineon or a third party

plans and forecasts for the Vanessa Transferred Business as previously
planned and forecast by Infineon.

Vanessa Assets or in general the Vanessa Transferred Business, subject to
SellersÂ’ ordinary and usual security provisions with respect to such
facilities as applicable to trusted third parties, and in any event the
Sellers shall cause Purchaser and TriQuint to be furnished with such
documents (or copies thereof) and information with respect to the affairs of
any of the Sellers with respect to the Vanessa Transferred Business and/or
the Vanessa Assets as may from time to time reasonably be requested by any of
them.

  

 **8.4 Preservation of Goodwill**.  During the period from the date of this
Agreement to the Effective Date, the Sellers shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to preserve intact their respective relationships with
customers, suppliers, governmental authorities and others having business
relations with them, and further to assist Purchaser and TriQuint to inherit
the good will of customers, suppliers, governmental authorities, and others
having business relations with them, with respect to the Vanessa Transferred
Business through reasonable cooperative communications and meetings designed
both accurately to communicate the intent of the Parties hereto with respect
to the continuation of the Vanessa Transferred Business, and to facilitate a
smooth transition of that business from Sellers to Purchaser and TriQuint.

  

 **8.5 Taxes**. The Sellers shall pay all sales taxes, transfer, value added,
and intangibles taxes and similar government charges applicable to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including without limitation all
taxes and similar charges, if any, payable upon the transfer of title to any
of the Vanessa Assets. Purchaser, TriQuint, and the Sellers will cooperate to
prepare and file with the proper public officials, as and to the extent
necessary, all appropriate sales tax exemption certificates or
similar instruments as may be necessary to avoid the imposition of sales,
transfer, value added and similar taxes on the transfer of Vanessa Assets
pursuant hereto.

  

 **8.6 Standstill**.  During the period from the date hereof and until the
Effective Date, except as permitted by TriQuint in writing, none of the
Sellers, nor any of their respective shareholders or affiliates, will sell,
transfer or otherwise dispose of any of the Vanessa Assets(except for
dispositions of assets in the ordinary course of business or as expressly
permitted elsewhere in this Agreement), and none of the Sellers, nor any of
their respective shareholders or affiliates, nor any of the respective agents
or representatives thereof, will respond to inquiries or proposals, or enter
into or pursue any discussions, or enter into any agreements (oral or
written), with respect to the sale, lease or other disposition of all or any
portion of the Vanessa Transferred Business or of any of the Vanessa Assets
to be transferred under this Agreement, other than with respect to normal
commercial transactions in the ordinary course of business or as expressly
permitted elsewhere in this Agreement.

  

 **8.7 Preservation of Records**.  The Sellers shall preserve all records
relating to the Vanessa Assets and the Vanessa Transferred Business that are
not transferred to Purchaser or TriQuint hereunder, or under any of the
Interim Agreements, in accordance with SellersÂ’ normal and standard records
retention policies for like portions of its business that it retains as a
going concern; shall make copies of retained records or portions thereof upon
reasonable advance request of Purchaser and/or TriQuint; and shall provide
TriQuint with a written summary of its records retention policies in effect
as of the time of close, which it shall update on request from TriQuint.

  

 **8.8 Business Communications Post Closing**.  After the Effective Date, the
Sellers shall promptly and accurately refer or as applicable forward all
inquiries, orders, payments, correspondence, and communications of any kind,
including without limitation electronic, voice, or paper, concerning any
aspect of the Vanessa Transferred Business that has been acquired by
Purchaser and/or TriQuint to such telephone numbers and addresses, and to
such personnel of Purchaser or TriQuint, as Purchaser or TriQuint from time
to time informs the Sellers. To the extent Purchaser or TriQuint receives
inquiries, orders, payments, correspondence, or communications of any kind
concerning any aspect of SellersÂ’ business not transferred to TriQuint or
Purchaser (whether because unrelated to the Vanessa

  



  

26      
   



  

Transferred Business or because relating to aspects of the Vanessa
Transferred Business retained by Sellers), Purchaser or TriQuint shall refer
or as applicable forward them promptly and accurately to such telephone
numbers and addresses, and to such personnel, of Sellers as Infineon from
time to time informs TriQuint. Seller personnel will provide reasonable
assistance by telephone consultation or other mutually convenient means to
assist with successful transition of the business to TriQuint and Purchaser.

  

 **8.9 Survival of Representations and Warranties**. Each representation,
warranty, indemnity, covenant and agreement of any of the parties hereto
shall survive the Effective Date; provided, however, that no party shall be
entitled to assert any claim against any other for misrepresentations or
breach of warranty under or pursuant to this Agreement unless the party
asserting such claim shall notify the other in writing of such claim within
one (1) year after the Effective Date. (Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no
event shall the Sellers on the one hand, or Purchaser or TriQuint on the
other hand, be liable for any consequential or punitive damages.)

  

 **8.10 Accounting Data for Compliance. **Infineon will support TriQuint with
such accounting data as may be necessary to permit TriQuint to comply with
reporting obligations to the Securities and Exchange Commission of the United
States concerning this Agreement and the transaction it contemplates,
promptly when needed to allow timely compliance by TriQuint.

  

 **8.11 Reserved.**

  

 **8.12 Hi Rel Determination. **The largest single contract under the Hi Rel
business relates to an agreement originally entered into between
SI Sicherungstechnik GmbH and Co. KG and Siemens Aktiengesellschaft
dated December, 1998, identified on Schedule 2.5.1 as a contract providing
for backlog from EADS Deutschland GmbH (the "Cobra Agreement). TriQuint will
buy the Hi Rel business, including the Cobra Agreement, as otherwise
contemplated by this Agreement, unless TriQuint determines, in good faith,
that neither it nor one of its Affiliates will be able to manufacture the
device described in the Cobra Agreement, and that it has been unable to reach
replacement terms with the customer under the Cobra Agreement that TriQuint,
in its sole discretion, is satisfied that it or its Affiliates will be able
to fulfill. These conditions apply to this contingency:

  

 **8.12.1 How and When TriQuint Signifies Satisfaction of Condition.**
TriQuint will signify satisfaction of the stated condition through delivery
of the Certificate identified in Section 5.4.3, as soon as it is able to do
so. TriQuintÂ’s right to deliver that certificate expires on September 30,
2002, U.S. Pacific time. TriQuint will in good faith inform Infineon as soon
as it knows whether it will be able to issue the certificate or not.

  

 **8.12.2 Interim Commitments.**  Between the date of this Agreement and
 the Effective Time, and thereafter if necessary until September 30, 2002,
the parties will work together to enable TriQuint to reach satisfaction. No
party shall be obligated by this commitment to spend additional resources or
commit additional funds (other than those incidental to travel or
communications fairly associated with a good faith attempt at resolution).

  

 **8.12.3 Effect if Certificate Not Delivered.**  If the Certificate
contemplated by Section 5.4.3 is not delivered on or before September 30,
2002, then as of the Effective Date, this Agreement will be deemed amended as
follows:

  

 **(a) Minimum Price Adjustment.**  The Minimum Price defined in Section
4.1.1 shall be EUR 42 million, instead of EUR 45 million.

  

 **(b) HiRel Assets Excluded.** **** TriQuint and Purchaser shall not acquire
any rights in the Products identified in Schedule 1.10, or in intellectual
property (whether Knowhow, Property Rights,  Software, or Materials,
or otherwise, and expressly but without limitation including test expertise)
under Section 2.3 that is related exclusively

  



  

27      
   



  

to the Hi Rel portion of the Vanessa Business (provided that the effect of
the Residuals clause at Section 2.3.7(b) shall not be affected.)

  

 **(c) HiRel Excluded from Vanessa Business.**  The term "Hi Rel Devices"
shall be excluded from Section 1.5 (including its subsections) and from the
definition of the Vanessa Licensed Business, and the reference to Schedule
1.10 shall be excluded from Sections 2.4.1(c) and 6.4.2.

  

 **(d) HiRel Ancillary Agreement Excluded.**  The Hi Rel Agreement attached
as Exhibit 2.6.1(f) shall not come into force, and shall be regarded as void.

  

 **(e) Infineon Retains Rights Necessary to Fulfill Hi Rel Obligations.** The
parties recognize that some of the Hi Rel products on Schedule
1.10 incorporate Galliumarsenide Devices, and so InfineonÂ’s ability to supply
such products to Customers requires special protection. Accordingly,
InfineonÂ’s activities in manufacturing the Hi Rel products listed on Schedule
1.10, and supplying them to customers, shall be excluded from the definition
of "Competitive Activities" under Section 1.5, and shall be treated as
outside the Vanessa Covenant Business for purposes of Section 2.3.7(a).
Further, if the Certificate is not delivered, TriQuint does hereby grant
Infineon a noncancellable, transferrable license, with rights to sublicense,
to the Property Rights, Software, Materials, and Knowhow to which title is
transferred under Section 2.3, to make, have made, use, and sell both the Hi
Rel Devices listed on Schedule 1.10, and also modifications of
the Galliumarsenide Device that is the subject of the Cobra Agreement as may
be required in fulfillment or extension of that agreement between Infineon
and its customer.

  

 **(f) Test Services.**  While Purchaser remains in the premises leased under
the lease attached as Exhibit 2.6.1(a), Purchaser will continue to supply
test services to Infineon for Hi Rel Products, at reasonable commercial
rates.

  

 **(g) Rules of Construction.**  To the extent application of the rules of
this Section 8.12.3 creates ambiguity or uncertainty in any Schedule or
Exhibit to this Agreement, or any annex, schedule, or exhibit to any
Ancillary Agreement, that ambiguity or uncertainty shall be resolved as
follows.  The governing interpretation shall be that which most fairly
captures the partiesÂ’ intent 1) to preserve InfineonÂ’s business in Hi Rel
Devices; 2) to permit Infineon to fulfill its obligations under the Cobra
Agreement as it exists on the signature date of this Agreement, and to engage
in follow up projects involving the same device or new designs based on the
same device, 3) to permit Infineon to fulfill its obligations to, and the
reasonable commercial expectations of, customers for Hi Rel products listed
on Schedule 1.10 that include Galliumarsenide Devices, and 4) to permit
Infineon to sell the Hi Rel Business to a third party, if TriQuint does not
acquire it.

  

 **9. Indemnification, Survival, Limitations**.

  

 **9.1 TriQuintÂ’s Indemnity**.  From and after the Effective Date, TriQuint
will save, indemnify and hold harmless the Sellers and SellersÂ’ officers,
directors, representatives, and employees from and against, and shall on
demand reimburse the Sellers and SellersÂ’ officers, directors,
representatives, and employees for damages suffered, by reason of any
misrepresentation or breach of warranty by Purchaser or TriQuint or non-
fulfillment of any covenant or agreement to be performed or complied with by
Purchaser or TriQuint under this Agreement (unless the performance of or
compliance with any such covenant or agreement has been expressly waived by
any of the Sellers in writing) or under any agreement, certificate, document
or instrument executed by Purchaser or TriQuint and delivered to the Sellers
pursuant to this Agreement. TriQuint shall further defend Sellers from, and
indemnify Sellers, and SellersÂ’ officers, directors, representatives, and
employees, for any and all actions, suits, proceedings, claims, demands,
assessments, judgments, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneysÂ’
fees, incident to any of the foregoing. Sellers and SellersÂ’ officers,
directors, representatives, and employees shall cooperate as

  



  

28      
   



  

reasonably required by TriQuint in such proceedings (at TriQuintÂ’s expense
for out of pocket costs.)

  

 **9.2 SellerÂ’s Indemnity**.  Subject to the limitations under Section 9.4
and 8.9 from and after the Effective Date, Infineon will save, indemnify and
hold harmless Purchaser and TriQuint and PurchaserÂ’s and TriQuintÂ’s officers,
directors, representatives, and employees from and against, and shall on
demand reimburse Purchaser and TriQuint and PurchaserÂ’s and TriQuintÂ’s
officers, directors, representatives, and employees for damages suffered by
reason of any misrepresentation, breach of warranty or nonfulfillment of any
covenant or agreement to be performed or complied with by any of the Sellers
under this Agreement (unless the performance of or compliance with any such
covenant or agreement has been expressly waived by TriQuint in writing) or
under any agreement, certificate, document or instrument executed by any of
the Sellers and delivered to Purchaser or TriQuint pursuant to
this Agreement. Sellers shall further defend Purchaser and TriQuint and
PurchaserÂ’s and TriQuintÂ’s officers, directors, representatives, and
employees from, and indemnify Purchaser and TriQuint and PurchaserÂ’s and
TriQuintÂ’s officers, directors, representatives, and employees for, any and
all actions, suits, proceedings, claims, demands, assessments, judgments,
costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneysÂ’ fees, incident to any of
the foregoing. Purchaser and TriQuint and PurchaserÂ’s and TriQuintÂ’s
officers, directors, representatives, and employees shall cooperate as
reasonably required by Sellers in such proceedings (at SellersÂ’ expense for
out of pocket costs.)

  

 **9.3 Indemnity Proceedings**.  If any action or proceeding covered by the
foregoing clauses is commenced by a third party against a party entitled to
indemnification under this Section 9 (an "Indemnitee"), the Indemnitee shall
give the Indemnitor(s) prompt written notice of such proceeding and copies of
all pleadings filed relating thereto within twenty (20) days after the
IndemniteeÂ’s receipt thereof.

  

 **9.3.1 Right to Defend**.  If the Indemnitor(s) shall, at its(their)
option, elect by prompt written notice to each Indemnitee to contest or
defend any such Covered Proceeding, the Indemnitor(s) shall, subject to the
provisions of this Section 9.3, be entitled, at its or their sole cost and
expense, to contest or defend the same with counsel of its or their own
choosing, but reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitee, and in such event
the Indemnitee shall not settle, compromise, pay or discharge the same
without the prior written consent of the Indemnitor(s) (which consent shall,
however, not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), so long as the
Indemnitor(s) is(are) actively contesting and defending the same in good
faith. In such a defense, Indemnitor may settle in its discretion on any
terms that do not require Indemnitee to pay money, do not require Indemnitee
to refrain from or perform any act, and secure for Indemnitee a full release.
Settlement on terms that do not meet those conditions requires the written
consent of the Indemnitee. If Indemnitor elects not to accept the tender of a
defense, then Indemnitee may defend, at IndemnitorÂ’s cost, provided that the
cost must be reasonable in light of the amounts at stake.

  

 **9.3.2 Waiver by Failure to Tender**.  Claims for indemnity with respect to
proceedings as to which defense is not timely tendered, are waived.
Tender shall be timely even if beyond the twenty days so long as the
Indemnitor(s) is (are) not prejudiced by any delay.

  

 **9.3.3 Special Provisions when Injunction is Sought**. If the proceeding
indemnified against does not seek only monetary damages, but seeks any
injunction or other equitable relief or specific performance against any
Indemnitee, then the Indemnitee shall be entitled to settle and discharge any
claim arising thereunder; provided that if the Indemnitee shall elect to
settle and discharge any such particular claim, the indemnity obligation of
the Indemnitor(s) with respect thereto shall be limited to that portion of
the liability arising from the election of the Indemnitee not to contest but
rather to settle and discharge the same (without the consent of the
Indemnitor(s)) which is reasonable after taking into account the substantive
merits of the position taken by the

  



  

29      
   



  

Indemnitor(s) in opposing such claim, as compared to the risks of litigation
or other opposition.

  

 **9.3.4 Participation Right**.  If the Indemnitor(s) elect(s) to defend a
Covered Proceeding, the Indemnitee shall be entitled to participate in the
defense thereof with its own separate counsel and receive copies of all
pleadings and other papers in connection therewith. In such event, the fees
and expenses of such IndemniteeÂ’s counsel shall, except as otherwise provided
in this Section 9, be borne by the Indemnitee, unless the
Indemnitee reasonably determines that it may have one or more defenses
available to it which are different from or in additional to those available
to the Indemnitor. In such event, the Indemnitor shall not have the right to
direct the defense of the claim, and the Indemnitor may do so at IndemniteeÂ’s
expense, provided that the expense must be reasonable in light of the amounts
involved.

  

 **9.4 Limitations**.  None of the parties shall be liable to any of the
other parties for breach of any warranty or representation or any other
provision of this Agreement, except as follows:

  

 **9.4.1 Sellers**. **** If one of the warranties, undertakings
and representations specified in this Agreement made by Sellers shall be
incorrect in whole or in part, TriQuint or Purchaser shall inform Infineon
immediately upon acquiring knowledge of this inaccuracy and demand that
Infineon restores the situation as if such representation, undertaking, or
warranty had not been violated. If within the period of eight weeks after
receipt of such a notification, Infineon fails to comply with this demand,
Infineon shall be liable for the damage incurred directly by the Purchaser as
a result of such a complete or partial inaccuracy or breach. Consequential or
indirect damages, such as loss of profit, shall not be compensated for
(provided that the parties recognize that loss of profit may be the proper
measure of direct damages for breach of the convenants covenants related to
non-competition, and Purchasers shall be entitled to remedies of specific
performance also with respect to those covenants.) There shall be no claim of
TriQuint or Purchaser for damages resulting under this Agreement except if
and to the extent that any individual claim exceeds EUR 50,000 (the
"Relevant Amount") and the aggregate amount of all Relevant Amounts exceeds
EUR 500,000 in which case Seller shall be liable for the aggregate of the
Relevant Amounts ("Freigrenze"). InfineonÂ’s liability for claims resulting
from this Agreement shall be restricted to a total of EUR 5,000,000 (in
words: five Million Euro), provided that TriQuint and Purchaser shall be
entitled, in addition to damages, to injunctive relief and/or specific
performance with respect to claims under Section 2.10 (noncompetition and
related covenants); Section 2.3 (related to intellectual property matters);
and sections of this Agreement calling for delivery of signatures or
documents related to the Vanessa Transferred Business. This limitation on
liability shall not apply to damages or remedies under each Ancillary
Agreement. All other or further claims on the part of TriQuint and/or
Purchaser not deriving from the representations and warranties and
commitments of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, irrespective of
the legal basis, are excluded (to the extent permissible by law). The
reversal of the contract by the Purchaser on whatever legal basis (other than
fundamental fraud) shall also be excluded.

  

 **9.4.2 InfineonÂ’s Exclusive Liability. **Infineon alone shall be liable
to TriQuint and/or Purchaser subject to the terms of this Section 9.4 for all
of TriQuintÂ’s or PurchaserÂ’s claims resulting from this Agreement, in
particular from Sections 6 and 8 even if the claims are based on the
infringement of warranties concerning circumstances within the sphere of
Infineon US.

  

 **9.4.3 TriQuintÂ’s Liability.** TriQuint shall be jointly and
severally liable for all of SellersÂ’ claims resulting from this Agreement
against Purchaser. If one of the warranties, undertakings and representations
specified in this Agreement made by TriQuint or Purchaser shall be incorrect
in whole or in part, Infineon shall inform TriQuint immediately upon
acquiring knowledge of this inaccuracy and demand that TriQuint restores the
situation as if such representation, undertaking, or warranty had not been

  



  

30      
   



  

violated. If within the period of eight weeks after receipt of such a
notification, TriQuint fails to comply with this demand, TriQuint shall be
liable for the damage incurred directly by Infineon or Infineon US as a
result of such a complete or partial inaccuracy or breach. Consequential or
indirect damages, such as loss of profit, shall not be compensated for. There
shall be no claim of Sellers under Section 7 except if and to the extent that
any individual claim exceeds EUR __ 50,000 (the "Relevant Amount") and the
aggregate amount of all Relevant Amounts exceeds EUR 500,000 in which case
TriQuint shall be liable for the aggregate of the Relevant Amounts
("Freigrenze"). TriQuintÂ’s liability for claims under this Agreement shall be
restricted to a total of unpaid amounts due as consideration hereunder, plus
EUR 5,000,000 (in words: five Million Euro), provided that TriQuint shall be
liable to the full extent of third party liabilities assumed, and provided
that Infineon shall be entitled, in addition to damages, to injunctive relief
and/or specific performance with respect to claims under Section 2.3 (related
to intellectual property matters). This limitation on liability shall not
apply to damages or remedies under each Ancillary Agreement. All other or
further claims on the part of Infineon not deriving from the representations
and warranties and commitments of this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements, irrespective of the legal basis, are excluded (to the extent
permissible by law). The reversal of the contract by the Purchaser
on whatever legal basis (other than fundamental fraud) shall also be
excluded.

  

 **9.4.4 In case of Intentional Acts.**  In case of fraud, or
misrepresentation known to the party making them, or intentional breach by
any party that is not cured promptly within ten days of Notice, then with
respect to that party and that event, to the full damages caused in addition
to the limits of the foregoing section.

  

 **9.4.5 Interim Agreements.** In case of breach of any Interim Agreement
that speaks as to recovery of damages, to the extent described in such
agreement.

  

 **10. Other Matters**.

  

 **10.1 Publicity**. Prior to the Effective Date, no publicity release or
similar public announcement concerning this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be issued by any party to this Agreement (or
its/their representatives) without prior consent to the form and substance
thereof by TriQuint (in the case of any proposed release or announcement by
or on behalf of any of the Sellers or any of them)or Infineon (in the case of
any proposed release or announcement by or on behalf of Purchaser or
TriQuint). Infineon will promptly review and will not unreasonably withhold
its consent to publication of a press release or public filing, if TriQuint
determines that such a release is necessary in order to comply with its legal
obligations.

  

 **10.2 Assignment**.  This agreement is not assignable by any party, without
the consent of both Infineon and TriQuint.

  

 **10.3 Controlling Law, Disputes Jurisdiction**.  This Agreement and each of
the Ancillary Agreements and any other agreements and instruments executed
and delivered pursuant hereto and thereto (except as they state otherwise)
shall be construed and enforced in accordance with the substantive laws of
the Federal Republic of Germany, without regard to principles of conflict of
laws, provided that the governing law with respect to the transfer of any
title will be the law applicable to the jurisdiction in which the asset
resides, and the law governing relationships with any employee will be the
law applicable to the jurisdiction within which that employee is principally
employed. Any dispute arising under or related to or in connection with this
Agreement or any of such other agreements and instruments (except as they
provide otherwise) shall be dealt with as follows:

  

 **10.3.1 Executive Conferencing**.  Either party may refer any dispute that
cannot be resolved by the managers directly involved to an Executive
Conference for resolution. If a dispute is referred to Executive Conference,
the referring party shall designate any manager senior to those whose day to
day responsibility is involved in the dispute (or the CEO if no other senior
manager can be designated); shall describe the dispute in terms sufficient to
inform the other party fairly of all matters involved therewith; and shall

  



  

31      
   



  

propose several alternate dates within one month to meet to resolve the
dispute. The other party shall likewise designate a manager senior to those
whose day to day responsibility is involved in the dispute (or the CEO if no
other senior manager can be designated), and shall select one of the offered
dates. On that date the designated managers shall meet in person, at a place
reasonably agreed by those managers. The designated managers shall have
full power to resolve the dispute, and shall meet alone, with such documents
as they wish, and each shall commit at least one full business day to the
process (more if the they both consent.) consent).  Each may be accompanied
by such additional people as they both may agree during such times as they
both may agree.

  

 **10.3.2 Arbitration**. If any dispute cannot be settled through executive
conferencing, such dispute, including any question regarding its existence,
validity or termination, shall be finally settled by arbitration under the
Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce, Paris
("Rules") by three arbitrators appointed in accordance with the said Rules.
Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, arbitration shall take place in
London, England, or as otherwise agreed by the parties. However, if Executive
Conferencing has been requested by one party, and the other has declined,
then subsequent arbitration on the matter that was the subject of
the Executive Conferencing request shall take place in the home jurisdiction
of the party that requested the Executive Conference.  Arbitration shall be
held in English.  Rules of discovery shall be as defined by the Rules, and
may be supplemented in the interests of fairness by the arbitrators. The
arbitrators shall have power to award remedies of specific performance or
injunctive relief as well as damages within the limits of this Agreement or
the applicable Ancillary Agreement. Each party agrees that service of
process, including demands for arbitration, may be made on such party through
the procedures set forth herein for Notice. The results of arbitration shall
be final and binding on the parties, and may be enforced in any court of
competent jurisdiction.

  

 **10.3.3 Legal Fees**. In any arbitration, the legal fees of the parties and
expenses of arbitration shall be borne by the prevailing party, in such
proportion as the arbitrator(s) find just and equitable.

  

 **10.4 Notices**. All notices shall be in writing and shall be deemed to
have been duly given when delivered personally, or when the transmission

receipt of notice sent by registered mail shows the notice has been accepted,
refused, or returned undeliverable. In each case, the notice must be sent to
the appropriate address or fax number listed below, or to such replacement

understanding of the parties hereto in respect of the subject matter hereof

 **10.9 Specific Performance**. The Sellers agree that the Vanessa Assets
include unique property that cannot be readily obtained on the open market

specifically to enforce the performance of the Sellers under this Agreement
without the necessity of posting any bond or other security, and the Sellers
hereby waive the defense in any such suit that TriQuint has an adequate
remedy at law and agree not to interpose any opposition, legal or otherwise,
as to the propriety of specific performance as a remedy.  The remedy of
specifically enforcing any or all of the provisions of this Agreement in
accordance with this Section 10.9 shall not be exclusive of any other rights
or remedies which TriQuint may have under this Agreement, at law in equity or
otherwise, all of which rights and remedies shall be cumulative.

means such agreement, document or instrument as amended or otherwise modified

only and are not intended to define or limit the contents of said Sections
and paragraphs.

 **10.11 Severability**.  If any clause of this Agreement is ruled void or
unenforceable, that provision shall be amended so as to conform as nearly as
possible to the purpose of the parties while preserving its enforceability.
If such amendment is not possible, that clause shall be severed, and the
remainder of the agreement shall remain in full force and effect.
