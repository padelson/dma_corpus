Schedule 6.6 hereto, to the best of the Sellers&#146; knowledge, all of the

are in full force and effect and there is not under any contract, agreement or
commitment included in the Vanessa Assets, any material default or event which,
after notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute such a default or
result in a right to accelerate or loss of any material rights. &#160;There have been no oral or written
modifications to the terms or provisions of any of such contracts, agreements
and commitments. Purchaser is aware of the fact that all contracts to be

Schedule 6.7 lists all pension, retirement, profit-sharing, deferred
compensation, bonus and incentive plans, all medical, vision, dental and other
health insurance or coverage plans and policies, all life insurance plans, all
other employee benefit plans and policies, all agreements governing employee
rights and obligations, all material commitments between Infineon and the
workers&#146; council (Betriebsrat) applicable to the Betriebsteil, and all
individual employment agreements (collectively, the Employee Benefits.)&#160;&#160; Schedule 6.7 separately lists those
Employee Benefits that, under the applicable transition agreement with the
Worker&#146;s Council (&#147;Betriebsvereinbarung&#148;), are dropped following close, in
exchange for a one time payment, as outlined in the Betriebsvereinbarung.&#160; Infineon has paid or will pay that one time
payment prior to or at closing. Infineon has paid down each transferred employee&#146;s
&#147;Zeitsaldenkonto&#148; to a maximum of 80 hours, or will pay it down to that level
latest four weeks after closing.&#160; The
Employee Benefits conform to, and the administration thereof is in compliance
with, all applicable laws and regulations.&#160;
Sellers have prepared and delivered to Purchaser copies of all documents
necessary for a complete understanding of and legal grounds for Employee
Benefits and the terms of the Betriebsvereinbarung (the definitive collection
of which is represented by folders delivered to Mr. Michael Brix, counsel for
TriQuint, on March 26, 2002).&#160; Nothing
about this Agreement, or the Ancillary Agreements, or the performance of them
in accordance with their terms, gives rise to special or extra liabilities for
TriQuint or Purchaser, under any of the Employee Benefits.&#160; By way of example but not limitation, there
are no bonuses or salary increases payable upon close, or rights of termination
with termination pay, or acceleration of any benefit, that will be triggered by
the signing, closing, or performance of this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements in accordance with their terms.</font></p>

that cannot be readily obtained on the open market and that TriQuint will be
irreparably injured if this Agreement is not specifically enforced.&#160; Therefore, TriQuint shall have the right specifically
to enforce the performance of the Sellers under this Agreement without the

the defense in any such suit that TriQuint has an adequate remedy at law and
agree not to interpose any opposition, legal or otherwise, as to the propriety
of specific performance as a remedy.&#160;
The remedy of specifically enforcing any or all of the provisions of
this Agreement in accordance with this Section 10.9 shall not be exclusive of
any other rights or remedies which TriQuint may have under this Agreement, at
law in equity or otherwise, all of which rights and remedies shall be
cumulative.</font></p>
