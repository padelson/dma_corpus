If, after the Effective Time, any such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses such right, such Dissenting Shares will thereupon be treated as if they had been converted into and have become exchangeable for, at the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, and the Surviving Corporation shall remain liable for payment of the Merger Consideration for such Shares. At the Effective Time, any holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the rights provided in Section 262 of the DGCL and as provided in the previous sentence.

(the &#147;Debt Commitment Letter&#148; and together with the Equity Commitment Letter, the &#147;</FONT><U><FONT face=serif>Financing Commitments</FONT></U><FONT face=serif>&#148;), pursuant to which, and subject to the terms and conditions thereof, certain lenders have committed to provide Parent or Merger Sub with loans in the amounts described therein, the proceeds of which may be used to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby (the &#147;Debt Financing&#148; and together with the equity financing pursuant to the Equity Commitment Letter, the &#147;</FONT><U><FONT face=serif>Financing</FONT></U><FONT face=serif>&#148;). Each of the Financing Commitments, in the form so delivered, is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent and Merger Sub and, to the knowledge of Parent, of the parties thereto. The Financing Commitments are in full force and effect and have not been withdrawn or terminated or otherwise amended or modified in any respect. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is in breach of any of the terms or conditions set forth therein and to the knowledge of Parent no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, could reasonably be expected to constitute a breach or failure to satisfy a condition precedent set forth therein. Parent or Merger Sub has paid any and all commitment or other fees required by the Financing Commitments that are due as of the date hereof, and will pay, after the date hereof, all such commitments and fees as they become due. The proceeds from the Financing constitute all of the financing required for the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and are sufficient for the satisfaction of all of Parent&#146;s and Merger Sub&#146;s obligations under this Agreement, including the payment of the Merger Consideration and the Option and Stock-Based Consideration (and any fees and expenses of or payable by Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation). The Financing Commitments contain all of the conditions precedent to the obligations of the parties thereunder to make the Financing available to Parent on the terms therein, and neither Parent nor Merger Sub has knowledge of facts or circumstances that would cause any conditions precedent to the Equity Commitment Letter or the Debt Commitment Letter not to be satisfied on a timely basis. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Debt Commitment Letters may be superseded at the option of Parent or Merger Sub after the date of this Agreement but prior to the Effective Time by the New Financing Commitments in accordance with Section 5.11. In such event, the term &#147;Financing Commitment&#148; as used herein shall be deemed to include the New Financing Commitments to the extent then in effect.</FONT></P>

In the event that Parent becomes aware of any event or circumstance that makes procurement of any portion of the Financing unlikely to occur in the manner or from the sources contemplated in the Financing Commitments, Parent shall promptly notify the Company and shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange as promptly as practicable any such portion from alternative sources (including through co-investment by one or more additional parties) with terms and conditions no less favorable from the standpoint of Parent and Merger Sub and no more adverse to the ability of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
