 Section 1.1 _The Merger_. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), at the Effective Time, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company, whereupon the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease, and the Company will continue its corporate existence under Delaware law as the surviving corporation in the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.

 

 Section 1.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at the offices of Debevoise and Plimpton LLP, 919 Third Avenue, New York, New York 10022 at 10:00 a.m., local time, on a date (the " _Closing Date_ ") which shall be the second Business Day after the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) of the conditions set forth in Article VI (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by actions to be taken at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions), or at such other place, date and time as the Company and Parent
may agree in writing.

 

 Section 1.3 _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, at the Closing, the Company will cause a certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") to be executed, acknowledged and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with Section 251 of the DGCL. The Merger will become effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such later date or time as may be agreed by the Company and Merger Sub in writing and specified in the Certificate of Merger in accordance with the DGCL (the effective time of the Merger being hereinafter referred to as the " _Effective Time_ ").

 Section 1.6 _Directors_. Subject to applicable Law, the directors of Merger Sub as of the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation and shall hold office until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, or their earlier death, resignation or removal.

    ARTICLE II

CONVERSION OF SHARES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

 

 Section 2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Merger Sub or the holders of any securities of the Company or Merger Sub:

 

 (a) _Conversion of Common Stock_. Each share of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of the Company outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (such shares, together, unless the context clearly otherwise requires, with the associated Rights, collectively, the "Common Stock", and each, a " _Share_ "), other than Shares to be cancelled pursuant to Section 2.1(b) and other than Dissenting Shares, shall be converted automatically 

  into and shall thereafter represent the right to receive $38.00 in cash (the "
_Merger_ _Consideration_ "). All Shares that have been converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in this Section 2.1
shall be automatically cancelled and shall cease to exist, and the holders of
certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented such
Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares other than
the right to receive the Merger Consideration and the right to receive any
then unpaid dividend or other distribution with respect to such Shares having
a record date before the Effective Time.

 

 (b) _Parent and Merger Sub-Owned Shares_. Each Share that is owned, directly or indirectly, by Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time or held by the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time (in each case, other than any such Shares held on behalf of third parties) (the " _Cancelled Shares_ ") shall by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange for such cancellation and retirement.

 

 (c) _Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock_. At the Effective Time and by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, all certificates representing the common stock of Merger Sub shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.

 

 (d) _Dissenters  Rights_. Any provision of this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, if required by the DGCL (but only to the extent required thereby), Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Cancelled Shares) and that are held by holders of such Shares who have not voted in favor of the adoption of this Agreement or consented thereto in writing and who are entitled to demand and who have properly exercised appraisal rights with respect thereto in accordance with, and who have complied with, Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") will not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, but instead holders of such Dissenting Shares will be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of such Section 262 unless and until any such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses its rights to appraisal and payment under the DGCL. If, after the Effective Time, any such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses such right, such Dissenting Shares will thereupon be treated as if they had been converted into and have become exchangeable for, at the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, and the Surviving Corporation shall remain liable for payment of the Merger Consideration for such Shares. At the Effective Time, any holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the rights provided in Section 262 of the DGCL and as provided in the previous sentence. The Company will give Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisals of Shares, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company relating to stockholders rights of appraisal and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all 

  negotiations and proceedings with respect to such notices and demands. The
Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent,
voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or
settle, or offer to agree to settle, any such demands.

 

 (e) _Adjustments_. If at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company, or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of capital stock, shall occur as a result of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock split) or subdivision or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend or stock distribution with a record date during such period (excluding, in each case, normal quarterly cash dividends), merger or other similar transaction, the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such change; provided that nothing herein shall be construed to permit the Company to take any action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

 

 Section 2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

 (a) _Paying Agent_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with a U.S. bank or trust company that shall be appointed by Parent, and approved in advance by the Company in writing (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld) to act as a paying agent hereunder (and pursuant to an agreement in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company) (the " _Paying Agent_ "), in trust for the benefit of holders of the Shares, the Company Stock Options and the Performance Shares, cash in U.S. dollars sufficient to pay (i) the aggregate Merger Consideration in exchange for all of the Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the Cancelled Shares), payable upon due surrender of the certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Shares (" _Certificates_ ") (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or non-certificated Shares represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") pursuant to the provisions of this Article II and (ii) the Option and Stock-Based Consideration payable pursuant to Section 2.3 (such cash referred to in subsections (a)(i) and (a)(ii) being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ").

 

      | (b) _Payment Procedures_. 
---|--- 

 

 (i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any event not later than the third Business Day following the Closing Date, the Paying Agent shall mail (x) to each holder of record of Shares whose Shares were converted into the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1, (A) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may mutually agree), and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration and (y) to each holder of a Company Stock Option or a Performance Share, a check in an amount due and payable to such holder pursuant to Section 2.3 hereof in respect of such Company Stock Option or Performance Share.

  (ii) Upon surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may customarily be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a check in an amount equal to the product of (x) the number of Shares represented by such holders properly surrendered Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares and (y) the Merger Consideration. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a check for any cash to be paid upon due surrender of the Certificate may be paid to such a transferee if the Certificate formerly representing such Shares is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid or are not applicable.

 

 (iii) Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable under this Agreement to any holder of Shares (including, for the avoidance of doubt, Restricted Shares) or holder of Company Stock Options or Performance Shares, such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of U.S. state or local Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent that amounts are so withheld or deducted and paid over to the applicable Governmental Entity, such withheld or deducted amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares or holder of the Company Stock Options or Performance Shares, in respect of which such deduction and withholding were made.

 

 (c) _Closing of Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or Parent for transfer, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for a check in the proper amount pursuant to this Article II.

 

 (d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains undistributed to the former holders of Shares for one year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Surviving Corporation upon demand, and any former holders of Shares who have not surrendered their Shares in accordance with this Section 2.2 shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, upon due surrender of their Shares.

 

 (e) _No Liability_. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, none of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

  (f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest all cash included in the Exchange Fund as reasonably directed by Parent; _provided_ , however, that any investment of such cash shall be limited to direct short-term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the U.S. government. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to the Surviving Corporation pursuant to Section 2.2(d) .

 

 (g) _Lost Certificates_. In the case of any Certificate that has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Paying Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate a check in the amount of the number of Shares represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate multiplied by the Merger Consideration.

 

 Section 2.3 _Treatment of Stock Options and Other Stock-Based Awards_.

 

 (a) Except as otherwise agreed in writing by Parent and the applicable holder thereof, each option to purchase Shares (collectively, the " _Company Stock Options_ ") granted under the employee and director stock plans of the Company (the " _Company Stock Plans_ "), whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will at the Effective Time be cancelled and the holder of such Company Stock Option will, in full settlement of such Company Stock Option, receive from the Surviving Corporation an amount (subject to any applicable withholding tax) in cash equal to the product of (x) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per Share of such Company Stock Option multiplied by (y) the total number of Shares subject to such Company Stock Option (the aggregate amount of such cash hereinafter referred to as the " _Option Consideration_ ").

 

 (b) Except as otherwise agreed in writing by Parent and the applicable holder thereof, immediately prior to the Effective Time, each award of restricted Common Stock granted under the Company Stock Plans (the " _Restricted Shares_ ") shall vest in full and be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.1(a) .

 

 (c) Except as otherwise agreed in writing by Parent and the applicable holder thereof, at the Effective Time, each performance share based on shares of Common Stock granted under the Company Stock Plans (the " _Performance Shares_ "), whether vested or unvested, which is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be deemed to be earned at the level set forth in the applicable Company Stock Plan and applicable award agreement, shall become fully vested and shall entitle the holder thereof to receive, at the Effective Time, an amount in cash equal to the Merger Consideration in respect of each Share earned with respect to the Performance Shares (subject to any applicable withholding taxes) (the aggregate amount of such cash, together with the Option Consideration, hereinafter referred to as the " _Option and_ _Stock-Based Consideration_ ").

 

 (d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will adopt such resolutions as may reasonably be required in its discretion to effectuate the actions contemplated by this Section 2.3.

  Section 2.4 _Further Actions_. The Company shall take or cause to be taken on or prior to December 31, 2006 any and all action reasonably necessary, including by amending the Company Stock Plans, to permit the exchange of Company Stock Options, Restricted Shares or Performance Shares for Parent equity awards pursuant to the agreements between Parent and the applicable holder of a Company Stock Option, Restricted Share or Performance Share referred to in Section 2.3, in each case to the extent consistent with such plans, agreements and applicable Law.

 Section 4.1 _Qualification, Organization, Subsidiaries, etc_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub is a legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of its respective jurisdiction of organization and has all requisite corporate or similar power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as presently conducted and is qualified to do business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation of its assets or properties or conduct of its business requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so organized, validly existing, qualified or in good standing, or to have such power or authority, would not, individually or in the aggregate, prevent or materially delay the Closing or prevent or materially delay or materially impair the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to satisfy the conditions precedent to the Merger, to obtain financing for the Merger or to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (a " _Parent Material Adverse Effect_ ").

None of the information provided by Parent or its Subsidiaries to be included in the Proxy Statement will, at the time it is filed with the SEC, or at the time it is first mailed to the stockholders of the Company or at the time of the Company Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

 

 Section 4.5 _Financing_. Attached as Annex I are true, accurate and complete copies, as of the date hereof, of (a) a fully executed equity commitment letter pursuant to which the Guarantor has committed to provide or cause to be provided the cash amounts set forth therein to provide equity financing to Parent and/or Merger Sub (the " _Equity Commitment_ _Letter_ "), and (b) a fully executed debt commitment letter and related term sheets Bank of America, N.A., Merrill Lynch Capital Corporation, General Electric Capital Corporation, Banc of America Securities LLC, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith Incorporated and GE Capital Markets, Inc.

The Financing Commitments contain all of the conditions precedent to the obligations of the parties thereunder to make the Financing available to Parent on the terms therein, and neither Parent nor Merger Sub has knowledge of facts or circumstances that would cause any conditions precedent to the Equity Commitment Letter or the Debt Commitment Letter not to be satisfied on a timely basis. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Debt Commitment Letters may be superseded at the option of Parent or Merger Sub after the date of this Agreement but prior to the Effective Time by the New Financing Commitments in accordance with Section 5.11. In such event, the term "Financing Commitment" as used herein shall be deemed to include the New Financing Commitments to the extent then in effect.

obligation of the Guarantor, enforceable in accordance with its terms.

Merger Sub has outstanding no option, warrant, right, or any other agreement pursuant to which any person other than Parent may acquire any equity security of Merger Sub. Merger Sub has not conducted any business prior to the date hereof and has, and prior to the Effective Time will have, no assets, liabilities or obligations of any nature other than those incident to its formation and pursuant to this Agreement and the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 Section 4.8 _No Vote of Parent Stockholders_. No vote of the stockholders of Parent or the holders of any other securities of Parent (equity or otherwise) is required by any applicable Law, the certificate of incorporation or by-laws or other equivalent organizational documents of Parent or the applicable rules of any exchange on which securities of Parent are traded, in order for Parent to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

Except for Merrill Lynch and Co., Inc. and Banc of America Securities LLC, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has employed any investment banker, broker or finder in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement who might be entitled to any fee or any commission in connection with or upon consummation of the Merger.

  written or oral, between Parent or Merger Sub or any of their affiliates, on
the one hand, and any member of the Companys management or the Board of

 (xiii) shall not make any capital expenditures having an aggregate value in excess of (i) with respect to the Companys fiscal year ending June 30, 2007, together with the amount of capital expenditures made by the Company through the date hereof, $42 million and (ii) with respect to the Companys fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2007, $10 million;

 (xvi) shall not waive, release, assign, settle or compromise any claim, action or proceeding, other than waivers, releases, assignments, settlements or compromises that involve only the payment of monetary damages not in excess of $500,000 in the aggregate (excluding amounts to be paid under existing insurance policies) or otherwise pay, discharge or satisfy any claims, liabilities or obligations in excess of such amount, in each case, other than in the ordinary course consistent with past practice;

 

 (xvii) shall not adopt a plan of complete or partial liquidation, dissolution, merger, consolidation, restructuring, recapitalization or other reorganization;

 (c) Parent agrees with the Company, on behalf of itself and its Subsidiaries and affiliates, that, between the date hereof and the Effective Time, Parent shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates to, take or agree to take any action (including entering into agreements with respect to any acquisitions, mergers, consolidations or business combinations) which would reasonably be expected to result in, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

 Section 5.2 _Access_.

 

 (a) Subject to compliance with applicable Laws, the Company shall (i) provide to Parent and to its officers, employees, accountants, consultants, legal counsel, financial advisors and agents and other representatives (collectively, " _Parent Representatives_ ") reasonable access during normal business hours, throughout the period prior to the earlier of the Effective Time and the Termination Date, to the Companys and its Subsidiaries properties, contracts, commitments, books and records and (ii) furnish to Parent and its Parent Representatives such financial and operating data and other information as such Parent Representatives may reasonably request (including, but not limited to, furnishing to Parent the financial results of the Company in advance of any filing by the Company with the SEC 

  containing such financial results) and (iii) instruct the employees, counsel,
financial advisors, auditors and other authorized representatives (other than
directors who are not employees) of the Company and its Subsidiaries to
cooperate reasonably with Parent in its investigation of the Company and its
Subsidiaries. The foregoing notwithstanding, the Company shall not be required
to afford such access if it would unreasonably disrupt the operations of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, would cause a violation of any agreement
to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, would cause a risk
of a loss of privilege or trade secret protection to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or would constitute a violation of any applicable Law, nor shall
Parent or any of its Parent Representatives be permitted to perform any onsite
procedure with respect to any property of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

 

 (b) Parent hereby agrees that all information provided to it or its Parent Representatives in connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby shall be deemed to be Evaluation Material, as such term is used in, and shall be treated in accordance with, the confidentiality agreement, dated as of October 11, 2006, between the Company and Parent (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "); provided, that Parent shall be entitled to share such Evaluation Material with prospective co-investors or limited partners of the members of Parent; provided further, however, that any prospective co-investors or limited partners of the members of Parent to whom Parent provides Evaluation Material shall, prior to receiving such Evaluation Material, agree in writing to be bound by the confidentiality provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement or shall execute their own confidentiality agreements in identical or substantially identical form with the Company.

 

 Section 5.3 _No Solicitation_.

 

 (a) Subject to the provisions of this Section 5.3 set forth below, the Company agrees that neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, and that it shall direct its and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives, including any investment banker, attorney or accountant retained by it or any of its Subsidiaries (" _Representative_ ") not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage (including by providing information) or facilitate any inquiries, proposals or offers with respect to, or the making or completion of, any Alternative Proposal, (ii) engage or participate in any negotiations regarding, or provide or cause to be provided any non-public information or data relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with, or have any discussions with any Person relating to, an actual or proposed Alternative Proposal, or otherwise knowingly encourage or facilitate any effort or attempt to make or implement an Alternative Proposal, (iii) approve, endorse or recommend, or propose publicly to approve, endorse or recommend, any Alternative Proposal, (iv) approve, endorse or recommend, or publicly announce an intention to approve, endorse or recommend, or enter into, any letter of intent, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement or other similar agreement relating to any Alternative Proposal, (v) amend, terminate, waive or fail to enforce, or grant any consent under, any confidentiality, standstill or similar agreement (provided, that the Company shall be permitted to waive any such agreement to permit the counterparty thereto to make a non-public offer or proposal to the Board of Directors (or Special Committee) of the Company with respect to an Alternative Proposal (except that references in the definition thereof to "20%" shall be deemed to be references to "50%" for purposes of this proviso)). Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the foregoing restrictions by any Subsidiary of the Company or 

  Representatives of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to
be a breach of this Section 5.3 by the Company.

 

 (b) The Company shall, shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, and shall direct each of its Representatives to, immediately cease any existing solicitations, discussions or negotiations with any Person (other than the parties hereto) that has made or indicated an intention to make an Alternative Proposal.

 

 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 5.3(a) or (b), the Company may, in response to an unsolicited Alternative Proposal which did not result from or arise in connection with a breach of Section 5.3(a) and which the Board of Directors of the Company (acting through its Special Committee) determines, in good faith, after consultation with its outside counsel and financial advisors, may reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal, (i) furnish non-public information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person making such Alternative Proposal and its Representatives pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement no less restrictive of and no more favorable to the other party than the Confidentiality Agreement; and (ii) participate in discussions or negotiations with such Person and its Representatives regarding such Alternative Proposal; _provided_ , however, (i) that Parent shall be entitled to promptly receive an executed copy of such confidentiality agreement and (ii) that the Company shall promptly provide or make available to Parent any material non-public information concerning the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is provided to the Person making such Alternative Proposal or its Representatives which was not previously provided or made available to Parent.

 

 (d) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall withdraw or modify the Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, or publicly propose to do so, or approve or recommend or publicly propose to approve or recommend, any Alternative Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, if, prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, the Board of Directors of the Company or the Special Committee determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that failure to so withdraw, qualify or modify its Recommendation would be inconsistent with the Board of Directors of the Companys or the Special Committees exercise of its fiduciary duties, the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee thereof may withdraw, qualify or modify its Recommendation (a " _Change of Recommendation_ "); _provided_ , however, that if such Change of Recommendation is the result of a Superior Proposal, the Company shall have first provided prior written notice to Parent that it is prepared to effect a Change of Recommendation in response to a Superior Proposal, which notice shall describe in reasonable detail and include any draft agreements pertaining to such Superior Proposal, and such Change of Recommendation can only be made if Parent has not made, within three Business Days of receipt of such notice, a proposal that the Board of Directors or any committee thereof determines is at least as favorable to the stockholders of the Company as such Superior Proposal.

 

 (e) The Company promptly (and in any event within 48 hours) shall advise Parent orally and in writing of (i) any Alternative Proposal or indication or inquiry with respect to or that would reasonably be expected to lead to any Alternative Proposal, (ii) any request for non-public information relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries, other than requests for 

  information not reasonably expected to be related to an Alternative Proposal,
and (iii) any inquiry or request for discussion or negotiation regarding an
Alternative Proposal, including in each case the identity of the person making
any such Alternative Proposal or indication or inquiry and the material terms
of any such Alternative Proposal or indication or inquiry (including copies of
any document or correspondence evidencing such Alternative Proposal or
inquiry). The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a reasonably
current basis of any material change to the terms of any such Alternative
Proposal or indication or inquiry.

 

 (f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or its Board of Directors (or the Special Committee) from disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, or from issuing a "stop, look and listen" statement pending disclosure of its position thereunder.

 

 (g) As used in this Agreement, "Alternative Proposal" shall mean (i) any inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person or group of Persons other than Parent or one of its Subsidiaries for a merger, reorganization, share exchange, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, dissolution, liquidation, or similar transaction involving the Company (or any Subsidiary or Subsidiaries of the Company whose business constitutes 20% or more of the net revenues, net income or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole), (ii) any proposal for the issuance by the Company of over 20% of its equity securities or (iii) any proposal or offer to acquire in any manner, directly or indirectly, over 20% of the equity securities or consolidated total assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, in each case other than the Merger.

 

 (h) As used in this Agreement, "Superior Proposal" shall mean any Alternative Proposal (i) on terms which the Board of Directors of the Company (or the Special Committee) determines in good faith, after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel and financial advisors, to be more favorable to the holders of Company Common Stock than the Merger, taking into account all the terms and conditions of such proposal and this Agreement and (ii) that the Board of Directors (or Special Committee) believes is reasonably capable of being completed, taking into account all financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects of such proposal; _provided_ , however, that for purposes of the definition of "Superior Proposal", the references to "20%" in the definitions of Alternative Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "50%".

 

 Section 5.4 _Filings; Other Actions_.

 

 (a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy Statement, which shall, subject to Section 5.3, include the Recommendation and shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond to any comments by the SEC staff in respect of the Proxy Statement. Parent and Merger Sub shall provide to the Company such information as the Company may reasonably request for inclusion in the Proxy Statement. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Companys stockholders as promptly as practicable after the Proxy Statement is cleared by the SEC. The Company shall as promptly as practicable notify Parent of the receipt of any oral or written comments from the SEC relating to the Proxy Statement. The Company shall cooperate and provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to 

  review and comment on the draft of the Proxy Statement (including each
amendment or supplement thereto). The Company shall provide Parent with copies
of all filings made and correspondence with the SEC with respect to the Proxy
Statement. If at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information should
be discovered by any party hereto which should be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to the Proxy Statement so that the Proxy Statement would not
include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the
party which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties
hereto and, to the extent required by applicable Law, an appropriate amendment
or supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed by the
Company with the SEC and disseminated by the Company to the stockholders of
the Company.

 

 (b) Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, the Company shall (i) take all action necessary in accordance with the DGCL and its certificate of incorporation and by-laws to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders as promptly as reasonably practicable following the mailing of the Proxy Statement for the purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval (such meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof, the " _Company Meeting_ "), and (ii) subject to a Change of Recommendation in accordance with Section 5.3(d), use all reasonable best efforts to solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the approval of this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Section 7.1 and subject to compliance with Section 7.3, the Company, regardless of whether the Board of Directors (whether or not acting through the Special Committee, if then in existence) has approved, endorsed or recommended an Alternative Proposal, or has withdrawn, modified or amended the Recommendation, will submit this Agreement to the stockholders of the Company at the Company Meeting for the purpose of adopting this Agreement.

 

 Section 5.5 _Employee Matters_.

 

 (a) From and after the Effective Time, the Company shall, and Parent shall cause the Company to, honor all Company Benefit Plans and compensation arrangements and agreements in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately before the Effective Time, provided that nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the amendment or termination of any such Company Benefit Plans, arrangements and agreements in accordance with their terms and applicable Law. For a period of twelve (12) months following the Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to each current and former employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries other than such employees covered by collective bargaining agreements (" _Company Employees_ ") compensation opportunities and benefits that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, to the compensation opportunities and benefits provided to Company Employees immediately before the Effective Time (excluding the value of equity based awards), it being understood that each element of compensation and benefits may be different from the individual elements of compensation and benefits provided to Company Employees prior to the Effective Time.

 

 (b) For all purposes (including purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and level of benefits) under the employee benefit plans of Parent and its Subsidiaries providing 

  benefits to any Company Employees after the Effective Time (the " _New Plans_
"), each Company Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service
with the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors before
the Effective Time, to the same extent as such Company Employee was entitled,
before the Effective Time, to credit for such service under any similar
Company employee benefit plan in which such Company Employee participated or
was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Effective Time, provided
that the foregoing shall not apply with respect to benefit accrual under any
defined benefit pension plan or retiree medical benefit plan to the extent
that its application would result in a duplication of benefits. In addition,
and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) each Company
Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting
time, in any and all New Plans, unless such employee would not have been
eligible to participate under comparable plans of the Company or its
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) for purposes of
each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits
to any Company Employee, Parent shall cause all pre-existing condition
exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for
such employee and his or her covered dependents, unless such conditions would
not have been waived under the comparable plans of the Company or its
Subsidiaries in which such employee participated immediately prior to the
Effective Time and Parent shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such
employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year
of the Company Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee participated
immediately before the consummation of the Merger (such plans, collectively,
the " _Old Plans_ ") ending on the date such employees participation in the
corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for
purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket
requirements applicable to such employee and his or her covered dependents for
the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with
such New Plan.

 

 (c) Parent hereby acknowledges that a "change of control" (or similar phrase) within the meaning of the Company Stock Plans (and award agreements thereunder) and the Company Benefit Plans, as applicable, including without limitation the change in control agreements, in each case listed on Section 5.5(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter will occur at or prior to the Effective Time, as applicable.

 

 (d) Nothing herein shall be deemed to be a guarantee of employment for any Employee, or to restrict the right of the Surviving Corporation to terminate any Employee. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.5, nothing contained herein, whether express or implied, (i) shall be treated as an amendment or other modification of any Company Benefit Plan, or (ii) shall limit the right of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries to amend, terminate or otherwise modify any Company Benefit Plan following the Closing Date. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in this Section 5.5 with respect to Employees are included for the sole benefit of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company, and that nothing herein, whether express or implied, shall create any third party beneficiary or other rights (i) in any other person, including, without limitation, any Employees, former Employees, any participant in any Company Benefit Plan, or any dependent or beneficiary thereof, or (ii) to continued employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation, or any of their respective affiliates or continued participation in any Company Benefit Plan.

  Section 5.6 _Efforts_.

 

 (a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties hereto shall, and the Company shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, use all reasonable best efforts to take promptly, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do promptly, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) the obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents, clearances, approvals, and expirations or terminations of waiting periods, including the Specified Approvals and the Parent Approvals, from Governmental Entities and the making of all necessary registrations and filings and the taking of all steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval, clearance or waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any Governmental Entity, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third parties, (iii) the defending of any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (iv) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments reasonably necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , however, that in no event shall the Company or any of its Subsidiaries be required to pay prior to the Effective Time any fee, penalty or other consideration to any third party for any consent or approval required for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any contract or agreement (other than _de minimis_ amounts or if Parent and Merger Sub have provided adequate assurance of repayment). Neither party shall take any action that is intended or would reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, result in any of the conditions to the Merger set forth in Article VI not being satisfied or the satisfaction of those conditions being materially delayed.

 

 (b) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided and without limiting the foregoing, the Company and Parent shall (i) promptly, but in no event later than fifteen (15) days after the date hereof, file any and all required Notification and Report Forms under the HSR Act with respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and thereafter make any other required submission under the HSR Act as promptly as reasonably practicable, and use reasonable best efforts to cause the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act, (ii) use reasonable best efforts to cooperate with each other in (x) determining whether any filings are required to be made with, or consents, permits, authorizations, waivers, clearances, approvals, and expirations or terminations of waiting periods are required to be obtained from, any third parties or Governmental Entities in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of, the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby and (y) timely making all such filings and timely seeking all such consents, permits, authorizations or approvals, (iii) supply to any Governmental Entity as promptly as practicable any additional information or documents that may be requested pursuant to any Law or by such Governmental Entity, and (iv) take, or cause to be taken, all other actions and do, or cause to be done, all other things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, including taking all such further action as may be necessary to resolve such objections, if any, as the United States Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice, state antitrust enforcement authorities or competition authorities of any 

  other nation or other jurisdiction or any other person may assert under any
Law with respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby,
and to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any Law that may be
asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger so as to enable
the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible (and in any event no later
than the End Date), including, without limitation, (x) proposing, negotiating,
committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order or
otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of any material assets or
businesses of Parent or its Subsidiaries or controlled affiliates or of the
Company or its Subsidiaries and (y) otherwise taking or committing to take any
actions that after the Closing Date would limit the freedom of Parent or its
Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporations) or controlled
affiliates freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain, one
or more of its or its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporations)
businesses, product lines or assets, in each case as may be required in order
to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction,
temporary restraining order or other order in any suit or proceeding which
would otherwise have the effect of preventing the Closing, materially delaying
the Closing or delaying the Closing beyond the End Date; provided that neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall become subject to, or consent or
agree to or otherwise take any action with respect to, any requirement,
condition, understanding, agreement or order of a Governmental Entity to sell,
to hold separate or otherwise dispose of, or to conduct, restrict, operate,
invest or otherwise change the assets or business of the Company or any of its
affiliates, unless such requirement, condition, understanding, agreement or
order is binding on the Company only in the event that the Closing occurs.

 

 (c) Subject to applicable legal limitations and the instructions of any Governmental Entity, the Company and Parent shall keep each other apprised of the status of matters relating to the completion of the transactions contemplated hereby, including to the extent permitted by Law promptly furnishing the other with copies of notices or other communications sent or received by the Company or Parent, as the case may be, or any of their respective Subsidiaries, to or from any third party and/or any Governmental Entity with respect to such transactions. The Company and Parent shall permit the other party to review in advance any proposed communication to any supervisory or Governmental Entity. Each of the Company and Parent agrees not to participate in any substantive meeting or discussion, either in person or by telephone, with any Governmental Entity in connection with the proposed transactions unless it consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent not prohibited by such Governmental Entity, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and participate.

 

 (d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties contained in this Section 5.6, if any administrative or judicial action or proceeding, including any proceeding by a private party, is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by this Agreement, each of the Company and Parent shall cooperate in all respects with each other and shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, nothing in this Section 5.6 shall limit a partys right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(b) or 7.1(c) so long as such party has, prior to such termination, complied with its obligations under this Section 5.6.

  (e) It is agreed that this Section 5.6 shall not govern the obligations of the parties with respect to obtaining the Financing, which obligations are set forth in Section 5.11.

 

 Section 5.7 _Takeover Statute_. If any "fair price," "moratorium," "control share acquisition" or other form of antitakeover statute or regulation shall become applicable to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby, each of the Company and Parent and the members of their respective Boards of Directors shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are reasonably necessary so that the transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or regulation on the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

 

 Section 5.8 _Public Announcements_. The Company and Parent will consult with and provide each other the opportunity to review and comment upon any press release or other public statement or comment prior to the issuance of such press release or other public statement or comment relating to this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated herein and shall not issue any such press release or other public statement or comment prior to such consultation except as may be required by applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities exchange. Parent and the Company agree to issue a joint press release announcing the execution of this Agreement.

 

 Section 5.9 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

 (a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses now existing in favor of the current or former directors, officers or employees, as the case may be, of the Company or its Subsidiaries as provided in their respective certificates of incorporation or by-laws or other organization documents or in any agreement shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect. For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect the exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions of the Companys and any Company Subsidiarys certificates of incorporation and by-laws or similar organization documents as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time or in any indemnification agreements of the Company or its Subsidiaries with any of their respective directors, officers or employees as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, and shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such provisions in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any individuals who at the Effective Time were current or former directors, officers or employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , however, that all rights to indemnification in respect of any Action pending or asserted or any claim made within such period shall continue until the disposition of such Action or resolution of such claim. From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor, in accordance with their respective terms, each of the covenants contained in this Section 5.9 without limit as to time.

 

 (b) From and after the Effective Time each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, indemnify and hold harmless (and advance funds in respect of each of the foregoing) each current and former director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each, together with such 

  persons heirs, executors or administrators, an " _Indemnified Party_ ")
against any costs or expenses (including advancing reasonable attorneys fees
and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit,
proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent
permitted by Law), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
amounts paid in settlement in connection with any actual or threatened claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative (an " _Action_ "), arising out of, relating to
or in connection with any action or omission occurring or alleged to have
occurred whether before or after the Effective Time (including acts or
omissions in connection with such persons serving as an officer, director or
other fiduciary in any entity if such service was at the request or for the
benefit of the Company); _provided_ , however, that neither Parent nor the
Surviving Corporation shall be liable for any settlement effected without
either Parents or the Surviving Corporations prior written consent (which
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of more than
one counsel (selected by a plurality of the applicable Indemnified Parties)
for all Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction with respect to any single
such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, unless the use of one
counsel for such Indemnified Parties would present such counsel with a
conflict of interest that would make such joint representation inappropriate.
It shall be a condition to the advancement of any amounts to be paid in
respect of legal and other fees and expenses that Parent or the Surviving
Corporation receive an undertaking by the Indemnified Party to repay such
legal and other fees and expenses paid in advance if it is ultimately
determined that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified under
applicable Law. In the event of any such Action, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall reasonably cooperate with the Indemnified Party in the
defense of any such Action.

 

 (c) For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, Parent shall either cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries or provide substitute policies or purchase or cause the Surviving Corporation to purchase, a "tail policy," in either case of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions that are not less advantageous in the aggregate than such policy with respect to matters arising on or before the Effective Time; _provided_ , however, that after the Effective Time, Parent shall not be required to pay with respect to such insurance policies in respect of any one policy year annual premiums in excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date hereof in respect of the coverage required to be obtained pursuant hereto, but in such case shall purchase as much coverage as reasonably practicable for such amount; and further provided that if the Surviving Corporation purchases a "tail policy" and the same coverage costs more than 500% of such last annual premium, the Surviving Corporation shall purchase the maximum amount of coverage that can be obtained for 500% of such last annual premium. At the Companys option, the Company may purchase prior to the Effective Time, a six-year prepaid "tail" policy on terms and conditions providing substantially equivalent benefits as the current policies of directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to matters arising on or before the Effective Time, covering without limitation the transactions contemplated hereby; provided that the cost of such tail policy shall not exceed 500% of the last annual premium paid in respect of the current coverage. If such tail prepaid policy has been obtained by the Company prior to the Effective 

  Time, Parent shall cause such policy to be maintained in full force and
effect, for its full term, and cause all obligations thereunder to be honored
by the Surviving Corporation.

 

 (d) Parent shall pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided in this Section 5.9.

 

 (e) The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in addition to, and not in limitation of, any other rights such Indemnified Party may have under the certificates of incorporation or by-laws or other organization documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation, any other indemnification arrangement, the DGCL or otherwise. The provisions of this Section 5.9 shall survive the consummation of the Merger and expressly are intended to benefit, and are enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties.

 

 (f) In the event Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in either such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.9.

 

 Section 5.10 _Control of Operations_. Without in any way limiting any partys rights or obligations under this Agreement, the parties understand and agree that nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the Companys operations prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its operations.

 

 Section 5.11 _Financing_.

 

 (a) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Financing Commitments, including using its reasonable best efforts (i) to negotiate definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and conditions contained in the Financing Commitments, (ii) to satisfy all conditions applicable to Parent in such definitive agreements, (iii) to comply with its obligations under the Financing Commitments, (iv) to enforce its rights under the Financing Commitments and (v) seeking such third party consents as may be reasonably required in connection with the Financing. Parent shall give the Company prompt notice upon becoming aware of any material breach by any party of the Financing Commitments or any termination of the Financing Commitments. Parent shall keep the Company informed on a prompt basis and in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing (including providing the Company with copies of all documents related to the Financing (other than ancillary agreements subject to confidentiality agreements)). In connection with its obligations under this Section 5.11, Parent shall be permitted to amend, modify or replace any portion of the Financing Commitments with new Financing Commitments, including through co-investment or by financing from one or more other additional parties (the " _New Financing Commitments_ "), provided that Parent shall not permit any amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any material provision or remedy under, the 

  Financing Commitments if such replacement (including through co-investment by
or financing from one or more other additional parties), amendment,
modification, waiver or remedy reduces the aggregate amount of the Financing
required to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby, adversely amends or expands the conditions to the drawdown of the
Financing in any respect that would make such conditions less likely to be
satisfied, that can reasonably be expected to delay the Closing or is adverse
to the interests of the Company in any other non _de minimis_ respect. In the
event that all conditions to the Financing Commitments (other than, in
connection with the Debt Financing, the availability or funding of any of the
Equity Financing) have been satisfied in Parents good faith judgment, Parent
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the lenders and the other
Persons providing such Financing to fund the Financing required to consummate
the Merger on the Closing Date. In the event that Parent becomes aware of any
event or circumstance that makes procurement of any portion of the Financing
unlikely to occur in the manner or from the sources contemplated in the
Financing Commitments, Parent shall promptly notify the Company and shall use
its reasonable best efforts to arrange as promptly as practicable any such
portion from alternative sources (including through co-investment by one or
more additional parties) with terms and conditions no less favorable from the
standpoint of Parent and Merger Sub and no more adverse to the ability of
Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that their respective
obligations to consummate the Agreement are not conditioned or contingent upon
receipt of the Financing.

 

 (b) The Company will and will cause its Subsidiaries to and will use reasonable efforts to cause each of its and their respective Representatives, including legal and accounting, to provide all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the Financing and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (provided that such requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries), including (i) providing to the parties providing the Financing all financial statements and other information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries that are customarily required for financings similar to the Debt Financing and using reasonable best efforts to provide such other financial information as Parent shall reasonably request in order to consummate the Debt Financing, (ii) participating in a reasonable number of meetings, drafting sessions and due diligence sessions in connection with the Financing, (iii) assisting in the preparation of (A) one or more offering documents or confidential information memoranda for any of the Debt Financing (including the execution and delivery of one or more customary representation letters in connection therewith); provided that any such memoranda and similar documents need not be issued by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; provided, further, that any such memoranda shall contain disclosure and financial statements with respect to the Company or the Surviving Corporation reflecting the Surviving Corporation and/or its Subsidiaries as the obligor and (B) materials for rating agency presentations, (iv) reasonably cooperating with the marketing efforts for any of the Debt Financing, including providing assistance in the preparation for, and participating in, meetings, due diligence sessions and similar presentations to and with, among others, prospective lenders, investors and rating agencies, and (v) executing and delivering (or using reasonable best efforts to obtain from advisors), and causing its Subsidiaries to execute and deliver (or use reasonable best efforts to obtain from advisors) or obtain from advisors, customary certificates (including a certificate of the chief financial officer of the Company with respect to solvency matters), accounting comfort letters, legal opinions (which may be reasoned if circumstances require), surveys, title insurance 

  or other documents and instruments relating to guarantees, the pledge of
collateral and other matters ancillary to the Financing as may be reasonably
requested by Parent in connection with the Financing and otherwise reasonably
facilitating the pledge of collateral and providing of guarantees contemplated
by the Debt Commitment Letter; _provided_ , however, that no obligation of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries under any such certificate, document or
instrument (other than the representation letter referred to above) shall be
effective until the Effective Time. The foregoing notwithstanding, (x) no pre-
Closing director shall be required to take any action with respect to the
foregoing and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be
obligated to take any action that requires action or approval by the pre-
Closing directors, (y) no obligation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or Representatives under any agreement, certificate, document or instrument
shall be effective until the Effective Time, and (z) none of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or Representatives shall be required to pay any
commitment or other similar fee or incur any other cost or expense that is not
simultaneously reimbursed by Parent in connection with the Debt Financing
prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall upon request by the Company
reimburse the Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by the
Company or its Subsidiaries in connection with such cooperation and shall
indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives for and against any and all losses suffered or incurred by
them in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing and any
information utilized in connection therewith (other than information provided
by the Company or its Subsidiaries) (such costs and losses, the " _Company
Financing Expenses_ "), _provided_ , that Parents obligation to pay such
Company Financing Expenses after the termination of this Agreement shall be
subject to the limitations set forth in the last sentence of Section 7.3(e) .
Any other provision hereof notwithstanding, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries, Affiliates or Representatives shall be required to incur any
cost, fee, expense or liability in excess of $250,000 in the aggregate for all
such Persons for all such costs, fees, expenses or liabilities in connection
with Section 5.11, except to the extent the Cap of the Guarantee is increased
in respect of such additional amounts. All non-public or otherwise
confidential information regarding the Company obtained by Parent, Merger Sub
or their Representatives pursuant to this Section 5.11 shall be kept
confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

 Section 5.12 _Stockholder Litigation_. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate, subject to a customary joint defense agreement, in, but not control, the defense or settlement of any stockholder litigation against the Company or its directors or officers relating to the Merger or any other transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ , however, that no such settlement shall be agreed to without Parents consent. In the event that (i) a proposed settlement of any stockholder litigation (of which Parent has been advised and kept informed in accordance with the terms of this Section 5.12) would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect, (ii) Parent does not consent to such proposed settlement and (iii) the ultimate resolution of such litigation is less favorable to the Company and its Subsidiaries than such proposed settlement, then such resolution and the effects thereof on the Company and its Subsidiaries (to the extent so less favorable) shall not constitute, or be considered in determining the existence or occurrence of, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

 Section 5.13 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (i) any notice or other communication received by such party from any Governmental Entity in connection with the 

  Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby or from any person
alleging that the consent of such person is or may be required in connection
with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby, if the subject
matter of such communication or the failure of such party to obtain such
consent could be material to the Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent,
(ii) any actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or,
to such partys knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or
otherwise affecting such party or any of its Subsidiaries which relate to the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) the discovery of
any fact or circumstance that, or the occurrence or non-occurrence of any
event the occurrence or non-occurrence of which, would cause or result in any
of the Conditions to the Merger set forth in Article VI not being satisfied or
satisfaction of those conditions being materially delayed in violation of any
provision of this Agreement; _provided_ , however, that the delivery of any
notice pursuant to this Section 5.13 shall not (x) cure any breach of, or non-
compliance with, any other provision of this Agreement or (y) limit the
remedies available to the party receiving such notice. The Company shall
notify Parent, on a reasonably current basis, of any events or changes with
respect to any material regulatory or other investigation or action involving
the Company or any of its affiliates by any Governmental Entity, and shall
reasonably cooperate with Parent or its affiliates in efforts to mitigate any
adverse consequences to Parent or its affiliates which may arise (including by
coordinating and providing assistance in meeting with regulators). The parties
agree and acknowledge that, except with respect to clause (iii) of the first
sentence of this Section 5.13, the Companys compliance or failure of
compliance with this Section 5.13 shall not be taken into account for purposes
of determining whether the condition referred to in Section 6.3(b) shall have
been satisfied.

 

 Section 5.14 _Private Placement Notes_. At the written request of Parent, the Company shall, to the extent permitted by the terms thereof, take all actions reasonably requested by Parent that are necessary or advisable, including the delivery of all such notices, certificates and other documents pursuant to each note purchase agreement and each other agreement governing the respective Private Placement Notes, to repay all of the Private Placement Notes outstanding on the Closing Date in accordance with the applicable provisions of such agreements; provided that the Company shall not be required to provide any irrevocable notice or take any other irrevocable act regarding such repurchase unless (i) such action is taken simultaneously with the Merger being consummated and (ii) prior to the Companys being required to take any of the actions described in this proviso, Parent shall have, or shall have caused to be, deposited with the trustee, or other appropriate recipient of such funds, under the applicable agreement governing the Private Placement Notes, sufficient funds to effect such repayment. The repayment of such Private Placement Notes shall not be required to be effective prior to the Effective Time and shall be expressly conditioned on the occurrence of the Effective Time. Parent hereby covenants and agrees to provide (or to cause to be provided) immediately available funds for the full payment at the Effective Time of all Private Placement Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn. The Company shall provide Parent with a reasonable period of time to review and comment on all notices, certificates and other documents to be delivered to holders of any of the Private Placement Notes (each of which notice, certificate and document shall be delivered contemporaneously to Parent) and each such notice, certificate and document shall be subject to the prior written approval of Parent. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Company shall have no obligation under any such notice, certificate or other document until the Effective Time, and Parent shall upon request by the Company promptly reimburse the Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company in 

  connection with the repayment of the Private Placement Notes and shall
indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its Representatives for and
against any and all losses suffered or incurred by them, or to which any of
the Company or its Representatives may become subject, arising out of or in
any way in connection with the repayment or any actions taken, or not taken,
by the Company or its Representatives pursuant to this Section 5.14 (such
costs and losses, the "Company Note Repurchase Expenses"), provided, that
Parents obligation to pay such Company Note Repurchase Expenses after the
termination of this Agreement shall be subject to the limitations set forth in
the last sentence of Section 7.3(e) . Any other provision hereof
notwithstanding, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be
required to incur any cost, fee, expense or liabilities in excess of $250,000
in the aggregate for all such Persons for all such costs, fees, expenses or
liabilities in connection with this Section 5.14, except to the extent the Cap
of the Guarantee is increased in respect of such additional amounts. The
parties agree and acknowledge that the Companys compliance or failure of
compliance with this Section 5.14 shall not be taken into account for purposes
of determining whether the condition referred to in Section 6.3(b) shall have
been satisfied. The Company shall be deemed to have satisfied each of its
obligations set forth in this Section 5.14 if the Company shall have used its
reasonable best efforts to comply with such obligations, regardless of the
actual outcome of any actions in respect of the Private Placement Notes.

      ARTICLE VII 
  
 TERMINATION 
---

 (e) by the Company, if Parent shall have breached or failed to perform any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i) would result in a failure of a condition set forth in Section 6.1 or 6.2 or failure of the Closing to occur and (ii) cannot be cured by the End Date, provided that the Company shall have given Parent written notice, delivered at least thirty (30) days prior to such termination, stating the Companys intention to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(e) and the basis for such termination;

 

 (f) by Parent, if the Company shall have breached or failed to perform any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i) would result in a failure of a condition set forth in Section 6.1 or 6.3 or failure of the Closing to occur and (ii) cannot be cured by the End Date, provided that Parent shall have given the Company written notice, delivered at least thirty (30) days prior to such termination, stating Parents intention to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(f) and the basis for such termination;

  (g) by the Company in order to enter into a transaction that is a Superior Proposal, if, prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, (A) the Board of Directors of the Company (or the Special Committee) has received a Superior Proposal, (B) the Company has notified Parent in writing of its intention to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(g) and included with such notice the most current written agreement relating to the transaction that constitutes such Superior Proposal, (C) at least 5 Business Days following receipt by Parent of the notice referred to in clause (B) above, and taking into account any revised proposal made by Parent since receipt of the notice referred to in clause (B) above, the Board of Directors (or the Special Committee) shall have determined that such revised proposal is not at least as favorable to the stockholders of the Company as such Superior Proposal, and (D) prior to or concurrently with such termination, the Company pays the fee due under Section 7.3;

 Section 7.3 _Termination Fees_.

 

 (a) In the event that:

 

 (i) (A) after the date of this Agreement, any Alternative Proposal (substituting 40% for the 25% threshold set forth in the definition of " _Alternative Proposal_ ") (a " _Qualifying Transaction_ ") is publicly proposed or publicly disclosed, (B) this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(d) (so long as a proposal regarding a Qualifying Transaction remains outstanding at the time of the Company Meeting), 7.1(f) (so 

  long as a proposal regarding a Qualifying Transaction remains outstanding at
the time of the breach giving rise to the termination), and (C) the Company
enters into a definitive agreement with respect to, or consummates, a
transaction contemplated by any proposal regarding a Qualifying Transaction
within twelve (12) months of the date this Agreement is terminated;

 

 (ii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(g); or

 

 (iii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(i) .

 

then in any such event under clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of this Section 7.3(a),
the Company shall pay to TC Group IV, L.L.C. a termination fee of $29.0
million in cash (the " _Termination Fee_ "), it being understood that in no
event shall the Company be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than
one occasion.

 

 In the event that a proposal regarding a Qualifying Transaction shall have been made known to the public or shall have been made directly to its stockholders generally or any person shall have publicly announced an intention (whether or not conditional or withdrawn) to make a proposal regarding a Qualifying Transaction that reasonably appears to be bona fide and thereafter this Agreement is terminated by the Company or Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(d) and no Termination Fee is yet payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 7.3(a)(i), then the Company shall pay to Parent all of the Expenses (as hereinafter defined) of Parent and Merger Sub and thereafter if the Company becomes obligated to pay to Parent the Termination Fee pursuant to Section 7.3(a)(i) such payment obligation shall be reduced by the amount of Expenses previously actually paid to Parent pursuant to this sentence. As used herein, "Expenses" shall mean all reasonable out-of-pocket documented fees and expenses (including all fees and expenses of counsel, accountants, consultants, financial advisors and investment bankers of Parent and its Affiliates), incurred by Parent or Merger Sub or on their behalf in connection with or related to the authorization, preparation, negotiation, execution and performance of this Agreement and the Financing and all other matters related to the Merger; provided that such fees and expenses shall not in any case exceed $10 million in the aggregate.

 

 (b) Any provision in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event that (i) the Company shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(e) and at the time of such termination there is no state of facts or circumstances that would reasonably be expected to cause the conditions set forth in Section 6.1(a), 6.1(b), Section 6.3(a), Section 6.3(b) and Section 6.3(d) not to be satisfied on the End Date assuming the Closing were to be scheduled on the End Date, (ii) the Company shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(h), or (iii) Parent or the Company shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(b) and, at the time of such termination, the conditions set forth in Section 6.1, Section 6.3(a), Section 6.3(b) and Section 6.3(d) have been satisfied, then in any such case Parent shall pay to the Company a fee of $35 million in cash (the " _Parent Termination Fee_ "), it being understood that in no event shall Parent be required to pay the Parent Termination Fee on more than one occasion. The Parent Termination Fee shall be paid to the Company concurrent with termination of this Agreement by Parent or not later than two (2) Business Days following termination of this Agreement by the Company, as the case may be.

  (c) Any payment required to be made pursuant to clause (i) of Section 7.3(a) shall be made to Parent promptly following the earlier of the execution of a definitive agreement with respect to, or the consummation of, any Qualifying Transaction (and in any event not later than two Business Days after delivery to the Company of notice of demand for payment); any payment required to be made pursuant to clause (ii) of Section 7.3(a) shall be made to Parent concurrently with, and as a condition to the effectiveness of, the termination of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(g); any payment required to be made pursuant to clause (iii) of Section 7.3(a) shall be made promptly following termination of this Agreement by Parent (and in any event not later than two Business Days after delivery to the Company of notice of demand for payment); and any such payment shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account to be designated by Parent. In circumstances in which Expenses are payable, such payment shall be made to Parent not later than two Business Days after delivery to the Company of an itemization setting forth in reasonable detail all Expenses (which itemization may be supplemented and updated from time to time by Parent until the 60th day after Parent delivers such notice of demand for payment), and all such payments shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account to be designated by Parent.

 

 (d) In the event that the Company shall fail to pay the Termination Fee and/or Expenses, or Parent shall fail to pay the Parent Termination Fee, required pursuant to this Section 7.3 when due, such fee and/or Expenses, as the case may be, shall accrue interest for the period commencing on the date such fee and/or Expenses, as the case may be, became past due, at a rate equal to the rate of interest publicly announced by Citibank, in the City of New York from time to time during such period, as such banks Prime Lending Rate. In addition, if either party shall fail to pay such fee and/or Expenses, as the case may be, when due, the such owing party shall also pay to the owed party all of the owed partys costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) in connection with efforts to collect such fee and/or Expenses, as the case may be. Parent and the Company acknowledges that the fees, Expense reimbursement and the other provisions of this Section 7.3 are an integral part of the Merger and that, without these agreements, Parent and the Company would not enter into this Agreement.

 

 (e) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 7.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that neither the Termination Fee nor the Parent Termination Fee is a penalty, but rather is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent and Merger Sub or the Company, as the case may be, for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Companys right to receive payment of the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to this Section 7.3 or the guarantee thereof pursuant to the Guarantee and to require that Parent, Merger Sub and the Guarantor perform their respective obligations under (i) Section 7.3 and the Guarantee in accordance with their terms, (ii) to pay the Company Financing Expenses and (iii) to pay the Company Note Repayment Expenses shall be the exclusive remedy of the Company against Parent, Merger Sub, the Guarantor or any of their respective stockholders, partners, members, directors, Affiliates, officers or agents for (x) the loss suffered as a result of any failure of the Merger to be consummated and (y) any other losses, damages, obligations or liabilities suffered as a result of or under this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, and 

  none of Parent, Merger Sub or the Guarantor, or any of their respective
stockholders, partners, members, directors, officers or agents, as the case
may be, shall have any liability or obligation relating to or arising out of
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby other than any such
liability in respect of the Parent Termination Fee and the Guarantee,
_provided_ , however, that Parent shall be obligated with respect to Sections
5.2(b) and the last sentence of Section 5.11(b); and _provided further,_
however, that Parent, Merger Sub and Guarantor shall be relieved of any
liability for the Company Financing Expenses and the Company Note Repayment
Expenses in the event the Merger Agreement is terminated in a circumstance in
which the Termination Fee is payable or would become payable upon the
occurrence of the event referred to Section 7.3(a)(i)(C) .
