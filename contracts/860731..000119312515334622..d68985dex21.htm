(b) Payment of Closing Merger Consideration.

 

(i) _Schedule 3.2(b)_ sets forth the allocation by NWS of the Total Merger
Consideration (including the Total Cash Consideration and the Total Stock
Consideration) and the Closing Merger Consideration (including the Closing

otherwise allocable to such Shareholder shall instead be allocated to the
Shareholders who are "accredited investors" _pro rata_ based on the total
number of shares of NWS Common Stock held by the "accredited investor"
Shareholders), no later than five Business Days prior to the Closing Date NWS
shall deliver to the Tyler Entities an updated _Schedule 3.2(b)_ reflecting

with the duly executed stock power, be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the amount of cash from the Closing Cash Consideration and the amount
of shares of Tyler Common Stock from the Closing Stock Consideration as set
forth for such Shareholder on  _Schedule 3.2(b)_. Each Stock Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. Until surrendered as contemplated by
this _Section 3.2(c)_, each such Stock Certificate shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon
such surrender the Per Share Merger Consideration that the holder thereof has
the right to receive in respect of such Stock Certificate pursuant to this
_ARTICLE III_. The Principal Shareholder agrees promptly to cure and the
Shareholders Representative shall use his best efforts to cause each other

(e) _No Further Ownership Rights in NWS Common Stock_. The Closing Merger
Consideration paid or issued upon the surrender of Stock Certificates in
accordance with the terms of this _ARTICLE III_ , subject to the
indemnification provisions set forth herein, the post-Closing adjustment
provisions set forth in _Section 3.4_ and to the rights of the Shareholders

stolen, or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Stock Certificate to be lost, stolen, or destroyed, the
Surviving Company shall deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen, or
destroyed Stock Certificate the Closing Merger Consideration with respect to
the number of shares of NWS Common Stock evidenced thereby as set forth on
_Schedule 3.2(b)_ for such Shareholder.

 

(g) _Adjustments_. Without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement, if
at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the

change.

 

(h) _Withholding_. As set forth on, and only as set forth on, _Schedule
3.2(b)_ there shall be deducted and withheld from the consideration otherwise

such amounts of Taxes as are required to be deducted and withheld with respect
to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of state,
local, or foreign Tax Law. Tyler or the Surviving Company, as applicable,
shall promptly pay over, or cause to be promptly paid over, to the appropriate
Governmental Authority responsible for Taxes all such Taxes and promptly
provide evidence of such payment to the Shareholders Representative. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate
Governmental Authority responsible for Taxes by Tyler or the Surviving
Company, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of NWS Common Stock,
in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Tyler or the
Surviving Company, as applicable. In no event shall Tyler or the Surviving
Company withhold under FIRPTA, provided that NWS delivers the FIRPTA Statement
as provided in _Section 8.11_. The Parties agree to cooperate to minimize the
amount of any withholding pursuant to this  _Section 3.2(h)_.

 



-8- 3.3 _Escrow Account_. At the Closing, Tyler shall pay and deliver the Escrow
Amount to the Escrow Agent (a) with respect to the cash portion of the Escrow

substance reasonably satisfactory to the Escrow Agent and the Shareholders
Representative, directing that certificates evidencing 106,810 shares of Tyler
Common Stock (the " _Escrowed Shares_ ") be delivered to the Escrow Agent, in
each case in accordance with the Escrow Agreement. _Schedule 3.2(b)_ sets
forth the allocation of the Escrowed Cash and the Escrowed Shares among the
Shareholders based upon the allocation of Total Cash Consideration and Total
Stock Consideration, respectively, among them. Promptly following the
execution of this Agreement, Tyler and the Shareholders Representative agree
to negotiate in good faith the form and substance of the Escrow Agreement,
which shall be in accordance with this Agreement and otherwise reasonably
satisfactory to each of Tyler and the Shareholders Representative. The Escrow
Amount shall be held and distributed in accordance with the terms of the
Escrow Agreement to satisfy (i) any post-Closing adjustments to the Total
Merger Consideration in favor of Tyler pursuant to _Section 3.4(e)_ in excess
of the Working Capital Holdback, and (ii) any and all indemnification
obligations of the Principal Shareholder and the Shareholders Representative
pursuant to _ARTICLE VIII_ and _ARTICLE XI_ , subject to the limitations set
forth in this Agreement. The fees of the Escrow Agent shall be shared equally
(50%/50%) by the Shareholders and Tyler.

 

3.4 _Post-Closing Total Merger Consideration Adjustment_.

 

(a) Not later than three Business Days prior to the Closing Date, NWS shall
prepare and deliver to Tyler a good faith estimate of the Closing Balance
Sheet (the " _Estimated Closing Balance Sheet_ "), including a calculation of
estimated Closing Working Capital (the " _Estimated Closing Working Capital_
") and the resulting Closing Cash Consideration (the " _Estimated Closing
Statement_ "). Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
Principal Shareholder may cause NWS to make cash distributions to the
Shareholders prior to the Closing, but only to the extent the Principal
Shareholder reasonably believes that the Closing Working Capital will be equal
to or greater than zero.

(b) As promptly as practicable, but in no event later than 90 days after the
Closing Date, Tyler shall in good faith prepare and deliver to the
Shareholders Representative an unaudited balance sheet of NWS as of the close
of business on the Closing Date (the " _Closing Balance Sheet_ "), and set
forth Tylers calculation of the Closing Working Capital, in each case
prepared in accordance with GAAP (provided that the Closing Balance Sheet need
not contain footnote disclosures) and the Accounting Guidelines. Tyler shall
permit the Shareholders Representative and his Representatives to have full
access to the books, records, and other documents of NWS or the Surviving
Company, as applicable, necessary for the Shareholders Representative and
his Representatives to review Tylers preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet
and Tylers calculation of the Closing Working Capital.

 

(c) If the Shareholders Representative disagrees with any part of Tylers
calculation of the Closing Working Capital, the Shareholders Representative
shall, within 30 days after the Shareholders Representatives receipt of the
Closing Balance Sheet and Tylers

 



-9-  calculation of the Closing Working Capital, notify Tyler in writing of such
disagreement by setting forth the Shareholders Representatives calculation
of the Closing Working Capital and describing in reasonable detail the basis
for such disagreement (an " _Objection Notice_ "). If an Objection Notice is
delivered to Tyler, then the Shareholders Representative and Tyler shall
negotiate in good faith to resolve their disagreements with respect to the
computation of the Closing Working Capital. If the Shareholders
Representative and Tyler are unable to resolve all such disagreements within
30 days after Tylers receipt of the Objection Notice, the Shareholders
Representative and Tyler shall submit such remaining disagreements to BDO USA
LLP, or if such firm declines, such other nationally or regionally-recognized
accounting firm as is acceptable to the Shareholders Representative and
Tyler (the " _Accountant_ ").

(d) The Accountant shall resolve all remaining disagreements with respect to
the computation of the Closing Working Capital as soon as practicable, but in
no event later than 60 days after its retention. The Accountant shall consider
only those items and amounts in Tylers and the
Shareholders Representatives respective calculations of the Closing Working
Capital that are identified as being items and amounts to which Tyler and the
Shareholders Representative have been unable to agree. In resolving any
disputed item, the Accountant may not assign a value to any item greater than
the greatest value for such item claimed by either Tyler or the Shareholders
Representative or less than the smallest value for such item claimed by either
Tyler or the Shareholders Representative. The Accountants determination of
the Closing Working Capital shall be based solely on written materials
submitted by Tyler and the Shareholders Representative ( _i.e_., not on an
independent review) and on the definition of "NWS Working Capital" included
in this Agreement and made in accordance with GAAP, the Accounting Guidelines,
and the terms of this Agreement. The determination of the Accountant shall be
conclusive and binding upon the Parties. The costs and expenses of the
Accountant in determining the Closing Working Capital shall be borne by the
Party whose calculation of the Closing Working Capital reflects the larger
variance from the Accountants determination of the Closing Working Capital.
The full amount of such costs and expenses shall be paid directly by Tyler or
the Surviving Company, but if such costs and expenses are to be borne by the
Shareholders Representative, Tyler shall deduct such amount from the Working
Capital Holdback. The Closing Working Capital, as finally determined pursuant
to this _Section 3.4_, shall be referred to as the " _Final Closing Working
Capital_."

 

(e) Within five Business Days after the earlier of (i) the Shareholders
Representatives confirmation that he agrees with Tylers calculation of the
Closing Working Capital as set forth on the Closing Balance Sheet, (ii) the
expiration of the 30-day notice period pursuant to _Section 3.4(c)_ without
receipt of an Objection Notice from the Shareholders Representative, or
(iii) the final resolution of any dispute pursuant to _Sections 3.4(c)_ or
_3.4(d)_ :

 

(i) if the Final Closing Working Capital exceeds (or is equal to) the
Estimated Closing Working Capital, then Tyler shall pay an amount in cash
equal to the Working Capital Holdback _plus_ the amount of such excess to the
Shareholders based on their respective Pro Rata Shares, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds in accordance with the Wiring Instructions; and

(ii) if the Final Closing Working Capital is less than the Estimated Working
Capital, then Tyler shall deduct such amount from the Working Capital

 



-10-  Holdback and pay the remaining amount of the Working Capital Holdback to the
Shareholders based on their respective Pro Rata Shares, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds in accordance with the Wiring Instructions. If
the Working Capital Holdback is insufficient to compensate Tyler, then Tyler
and the Shareholders Representative shall deliver joint written instructions
to the Escrow Agent to disburse to Tyler a portion of the Escrowed Cash equal
to the amount of such deficiency.

(f) Any payments made pursuant to this _Section 3.4_ shall be treated as an
adjustment to the Total Merger Consideration by the Parties for Tax purposes,
unless otherwise required by applicable Tax Law.

Intellectual Property_."

 



-17- (b) NWS possesses all right, title, and interest in and to all of the Owned
Intellectual Property, free and clear of any Encumbrances other than
Permitted Encumbrances. To NWSs Knowledge, no Person has either asserted any
rights in, or any other right of use with respect to, the Owned Intellectual
Property. To NWSs Knowledge, NWS does not have any obligation to compensate
any Person for any development, license, or modification, use, sale, or
distribution of any of the Owned Intellectual Property, except as described on
_Schedule 5.12_. Except as set forth on _Schedule 5.12_, to the Knowledge
of NWS, there is no unauthorized use, disclosure, infringement, or
misappropriation of any Owned Intellectual Property by any current or former
employee of NWS or other Third Party. None of the Owned Intellectual Property
has been adjudicated by a United States court to be invalid or unenforceable,
in whole or in part, and to NWSs Knowledge, the Owned Intellectual Property
is valid and enforceable, and NWS has not received any written notice from a
Third Party alleging that any Owned Intellectual Property is invalid or
unenforceable. No Owned Intellectual Property is subject to any outstanding
injunction, judgment, order, decree, ruling, charge, settlement, or
other disposition of any dispute in a United States court regarding any Owned
Intellectual Property.

(c) The Owned Intellectual Property, together with (i) the Intellectual
Property licensed by NWS pursuant to a Contract described on _Schedule 5.11_
and (ii) the material Software described in _Section 5.12(a)(vii)_ and on
_Schedule 5.12_ that is licensed by NWS (collectively, the " _Licensed
Intellectual Property_ "), constitutes all of the material Intellectual
Property necessary for the conduct of NWSs business as conducted on the date
of this Agreement and the Closing Date.

(d) To the Knowledge of NWS, the conduct and operation of NWSs business does
not infringe, misappropriate, dilute, violate, or otherwise impair any valid
Intellectual Property right of any other Person. There is (i) no Proceeding
pending, or to NWSs Knowledge, threatened, with respect to the Owned
Intellectual Property, or (ii) no judgment or order regarding any Proceeding
has been rendered by any competent Governmental Authority and no settlement
agreement or similar contractual obligation has been entered into by NWS with
respect to any Proceeding regarding the Owned Intellectual Property. 

(e) To the Knowledge of NWS, no Third Party has any rights to terminate any
assignment or license to NWS with respect to the Owned Intellectual Property
or the Licensed Intellectual Property.

(f) Except as set forth on _Schedule 5.12(f)_ or in the ordinary course of
business, NWS has not agreed to indemnify any entity or Person for any
infringement of any Intellectual Property of any Third Party in connection
with the providing, selling, licensing, marketing, or distributing any NWS
products or services.

(g) To NWSs Knowledge, its business as currently conducted does not involve
the use or development of, or engagement in, encryption technology, or other
technology, the development, commercialization, or export of which is
restricted under applicable Law.

 

(h) NWS employed commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that all source
code for the Software created by NWS employees involved in its business ("
_NWS Developed_

 



-18-   _Software_ ") is documented in accordance with industry standards. To NWSs
Knowledge, no portion of the NWS Developed Software and no other Software
constituting Owned Intellectual Property, contains any disabling mechanism or
protection feature designed to prevent its use, computer virus, worm, Software
lock, drop dead device, trojan-horse routine, trap door, or time bomb that may
be used to access, modify, delete, damage, or disable any computer system.

(i) NWS owns or has a valid and enforceable right to use all material Internal
Use Software, and all computer hardware and telecommunications systems used
by NWS (the " _Information Systems_ "). The Internal Use Software and the
Information Systems, and NWSs rights with respect to the Internal Use
Software and Information Systems, are adequate in all material respects to
serve the needs of its business in the manner and to the extent presently
conducted. To NWSs Knowledge, NWSs back-up and disaster recovery plans and
policies adopted or in effect with respect to the Internal Use Software, the
Information Systems, and the information and data used in the conduct of NWSs
business in the manner and to the extent presently conducted are adequate to
meet the needs of the business of NWS as presently conducted.

(j) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, this _Section
5.12_ contains all representations and warranties made by NWS in this
Agreement with respect to compliance with Laws related to Intellectual
Property.

5.13  _Environmental Matters_. Except as set forth on _Schedule 5.13_, (a)
NWS has complied with and is in compliance, in all material respects, with all
Environmental, Health, and Safety Laws, including Environmental, Health,
and Safety Laws relating to air, water, land, and the generation, storage,
use, handling, transportation, treatment, or disposal of Hazardous Substances;
(b) NWS has obtained and complied, in all material respects, with all
necessary permits and other approvals necessary to treat, transport, store,

extent required by all Environmental, Health, and Safety Laws, all past and
present sites owned or operated by NWS where Hazardous Substances have been
treated, stored, disposed of, or otherwise handled; (c) there have been no
"releases" or threats of "releases" (as defined in any Environmental, Health,
and Safety Laws) at, from, in, or on any property owned or operated by NWS in
violation of any Environmental, Health, and Safety Laws; and (d) to NWSs
Knowledge, there is no on-site or off-site location to which NWS has
transported or disposed of Hazardous Substances or arranged for the
transportation or disposal of Hazardous Substances which is the subject of any
federal, state, local, or foreign enforcement action or any other
investigation which could lead to any claim against NWS or Tyler or the
Surviving Company for any clean-up cost, remedial work, damage to natural
resources, or personal injury, including any claim under any Environmental,
Health, and Safety Law. None of the past or present sites owned or operated by
NWS is currently or has ever been designated as a treatment, storage, or
disposal facility, nor has any such facility ever applied for an Authorization
designating it as a treatment, storage, or disposal facility, under any
Environmental, Health, and Safety Law. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, this _Section 5.13_ contains all representations
and warranties made by NWS in this Agreement with respect to compliance with
Environmental, Health, and Safety Laws.

Knowledge, threatened labor dispute involving NWS and any group of

social security benefits, or other benefits or obligations for employees
(other than routine payments to be made in the normal course of business and

services for NWS as part of his or her employment.

 

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, this _Section
5.14_ contains all representations and warranties made by NWS in this
Agreement with respect to compliance with Laws related to employment matters.

5.15 _Employee Benefit Plans_.

 

(a) _Schedule 5.15(a)_ sets forth an accurate schedule of each (i) "employee
benefit plan," as defined in Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974, as amended (" _ERISA_ "), whether formal or informal and
whether legally binding or not, under which NWS or an ERISA Affiliate has any
current or future obligation or liability or any such arrangement under which
any present or former employee of NWS or an ERISA Affiliate, or such present
or former employees dependents or beneficiaries, has any current or future
right to benefits, (ii) bonus, deferred compensation, incentive, restricted
stock, stock purchase, stock option, stock appreciation right, phantom stock,

director or employee loan, fringe benefit, sabbatical, severance (including

(iii) plan, arrangement, agreement, program, policy, practice, or
understanding, whether oral or written, formal or informal, funded or
unfunded, registered or unregistered, which provides benefits to
employees outside of the United States (each such plan and arrangement
referred to hereinafter as an " _NWS Plan_ "). NWS has no commitment,
proposal, or communication to employees regarding the creation of an
additional benefit plan or any increase in benefits under any NWS Plan. Each
NWS Plan that is an employee benefit plan within the meaning of Section 3(3)
of ERISA may be unilaterally amended or terminated in its entirety without
liability except as to benefits vested and accrued thereunder prior to such
amendment or termination. Neither NWS nor any ERISA Affiliate has ever
maintained, contributed to or been obligated to contribute to or has any
liability with respect to, any plan, program, fund, or arrangement
that constitutes a plan subject to Section 412 of the Code or Title IV of
ERISA or a "multi-employer plan" as defined in Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA.

 

(b) Each NWS Plan listed on _Schedule 5.15(a)_ is in compliance in all
material respects with the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code, and any
other applicable Law. Except as set forth on _Schedule 5.15(b)_, with respect
to each NWS Plan, all reports and other documents required under ERISA or
other applicable Law to be filed with any Governmental Authority, the failure
to file which could reasonably be expected to result in a material liability
to NWS or any ERISA Affiliate, including all Forms 5500, or required to be
distributed to

 



-21-  participants or beneficiaries, have been duly and timely filed or
distributed. Except as set forth on _Schedule 5.15(b)_, each NWS Plan that is
intended to be "qualified" within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code
(a " _Qualified Plan_ ") is, and has been during the period from its adoption
to the date hereof, so qualified, both as to form and operation and all
necessary approvals of Governmental Authorities, including a favorable
determination as to the qualification under the Code of each such Qualified
Plan and each amendment thereto, have been timely obtained. With respect to
each NWS Plan that is subject to Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA and
Section 4980B of the Code and similar state Law provisions, the applicable
requirements thereof have been satisfied in all material respects by NWS and
each ERISA Affiliate. Except as set forth on  _Schedule 5.15(b)_, all
accrued contribution obligations or premium payment of NWS with respect to any
NWS Plan have either been fulfilled in their entirety or are fully reflected
in the Financial Statements.

 

(c) Neither NWS nor any ERISA Affiliate owes, with respect to any NWS Plan,
any liability for excise tax or penalty due to the IRS. No act, omission, or
transaction has occurred that would result, directly or indirectly, through
its own liability, indemnification, or otherwise, in imposition on NWS of (i)
breach of fiduciary duty liability damages under Section 409 of ERISA or (ii)
any liability under Section 502 of ERISA. There have been no terminations,
partial terminations, or discontinuances of required contributions to any
Qualified Plan within the past six years without, to the extent required
by applicable Law, notice to and approval by the IRS and payment of all
accrued obligations and liabilities attributable to such required
contributions to the applicable Qualified Plan.

 

(d) Except as set forth on _Schedule 5.15(d)_, neither NWS nor any ERISA
Affiliate has made any promises of retirement or other benefits to employees,
except as set forth in the NWS Plans, and neither NWS nor any ERISA Affiliate
maintains or has established any NWS Plan that is a "welfare benefit plan"
within the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA that provides for continuing
benefits or coverage for any participant or any beneficiary of a participant
after such participants termination of employment, except as may be required
by Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA and Section 4980B of the Code and
similar state Law provisions, and at the expense of the participant or the
beneficiary of the participant. Neither NWS nor any ERISA Affiliate maintains,
has established, has ever participated in or been obligated to contribute to,
or has any liability to a multiple employer welfare benefit arrangement as
described in Section 3(40)(A) of ERISA. With respect to any insurance policy
providing funding for benefits under any NWS Plan, NWS has no liability in the
nature of a retroactive rate adjustment, loss sharing arrangement or other
similar liability, nor would there be any such liability if such insurance
policy was terminated on the date hereof.

 

(e) There are no pending, or to NWSs Knowledge threatened Proceedings (other
than routine claims for benefits in the ordinary course) asserted or
instituted against the assets of any NWS Plan or its related trust or against
any fiduciary of an NWS Plan. To NWSs Knowledge, there are no investigations
or audits of any NWS Plan by any Governmental Authority currently pending and
there have been no such investigations or audits that have been concluded that
resulted in any liability to NWS or any ERISA Affiliate that has not been
fully discharged. There is no pending voluntary compliance, closing agreement
program or other matter under the Employee Plans Compliance Resolution System
with respect to a NWS Plan.

 



-22- (f) Neither NWS nor any ERISA Affiliate has engaged in any prohibited
transaction, within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of
the Code, in connection with any NWS Plan for which exemption was not
available and that has not been fully corrected (including the payment of any
associated excise taxes, penalties and interest) in accordance with ERISA and
the Code. Neither NWS nor any ERISA Affiliate participates in or has an
obligation to contribute to or otherwise has any liability with respect to a
multiemployer plan as defined in Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA. NWS and each
ERISA Affiliate have, for purposes of each NWS Plan, correctly classified
those individuals performing services for NWS and each ERISA Affiliate as
common law employees, leased employees, independent contractors or agents.

 

(g) NWS has made available to Tyler complete, accurate, and current copies of
each of the following:

 

(i) the text (including amendments) of each NWS Plan, to the extent reduced to
writing, all related trust documents (including, but not limited to, any tax-
exempt trust, secular trust, VEBA, and "rabbi trust" document), if applicable,
all amendments thereto, and all associated contracts (including insurance
contracts, HMO/PPO/POS agreements, recordkeeping contracts, trustee
contracts, and third-party administrator contracts);

(ii) a summary of each NWS Plan, to the extent not previously reduced to
writing;

401(a) of the Code, the most recent determination or opinion letter

by NWS with respect to such NWS Plan.

 

(h) Except as set forth on _Schedule 5.15(h)_, the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not, either immediately or
upon the occurrence of any event thereafter, (i) entitle any current or former
employee, officer, director, or independent contractor of NWS or any ERISA
Affiliate to severance pay, unemployment 

 



-23-  compensation, or any other payment, (ii) accelerate the time of payment or
vesting, or increase the amount of compensation otherwise due any such
individual, (iii) result in any portion of any payment to any such individual
not being deductible by NWS, or (iv) conflict with the provisions of any NWS
Plan.

(i) Except as set forth on _Schedule 5.15(i)_, none of the NWS Plans is
subject to Section 409A of the Code. With respect to each NWS Plan which is
subject to Section 409A of the Code: (i) such plan has been maintained and
administered in a manner consistent with avoiding adverse tax consequences
under Section 409A of the Code, and (ii) the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will not result in such adverse tax consequences.

 

(j) Without the consent or approval of the holders of unvested shares of NWS
Common Stock under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, the terms of the
Employee Stock Purchase Plan permit NWS, prior to the Closing, to (i) cancel
or terminate the unvested shares of NWS Common Stock purchased thereunder,
(ii) purchase all of the vested or unvested shares of NWS Common Stock
purchased thereunder, or (iii) waive the rights of NWS under the Employee
Stock Purchase Plan or any purchase agreement thereunder to purchase the
shares of NWS Common Stock purchased thereunder. True and complete copies of
all agreements and instruments relating to or issued under the Employee Stock
Purchase Plan have been made available to Tyler, and such agreements and
instruments have not been amended, modified, or supplemented, and there are no
agreements to amend, modify, or supplement such agreements or instruments.

(k) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, this _Section
5.15_ contains all representations and warranties made by NWS in this
Agreement with respect to compliance with Laws related to employee benefit
plans.

5.16  _Insurance_.

(a) All insurance policies currently owned or held by NWS (each, an "
_Insurance Policy_ "), are in full force and effect and all premiums
currently payable or previously due with respect to such Insurance Policies
have been paid. No written notice of cancellation or termination has been
received by NWS or the Shareholders with respect to any Insurance Policy. NWS
has not received any written notice of non-coverage, reservation of rights, or
rejection of tender for any outstanding claim with respect to any Insurance
Policy.

 

(b) The Insurance Policies, to the Knowledge of NWS, provide adequate
insurance coverage for NWS and its business, assets, and properties. 

(c) _Schedule 5.16(c)_ sets forth an accurate list of all claims or losses
valued within the last one year provided by each applicable insurance company
showing all workers compensation, property, marine, inland marine, fidelity,
aviation, liability, auto, or other insurance claims relating to any event or
occurrence that took place or was discovered at any time during the past six
policy years, including the status of any claims payment. To NWSs Knowledge,
NWS has not failed to give any notice or present any claim under any Insurance
Policy in due and timely fashion. To NWSs Knowledge, NWS has not been, and
is not now, the

 



-24-  subject of any claim relating to damage or injury in excess of its then
current Insurance Policy liability or coverage limits or for which coverage
has been denied by its insurer. Since December 31, 2014, NWS has not suffered
any physical damage to its assets that is not fully covered by the Insurance
Policies, other than deductibles under its Insurance Policies and other than
self-insured retentions set forth on  _Schedule 5.16(c)_.

all material respects. All material Taxes due and owing by NWS (whether or not
shown on any Tax Return) have been, or will be, timely paid. There are no

6.8 _Available Funds_.

 

(a) Tyler has sufficient cash on hand together with the Debt Financing to be
obtained from one or more lenders to enable it to make payment of the Total
Cash Consideration and consummate the transactions contemplated by this

satisfy on a timely basis any condition to Closing to be satisfied by it. As
of the Closing, and after giving effect to all of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, each of Tyler, the Surviving Company, and each
Subsidiary of any of the foregoing will be Solvent. For purposes of this
_Section 6.8(a)_, " _Solvent_ " means that, with respect to any Person and
as of any date of determination, (i) the amount of the "present fair saleable
value" of the assets of such Person, will, as of such date, exceed the amount
of all "liabilities of such Person, contingent or otherwise," as of such
date, as such quoted terms are generally determined in accordance with
applicable federal laws governing determinations of the insolvency of debtors,
(ii) the present fair saleable value of the assets of such Person will, as of
such date, be greater than the amount that will be required to pay the
liability of such Person on its indebtedness as its indebtedness becomes
absolute and matured, (iii) such Person will not have, as of such date,
an unreasonably small amount of capital with which to conduct its business,
and (iv) such Person will be able to pay its indebtedness as it matures.

 

(b) Tyler has delivered to the Shareholders Representative true and complete
copies of an executed financing best efforts letter (including all exhibits,
schedules, attachments and appendices thereto, but not including any related
fee letter, the " _Financing Letter_ "), pursuant to which the lender party
thereto has undertaken, upon the terms and subject to the conditions
expressly set forth therein, to use its reasonable best efforts to cause to be
provided the Debt Financing to fund, together with cash of Tyler on the
Closing Date, Tylers payment of the Total Cash Consideration. As of the date
of this Agreement, the Financing Letter has not been amended or modified, and
the undertaking to arrange the Debt Financing contained in the Financing
Letter has not been withdrawn or rescinded and, to the Knowledge of Tyler, no
such amendment, modification, withdrawal, or rescission is contemplated as of
the date of this Agreement. There are no side letters or agreements to which
Tyler is a party related to the Debt Financing that could adversely affect the
availability of the Debt Financing.

(c) As of the date hereof, no event has occurred that (with or without notice
or lapse of time, or both) constitutes or would constitute a breach or
default under the Financing Letter by Tyler or, to the Knowledge of Tyler, any
other party thereto. As of the date of this Agreement, assuming the accuracy
of the representations and warranties of the Principal Shareholder and NWS
set forth in _ARTICLE IV_ and _ARTICLE V_ , Tyler does not have any Knowledge
of any fact, occurrence or condition existing on the date hereof that, with or
without notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to (i)
result in any of the terms or conditions in the Financing Letter not being
satisfied on a timely basis, or (ii) otherwise result in the Debt Financing
not being consummated on a timely basis in order to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

6.9 _SEC Reports and Financial Statements_. Tyler has timely filed or
otherwise transmitted all forms, reports, statements, certifications, and
other documents (including all exhibits, supplements, and amendments thereto)
required to be filed by Tyler with the SEC since December 31, 2011
(collectively, with any amendments thereto, the " _SEC Reports_ "), each of
which, including any financial statements or schedules included therein, as
finally amended prior to the date hereof, has complied in all material
respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act, each as in effect on the date so filed. None of the SEC Reports
contained, when filed as finally amended prior to the date hereof, any untrue
statement

 



-33-  of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated
or incorporated by reference therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. Each of (a) the consolidated balance sheets included in
the SEC Reports were prepared from and in accordance with the books and
records of Tyler and in accordance with GAAP and fairly present, in all
material respects, the consolidated financial position of Tyler at the
respective dates thereof and (b) the related consolidated statements of
comprehensive income and cash flows included in the SEC Reports (including
any related notes and schedules) were prepared from and in accordance with
the books and records of Tyler and in accordance with GAAP and fairly present,
in all material respects, the results of operations and cash flows of Tyler
for the periods indicated (subject, in the case of the unaudited financial
statements referenced in each of clauses (a) and (b), to normal recurring
year-end audit adjustments and the absence of full footnote disclosure. Tyler
maintains a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide
reasonable assurance that Tylers material transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with
GAAP.

 

6.10 _Broker s or Finders Fees_. Except for Wells Fargo Securities, no
investment banker, broker, finder, or other Person is entitled to any
brokerage or finders fee or similar commission with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement based in any way on agreements,

representation or warranty whatsoever, express or implied, other than those
representations and warranties of the Tyler Entities expressly set forth in
this Agreement.

obligations of a type required to be reflected on a balance sheet prepared in
accordance with GAAP, except those (i) that are accrued, reserved against in
the financial statements included with the SEC Reports or reflected in the
notes thereto or (ii) that were incurred after December 31, 2014 in the
ordinary course of business.

6.13 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Since December 31, 2014 and
through the date of this Agreement, there has not been any change, event or
development that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or would
reasonably be expected to have a Tyler Material Adverse Effect.

 

6.14 _Accountant_. Neither Tyler nor any of its Affiliates have been a client
of the Accountant, nor has Tyler (or any of its Affiliates) had any material
relationship with the Accountant, during the last five years.

6.15 _Independent Investigation_. Each Tyler Entity acknowledges and agrees
that: (a) in making its decision to enter into this Agreement and to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, the Tyler Entities have
relied solely upon their own investigation and the express representations
and warranties of the Principal Shareholder and NWS set forth in _ARTICLE IV_
and _ARTICLE V_ (including the related portions of the Disclosure Schedules);
and (b) no Shareholder nor NWS nor any other Person has made any

delayed, from and after the execution of this Agreement and until the earlier
of the Closing or the termination of this Agreement, NWS and the Principal
Shareholder will not permit NWS to take any of the actions listed in _Section
5.22_.

(c) Each Party covenants and agrees that until the earlier of the Closing or
the termination of this Agreement, except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement or unless the Shareholders Representative (with respect to the
Tyler Entities) or Tyler (with respect to NWS, the Principal Shareholder, or
the Shareholders Representative) otherwise agrees in writing, which
agreement shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed, such
Party shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to take any action (or
omit to take any action) if such action (or omission) would reasonably be
expected to result in any of the conditions set forth in _ARTICLE IX_ not
being satisfied.

 



-35- 7.2 _Access to Information_. NWS shall afford to Tyler, and to Tylers
Representatives, upon NWSs approval (which approval will not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned, or delayed) of a reasonable request by Tyler to be
provided reasonable access during normal business hours during the period
prior to the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement to all of
NWSs properties, books and records, financial and operating data, other
information, and to those employees of NWS to whom Tyler reasonably requests
access; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such access shall be conducted
during normal business hours under the supervision of NWS personnel and in
such a manner as not to interfere with the normal operations of NWS. All
requests by Tyler for access pursuant to this _Section 7.2_ shall be
submitted or directed exclusively to the Shareholders Representative (for the
avoidance of doubt, neither Tyler nor any of its Affiliates or Representatives
shall contact any of NWS employees, customers, or suppliers without first
coordinating such contact with the Shareholders Representative). During such
period, NWS shall furnish, as promptly as practicable, to Tyler all
information concerning NWSs business, properties, and NWS employees as Tyler
may reasonably request (it being agreed, however, that the foregoing shall
not permit any Tyler Entity or any such Representatives to conduct any
environmental testing or sampling). Notwithstanding the foregoing, NWS shall
not be required to provide access to or disclose information if such
disclosure would, as determined reasonably and in good faith by NWS, (i)
jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of NWS, or (ii) violate any Law or
any Contract to which NWS is a party, in each case it being agreed that the
Parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause such information to
be provided in a manner that does not cause such jeopardization or violation
(it being agreed that neither NWS nor any of its Affiliates shall be required
to make monetary payments in connection with the foregoing). Without limiting
the other provisions of this _Section 7.2_, the Tyler Entities will use
reasonable best efforts to minimize any disruption to the business of
NWS that may result from the requests for access, data, or information
hereunder.

7.3 _Exclusivity_. NWS and the Tyler Entities agree to the following
exclusivity provisions until the earlier of the Closing or the termination of
this Agreement (the " _Exclusivity Period_ "):

 

(a) During the Exclusivity Period, NWS shall exclusively be in discussions and
negotiate with the Tyler Entities and shall not, and will procure that its
Affiliates and Representatives shall not, directly or indirectly (whether or
not in conjunction with a Third Party) solicit, encourage, or initiate any
offer or proposal from, or enter into, re-start, solicit, initiate, or
otherwise engage in any discussions or negotiations with, or seek, encourage,
or respond to, or provide or disclose any information to, or enter into any
agreement, terms, arrangement, or understanding (whether or not legally
binding) with, any Person or group of Persons other than the Tyler Entities
and its Representatives with respect to any transaction involving any
acquisition of or investment in, or any disposal (whether by way of sale,
offer, transfer, assignment or otherwise) of, a material portion of the
capital stock of NWS (or interest therein), or a material portion of the
assets of NWS.

(b) During the Exclusivity Period, the Tyler Entities shall exclusively be in
discussions and negotiate with NWS and shall not, and will procure that its
Representatives shall not, directly or indirectly (whether or not in
conjunction with a Third Party) solicit, encourage, or initiate any offer or
proposal from, or enter into, re-start, solicit, initiate, or otherwise engage
in

 



-36-  any discussions or negotiations with, or seek, encourage, or respond to, or
provide or disclose any information to, or enter into any agreement, terms,
arrangement, or understanding (whether or not legally binding) with, any
Person or group of Persons other than NWS and its Affiliates or
Representatives concerning any transaction involving any acquisition of or
investment in, or any disposal (whether by way of sale, offer,
transfer, assignment, or otherwise) of, a material portion of the shares or
equity (or any interest therein) of any Third Party that competes with NWS, or
a material portion of the assets of any such Third Party (any such transaction
described in  _Sections 7.3(a)_ or _7.3(b)_ to be considered an "
_Alternative Transaction_ ").

(c) NWS, the Principal Shareholder, and the Shareholders Representative (on
behalf of the other Shareholders), on the one hand, and the Tyler Entities, on
the other hand, each represents and warrants to the other such Party that any
and all discussions, negotiations, agreements, or obligations with any party
with respect to any Alternative Transaction was terminated on or before
execution of the Term Sheet, and none of such Parties, or any of its
Representatives, has received any proposal for, or inquiry respecting, any
Alternative Transaction since the execution of the Term Sheet. If either such
Party or any of its Representatives receives any proposal for, or inquiry
respecting, any Alternative Transaction, or any request for
nonpublic information in connection with any such Alternative Transaction,
such Party will promptly notify the other such Party, describing in detail the
identity of the Person or group of Persons making such proposal or inquiry and
the terms and conditions of such proposal or inquiry.

7.4 _Shareholder Approval_.

 

(a) NWS and the Principal Shareholder shall use their best efforts to obtain

following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the written consent of
Shareholders holding the requisite number of shares of NWS Common Stock under
the Michigan Act with respect to authorization and approval of the Merger
and authorization, approval, and adoption of this Agreement (the "

approval of the Merger, authorization, approval, and adoption of this
Agreement, and instruction to present the Merger and this Agreement to the

following, but in no event later than ten days after, receipt of the
Shareholder Consent, NWS shall prepare and mail a notice (the " _Shareholder
Notice_ ") to each Shareholder that did not execute the Shareholder Consent.
The Shareholder Notice shall include (i) a statement to the effect that NWS
board of directors unanimously authorized and approved the Merger and
authorized, approved, and adopted this Agreement, (ii) a copy of the
Shareholder Consent and notice that the Merger and this Agreement have been
approved by Shareholders holding the requisite number of shares of NWS Common
Stock under the Michigan Act, (iii) notice that subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement the Merger will be consummated, and (iv) notice
that, based on the Total Merger Consideration and in accordance with Section
1762(2)(b) of the Michigan Act, such Shareholders shall not have a right of
dissent with respect to the Merger. All materials submitted to the
Shareholders in accordance with this _Section 7.4(b)_ shall be subject to
Tylers prior review and approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned, or delayed.

to (i) make, or cause to be made, all filings and submissions (including
those under the HSR Act) required under any Law applicable to such party or
any of its Affiliates, and (ii) obtain or provide, or cause to be obtained, as
set forth in _Sections 5.4(a)_ and _6.4_ (other than those that NWS is not

such consents, approvals, orders, and Authorizations. The Parties shall not
willfully take any action that will have the effect of delaying, impairing or
impeding the receipt of any required consents, approvals, orders, and
Authorizations. If required by the HSR Act and if the appropriate filing
pursuant to the HSR Act has not been filed prior to the date hereof, each
party hereto agrees to (i) make an appropriate filing pursuant to the HSR Act
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement within five
Business Days after the date hereof and (ii) request early termination of the
waiting period under the HSR Act.

 

(b) Without limiting the generality of the Parties undertakings pursuant to
_Section 7.5(a)_, each of the Parties shall use all reasonable best efforts
to:

(i) respond to any inquiries by any Governmental Authority regarding antitrust
or other matters with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or any Ancillary Document;

(ii) avoid the imposition of any order or the taking of any action that would
restrain, alter, or enjoin the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
any Ancillary Document; and

 

(iii) in the event any order or other action by a Governmental Authority
adversely affecting the ability of the parties to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any Ancillary Document has been issued, to
have such order or other action vacated or lifted.

 

(c) Without waiver of the attorney-client privilege, all analyses,
appearances, meetings, discussions, presentations, memoranda, briefs,
filings, arguments, and proposals made by or on behalf of any Party before any
Governmental Authority or the staff or regulators of any Governmental
Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated hereunder (but,
for the avoidance of doubt, not including any interactions between NWS and
Governmental Authorities in the ordinary course of business, any disclosure of
which is not permitted by Law, or any disclosure containing
confidential information) shall be disclosed to the other Parties in advance
of any filing, submission, or attendance, it being the intent that the Parties
will consult and cooperate with one another, and consider in good faith the
views of one another, in connection

 



-38-  with any such analyses, appearances, meetings, discussions, presentations,
memoranda, briefs, filings, arguments, and proposals. Any Party may, as it
deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively
sensitive material provided to the other Party under this _Section 7.5_ as
"outside counsel only." Such materials and the information contained therein
shall be given only to the outside legal counsel of the recipient and will
not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers, or directors
of the recipient, unless express written permission is obtained in advance
from the source of such materials. Each Party shall give notice to the other
Parties with respect to any meeting, discussion, appearance, or contact with
any Governmental Authority or the staff or regulators of any Governmental
Authority (other than communications that relate solely to administrative
matters), with such notice being sufficient to provide the other Parties with
the opportunity to attend and participate in such meeting, discussion,
appearance, or contact.

 

(d) NWS shall be responsible for all fees and expenses incurred with obtaining
any consents or approvals from Third Parties, or Authorizations, giving
notices, or making filings, in each case as set forth in _Section 5.4(a)_ (
_provided_ , _however_ , that any such fees and expenses shall be paid by NWS
in full prior to the Closing or accrued in full on the books and records of
NWS prior to the Closing; and, _provided further_ , that NWS shall not be
obligated to pay any consideration therefor to any Third Party from whom
consent or approval is requested), except that (i) Tyler shall be responsible
for the Merger Filings and (ii) each of NWS and the Tyler Entities shall be
responsible for their respective fees and expenses in connection with their
respective filings of a pre-merger notification and report form under the
HSR Act; _provided, however_ , that the filing fee therefor shall be paid by
the Tyler Entities.

(e) Without limiting the generality of the Parties undertaking pursuant to
this _Section 7.5_, each Party agrees to use its reasonable best efforts and
to take any and all steps necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every
impediment under any antitrust, competition, or trade regulation Law that may
be asserted by any Governmental Authority or any Third Party so as to enable
the Parties hereto to close the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as
promptly as possible; _provided_ , _however_ , nothing in this _Section 7.5_
shall require, or be construed to require, either Party or any of its
Affiliates to agree to (i) sell, hold, divest, discontinue, or limit, before
or after the Closing Date, any assets, businesses, or interests of such Party
or any of its Affiliates, (ii) any conditions relating to, or changes or
restrictions in, the operations of any such assets, businesses, or interests

of each of the Parties, and nothing in this  _Section 7.8_, express or
implied, shall confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies of any
nature whatsoever under or by reason of this _Section 7.8_. Nothing contained
herein, express or implied, shall be construed to establish, amend or modify
any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement. The Parties hereto
acknowledge and agree that the terms set forth in this _Section 7.8_ shall

Affiliates or compensation or benefits of any nature or kind whatsoever.

 

(d) NWS shall be responsible for the payment of any Change of Control Payments

Tyler shall give notice to NWS, as promptly as reasonably practicable, upon

which occurred on or prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement). The premium amounts for such
tail policies shall be fully paid by NWS or accrued on the books and records
of NWS prior to the Closing. During the term of such tail policies, neither
Tyler nor the Surviving Company shall take any action following the Closing to
cause any such tail policy to be cancelled or any provision therein to be
amended or waived;  _provided_ , that neither Tyler, the Surviving Company
(except to the extent of such pre-Closing accrual thereof by NWS), nor any
Affiliate thereof shall be obligated to pay any premiums or other amounts in
respect of such tail policies.

 

(c) The obligations of Tyler under this _Section 7.13_ shall not be
terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any director
or officer to whom this _Section 7.13_ applies without the consent of such

Person, then, and in either such case, proper provision shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of Tyler shall assume all of the obligations
set forth in this _Section 7.13_.

7.14  _Confidentiality_. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the Non-
disclosure Agreement remains in full force and effect, and the Tyler Entities,
on the one hand, and NWS and the Principal Shareholder, on the other hand,
covenant and agree to keep confidential, in accordance with the provisions of
the Non-disclosure Agreement, information provided to such Party or Parties or
any of their respective Representatives pursuant to this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, if this Agreement
is, for any reason, terminated prior to the Closing, the Non-disclosure
Agreement and the provisions of this _Section 7.14_ shall nonetheless
continue in full force and effect.

 



-43- 7.15 _Debt Financing_.

 

(a) Tyler acknowledges that it shall be fully responsible for obtaining the

insurance as reasonably requested by Tyler; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Tyler shall pay (and, to the extent practicable, in advance) any out-of-
pocket costs or expenses incurred in connection therewith (including, any
commitment or other fee or incur any other liability in connection with the
Debt Financing prior to the Effective Time); and, _provided further_ , that
such requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing
operations of NWS. Tyler shall, promptly upon request by NWS, reimburse NWS
for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by NWS in connection with
such cooperation. Tyler shall indemnify and hold harmless NWS from and
against any and all Losses suffered or incurred by NWS in connection with the
arrangement of the Debt Financing and any information utilized in connection
therewith.

 

(c) If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and
conditions contemplated in the Financing Letter, Tyler shall use its
reasonable best efforts to promptly obtain alternative financing in an amount,
together with cash of Tyler on the Closing Date, sufficient for Tyler to pay

transactions contemplated by this Agreement on the terms set forth in this
Agreement (an " _Alternative Financing_ ").

7.16 _Payment of Notes Payable to Former Shareholders and Employees_. Prior
to the Closing, NWS shall pay in full all outstanding notes payable to former

Schwartz and Cohn LLP may serve as counsel to each and any Shareholder and its
respective Affiliates (individually and collectively, the " _Holder Group_
"), on the one hand, and NWS, on the other hand, in connection with the
negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and that, following
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, Honigman Miller

(a) Except to the extent treated as a liability in the calculation of Closing
Working Capital, the Principal Shareholder and the Shareholders

and certified evidence of payment thereof.

Loss attributable to any breaches of the Tax representations, warranties or
covenants of Tyler, the Surviving Company, and their Affiliates under this
_ARTICLE VIII_. For purposes, of clarity, such indemnification shall include

(c) The Tyler Entities, jointly and severally, covenant and agree that they
will indemnify, defend, protect, and hold harmless the Shareholders and their

with the Closing Date; and

of such claim and to employ counsel of its choice for such purpose, the fees

Representative, the Surviving Company, and Tyler shall provide each other with
such cooperation and information as any of them reasonably may request of the
others in filing any Tax Return pursuant to this

necessary to mitigate, reduce, or eliminate any Tax that could be
imposed with the transactions contemplated under this Agreement.

_ARTICLE VIII_ shall be satisfied: (a) from the Escrow Amount, and (b) to the
extent such amounts exceed the amount available to Tyler in the Escrow Amount,
such excess shall be an obligation of the Shareholders, severally and
not jointly (limited by their Pro Rata Shares).

pursuant to this _ARTICLE VIII_ shall be treated by the Parties as an
adjustment for Tax purposes to the Total Cash Consideration or Total Stock

certificate, dated as of the Closing Date, certifying to the effect that no

11.1(a)(i)_ shall not be limited to the Principal Shareholders Pro Rata Share
and the other Shareholders shall have no indemnity obligation), or (ii) of
NWS as set forth in _ARTICLE V_ , (b) during the applicable Survival Period,
any breach or nonfulfillment of any covenant or agreement on the part of
the Shareholders or NWS under this Agreement, or (c) any Proceeding by a
Shareholder against NWS, the Surviving Company, or their respective Affiliates
and Representatives with respect to any event or action occurring on or before
the Effective Time (but excluding (i) any obligation of the Tyler Entities
pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) any employment claim accrued by NWS prior
to the Effective Time but payable by the Surviving Company after the Effective
Time).

 

11.2 _Indemnification by Tyler_. The Tyler Entities, jointly and severally,
covenant and agree that they will indemnify, defend, protect, and hold
harmless the Shareholders and their respective agents, representatives,
Affiliates, beneficiaries and heirs, and employees at all times from and after
the Effective Time from and against all Losses incurred by any of such
indemnified Persons as a result of or arising from (a) during the applicable
Survival Period, any

 



-55-  breach of the representations and warranties of the Tyler Entities set forth
herein or in the Schedules or certificates attached hereto, or (b) during the
applicable Survival Period, any breach of or nonfulfillment of any covenant
or agreement on the part of the Tyler Entities under this Agreement.

11.3 _Third Party Claims_. Promptly after any Party (hereinafter the "
_Indemnified Party_ ") has received notice of or has knowledge of any claim
(or any facts giving rise to a claim) by a Third Party of the commencement of
any Proceeding by a Third Party that the Indemnified Party believes in good
faith is an indemnifiable claim under this Agreement, the Indemnified Party
shall promptly give to the party obligated to provide indemnification pursuant
to _Sections 11.1_ or _11.2_  (hereinafter the " _Indemnifying Party_ ")
written notice of such claim or the commencement of such Proceeding. Such
notice shall state the nature and the basis of such claim and a reasonable
estimate of the amount thereof, along with all documentation and records in
such Indemnified Partys possession relating to such claim. The Indemnifying
Party shall have the right to defend and settle, at its own expense and by its
own counsel, any such matter so long as the Indemnifying Party pursues the
same diligently and in good faith. If the Indemnifying Party undertakes to
defend or settle any such matter, it shall promptly notify the Indemnified
Party of its intention to do so, and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate
with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel in all commercially reasonable
respects in the defense thereof and in any settlement thereof. Such
cooperation shall include, but shall not be limited to, furnishing the
Indemnifying Party with any books, records, and other information reasonably
requested by the Indemnifying Party and in the Indemnified Partys possession
or control. After the Indemnifying Party has notified the Indemnified Party of
its intention to undertake to defend or settle any such asserted liability,
and for so long as the Indemnifying Party diligently pursues such defense, the
Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any additional legal expenses
incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with any defense or
settlement of such asserted liability; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Indemnified Party shall be entitled, at its expense, to participate in the
defense of such asserted liability and the negotiations of the
settlement thereof. If the Shareholders Representative has assumed the
defense of a claim, Tyler will not (and will cause its Affiliates and
Representatives not to) admit any liability with respect to, or settle,
compromise or discharge, any such claim without the prior written consent of
the Shareholders Representative, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld. The Indemnifying Party shall not settle any such Third Party claim
without the consent of the Indemnified Party, unless the settlement thereof
imposes no liability or obligation on, and includes a complete release from
liability of, the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party desires to
accept a final and complete settlement of any such Third Party claim and
the Indemnified Party refuses to consent to such settlement within ten
Business Days, then the Indemnifying Partys liability under this _Section
11.3_ with respect to such Third Party claim shall be limited to the amount so
offered in settlement by said Third Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that
notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
refuse to consent to any such proposed settlement and the Indemnifying Partys
liability hereunder shall not be limited by the amount of the proposed
settlement if such settlement does not provide for the complete release of the
Indemnified Party. If, upon receiving notice, the Indemnifying Party does not
timely undertake to defend such matter to which the Indemnified Party is
entitled to indemnification hereunder, or fails diligently to pursue such
defense, the Indemnified Party may undertake such defense through counsel of
its choice, at the cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, and the
Indemnified Party may seek indemnification for any and all Losses based upon,
arising from or relating to such claim;

 



-56-  provided that, the Indemnifying Party may nonetheless participate (at its
own expense) in the defense of such claim and the Indemnified Party will
consult with the Indemnifying Party in respect of such defense.

11.4 _Non-Third Party Claims_. In the event that any Indemnified Party asserts
the existence of a claim giving rise to Losses (but excluding claims
resulting from the assertion of liability by a Third Party), such party shall
give prompt written notice to the Indemnifying Party. Such written notice
shall state that it is being given pursuant to this  _Section 11.4_, specify
the nature and amount of the claim asserted, and the amount of the claim
deemed a valid claim (such date to be established in accordance with the next
sentence), along with all documentation and records in such Indemnified
Partys possession relating to such claim. If such Indemnifying Party, within
60 days after the receipt of such written notice from such Indemnified Party,
shall not give written notice to such Indemnified Party announcing
such Indemnifying Partys intent to contest such assertion of such
Indemnified Party, such assertion shall be deemed accepted and the amount of
such claim shall be deemed a valid claim. In the event, however, that such
Indemnifying Party contests such assertion of a claim by giving such written
notice to the Indemnified Party within said period, then the parties shall act
in good faith to reach agreement regarding such claim.

 

11.5 _Survival of Representations and Warranties and Covenants and
Agreements_. The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set
forth in this Agreement shall survive the Closing as follows: (a) the
representations and warranties set forth in this Agreements shall, except as
set forth in clauses (b) and (c) below, survive the Closing for a period of
18 months from the Closing Date; (b) the representations and warranties
contained in _Sections 4.1_ (Authority; Binding Agreement), _4.4_
(Ownership), _5.1_ (Due Organization and Qualification), _5.2_ (Authority;
Binding Agreement), _5.5_ (Capitalization), _6.1_ (Due Organization and
Authority), and _6.2_ (Authority; Binding Agreement) (collectively, the "
_Fundamental Representations_ ") shall survive until the fifth anniversary of
the Closing; and (c) the representations and warranties contained in _Section
5.18_ (Taxes) (the " _Tax Representations_ ") shall survive until the
expiration of all applicable statutes of limitations, including
any extensions thereof, plus 60 days (whether permissive or otherwise); (d)
the covenants and agreements that are to be performed prior to Closing shall
not survive the Closing; and (e) the covenants and agreements that are to be
performed all or in part after Closing shall survive until either the date
provided herein or, if no date is provided, the expiration of the applicable
statutes of limitations (in each case, the " _Survival Period_ "). Each
representation and warranty made in this Agreement shall expire on the last
day, if any, that claims for breaches of such representation or warranty may
be made, except that any such representation or warranty that has been made
the subject of a claim or the breach of which is the subject to a written
notice before such expiration date shall survive with respect to such claim or
notice of beach until the final resolution of such claim or breach.

 

11.6 _Certain Limitations_.

 

(a) _Indemnification Basket_. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the
contrary, neither the Shareholders, on the one hand, nor the Tyler Entities,
on the other hand, shall be entitled to indemnification from the other under
the provisions of _Section 11.1_ or _Section 11.2_, as the case may be,
unless and until the aggregate amount of all Losses subject to
indemnification by such other Party exceeds $3,350,000 (the " _Basket_ "), in
which event the

 



-57-  Indemnifying Party shall be required to pay or be liable for all such Losses
from the first dollar; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Basket shall not be
applicable to Losses resulting from (i) any breach of a Fundamental
Representation or a Tax Representation or (ii) actual fraud.

(b) _Indemnification Limitation_. Notwithstanding anything contained herein
to the contrary, the aggregate indemnification obligation of the Shareholders
under _Section 11.1_ or the Tyler Entities under _Section 11.2_ shall be
limited to an amount equal to the Escrow Amount. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the limitations set forth in this _Section 11.6(b)_ shall not
apply to (i) any breach of a Fundamental Representation or a Tax
Representation or (ii) actual fraud.

 

(c) _Read Out of Materiality_. For purposes of determining the amount of any
Loss suffered by an Indemnified Party for purposes of  _Sections 11.1_ or
_11.2_ , but not for the purposes of determining whether a representation or
warranty has been in fact violated, all such representations and warranties
shall be read as if any and all exceptions, limitations, restrictions,
qualifications, and exclusions contained in such representations and
warranties based or conditioned on the terms "material," or "materially" were
deleted.

 

(d) _Effect of Insurance Proceeds_. Payments by an Indemnifying Party pursuant
to _Section 11.1_ or _Section 11.2_ in respect of any Loss shall be limited
to the amount of any liability or damage that remains after deducting
therefrom any insurance proceeds and any indemnity, contribution or other
similar payment received or reasonably expected to be received by the
Indemnified Party (or the Surviving Company) in respect of any such claim. The
Indemnified Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to recover
under insurance policies or indemnity, contribution or other similar
agreements for any Losses prior to seeking indemnification under this
Agreement.

(e) _Effect of Tax Benefits_. Payments by an Indemnifying Party pursuant to
_Section 11.1_ or _Section 11.2_ in respect of any Loss shall be reduced by
an amount equal to any Tax benefit realized or reasonably expected to be
realized as a result of such Loss by the Indemnified Party.

 

(f) _Limitation of Liability_. Except with respect to indemnified Losses
required to be paid to a Third Party as part of a Third Party claim under
this _ARTICLE XI_ , in no event shall any Indemnifying Party be liable to any
Indemnified Party for any punitive, incidental, consequential, special or
indirect damages, including loss of future revenue or income, loss of
business reputation or opportunity relating to the breach or alleged breach
of this Agreement, or diminution of value or any damages based on any type of
multiple.

 

(g) _Mitigation of Losses_. Each Indemnified Party shall take, and cause its
Affiliates to take, all reasonable steps to mitigate any Loss upon becoming
aware of any event or circumstance that would be reasonably expected to, or
does, give rise thereto, including incurring costs only to the minimum extent
necessary to remedy the breach that gives rise to such Loss.

 

(h) _Knowledge_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, Losses for which the Shareholders may be liable pursuant to
_Section 11.1_ shall exclude all Losses relating to the breach of any
representation or warranty of the Principal Shareholder or NWS to the extent
the Shareholders Representative establishes to a reasonable certainty
that any

 



-58-  Tyler Entity had actual Knowledge as of the Closing of material information
that is materially inconsistent with the representation or warranty on which
the claim of the Tyler Entity Indemnified Party is based, and could
reasonably be expected to have an understanding of the relevance of such
materially inconsistent information to such representation and warranty, and
thereby it can reasonably be concluded that the Tyler Entity has waived the
right to rely on such representation or warranty or should be estopped from
asserting such claim as a result thereof. The Tyler Entities expressly
acknowledge the Shareholders right to establish that the Tyler Entities have
waived such right or should otherwise be estopped from asserting such claim
based on the breach of such representation or warranty due to such actual
Knowledge.

 

11.7 _Payments; Indemnification Escrow Fund_.

 

(a) Once a Loss is agreed to by the Indemnifying Party or finally adjudicated
to be payable pursuant to this _ARTICLE XI_ , and subject to  _Section
11.6(a)_, the Indemnifying Party shall satisfy its obligations within 15
Business Days of such final, non-appealable adjudication by wire transfer of
immediately available funds.

 

(b) Any Losses payable to a Tyler Indemnified Party pursuant to this _ARTICLE
XI_ shall be satisfied: (i) first, from the Escrow Amount; provided that any
Shareholders Representative Expenses incurred in connection with the defense
and settlement of a claim for indemnity under this _ARTICLE XI_ shall also be
deemed to be Losses to be satisfied from the Escrow Amount, but only to the
extent funds are available following the payment of the Losses due to any
Tyler Indemnified Party in connection with such claim for indemnity, and (ii)
second, to the extent the amount of Losses payable exceeds the amounts
available to the Tyler Indemnified Party from the Escrow Amount, such excess
shall be an obligation of the Shareholders, severally and not jointly (limited
to their Pro Rata Shares), except with respect to Losses that are
indemnifiable under  _Section 11.1(a)(i)_, which shall be a several
obligation of the Principal Shareholder responsible for the breach and not
limited by his Pro Rata Share.

 

(c) Indemnification payments under this Agreement from the Escrow Amount shall
be satisfied from the Escrowed Cash and the Escrowed Shares pro rata to the
original amounts thereof deposited into the Escrow Account.

(d) For purposes of determining indemnification payments under this Agreement
that are satisfied by the release of Escrowed Shares from the Escrow Account,
the value of an Escrowed Share shall be deemed to be equal to the Average
Trading Price.

 

(e) Upon the termination of the Escrow Account pursuant to the terms of the
Escrow Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall pay (or deliver, in the case of
Escrowed Shares) any amounts remaining in the Escrow Account (i) first, to the
Shareholders Representative for any Shareholders Representative Expenses,
and (ii) second, to the Shareholders as set forth in the Escrow Agreement in
accordance with their Pro Rata Shares.

11.8 _Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. All indemnification
payments made under this _ARTICLE XI_ shall be treated by the Parties for Tax
purposes as an adjustment to the Total Cash Consideration or Total Stock
Consideration, based upon the source of the indemnity payment, unless
otherwise required by applicable Tax Law.

 



-59- 11.9 _Exclusive Remedy_. The Parties acknowledge and agree that their sole and
exclusive remedy with respect to any and all claims (other than claims
arising from actual fraud on the part of a Party in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement) for any breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant, agreement, or obligation set forth in
this Agreement, except to the extent subject to _ARTICLE VIII_ , shall be
pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this _ARTICLE XI_. In
furtherance of the foregoing, each Party hereby waives, to the fullest extent
permitted under Law, any and all rights, claims, and causes of action for any
breach of any such representation, warranty, covenant, agreement, or
obligation it may have against the other Parties and their Affiliates arising
under or based upon any Law, except pursuant to the indemnification
provisions set forth in this _ARTICLE XI_. Nothing in this _Section 11.9_
shall limit any Persons right to seek and obtain any equitable relief to
which it shall be entitled or to seek any remedy on account of any Partys
actual fraud.

ARTICLE XII

 

NONCOMPETITION COVENANTS

 

12.1 _Prohibited Activities by the Principal Shareholder_.

 

(a) For no additional consideration, the Principal Shareholder will not for
five years following the Closing Date, directly or indirectly, for himself or
on behalf of or in conjunction with any other Person of whatever nature:

(i) engage, as an officer, director, shareholder, owner, partner, joint
venturer, or in a managerial or advisory capacity, whether as an employee,
independent contractor, consultant or advisor, or as a sales representative,
in any Competitive Business in the Territory;

 

(ii) call upon any Person that is, at that time, or which has been, within one
year prior to that time, a customer of NWS, Tyler, the Surviving Company, or
any of their respective subsidiaries within the Territory for the purpose of
soliciting or selling services or products in a Competitive Business within
the Territory; or

 

(iii) call upon any Person, who is, at that time, an employee, contractor, or
consultant of Tyler or the Surviving Company or any of their respective
subsidiaries, for the purpose or with the intent or effect of enticing such
employee or consultant away from or out of the employ or service with Tyler or
the Surviving Company or any of their respective subsidiaries.

 

(b) Notwithstanding the above, _Section 12.1(a)_ shall not be deemed to
prohibit the Principal Shareholder (i) from acquiring, as a passive investor
with no involvement in the operation of the business, not more than five
percent of the capital stock of a Competitive Business whose stock is publicly
traded on a national securities exchange, automated quotation system,
or over-the-counter, (ii) engaging in any activity on behalf of Tyler (or any
of its Affiliates), or (iii) from acquiring any portion of the Total Stock
Consideration.

 

12.2 _Equitable Relief_. Because of the difficulty of measuring economic
losses to Tyler and the Surviving Company as a result of a breach of the
foregoing covenants, because a breach of such covenant would diminish the
value of the assets and business of NWS being acquired

 



-60-  pursuant to this Agreement, and because of the immediate and irreparable
damage that could be caused to Tyler and the Surviving Company for which it
would have no other adequate remedy, the Principal Shareholder agrees that
the foregoing covenants may be enforced against him by injunctions,
restraining orders, and other equitable actions.

 

12.3 _Reasonable Restraint_. It is agreed by the Parties that the foregoing
covenants in this _ARTICLE XII_ are necessary in terms of time, activity, and
territory to protect Tylers and the Surviving Companys interest in the
assets and business being acquired pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and
impose a reasonable restraint on the Principal Shareholder in light of the
activities and business of NWS on the date of the execution of this Agreement
and the current plans of NWS.

12.4  _Severability; Reformation_. The covenants in this _ARTICLE XII_ are
severable and separate, and the unenforceability of any specific covenant
shall not affect the continuing validity and enforceability of any other
covenant. In the event any court of competent jurisdiction shall determine
that the scope, time, or territorial restrictions set forth in this _ARTICLE
XII_ are unreasonable and therefore unenforceable, then it is the intention of
the Parties that such restrictions be enforced to the fullest extent that the
court deems reasonable and this Agreement shall thereby be reformed.

12.5 _Material and Independent Covenant_. The Principal Shareholder
acknowledges that his respective agreements and the covenants set forth in
this _ARTICLE XII_ are material conditions to the Tyler Entities agreements
to execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby and that the Tyler Entities would not have entered into
this Agreement without such covenants. All of the covenants in this _ARTICLE
XII_ shall be construed as an agreement independent of any other provision in
this Agreement.

ARTICLE XIII

 

NONDISCLOSURE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION

 

13.1 _General_. The Principal Shareholder recognizes and acknowledges that he
had in the past, currently has, or in the future will have, access to certain
confidential information relating to the business of NWS, the Surviving
Company, and Tyler, such as lists of customers, operational policies, and
pricing and cost policies that are, and following the Closing will be,
valuable, special and unique assets of the Surviving Company and Tyler. The
Principal Shareholder agrees that he will not use or disclose such
confidential information to any Person for any purpose whatsoever, except as
is required in the course of performing his duties, if any, to NWS prior to
the Closing or to Tyler or the Surviving Company after the Closing or with
regard to enforcing his rights under this Agreement, unless (a) such
information becomes known to the public generally through no fault of the
Principal Shareholder, or (b) disclosure is required by Law, _provided_ that
prior to disclosing any information pursuant to this clause (b) the Principal
Shareholder shall, if possible, give prior written notice thereof to Tyler
and provide Tyler with the opportunity to contest such disclosure.

13.2 _Equitable Relief_. Because of the difficulty of measuring economic
losses as a result of the breach of the foregoing covenants, because a breach
of such covenant would diminish the value of the assets and business of NWS
being sold pursuant to this Agreement or

 



-61-  the business of Tyler, and because of the immediate and irreparable damage
that would be caused for which the Surviving Company and Tyler would have no
other adequate remedy, the Principal Shareholder agrees that the foregoing
covenants may be enforced against him by injunctions, restraining orders and
other equitable actions. Nothing herein shall be construed as prohibiting
Tyler or the Surviving Company from pursuing any other available remedy for
such breach or threatened breach, including the recovery of damages.

ARTICLE XIV

 

FEDERAL SECURITIES ACT

 

14.1 _Restricted Securities_.

 

(a) The shares of Tyler Common Stock constituting the Total Stock
Consideration to be issued in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement will not be registered under the Securities Act and therefore may
not be resold without compliance with the Securities Act (collectively, the "
_Restricted Shares_ "). Certificates representing the Restricted Shares shall
bear the following legend:

The shares represented by this certificate were not issued in a transaction
registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended ("Securities Act"),
or any applicable state securities laws. The shares represented hereby have
been acquired for investment and may not be sold or transferred unless such
sale or transfer is covered by an effective registration statement under the
Securities Act and applicable state securities laws or, in the opinion of
counsel to the issuer, is exempt from the registration requirements of the
Securities Act and such laws.

 

(b) Each Shareholder to be issued shares of Tyler Common Stock as set forth on
_Schedule 3.2(b)_ shall be required, as a condition precedent to being
issued any Restricted Shares, to execute and deliver to Tyler, not later than
ten Business Days prior to the Closing Date, an Investment Representation
Letter in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Tyler and
the Principal Shareholder (each, an " _Investment Representation Letter_ "),
pursuant to which each such Shareholder shall acknowledge that: (i) it is
being issued Restricted Shares; and (ii) such Restricted Shares are being
or will be acquired by such Shareholder solely for its own account, for
investment purposes only, and with no present intention of distributing,
selling, or otherwise disposing of them in connection with a distribution.
Each such Shareholder shall also be required, in the Investment
Representation Letter, to covenant, warrant, and represent to Tyler that none
of such Restricted Shares will be, directly or indirectly, offered, sold,
assigned, pledged, hypothecated, transferred, or otherwise disposed of except
after full compliance with all of the applicable provisions of the Securities
Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC.

 

14.2 _Economic Risk; Sophistication; Accredited Investors_.

 

(a) The Principal Shareholder covenants, warrants, and represents to Tyler
that he: (i) is able to bear the economic risk of an investment in the
Restricted Shares and can afford to sustain a total loss of such investment;
(ii) has such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters that
he is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of the 

 



-62-  proposed investment and therefore has the capacity to protect his own
interests in connection with the acquisition of the Restricted Shares pursuant
hereto; (iii) is an "accredited investor," as that term is defined in
Regulation D under the Securities Act; and (iv) has (by himself or together
with his Representatives) had an adequate opportunity to ask questions and
receive answers from the officers of Tyler concerning, among other matters,
Tyler, its management, and its plans for the operation of its business.

(b) Each Shareholder receiving Restricted Shares as set forth on _Schedule
3.2(b)_ shall be required, in the Investment Representation Letter and as a
condition precedent to being issued any Restricted Shares, to covenant,
warrant, and represent to Tyler that it: (i) is able to bear the economic
risk of an investment in the Restricted Shares and can afford to sustain a
total loss of such investment; (ii) has such knowledge and experience in
financial and business matters that it is capable of evaluating the merits
and risks of the proposed investment and therefore has the capacity to protect
its own interests in connection with the acquisition of the Restricted Shares
pursuant hereto; (iii) is an "accredited investor," as that term is defined
in Regulation D under the Securities Act; and (iv) has (by itself or together
with its Representatives) had an adequate opportunity to ask questions and
receive answers from the officers of Tyler concerning, among other matters,
Tyler, its management, and its plans for the operation of its business.

(c) Each Shareholder receiving Restricted Shares as set forth on _Schedule
3.2(b)_ shall be required, as a condition precedent to being issued any
Restricted Shares, to complete and return to Tyler, not later than ten
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, an investor
suitability questionnaire, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
Tyler and the Principal Shareholder (each, an " _Investor Suitability
Questionnaire_ "), and such Shareholders status as an "accredited investor"
shall be subject to verification by Tyler based upon the review of the
completed Investor Suitability Questionnaire by Tyler and its Representatives
and all other information available to Tyler.

 

14.3 _Rule 144 Reporting_. With a view to making available the benefits of
certain rules and regulations of the SEC that may permit the resale of Tyler
Common Stock to the public without registration, for a period of three years
after the Closing, Tyler agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to:

 

(a) make and keep public information (as such terms are defined in Rule 144)
regarding Tyler available;

 

(b) file with the SEC in a timely manner all reports and other documents
required of Tyler under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act; and

(c) furnish the Principal Shareholder upon written request a written statement
by Tyler as to its compliance with the reporting requirements of Rule 144,
the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, a copy of the most recent annual or
quarterly report of Tyler, and such other reports and documents so filed as
the Principal Shareholder may reasonably request in availing himself of any
rule or regulation of the SEC allowing the Principal Shareholder to sell any
such shares without registration.

15.2 _Assignment_. No Party may assign this Agreement or any of its rights or
obligations arising hereunder without the prior written consent of the other
Parties; _provided, however_ , that, without the consent of NWS, Tyler may,
without relieving Tyler from its liabilities or obligations hereunder, (i)
assign this Agreement, and its rights and obligations hereunder, to an
Affiliate of Tyler or to an entity formed, controlled and primarily owned by
Tyler or (ii) make a collateral assignment of this Agreement, and its rights
and obligations hereunder, to any Financing Source in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby.

15.3 _Entire Agreement, Amendments, and Waiver_. This Agreement (together
with any Exhibits, Annexes, and Schedules hereto) and all certificates,

contain the entire understanding of the Parties with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby and supersede all prior agreements,

obligations hereunder may be waived only in writing by that Party

character, nor shall the waiver constitute a continuing waiver unless
otherwise expressly provided. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, _Section 15.2_, this _Section 15.3_, _Section 15.4_,

cancelled or waived in a manner that impacts or is adverse in any respect to
any Financing Source without the prior consent of such Financing Source.

AGREEMENT (INCLUDING ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION BASED UPON, ARISING OUT OF,

15.7 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement which is invalid
or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be
ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability and, unless
the effect of such invalidity or unenforceability would prevent the Parties

VIII_ and _ARTICLE XI_ , nothing in this Agreement shall provide any benefit

remedy, or right of any kind, it being the intent of the Parties that this
Agreement shall not be construed as a third-party beneficiary Contract;
_provided_ that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, the Financing Sources shall be third party beneficiaries of the
provisions set forth in _Section 15.2_, _Section 15.3_, _Section 15.4_,
this _Section 15.8_, and _Section 15.15_.

 

15.9 _Time of Essence_. With regard to all dates and time periods set forth or

15.10 _Disclosure Schedule_. The information in the Disclosure Schedule
constitutes (a) exceptions or qualifications to representations, warranties,
covenants, and obligations of NWS as set forth in this Agreement or (b)
descriptions or lists of assets and liabilities and other items referred to in
this Agreement. Neither the specification of any dollar amount in any
representation or warranty nor the disclosure of a document or information in
the Disclosure Schedule is intended, or shall be construed or offered in any
dispute between the Parties as evidence of, the materiality of such dollar
amount, document, or information, nor does it establish any standard of
materiality upon which to judge the inclusion or omission of any similar
documents or information in that Schedule or any other Schedule. The
information

 



-67-  contained in this Agreement and the Disclosure Schedule is disclosed solely
for the purposes of this Agreement, and no information contained herein or
therein shall be deemed to be an admission of any matter whatsoever,
including of any violation of Law or breach of any Contract. An exception or
qualification set forth in the Disclosure Schedule with respect to a
particular representation or warranty shall be deemed to be an exception
or qualification with respect to all other applicable representations and
warranties to the extent that it is reasonably apparent from the face of such
disclosure that such disclosure is applicable to such other Disclosure
Schedule or Disclosure Schedules, whether or not such exception or
qualification is so numbered or such other representations and warranties
expressly refer to a Schedule. The Disclosure Schedule shall not be construed
as indicating that any disclosed information is required to be disclosed, and
no disclosure shall be construed as an admission that such information is
material to, or required to be disclosed by, NWS. Capitalized terms used in
the Disclosure Schedule that are not defined therein shall have the meaning
given them in this Agreement. From time to time prior to the Closing, NWS
shall have the right (but not the obligation) to supplement or amend the
Disclosure Schedule, with express reference therein to the applicable
Schedule(s), to reflect the existence or happening of any matter hereafter
arising or occurring which, if existing as of the date hereof, would have been
required to be set forth or described in the Disclosure Schedule (each such
amendment or supplement, a " _Disclosure Schedule Supplement_ "), and each
such Disclosure Schedule Supplement shall be deemed to be incorporated into
and to supplement and amend the Disclosure Schedule as of the Closing Date. In
the event such event, development, or occurrence that is the subject of the
Disclosure Schedule Supplement constitutes or relates to something that has
had a Material Adverse Effect, then Tyler shall have the right to terminate
this Agreement for failure to satisfy the closing conditions set forth in
_Sections 9.2(a)_ or _9.2(c)_ , as applicable; _provided_ , _however_ , that
if Tyler has the right to, but does not elect to terminate this Agreement
within five Business Days of its receipt of such Disclosure Schedule
Supplement, then Tyler shall be deemed to have irrevocably waived any right to
terminate this Agreement with respect to such matter under the conditions set
forth in _Sections 9.2(a)_ or _9.2(c)_ , as applicable.

 

15.11 _Enforcement_. The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in
the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms on a timely basis or were otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and
to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any
court identified in _Section 15.4(b)_, this being in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

 

15.12 _Exclusivity of Agreement_. The Parties have voluntarily agreed to
define their rights, liabilities, and obligations respecting the subject
matter of this Agreement exclusively in contract pursuant to the express terms
and provisions of this Agreement, and the Parties expressly disclaim that they
are owed any duties not expressly set forth in this Agreement. The sole
and exclusive remedies for any breach of the terms and provisions of this
Agreement (including any representations and warranties set forth herein)
shall be those remedies available at law or in equity for breach of contract
only (as such contract remedies may be further limited or excluded pursuant
to the express terms of this Agreement); and the Parties hereby waive and
release any and all tort claims and causes of action that may be based upon,
arise out of, or relate to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution, or
performance of this Agreement (including

 



-68-  any tort claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of, or related to
any representation or warranty made in or in connection with this Agreement or
as an inducement to enter into this Agreement).

15.13 _Shareholders  Representative_.

 

(a) To the extent permitted by Law, the Shareholders hereby irrevocably
appoint the Shareholders Representative as the representative, agent, proxy,
and attorney-in-fact for all the Shareholders for all purposes under this
Agreement including the full power and authority on the Shareholders behalf:
(i) to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement including
the execution and delivery of all other agreements, instruments, and documents
contemplated hereby or executed in connection herewith, (ii) to negotiate
disputes arising under, or relating to, this Agreement, and the other
agreements, instruments, and documents contemplated hereby or executed in
connection herewith, (iii) to receive and disburse to the Shareholders any
funds received on behalf of the Shareholders under this Agreement, or
otherwise, (iv) to withhold any amounts received on behalf of the
Shareholders pursuant to this Agreement, or otherwise to satisfy any and all
obligations or liabilities incurred by the Shareholders Representative in the
performance of its duties hereunder, (v) to execute and deliver any amendment
or waiver to this Agreement, and the other agreements, instruments, and
documents contemplated hereby or executed in connection herewith (without the
prior approval of the Shareholders), and (vi) to take all other actions to be
taken by or on behalf of the Shareholders in connection with this Agreement,
and the other agreements, instruments, and documents contemplated hereby or
executed in connection herewith. The Shareholders, by executing
this Agreement, further agree that such agency and proxy are coupled with an
interest, are therefore irrevocable without the consent of the Shareholders
Representative and shall survive the death, incapacity, bankruptcy,
dissolution, or liquidation of any Shareholder. All decisions and actions by
the Shareholders Representative shall be binding upon all of the
Shareholders, and no Shareholder shall have the right to object, dissent,
protest, or otherwise contest the same. The Shareholders Representative
shall have no duties or obligations hereunder except those set forth herein
and such duties and obligations shall be determined solely by the express
provisions of this Agreement.

 

(b) Each Shareholder hereby severally, for itself only and not jointly, agrees
to indemnify and hold harmless the Shareholders Representative and his
agents and assigns against all liabilities, claims, actions, damages, losses,
and expenses (including legal and other professional fees and expenses, and
litigation costs) of any kind (whether known or unknown, fixed or contingent)
(" _Shareholders  Representative Expenses_") arising out of or in connection
with (i) the Shareholders Representatives omissions to act, or actions
taken, resulting from, arising out of, or incurred in connection with, or
otherwise with respect to this Agreement, or (ii) services taken with respect
to this Agreement or believed to be in the scope of the Shareholders
Representative or his agents and assigns authority, provided that
the Shareholders Representative has not acted with fraud, in each case as
any such Shareholders Representative Expenses is suffered or incurred. The
Shareholders Representative shall not have by reason of this Agreement a
fiduciary relationship in respect of any Shareholder. The Shareholders
Representative shall not be liable to any Shareholder for any action taken or
omitted by the Shareholders Representative or any agent employed by the
Shareholders Representative hereunder or under any other document or
instrument contemplated hereby, or in connection

 



-69-  therewith, except that the Shareholders Representative shall not be
relieved of any liability imposed by law for fraud. The Shareholders
Representative shall not be liable to any of the Shareholders for action
taken in good faith. The Shareholders Representative shall not be required to
make any inquiry concerning either the performance or observance of any of the
terms, provisions or conditions of this Agreement. Neither the Shareholders
Representative nor any agent employed by it shall incur any liability to any
Shareholder by virtue of the failure or refusal of the Shareholders
Representative for any reason to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby or relating to the performance of its other duties
hereunder, except for actions or omissions constituting fraud.

(c) If the Shareholders Representative resigns or is otherwise unable or
unwilling to serve in such capacity, then the Principal Shareholder will
appoint a new Person to serve as a replacement for such Shareholders
Representative and will provide prompt written notice thereof to Tyler. Until
such notice is received, Tyler will be entitled to rely on the actions and
statements of the previous Shareholders Representative and all such actions
and statements shall be binding on the Shareholders.

15.14 _Attorney-Client Privilege_. No Tyler Entity nor the Surviving Company
may assert any privilege in order to prevent disclosure to any Shareholder or
any of their Affiliates of any communications between NWS and Honigman Miller
Schwartz and Cohn LLP that occurred before the Closing.

 

15.15 _No Recourse to Financing Sources_. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, NWS, each Shareholder and the Shareholders Representative (in
_each_ case on behalf of itself and each of its shareholders, partners,
members, Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, and
representatives) hereby waives any rights or claims against Financing Source
in connection with this Agreement, the Debt Financing, and the Financing
Letter, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort, or otherwise, and NWS,
each Shareholder and the Shareholders Representative (in each case on behalf
of itself and each of its shareholders, partners, members, Affiliates,
directors, officers, employees, agents, and representatives) agrees not to
commence (and if commenced agrees to dismiss or otherwise terminate) any
action or proceeding against any Financing Source in connection with this
Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby or thereby (including any
action or proceeding relating to the Debt Financing or the Financing Letter).
In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing waiver, it is agreed
that no Financing Source shall have any liability for any claims, losses,
settlements, liabilities, damages, costs, expenses, fines, or penalties to
NWS, any Shareholder, or the Shareholders Representative (or any of their
respective shareholders, partners, members, Affiliates, directors, officers,
employees, agents, and representatives) in connection with this Agreement or
any transaction contemplated hereby or thereby (including any action or
proceeding relating to the Debt Financing or the Financing Letter). Nothing
in this _Section 15.15_ shall in any way (a) expand the circumstances in
which any Tyler Entity may be liable under this Agreement or as a result of
the transactions contemplated hereby (including as a result of the Debt
Financing) or (b) limit or qualify the obligations and liabilities of the
parties to the Financing Letter to each other thereunder or in connection
