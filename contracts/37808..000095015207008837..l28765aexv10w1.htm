interests of their respective companies and their shareholders to consummate the strategic business
combination transaction provided for in this Agreement in which Omega will, on the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, merge with and into FNB (the &#147; Merger &#147;), so
that FNB is the surviving company in the Merger (sometimes referred to in such capacity as the
&#147;Surviving Company&#148;); and
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, for federal income Tax (as defined in Section&nbsp;3.10(b)) purposes, it is intended that

interest, rounded to the nearest cent, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (a)&nbsp;the Average
Closing Price (as defined below) as of the Closing Date by (b)&nbsp;the fraction of a share (calculated
to the nearest ten-thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of FNB Common Stock, to which such

each Omega Plan that is intended to be a &#147;qualified plan&#148; within the meaning of Section 401(a) of
the Code (&#147;Omega Qualified Plans&#148;). The IRS has issued a favorable determination letter with

entitled to rely on a favorable opinion issued by the IRS, and, to the knowledge of Omega, there
are no existing circumstances and no events have occurred that would reasonably be expected to
adversely affect the qualified status of any Omega Qualified Plan or the related trust. No trust
funding any Omega Plan is intended to meet the requirements of Code Section&nbsp;501(c)(9). To the

fiduciary, has engaged in any &#147;prohibited transaction&#148; (as defined in Section&nbsp;4975 of the Code or
