 (b) FNB may at any time change the method of effecting the combination and Omega shall cooperate in such efforts, including by entering into an appropriate amendment to this Agreement (to the extent such amendment only changes the method of effecting the business combination and does not substantively affect this Agreement or the rights and obligations of the parties or their respective shareholders hereunder); provided, however, that no such change shall (i) alter or change the amount or kind of the Merger Consideration (as defined in Section 1.4(a)) provided for in this Agreement, (ii) adversely affect the Tax treatment of Omegas shareholders as a result of receiving the Merger Consideration or the Tax treatment of either party pursuant to this Agreement or (iii) materially impede or delay consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

The Merger shall become effective as set forth in the articles of merger (the "Articles of Merger") that shall be filed with the Secretary of State of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the Secretary of State of the State of Florida on or before the Closing Date (as defined in Section 9.1).

The directors of the Surviving Company immediately after the Merger shall be (i) the directors of FNB immediately prior to the Merger and (ii) three current independent members of Omegas Board of Directors (the "Omega Designees") as are mutually agreed by FNB and Omega. The executive officers of the Surviving Company immediately after the Merger shall be the executive officers of FNB immediately prior to the Merger. 

   

 1.4 _Conversion of Omega Capital Stock_. 

  

 (a) Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, each share of common stock, $5.00 par value, of Omega ("Omega Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than Treasury Shares (as defined in Section 1.4(b)) shall, by virtue of the Merger, no longer be outstanding and shall as of the Effective Time automatically be converted into and shall thereafter represent the right to receive as merger consideration (the "Merger Consideration") 2.022 shares (the "Exchange Ratio") of common stock, $.01 par value, of FNB ("FNB Common Stock"). 

    ##### 

  

     

 (b) At and after the Effective Time, each Treasury Share shall be cancelled and retired and no shares of FNB Common Stock or other consideration shall be issued in exchange therefor. "Treasury Shares" means shares of Omega Common Stock held by Omega or any of its Subsidiaries (as defined in Section 3.1(c)) or by FNB or any of its Subsidiaries, other than in a fiduciary, including custodial or agency, capacity or as a result of debts previously contracted in good faith. 

   

 (c) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of Omega shall be closed as to holders of Omega Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time and no transfer of Omega Common Stock by any such holder shall thereafter be made or recognized. If, after the Effective Time, certificates representing Omega Common Stock ("Certificates") are properly presented in accordance with Section 2.2 of this Agreement to the Exchange Agent (as defined in Section 2.2(a)), such Certificates shall be canceled and exchanged for certificates representing the number of whole shares of FNB Common Stock into which the Omega Common Stock represented thereby was converted in the Merger, plus any payment for any fractional share of FNB Common Stock without any interest thereon and any dividends or distributions to which the holder of such Certificates is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(b). 

   

 (d) Each holder of Omega Common Stock shall have the option of enrolling the whole shares of FNB Common Stock issuable to such shareholder upon the consummation of the Merger in FNBs Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan (the "DRSP Plan"). Each Omega shareholder electing to enroll in the DRSP Plan shall be issued a certificate representing the number of whole shares of FNB Common Stock received in the Merger, and any future dividends will be reinvested in accordance with the DRSP Plan. 

   

 (e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of Omega Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fractional share of FNB Common Stock, after taking into account all Certificates delivered by such holder, shall receive an amount in cash, without interest, rounded to the nearest cent, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (a) the Average Closing Price (as defined below) as of the Closing Date by (b) the fraction of a share (calculated to the nearest ten-thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of FNB Common Stock, to which such holder would otherwise be entitled. No such holder shall be entitled to dividends or other rights in respect of any such fractional shares. "Average Closing Price" means, as of any specified date, the average composite closing price of FNB Common Stock on the NYSE as reported in New York Stock Exchange Composite Transactions in The Wall Street Journal (Eastern Edition) or, if not reported therein, in another mutually agreed upon authoritative source, for each of the 20 consecutive trading days ending on and including the fifth such trading day prior to the specified date rounded to the nearest ten-thousandth.

FNB shall assume each such Omega Stock Option in accordance with the terms of the relevant Omega Stock Plan and stock option or other agreement by which it is evidenced, except that from and after the Effective Time: (i) FNB and the Compensation Committee of its Board of Directors shall be substituted for Omega and the committee of the Board of Directors of Omega, including, if applicable, the entire Board of Directors of Omega, administering such Omega Stock Plan, (ii) each Omega Stock Option assumed by FNB may be exercised solely for shares of FNB Common Stock, (iii) the number of shares of FNB Common Stock subject to such Omega Stock Option shall be equal to the number of shares of Omega Common Stock subject to such Omega Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, provided that any fractional shares of FNB Common Stock resulting from such multiplication shall be rounded down to the nearest share, and (iv) the exercise price per share of FNB Common Stock under each such option shall be the amount (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to the per share exercise price under each such Omega Stock Option prior to the Effective Time divided by the Exchange Ratio. Notwithstanding clauses (iii) and (iv) of the preceding sentence, each Omega Stock Option that is an "incentive stock option" shall be adjusted as required by Section 424 of the Code, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, so as not to constitute a modification, extension or renewal of the option within the meaning of Section 424(h) of the Code. FNB and Omega agree to take all necessary steps to effect the provisions of this Section 1.6(a). As of the Effective Time, FNB shall issue to each holder of each outstanding Omega Stock Option that has been assumed by FNB (the "Assumed Stock Options") a document evidencing the conversion and assumption of such Omega Stock Option by FNB pursuant to this Section 1.6(a). 

   

 (b) _Omega Restricted Stock Units_. Effective immediately prior to the Effective Time, each then outstanding restricted stock unit (each an "Omega RSU"), pursuant 

   ##### 

  

   

to the Omega Stock Plans and the award agreements evidencing the grants
thereunder, granted to any current or former employee of Omega or any of its
Subsidiaries shall become vested in full. At the Effective Time, each holder
of an Omega RSU shall be entitled to receive a number of shares of FNB Common
Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio multiplied by the total number of shares of
Omega Common Stock subject to such Omega RSU. 

   

 (c) _Omega Employee Stock Ownership Plan_. If requested by FNB, Omega agrees that its Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the "ESOP") shall terminate as of a date not later than March 31, 2008 and, in connection therewith, repay all indebtedness of the ESOP. Appropriate distributions of all of the assets held by the ESOP will be made to the participants in the ESOP as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter in accordance with the provisions of the ESOP and applicable law.

As soon as practicable following the Closing (as defined in Section 9.1), FNB shall file a registration statement on an appropriate form or a post-effective amendment to a previously filed registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") with respect to the issuance of the shares of FNB Common Stock subject to the Assumed Stock Options and shall use its best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement or registration statements (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as such equity awards remain outstanding. 

   

 1.7 _Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Company_. FNBs Charter (as defined in Section 4.1(b)) as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Company until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable law.

   ##### 

  

    

Pennsylvania ("FNB Bank") to enter into a bank merger agreement, the form of
which is attached hereto as Exhibit A (the "Bank Merger Agreement"), that
provides for the merger of Omega Bank with and into FNB Bank (the "Bank
Merger"), in accordance with applicable laws and regulations and the terms of
the Bank Merger Agreement and as soon as practicable after consummation of the

ARTICLE II 

   

EXCHANGE OF SHARES  

  

 2.1 _FNB to Make Merger Consideration Available_. As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time, FNB shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Certificates, for exchange in accordance with this Article II, (i) certificates representing the aggregate number of shares of FNB Common Stock issuable pursuant to this Agreement in exchange for shares of Omega Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger, (ii) immediately available funds equal to any dividends or distributions payable in accordance with Section 2.2(b) and (iii) cash in lieu of any fractional shares (such cash and certificates for shares of FNB Common Stock, collectively being referred to as the "Exchange Fund"), to be issued pursuant to Section 1.4 and paid pursuant to Section 1.4 in exchange for outstanding shares of Omega Common Stock. 

  

 2.2 _Exchange of Shares_. 

  

 (a) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Registrar and Transfer Company (the "Exchange Agent") shall mail to each holder of record of Omega Common Stock a letter of transmittal in customary form as prepared by FNB and reasonably acceptable to Omega which shall specify, among other things, that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares into which the shares of Omega Common Stock represented by such Certificate or Certificates shall have been converted pursuant to this Agreement and any dividends or distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(b). After the Effective Time of the Merger, each holder of a Certificate formerly representing Omega Common Stock, other than Treasury Shares, who surrenders or has surrendered such Certificate or customary affidavits and indemnification regarding the loss or destruction of such Certificate, together with duly executed transmittal materials to the Exchange Agent, shall, upon acceptance thereof, be entitled to a certificate representing FNB Common Stock into which the shares of Omega Common Stock shall have been converted pursuant to Section 1.4, as well as any cash in lieu 

   ##### 

  

   

of any fractional share of FNB Common Stock to which such holder would
otherwise be entitled and any dividends or distributions to which such holder
is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(b). The Exchange Agent shall accept such
Certificate upon compliance with such reasonable and customary terms and
conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange
thereof in accordance with normal practices. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 2.2, each Certificate representing Omega Common
Stock shall be deemed from and after the Effective Time of the Merger to
evidence only the right to receive the Merger Consideration any cash in lieu
of fractional shares into which the shares of Omega Common Stock represented
by such Certificate or Certificates shall have been converted pursuant to
this Agreement and any dividends or distributions to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(b). FNB shall not be obligated to deliver
the Merger Consideration or any check representing cash in lieu of
fractional shares and/or declared but unpaid dividends to which any former
holder of Omega Common Stock is entitled as a result of the Merger until such
holder surrenders his Certificate or Certificates for exchange as provided in
this Section 2.2. If any certificate for shares of FNB Common Stock, or any
check representing cash in lieu of fractional shares and/or declared but
unpaid dividends, is to be issued in a name other than that in which a
Certificate surrendered for exchange is issued, the Certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for
transfer and the person requesting such exchange shall affix any requisite
stock transfer tax stamps to the Certificate surrendered or provide funds for
their purchase or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that
such taxes are not payable. 

   

 (b) Following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the record holder of the Certificates representing whole shares of FNB Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of any dividends or distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Date which have been declared by Omega in respect of shares of Omega Common Stock after the date of this Agreement in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time, (ii) at the time of such surrender, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of FNB Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 1.4 and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time of the Merger and which theretofore had become payable with respect to such whole shares of FNB Common Stock, and (iii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time of the Merger but prior to surrender and a payment date subsequent to surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of FNB Common Stock. After the date of this Agreement, Omega shall coordinate with FNB the declaration of any dividends in respect of Omega Common Stock as provided in Section 6.11. 

   

 (c) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of Omega of the shares of Omega Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time other than to settle transfers of Omega Common 

   ##### 

  

   

Stock that occurred prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to FNB for any reason, they shall be canceled and
exchanged as provided in this Agreement. All shares of FNB Common Stock and
cash in lieu of fractional shares and/or declared but unpaid dividends issued
upon the surrender for exchange of shares of Omega Common Stock or
the provision of customary affidavits and indemnification for lost or
mutilated Certificates in accordance with the terms hereof and the letter of
transmittal, shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to such shares of Omega Common Stock. 

   

 (d) Any portion of the Exchange Fund, including any interest thereon, that remains undistributed to the shareholders of Omega following the passage of 12 months after the Effective Time of the Merger shall be delivered to FNB, upon demand, and any shareholders of Omega who have not theretofore complied with this Section 2.3 shall thereafter look only to FNB for payment of their claim for FNB Common Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of FNB Common Stock and any unpaid dividends or distributions payable in accordance with Section 2.2(b). 

   

 (e) Neither Omega nor FNB shall be liable to any holder of shares of Omega Common Stock or FNB Common Stock, as the case may be, for such shares, or dividends or distributions with respect thereto, or cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. 

   

 (f) The Exchange Agent shall not be entitled to vote or exercise any rights of ownership with respect to the shares of FNB Common Stock held by it from time to time hereunder, except that it shall receive and hold all dividends or other distributions paid or distributed with respect to such shares of FNB Common Stock for the account of the Persons entitled thereto. 

   

 (g) Certificates surrendered for exchange by any Person constituting an Affiliate of Omega for purposes of Rule 144(a) and Rule 145 (an "Affiliate") under the Securities Act shall not be exchanged for certificates representing whole shares of FNB Common Stock until FNB has received a written agreement from such person as provided in Section 6.5. 

   

 2.3 _Adjustments for Dilution and Other Matters_. If prior to the Effective Time of the Merger, (a) FNB shall declare a stock dividend or distribution on FNB Common Stock with a record date prior to the Effective Time of the Merger, or subdivide, split up, reclassify or combine FNB Common Stock, or make a distribution other than a regular quarterly cash dividend not in excess of $.30 per share, on FNB Common Stock in any security convertible into FNB Common Stock, in each case with a record date prior to the Effective Time of the Merger, or (b) the outstanding shares of FNB Common Stock shall have been increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or securities, in each case as a result of a reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, 

   ##### 

  

    

stock split, reverse stock split or other similar change in FNBs
capitalization other than a business combination transaction with another
bank holding company or financial services company, then a proportionate
adjustment or adjustments will be made to the Exchange Ratio, which
adjustment may include, as appropriate, the issuance of securities, property
or cash on the same basis as that on which any of the foregoing shall have
been issued, distributed or paid to holders of FNB Common Stock generally. 

  

 2.4 _Withholding Rights_. The Exchange Agent or, subsequent to the first anniversary of the Effective Time, FNB, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any cash portion of the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of FNB Common Stock, cash dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2(b) and any other cash amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Omega Common Stock such amounts as the Exchange Agent or FNB, as the case may be, is required to deduct and withhold under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law, with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent the amounts are so withheld by the Exchange Agent or FNB, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of shares of Omega Common Stock in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made by the Exchange Agent or FNB, as the case may be.

   ##### 

  

  

 3.9 _Legal Proceedings_. 

  

 (a) There is no pending, or, to Omegas knowledge, threatened, litigation, action, suit, proceeding, investigation or arbitration by any individual, partnership, corporation, trust, joint venture, organization or other entity (each, a "Person") or Governmental Entity that is material to Omega and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in each case with respect to Omega or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or permits, licenses or authorizations. 

   

 (b) There is no material Injunction, judgment, or regulatory restriction (other than those of general application that apply to similarly situated financial or bank holding companies or their Subsidiaries) imposed upon Omega, any of its Subsidiaries or the assets of Omega or any of its Subsidiaries. 

   

 3.10 _Taxes and Tax Returns_. 

  

 (a) Each of Omega and its Subsidiaries has duly and timely filed (including all applicable extensions) all Tax Returns (as defined in subsection (c), below) required to be filed by it on or prior to the date of this Agreement (all such Tax Returns being accurate and complete in all material respects), has timely paid or withheld and timely remitted all Taxes shown thereon as arising and has duly and timely paid or withheld and timely remitted all Taxes (whether or not shown on any Tax Return) that are due and payable or claimed to be due from it by a Governmental Entity other than Taxes that (i) are being contested in good faith, which have not been finally determined, and (ii) have been adequately reserved against in accordance with GAAP on Omegas most recent consolidated financial statements. All required estimated Tax payments sufficient to avoid any underpayment penalties or interest have been made by or on behalf of each of Omega and its Subsidiaries. Neither Omega nor any of its Subsidiaries has granted any extension or waiver of the limitation period for the assessment or collection of Tax that remains in effect. There are no disputes, audits, examinations or proceedings in progress or pending (including any notice received of an intent to conduct an audit or examination), or claims asserted, for Taxes upon Omega or any of its Subsidiaries. No claim has been made by a Governmental Entity in a jurisdiction where Omega or any of its Subsidiaries has not filed Tax Returns such that Omega or any of its Subsidiaries is or may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction. All deficiencies asserted or assessments made as a result of any examinations by any Governmental Entity of the Tax Returns of, or including, Omega or any of its Subsidiaries have been fully paid. No issue has been raised by a Governmental Entity in any prior examination or audit of each of Omega and its Subsidiaries which, by application of the same or similar principles, could reasonably be expected to result in a proposed deficiency in respect of such Governmental Entity for any subsequent taxable period. There are no Liens for Taxes (other than statutory liens for Taxes not yet due and payable) upon any of the assets of Omega or any of its Subsidiaries. Neither Omega nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or is bound by any Tax sharing, allocation or indemnification agreement or arrangement (other than such an agreement or arrangement 

   ##### 

  

   

exclusively between or among Omega and its Subsidiaries). Neither Omega nor
any of its Subsidiaries (A) has been a member of an affiliated group filing a
consolidated federal income Tax Return (other than a group the common parent
of which was Omega) or (B) has any liability for the Taxes of any Person
(other than Omega or any of its Subsidiaries) under Treas. Reg. §1.1502-6
(or any similar provision of state, local or foreign law), or as a transferee
or successor, by contract or otherwise. Neither Omega nor any of its
Subsidiaries has been, within the past two years or otherwise as part of a
"plan (or series of related transactions)" (within the meaning of
Section 355(e) of the Code) of which the Merger is also a part, or a
"distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" (within the meaning
of Section 355(a)(1)(A) of the Code) in a distribution of stock intended to
qualify for tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code. No share
of Omega Common Stock is owned by a Subsidiary of Omega. Omega is not and has
not been a "United States real property holding company" within the meaning
of Section 897(c)(2) of the Code during the applicable period specified in
Section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii) of the Code. Neither Omega, its Subsidiaries nor any
other Person on their behalf has executed or entered into any
written agreement with, or obtained or applied for any written consents or
written clearances or any other Tax rulings from, nor has there been any
written agreement executed or entered into on behalf of any of them with any
Governmental Entity, relating to Taxes, including any IRS private
letter rulings or comparable rulings of any Governmental Entity and closing
agreements pursuant to Section 7121 of the Code or any predecessor provision
thereof or any similar provision of any applicable law, which rulings or
agreements would have a continuing effect after the Effective Time.
Neither Omega nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in a "reportable
transaction," as set forth in Treas. Reg. § 1.6011-4(b), or any transaction
that is the same as or substantially similar to one of the types of
transactions that the IRS has determined to be a tax avoidance transaction and
identified by notice, regulation or other form of published guidance as a
"listed transaction," as set forth in Treas. Reg. § 1.6011-4(b)(2). FNB has
received complete copies of (i) all federal, state, local and foreign income
or franchise Tax Returns of Omega and its Subsidiaries relating to
the taxable periods beginning January 1, 2004 or later and (ii) any audit
report issued within the last three years relating to any Taxes due from or
with respect to Omega or its Subsidiaries. Neither Omega, any of its
Subsidiaries nor FNB (as a successor to Omega) will be required to include
any item of material income in, or exclude any material item of deduction
from, taxable income for any taxable period (or portion thereof) ending after
the Closing Date as a result of any (i) change in method of accounting for a
taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date, (ii) installment sale
or open transaction disposition made on or prior to the Effective Time, (iii)
prepaid amount received on or prior to the Closing Date or (iv) deferred
intercompany gain or any excess loss account of Omega or any of its
Subsidiaries for periods or portions of periods described in Treasury
Regulations under Section 1502 of the Code (or any corresponding or similar
provision of state, local or foreign law) for periods (or portions thereof)
ending on or before the Closing Date.

obligated to contribute, whether or not written, including without limitation
any employee welfare benefit plan within the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA,
any employee pension benefit plan within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA
(whether or not such plan is subject to ERISA), and any bonus, incentive,
deferred compensation, vacation, stock purchase, stock option, severance,
employment, change of control or fringe benefit plan, program or policy. 

  

 "Omega Employment Agreement" means a written contract, offer letter or agreement of Omega or any of its Subsidiaries with or addressed to any individual who is rendering or has rendered services thereto as an employee pursuant to which Omega or any of its Subsidiaries has any actual or contingent liability or obligation to provide compensation and/or benefits in consideration for past, present or future services.

 (b) With respect to each Omega Plan, Omega has delivered or made available to FNB a true, correct and complete copy of: (i) each writing constituting a part of such Omega Plan, including without limitation all plan documents, current employee communications, benefit schedules, trust agreements, and insurance contracts and other funding vehicles; (ii) the most recent Annual Report (Form 5500 Series) and accompanying schedule, if any; (iii) the current summary plan description and any material modifications thereto, if any (in each case, whether or not required to be furnished under ERISA); (iv) the most recent annual financial report, if any; (v) the most recent actuarial report, if any; and (vi) the most recent determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service ("the IRS"), if any. Omega has delivered or made available to FNB a true, correct and complete copy of each material Omega Employment Agreement. 

   

 (c) All material contributions required to be made to any Omega Plan by applicable law or regulation or by any plan document or other contractual undertaking, and all material premiums due or payable with respect to insurance policies funding any Omega Plan, for any period through the date hereof have been timely made or paid in full or, if the contributions or payments are not due on or before the date hereof, have been fully reflected on the financial statements to the extent required by GAAP. Each Omega Benefit Plan that is an employee welfare benefit plan under Section 3(1) of ERISA either (i) is funded through an 

   ##### 

  

   

insurance company contract and is not a "welfare benefit fund" within the
meaning of Section 419 of the Code or (ii) is unfunded. 

   

 (d) With respect to each Omega Plan, Omega and its Subsidiaries have complied, and are now in compliance, in all material respects, with all provisions of ERISA, the Code and all laws and regulations applicable to such Omega Plans. Each Omega Plan has been administered in all material respects in accordance with its terms. There is not now, nor do any circumstances exist that would reasonably be expected to give rise to, any requirement for the posting of security with respect to an Omega Plan or the imposition of any material lien on the assets of Omega or any of its Subsidiaries under ERISA or the Code. Section 3.11(d) of the Omega Disclosure Schedule identifies each Omega Plan that is intended to be a "qualified plan" within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code ("Omega Qualified Plans"). The IRS has issued a favorable determination letter with respect to each Omega Qualified Plan and the related trust that has not been revoked or Omega is entitled to rely on a favorable opinion issued by the IRS, and, to the knowledge of Omega, there are no existing circumstances and no events have occurred that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the qualified status of any Omega Qualified Plan or the related trust. No trust funding any Omega Plan is intended to meet the requirements of Code Section 501(c)(9). To the knowledge of Omega, none of Omega and its Subsidiaries nor any other person, including any fiduciary, has engaged in any "prohibited transaction" (as defined in Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA), which would reasonably be expected to subject any of the Omega Plans or their related trusts, Omega, any of its Subsidiaries or any person that Omega or any of its Subsidiaries has an obligation to indemnify, to any material Tax or penalty imposed under Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502 of ERISA. 

   

 (e) With respect to each Omega Plan that is subject to Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 or 4971 of the Code, (i) there does not exist any accumulated funding deficiency within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA, whether or not waived, and, (ii) (A) the fair market value of the assets of such Omega Plan equals or exceeds the actuarial present value of all accrued benefits under such Omega Plan (whether or not vested) on a termination basis; (B) no reportable event within the meaning of Section 4043(c) of ERISA for which the 30-day notice requirement has not been waived has occurred; (C) all premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (the "PBGC") have been timely paid in full; (D) no liability (other than for premiums to the PBGC) under Title IV of ERISA has been or would reasonably be expected to be incurred by Omega or any of its Subsidiaries; and (E) the PBGC has not instituted proceedings to terminate any such Omega Plan and, to Omegas knowledge, no condition exists that presents a risk that such proceedings will be instituted or which would reasonably be expected to constitute grounds under Section 4042 of ERISA for the termination of, or the appointment of a trustee to administer, any such Omega Plan, except as would not have a Material Adverse Effect, individually or in the aggregate, in the case of clauses (A), (B), (C), (D) and (E). 

    ##### 

  

     

 (f) (i) No Omega Benefit Plan is a Multiemployer Plan or a plan that has two or more contributing sponsors at least two of whom are not under common control, within the meaning of Section 4063 of ERISA (a "Multiple Employer Plan"); (ii) none of Omega and its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective ERISA Affiliates has, at any time during the last six years, contributed to or been obligated to contribute to any Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer Plan; and (iii) none of Omega and its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective ERISA Affiliates has incurred, during the last six years, any Withdrawal Liability that has not been satisfied in full. There does not now exist, nor do any circumstances exist that would reasonably be expected to result in, any Controlled Group Liability that would be a liability of Omega or any of its Subsidiaries following the Effective Time, other than such liabilities that arise solely out of, or relate solely to, the Omega Benefit Plans. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither Omega nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor, to Omegas knowledge, any of their respective ERISA Affiliates, has engaged in any transaction described in Section 4069 or Section 4204 or 4212 of ERISA. 

   

 (g) Omega and its Subsidiaries have no liability for life, health, medical or other welfare benefits to former employees or beneficiaries or dependents thereof, except for health continuation coverage as required by Section 4980B of the Code, Part 6 of Title I of ERISA or applicable law and at no expense to Omega and its Subsidiaries. 

   

 (h) Neither the execution nor the delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will, either alone or in conjunction with any other event (whether contingent or otherwise), (i) result in any payment or benefit becoming due or payable, or required to be provided, to any director, employee or independent contractor of Omega or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) increase the amount or value of any benefit or compensation otherwise payable or required to be provided to any such director, employee or independent contractor, (iii) result in the acceleration of the time of payment, vesting or funding of any such benefit or compensation or (iv) result in any amount failing to be deductible by reason of Section 280G of the Code or would be subject to an excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code or Section 409A of the Code. 

   

 (i) No labor organization or group of employees of Omega or any of its Subsidiaries has made a pending demand for recognition or certification, and there are no representation or certification proceedings or petitions seeking a representation proceeding presently pending or, to Omegas knowledge, threatened to be brought or filed, with the National Labor Relations Board or any other labor relations tribunal or authority. Each of Omega and its Subsidiaries is in material compliance with all applicable laws respecting employment and employment practices, terms and conditions of employment, wages and hours and occupational safety and health. 

   

 3.12 _SEC Reports_. Omega has previously made available to FNB an accurate and complete copy of each final registration statement, prospectus, report, schedule and definitive proxy statement filed since January 1, 2005 by Omega with the SEC pursuant to the 

   ##### 

  

    

Securities Act or the Exchange Act (the "Omega Reports"), on and prior to the
date of this Agreement and no such Omega Report as of the date of such Omega
Report contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were
made, not misleading, except that information as of a later date (but before
the date of this Agreement) shall be deemed to modify information as of an
earlier date. Since January 1, 2005, as of their respective dates, all Omega
Reports filed under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act complied as to
form in all material respects with the published rules and regulations of the
SEC with respect thereto. 

  

 3.13 _Compliance with Applicable Law_. Omega and each of its Subsidiaries hold all licenses, franchises, permits and authorizations necessary for the lawful conduct of their respective businesses under and pursuant to each, and, since January 1, 2005, have complied in all respects with and are not in default in any respect under any, applicable law, statute, order, rule, regulation, policy or guideline of any Governmental Entity relating to Omega or any of its Subsidiaries (including the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Community Reinvestment Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorist (USA Patriot) Act of 2001, the Bank Secrecy Act and applicable limits on loans to one borrower), except where the failure to hold such license, franchise, permit or authorization or such noncompliance or default is not reasonably likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Omega. 

  

 3.14 _Contracts_. Except for matters that have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Omega and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, (i) none of Omega nor any of its Subsidiaries is (with or without the lapse of time or the giving of notice, or both) in breach or default in any material respect under any material contract, lease, license or other agreement or instrument, (ii) to the knowledge of Omega, none of the other parties to any such material contract, lease, license or other agreement or instrument is (with or without the lapse of time or the giving of notice, or both) in breach or default in any material respect thereunder and (iii) neither Omega nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any written notice of the intention of any party to terminate or cancel any such material contract, lease, license or other agreement or instrument whether as a termination or cancellation for convenience or for default of Omega or any of its Subsidiaries. 

  

 3.15 _Agreements with Regulatory Agencies_. Neither Omega nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any cease-and-desist or other order or enforcement action issued by, or is a party to any written agreement, consent agreement or memorandum of understanding with, or is a party to any commitment letter or similar undertaking to, or is subject to any order or directive by, or has been ordered to pay any civil money penalty by, or has been since January 1, 2005, a recipient of any supervisory letter from, or since January 1, 2005, has 

   ##### 

  

    

adopted any policies, procedures or board resolutions at the request or
suggestion of any Regulatory Agency or other Governmental Entity that
currently restricts in any material respect the conduct of its business or
that in any material manner relates to its capital adequacy, its ability to
pay dividends, its credit or risk management policies, its management or its
business, other than those of general application that apply to similarly
situated financial holding companies or their Subsidiaries (each item in this
sentence, whether or not set forth in Section 3.15 of the Omega Disclosure
Schedule, an "Omega Regulatory Agreement"), nor has Omega or any of
its Subsidiaries been advised since January 1, 2005 by any Regulatory Agency
or other Governmental Entity that it is considering issuing, initiating,
ordering, or requesting any such Omega Regulatory Agreement. To the knowledge
of Omega, there has not been any event or occurrence since January 1, 2005
that could reasonably be expected to result in a determination that Omega Bank
is not "well capitalized" and "well managed" as a matter of U.S. federal
banking law. Omega Bank has at least a "satisfactory" rating under the U.S.
Community Reinvestment Act. 

  

 3.16 _Undisclosed Liabilities_.

relating to or affecting creditors rights or by general equity principles. 

   

 (b) Omega has set forth in Section 3.25 of the Omega Disclosure Schedule as to Omega and each Omega Subsidiary as of the latest practicable date prior to the date of this Agreement: (A) any written or, to Omegas knowledge, oral Loan under the terms of which the obligor is 90 or more days delinquent in payment of principal or interest, or to Omegas knowledge, in default of any other material provision thereof; (B) each Loan that has been classified as "substandard," "doubtful," "loss" or "special mention" or words of similar import by Omega, a Omega Subsidiary or an applicable regulatory authority; (C) a listing of the Other Real Estate Owned ("OREO") acquired by foreclosure or by deed-in-lieu thereof, including the book value thereof and (D) each Loan with any director, executive officer or five percent or greater shareholder of Omega or a Omega Subsidiary, or to the knowledge of Omega, any Person controlling, controlled by or under common control with any of the foregoing.

its Subsidiaries) under Treas. Reg. §1.1502-6 (or any similar provision
of state, local or foreign law), or as a transferee or successor, by contract
or otherwise. Neither FNB nor any of its Subsidiaries has been, within the
past two years or otherwise as part of a "plan (or series of related
transactions)" (within the meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code) of

"controlled corporation" (within the meaning of Section 355(a)(1)(A) of the
Code) in a distribution of stock intended to qualify for tax-free treatment
under Section 355 of the Code. No share of FNB Common Stock is owned by
a Subsidiary of FNB. FNB is not and has not been a "United States real
property holding company" within the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the Code
during the applicable period specified in Section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii) of the
Code. Neither FNB, its Subsidiaries nor any other Person on their behalf has
executed or entered into any written agreement with, or obtained or applied
for any written consents or written clearances or any other Tax rulings from,
nor has there been any written agreement executed or entered into on behalf
of any of them with any Taxing Authority, relating to Taxes, including any
IRS private letter rulings or comparable rulings of any Taxing Authority and
closing agreements pursuant to Section 7121 of the Code or any predecessor
provision thereof or any similar provision of any applicable law, which
rulings or agreements would have a continuing effect after the Effective
Time. Neither FNB nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in a "reportable
transaction," as set forth in Treas. Reg. §1.6011-4(b), or any transaction
that is the same as or substantially similar to one of the types of
transactions that the IRS has determined to be a tax avoidance transaction
and identified by notice, regulation or other form of published guidance as a
"listed transaction," as set forth in Treas. Reg. §1.6011-4(b)(2). Omega has
received complete copies of (i) all federal, state, local and foreign income
or franchise Tax Returns of FNB and its Subsidiaries relating to the taxable
periods beginning January 1, 2004 or later and (ii) any audit report issued
within the last three years 

   ##### 

  

    

relating to any Taxes due from or with respect to FNB or its Subsidiaries.
Neither FNB, nor any of its Subsidiaries will be required to include any item
of material income in, or exclude any material item of deduction from,
taxable income for any taxable period (or portion thereof) ending after the

taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date, (ii) installment sale
or open transaction disposition made on or prior to the Effective Time, (iii)
prepaid amount received on or prior to the Closing Date or (iv) deferred
intercompany gain or any excess loss account of FNB or any of its Subsidiaries

local or foreign law) for periods (or portions thereof) ending on or before
the Closing Date. 

  

 4.11 _Employee Benefits_. For purposes hereof, the following terms shall have the following meaning: 

  

 "FNB Benefit Plan" means any material employee benefit plan, program, policy, practice, or other arrangement providing benefits to any current or former employee, officer or director of FNB or any of its Subsidiaries or any beneficiary or dependent thereof that is sponsored or maintained by FNB or any of its Subsidiaries or to which FNB or any of its Subsidiaries contributes or is obligated to contribute, whether or not written, including without limitation any employee welfare benefit plan within the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA, any employee pension benefit plan within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA (whether or not such plan is subject to ERISA) and any bonus, incentive, deferred compensation, vacation, stock purchase, stock option, severance, employment, change of control or fringe benefit plan, program or policy. 

  

 "FNB Employment Agreement" means a written contract, offer letter or agreement of FNB or any of its Subsidiaries with or addressed to any individual who is rendering or has rendered services thereto as an employee pursuant to which FNB or any of its Subsidiaries has any actual or contingent liability or obligation to provide compensation and/or benefits in consideration for past, present or future services. 

  

 "FNB Plan" means any FNB Benefit Plan other than a Multiemployer Plan. 

  

 (a) Section 4.11(a) of the FNB Disclosure Schedule includes a complete list of all material FNB Benefit Plans and all material FNB Employment Agreements. 

   

 (b) With respect to each FNB Plan, FNB has delivered or made available to Omega a true, correct and complete copy of: (i) each writing constituting a part of such FNB Plan, including without limitation all plan documents, employee communications, benefit schedules, trust agreements, and insurance contracts and other funding vehicles; (ii) the most recent Annual Report (Form 5500 Series) and accompanying schedule, if any; (iii) the current summary plan description and any material modifications thereto, if any (in each case, 

   ##### 

  

   

whether or not required to be furnished under ERISA); (iv) the most recent
annual financial report, if any; (v) the most recent actuarial report, if
any; and (vi) the most recent determination letter from the IRS, if any. FNB
has delivered or made available to Omega a true, correct and complete copy of
each material FNB Employment Agreement. 

   

 (c) All material contributions required to be made to any FNB Plan by applicable law or regulation or by any plan document or other contractual undertaking, and all material premiums due or payable with respect to insurance policies funding any FNB Plan, for any period through the date hereof have been timely made or paid in full or, to the extent not required to be made or paid on or before the date hereof, have been fully reflected on the financial statements to the extent required by GAAP. Each FNB Benefit Plan that is an employee welfare benefit plan under Section 3(1) of ERISA either (i) is funded through an insurance company contract and is not a "welfare benefit fund" within the meaning of Section 419 of the Code or (ii) is unfunded. 

   

 (d) With respect to each FNB Plan, FNB and its Subsidiaries have complied, and are now in compliance, in all material respects, with all provisions of ERISA, the Code and all laws and regulations applicable to such FNB Plans. Each FNB Plan has been administered in all material respects in accordance with its terms. There is not now, nor do any circumstances exist that would reasonably be expected to give rise to, any requirement for the posting of security with respect to a FNB Plan or the imposition of any material lien on the assets of FNB or any of its Subsidiaries under ERISA or the Code. Section 4.11(d) of the FNB Disclosure Schedule identifies each FNB Plan that is intended to be a "qualified plan" within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code ("FNB Qualified Plans"). The IRS has issued a favorable determination letter with respect to each Qualified Plan and the related trust that has not been revoked or FNB is entitled to rely on a favorable opinion issued by the IRS, and, to the knowledge of FNB, there are no existing circumstances and no events have occurred that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the qualified status of any FNB Qualified Plan or the related trust. No trust funding any FNB Plan is intended to meet the requirements of Code Section 501(c)(9). To the knowledge of FNB, none of FNB and its Subsidiaries nor any other person, including any fiduciary, has engaged in any "prohibited transaction" (as defined in Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA), which would reasonably be expected to subject any of the FNB Plans or their related trusts, FNB, any of its Subsidiaries or any person that FNB or any of its Subsidiaries has an obligation to indemnify, to any material Tax or penalty imposed under Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502 of ERISA. 

   

 (e) With respect to each FNB Plan that is subject to Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 or 4971 of the Code, (i) there does not exist any accumulated funding deficiency within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA, whether or not waived, and, (ii) except as would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect: (A) the fair market value of the assets of such FNB Plan equals or exceeds the 

   ##### 

  

   

actuarial present value of all accrued benefits under such FNB Plan (whether
or not vested) on a termination basis; (B) no reportable event within the
meaning of Section 4043(c) of ERISA for which the 30-day notice requirement
has not been waived has occurred; (C) all premiums to the PBGC have been
timely paid in full; (D) no liability (other than for premiums to the PBGC)
under Title IV of ERISA has been or would reasonably be expected to be
incurred by FNB or any of its Subsidiaries; and (E) the PBGC has not
instituted proceedings to terminate any such FNB Plan and, to FNBs
knowledge, no condition exists that presents a risk that such proceedings will
be instituted or which would reasonably be expected to constitute grounds
under Section 4042 of ERISA for the termination of, or the appointment of a
trustee to administer, any such FNB Plan. 

   

 (f) (i) No FNB Benefit Plan is a Multiemployer Plan or a Multiple Employer Plan; (ii) none of FNB and its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective ERISA Affiliates has, at any time during the last six years, contributed to or been obligated to contribute to any Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer Plan; and (iii) none of FNB and its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective ERISA Affiliates has incurred, during the last six years, any Withdrawal Liability that has not been satisfied in full. There does not now exist, nor do any circumstances exist that would reasonably be expected to result in, any Controlled Group Liability that would be a liability of FNB or any of its Subsidiaries following the Effective Time, other than such liabilities that arise solely out of, or relate solely to, the FNB Benefit Plans. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither FNB nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor, to FNBs knowledge, any of their respective ERISA Affiliates, has engaged in any transaction described in Section 4069 or Section 4204 or 4212 of ERISA. 

   

 (g) FNB and its Subsidiaries have no liability for life, health, medical or other welfare benefits to former employees or beneficiaries or dependents thereof, except for health continuation coverage as required by Section 4980B of the Code, Part 6 of Title I of ERISA or applicable law and at no expense to FNB and its Subsidiaries. 

   

 (h) Neither the execution nor the delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will, either alone or in conjunction with any other event (whether contingent or otherwise), (i) result in any payment or benefit becoming due or payable, or required to be provided, to any director, employee or independent contractor of FNB or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) increase the amount or value of any benefit or compensation otherwise payable or required to be provided to any such director, employee or independent contractor, (iii) result in the acceleration of the time of payment, vesting or funding of any such benefit or compensation or (iv) result in any amount failing to be deductible by reason of Section 280G of the Code or would be subject to an excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code or Section 409A of the Code. 

   

 (i) No labor organization or group of employees of FNB or any of its Subsidiaries has made a pending demand for recognition or certification, and there are no representation or certification proceedings or petitions seeking a representation proceeding 

   ##### 

  

   

presently pending or, to FNBs knowledge, threatened to be brought or filed,
with the National Labor Relations Board or any other labor relations tribunal
or authority. Each of FNB and its Subsidiaries is in material compliance with
all applicable laws and collective bargaining agreements respecting
employment and employment practices, terms and conditions of
employment, wages and hours and occupational safety and health. 

   

 4.12 _SEC Reports_. FNB has previously made available to Omega an accurate and complete copy of each final registration statement, prospectus, report, schedule and definitive proxy statement filed since January 1, 2005 by FNB with the SEC pursuant to the Securities Act or the Exchange Act (the "FNB Reports") and prior to the date of this Agreement, as of the date of such FNB Report, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading, except that information as of a later date (but before the date of this Agreement) shall be deemed to modify information as of an earlier date. Since January 1, 2005, as of their respective dates, all FNB Reports filed under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act complied as to form in all material respects with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto. 

  

 4.13 _Compliance with Applicable Law_. FNB and each of its Subsidiaries hold all licenses, franchises, permits and authorizations necessary for the lawful conduct of their respective businesses under and pursuant to each, and since January 1, 2005, have complied in all respects with and are not in default in any respect under any applicable law, statute, order, rule, regulation, policy or guideline of any Governmental Entity relating to FNB or any of its Subsidiaries (including the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Community Reinvestment Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorist (USA Patriot) Act of 2001, the Bank Secrecy Act and applicable limits on loans to one borrower), except where the failure to hold such license, franchise, permit or authorization or such noncompliance or default is not reasonably likely to, either individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on FNB. 

  

 4.14 _Contracts_. Except for matters that have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on FNB and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, (i) none of FNB nor any of its Subsidiaries is (with or without the lapse of time or the giving of notice, or both) in breach or default in any material respect under any material contract, lease, license or other agreement or instrument, (ii) to the knowledge of FNB, none of the other parties to any such material contract, lease, license or other agreement or instrument is (with or without the lapse of time or the giving of notice, or both) in breach or default in any material respect thereunder and (iii) neither FNB nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any written notice of the intention of any party to terminate or 

    ##### 

 

  

cancel any such material contract, lease, license or other agreement or
instrument whether as a termination or cancellation for convenience or for
default of FNB or any of its Subsidiaries. 

   

 4.15 _Agreements with Regulatory Agencies_. Neither FNB nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any cease-and-desist or other order or enforcement action issued by, or is a party to any written agreement, consent agreement or memorandum of understanding with, or is a party to any commitment letter or similar undertaking to, or is subject to any order or directive by, or has been since January 1, 2005, a recipient of any supervisory letter from, or has been ordered to pay any civil money penalty by, or since January 1, 2005, has adopted any policies, procedures or board resolutions at the request or suggestion of any Regulatory Agency or other Governmental Entity that currently restricts in any material respect the conduct of its business or that in any material manner relates to its capital adequacy, its ability to pay dividends, its credit or risk management policies, its management or its business, other than those of general application that apply to similarly situated financial holding companies or their Subsidiaries (each item in this sentence, whether or not set forth in the FNB Disclosure Schedule, a "FNB Regulatory Agreement"), nor has FNB or any of its Subsidiaries been advised since January 1, 2005, by any Regulatory Agency or other Governmental Entity that it is considering issuing, initiating, ordering or requesting any such FNB Regulatory Agreement. To the knowledge of FNB, there has not been any event or occurrence since January 1, 2005 that could reasonably be expected to result in a determination that any such bank Subsidiary is not "well capitalized" and "well managed" as a matter of U.S. federal banking law. Each bank Subsidiary of FNB has at least a "satisfactory" rating under the U.S. Community Reinvestment Act. 

  

 4.16 _Undisclosed Liabilities_. Except for (i) those liabilities that are reflected or reserved against on the consolidated balance sheet of FNB included in the FNB 10-Q (including any notes thereto), (ii) liabilities incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby and (iii) liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice since September 30, 2007, since September 30, 2007, neither FNB nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred any liability of any nature whatsoever (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether due or to become due) that, either individually or in the aggregate, has had or is reasonably likely to have, a Material Adverse Effect on FNB. 

  

 4.17 _Environmental Liability_. 

  

 (a) To FNBs Knowledge, (A) FNB and its Subsidiaries are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws; (B) no real property, including buildings or other structures, currently or formerly owned or operated by FNB or any of its Subsidiaries, or any property in which FNB or any of its Subsidiaries has held a security interest, Lien or a fiduciary or management role ("FNB Loan Property"), has been contaminated with, or has had any release of, any Hazardous Substance except in material compliance with Environmental Laws; (C) neither FNB nor any of its Subsidiaries could be deemed the owner 

    ##### 

  

    

or operator of, or have actively participated in the management regarding
Hazardous Substances of, any FNB Loan Property that has been contaminated
with, or has had any material and unlawful release to the environment of, any
regulated quantity of any Hazardous Substance; (D) neither FNB nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any material liability for any Hazardous Substance disposal
or contamination on any third party property; (E) neither FNB nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received any notice, demand letter, claim or request for
information alleging any material violation of, or liability under, any
Environmental Law; (F) neither FNB nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject
to any order, decree, injunction or other agreement with any Governmental
Entity or any third party relating to any Environmental Law; (G) there are no
circumstances or conditions (including the presence of unencapsulated friable
asbestos, underground storage tanks, lead products, polychlorinated
biphenyls, prior manufacturing operations, dry-cleaning or automotive
services) involving FNB or any of its Subsidiaries, any currently or formerly
owned or operated property, or any FNB Loan Property, that could reasonably
be expected to result in any material claims, liability or investigations
against FNB or any of its Subsidiaries, result in any material restrictions
on the ownership, use or transfer of any property pursuant to any
Environmental Law or materially and adversely affect the value of any FNB
Loan Property, (H) FNB has set forth in the FNB Disclosure Schedule and made
available to Omega copies of all environmental reports or studies, sampling
data, correspondence and filings in its possession or reasonably available to
it relating to FNB, its Subsidiaries and any currently owned or operated
property of FNB which were prepared in the last five years and (I) FNB has
made available to Omega copies of all environmental reports or studies,
sampling data, correspondence and filings in the possession or reasonably
available to it relating to any currently outstanding FNB Loan and which were
prepared for FNB in the last five years. 

   

 (b) There are no legal, administrative, arbitral or other proceedings, claims, actions, causes of action, private environmental investigations or remediation activities or governmental investigations of any nature seeking to impose, or that are reasonably likely to result in the imposition, on FNB of any liability or obligation arising under common law or under any local, state or federal environmental statute, regulation or ordinance including the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, pending or threatened against FNB, which liability or obligation is reasonably likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on FNB. To the knowledge of FNB, there is no reasonable basis for any such proceeding, claim, action or governmental investigation that would impose any liability or obligation that would be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on FNB. FNB is not subject to any agreement, order, judgment, decree, letter or memorandum by or with any Governmental Entity or third party imposing any liability or obligation with respect to the foregoing that is reasonably likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on FNB. 

    ##### 

  

     

 4.18 _Reorganization_. As of the date of this Agreement, FNB is not aware of any fact or circumstance that could reasonably be expected to prevent the Merger from qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. 

  

 4.19 _Loans; Nonperforming and Classified Assets_. 

  

 (a) Except as set forth in Section 4.19 of the FNB Disclosure Schedule, each Loan on the books and records of FNB and its Subsidiaries was made and has been serviced in all material respects in accordance with their customary lending standards in the ordinary course of business, is evidenced in all material respects by appropriate and sufficient documentation and, to the knowledge of FNB, constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the obligor named therein, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer and similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights or by general equity principles. 

   

 (b) FNB has set forth in Section 4.20 of the FNB Disclosure Schedule as to FNB and each FNB Subsidiary as of the latest practicable date prior to the date of this Agreement: (A) any written or, to FNBs knowledge, oral Loan under the terms of which the obligor is 90 or more days delinquent in payment of principal or interest, or to FNBs knowledge, in default of any other material provision thereof; (B) each Loan that has been classified as "substandard," "doubtful," "loss" or "special mention" or words of similar import by FNB, a FNB Subsidiary or an applicable regulatory authority; (C) a listing of the OREO acquired by foreclosure or by deed-in-lieu thereof, including the book value thereof and (D) each Loan with any director, executive officer or five percent or greater shareholder of FNB or a FNB Subsidiary, or to the knowledge of FNB, any Person controlling, controlled by or under common control with any of the foregoing. 

   

 4.20 _Fiduciary Accounts_. FNB and each of its Subsidiaries has properly administered all accounts for which it acts as a fiduciary, including but not limited to accounts for which it serves as a trustee, agent, custodian, personal representative, guardian, conservator or investment advisor, in accordance with the terms of the governing documents and applicable laws and regulations. Neither FNB nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor any of their respective directors, officers or employees, has committed any breach of trust to FNBs knowledge with respect to any fiduciary account and the records for each such fiduciary account are true and correct and accurately reflect the assets of such fiduciary account. 

  

 4.21 _Allowance for Loan Losses_. FNB Banks allowance for loan losses is sufficient at the date of this Agreement for its reasonably anticipated loan losses, is in compliance with the standards established by applicable Governmental Entities and GAAP and, to the knowledge of FNB, is adequate.

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS  

  

 6.1 _Regulatory Matters_. 

  

 (a) FNB agrees to prepare the Registration Statement to be filed by FNB with the SEC in connection with the issuance of FNB Common Stock in the Merger including the Joint Proxy Statement and prospectus and other proxy solicitation materials of Omega and FNB constituting a part thereof and all related documents. Omega shall prepare and furnish to FNB such information relating to it and its directors, officers and shareholders as may be reasonably required in connection with the above referenced documents based on its knowledge of and access to the information required for said documents, and Omega, and its legal, financial and accounting advisors, shall have the right to review in advance and approve, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld such Registration Statement prior to its filing. Omega agrees to cooperate with FNB and FNBs counsel and accountants in requesting and obtaining appropriate opinions, consents and letters from its financial advisor and independent auditor in connection with the Registration Statement and the Joint Proxy Statement. As long as Omega has cooperated as described above, FNB agrees to file, or cause to be filed, the Registration Statement and the Joint Proxy Statement with the SEC as promptly as reasonably practicable. Each of Omega and FNB agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Registration Statement to be declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as reasonably practicable after the filing thereof. FNB also agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary state securities law or "Blue Sky" permits and approvals required to carry out the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. After the Registration Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act, Omega and FNB shall each promptly mail at its expense the Joint Proxy Statement to its respective shareholders. 

   

 (b) Each of Omega and FNB agree that none of the information supplied or to be supplied by it for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Registration Statement shall, at the time the Registration Statement and each amendment or supplement thereto, if any, becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading. Each of Omega and FNB agree that none of the information supplied or to be supplied by it for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Joint Proxy Statement and any amendment or supplement thereto shall contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading. Each of Omega and FNB further agree that if such party shall become aware prior to the Effective Time of any information furnished by such party that would cause any of the statements in the Registration Statement or the Joint Proxy Statement to be false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or to omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein not false or 

   ##### 

  

   

misleading, to promptly inform the other parties thereof and an appropriate
amendment or supplement describing such information shall be filed promptly
with the SEC and, to the extent required by law, disseminated to the
shareholders of Omega and/or FNB. 

   

 (c) FNB agrees to advise Omega, promptly after FNB receives notice thereof, of the time when the Registration Statement has become effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed, of the issuance of any stop order or the suspension of the qualification of FNB Common Stock for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, of the initiation or, to the extent FNB is aware thereof, threat of any proceeding for any such purpose, or of any request by the SEC for the amendment or supplement of the Registration Statement or for additional information. 

   

 (d) The parties shall cooperate with each other and use their respective reasonable best efforts to promptly prepare and file all necessary documentation, to effect all applications, notices, petitions and filings, to obtain as promptly as practicable all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties, Regulatory Agencies and Governmental Entities that are necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Merger), and to comply with the terms and conditions of all such permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all such Regulatory Agencies and Governmental Entities. Omega and FNB shall have the right to review in advance, and, to the extent practicable, each will consult the other on, in each case subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, all the information relating to Omega or FNB, as the case may be, and any of their respective Subsidiaries, which appear in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party, Regulatory Agency or any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing right, each of the parties shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. The parties shall consult with each other with respect to the obtaining of all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties, Regulatory Agencies and Governmental Entities necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each party will keep the other apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to require FNB to take any action, or commit to take any action, or agree to any condition or restriction, in connection with obtaining the foregoing permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of third parties, Regulatory Agencies or Governmental Entities, that would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on FNB and its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Company after giving effect to the Merger) taken as a whole after the Effective Time (a "Materially Burdensome Regulatory Condition"). In addition, Omega agrees to cooperate and use its reasonable best efforts to assist FNB in preparing and filing such petitions and filings, and in obtaining such permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of third parties, Regulatory Agencies and Governmental Entities, that may be 

   ##### 

  

   

necessary or advisable to effect any mergers and/or consolidations of
Subsidiaries of Omega and FNB following consummation of the Merger. 

   

 (e) Each of FNB and Omega shall, upon request, furnish to the other all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and shareholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the Joint Proxy Statement, the Registration Statement or any other statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of FNB, Omega or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any Regulatory Agency or Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

   

 (f) Each of FNB and Omega shall promptly advise the other upon receiving any communication from any Regulatory Agency or Governmental Entity whose consent or approval is required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that causes such party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that any Requisite Regulatory Approval (as defined in Section 7.1(c)) will not be obtained or that the receipt of any such approval may be materially delayed. 

   

 (g) _Press Releases_. Omega and FNB shall consult with each other before issuing any press release with respect to the Merger or this Agreement and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statements without the prior consent of the other party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, however, that a party may, without the prior consent of the other party, but after such consultation, to the extent practicable under the circumstances, issue such press release or make such public statements as may upon the advice of outside counsel be required by law or the rules or regulations of the SEC, the FDIC, the OCC, the NYSE or FINRA. In addition, the Chief Executive Officers of Omega and FNB shall be permitted to respond to appropriate questions about the Merger from the press. Omega and FNB shall cooperate to develop all public announcement materials and make appropriate management available at presentations related to the Merger as reasonably requested by the other party. 

   

 6.2 _Access to Information_. 

  

 (a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, each of Omega and FNB shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel and other representatives of the other, reasonable access, during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all its properties, books, contracts, commitments and records, and, during such period, the parties shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, make available to the other party all other information concerning its business, properties and personnel as the other may reasonably request. Omega shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, provide to FNB a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed or received by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of 

   ##### 

  

   

federal securities laws or federal or state banking laws other than reports or
documents that such party is not permitted to disclose under applicable law.
Neither Omega nor FNB nor any of their Subsidiaries shall be required to
provide access to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure
would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of such party or
its Subsidiaries or contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment,
decree, fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of
this Agreement. The parties shall make appropriate substitute disclosure
arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding
sentence apply. 

   

 (b) All information and materials provided pursuant to this Agreement shall be subject to the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement entered into between the parties (the "Confidentiality Agreement"). 

   

 (c) No investigation by either of the parties or their respective representatives shall affect the representations and warranties of the other set forth in this Agreement. 

   

 6.3 _Shareholder Approval_. 

  

 (a) Omega shall call a meeting of its shareholders for the purpose of obtaining the requisite shareholder approval required in connection with this Agreement and the Merger (the "Omega Shareholder Meeting"), and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its meeting to occur as soon as reasonably practicable. Subject to Section 6.13, the Board of Directors of Omega shall recommend approval and adoption of this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, by Omegas shareholders and shall include such recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement (the "Omega Recommendation"). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Omegas obligations pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 6.3(a) shall not be affected by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to Omega of any Acquisition Proposal (as defined in Section 6.13(e)). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1, Omegas obligations pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 6.3(a) shall terminate. 

   

 (b) FNB shall call a meeting of its shareholders for the purpose of obtaining the requisite shareholder approval required in connection with this Agreement and the Merger (the "FNB Shareholder Meeting"), and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its meeting to occur as soon as reasonably practicable. The Board of Directors of FNB shall recommend that FNBs shareholders vote in favor of approval and adoption of this Agreement, the Merger, including the issuance of the shares of FNB Common Stock in connection therewith and the other transactions contemplated hereby (the "FNB Proposal"). FNB shall include such recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement (the "FNB Recommendation"). The Board of Directors of FNB shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such approval. The FNB Proposal shall be submitted to the shareholders of FNB at 

   ##### 

  

   

the FNB Shareholder Meeting for the purpose of approving the issuance of
shares of FNB Common Stock in connection with the Merger. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1, FNBs
obligations pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 6.3(b) shall
terminate. 

   

 6.4 _Commercially Reasonable Efforts; Cooperation_. Each of Omega and FNB agrees to exercise good faith and use its commercially reasonable efforts to satisfy the various covenants and conditions to Closing in this Agreement, and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as possible. 

  

 6.5 _Affiliates_. Omega shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause each director, executive officer and other person who is an "affiliate" (for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act) of Omega to deliver to FNB, as soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement, a written agreement, in the form of Exhibit B. 

  

 6.6 _NYSE Approval_. FNB shall cause the shares of FNB Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be approved for quotation on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 6.7 _Benefit Plans_. 

  

 (a) As soon as administratively practicable after the Effective Time, FNB shall take all reasonable action so that employees of Omega and its Subsidiaries shall be entitled to participate in each employee benefit plan, program or arrangement of FNB of general applicability with the exception of FNBs defined benefit pension plan (the "FNB Plans") to the same extent as similarly-situated employees of FNB and its Subsidiaries, it being understood that inclusion of the employees of Omega and its Subsidiaries in the FNB Plans may occur at different times with respect to different plans, provided that coverage shall be continued under corresponding Benefit Plans of Omega and its Subsidiaries until such employees are permitted to participate in the FNB Plans and provided further, however, that nothing contained herein shall require FNB or any of its Subsidiaries to make any grants to any former employee of Omega under any discretionary equity compensation plan of FNB. FNB shall cause each FNB Plans in which employees of Omega and its Subsidiaries are eligible to participate to recognize, for purposes of determining eligibility to participate in, the vesting of benefits under the FNB Plans, the service of such employees with Omega and its Subsidiaries to the same extent as such service was credited for such purpose by Omega, provided, however, that such service shall not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits. Except for the commitment to continue those Benefit Plans of Omega and its Subsidiaries that correspond to FNB Plans until employees of Omega and its Subsidiaries are included in such FNB Plans, nothing herein shall limit the ability of FNB to amend or terminate any of Omegas Benefit Plans in accordance with and to the extent permitted by their terms at any time permitted by such terms. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (b) At and following the Effective Time, and except as otherwise provided in Section 6.7(d) FNB shall honor, and the Surviving Company shall continue to be obligated to perform, in accordance with their terms, all benefit obligations to, and contractual rights of, current and former employees of Omega and its Subsidiaries and current and former directors of Omega and its Subsidiaries existing as of the Effective Date, as well as all employment, executive severance or "change-in-control" or similar agreements, plans or policies of Omega that are set forth on Schedule 6.7(b) of the Omega Disclosure Schedule, subject to the receipt of any necessary approval from any Governmental Entity. The severance or termination payments that are payable pursuant to such agreements, plans or policies of Omega are set forth on Schedule 6.7(b) of the Omega Disclosure Schedule. Following the consummation of the Merger and for one year thereafter, FNB shall, to the extent not duplicative of other severance benefits, pay employees of Omega or its Subsidiaries who are terminated for other than cause, severance as set forth on Schedule 6.7(b) of the FNB Disclosure Schedule. Following the expiration of the foregoing severance policy, any years of service recognized for purposes of this Section 6.7(b) will be taken into account under the terms of any applicable severance policy of FNB or its Subsidiaries. 

   

 (c) At such time as employees of Omega and its Subsidiaries become eligible to participate in a medical, dental or health plan of FNB or its Subsidiaries, FNB shall cause each such plan to (i) waive any preexisting condition limitations to the extent such conditions are covered under the applicable medical, health or dental plans of FNB and (ii) waive any waiting period limitation or evidence of insurability requirement that would otherwise be applicable to such employee or dependent on or after the Effective Time to the extent such employee or dependent had satisfied any similar limitation or requirement under an analogous Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time. 

   

 (d) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, Omega shall, at the written request of FNB, freeze or terminate such of the Omega Benefit Plans as is requested by FNB, including Omegas 401(k) Plan.

 (a) In the event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative, including any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (each a "Claim") in which any individual who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer of Omega or any of its Subsidiaries or who is or was serving at the request of Omega or any of its Subsidiaries as a director or officer of another Person (the "Indemnified Parties"), is, or is threatened to be, made a party based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that he is or was a director or officer of Omega or any of its Subsidiaries or was serving at the request of Omega or any of its Subsidiaries as a director or officer of another Person or (ii) this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, whether asserted or arising before or after the 

    ##### 

  

    

Effective Time, the parties shall cooperate and use their best efforts to
defend against and respond thereto. From and after the Effective Time, FNB
shall, and shall cause the Surviving Company to, indemnify, defend and hold
harmless, as and to the fullest extent currently provided under applicable
law, the Omega Articles, the Omega Bylaws and any agreement set forth in
Section 6.8 of the Omega Disclosure Schedule, each such Indemnified Party
against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, expenses (including
reimbursement for reasonable fees and expenses, including fees and expenses
of legal counsel, incurred in advance of the final disposition of any claim,
suit, proceeding or investigation upon receipt of any undertaking required by
applicable law), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement in
connection with any such threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation. 

   

 (b) FNB and the Surviving Company agree that all rights to indemnification of liabilities (including advancement of expenses), and all limitations with respect thereto, existing in favor of any Indemnified Person, as provided in the Omega Articles or the Omega Bylaws, shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect, without any amendment thereto; provided, however, that in the event any Claim is asserted or made, any determination required to be made with respect to whether an Indemnified Persons conduct complies with the standards set forth under the PBCL, the Omega Articles or the Omega Bylaws, as the case may be, shall be made by independent legal counsel (whose fees and expenses shall be paid by FNB and the Surviving Company) selected by such Indemnified Person and reasonably acceptable to FNB; and provided further that nothing in this Section 6.8 shall impair any rights or obligations of any current or former director or officer of Omega or its Subsidiaries, including pursuant to the respective organizational documents of Omega, or their respective Subsidiaries, under the PBCL or otherwise. 

   

 (c) Prior to the Effective Time, Omega shall obtain at the expense of FNB, and FNB shall maintain for a period of six years following the Effective Time, directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance policies in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including the transactions contemplated hereby, covering the Indemnified Persons who are currently covered by Omegas directors and officers liability insurance or fiduciary liability insurance policies, provided that FNB may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions that are not less advantageous than such policies of Omega or single premium tail coverage with policy limits equal to Omegas existing coverage limits, provided that in no event shall FNB be required to expend for any one year an amount in excess of 150% of the annual premium currently paid by Omega for such insurance (the "Insurance Amount"), and further provided that if FNB is unable to maintain or obtain the insurance called for by this Section 6.8(c) as a result of the preceding provision, FNB shall use its commercially reasonable best efforts to obtain the most advantageous coverage as is available for the Insurance Amount. The provisions of the immediately preceding sentence shall be deemed to have been satisfied if prepaid policies have been obtained prior to the Effective Time from 

   ##### 

  

   

an insurer or insurers that have an insurer financial strength rating by A.M.
Best Co. of at least "A," which policies provide the Indemnified Persons with
coverage, from the Effective Time to the sixth anniversary of the Effective
Time, including in respect of the transactions contemplated hereby, on terms
that are no less advantageous to Indemnified Persons than Omegas DandO
Insurance existing immediately prior to the date hereof. If such prepaid
policies have been obtained prior to the Effective Time, then the FNB shall
maintain such policies in full force and effect and continue the obligations
thereunder. 

   

 (d) The provisions of this Section 6.8 shall survive the Effective Time and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives. 

   

 6.9 _Additional Agreements_. In case at any time after the Effective Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement (including any merger between a Subsidiary of FNB, on the one hand, and a Subsidiary of Omega, on the other) or to vest the Surviving Company with full title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of either party to the Merger, the proper officers and directors of each party and their respective Subsidiaries shall take all such necessary action as may be reasonably requested by, and at the sole expense of, FNB. 

  

 6.10 _Advice of Changes_. Each of FNB and Omega shall promptly advise the other of any change or event (i) having or reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on it or (ii) that it believes would or would be reasonably likely to cause or constitute a material breach of any of its representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement; provided, however, that no such notification shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties (or remedies with respect thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement; provided, further, that a failure to comply with this Section 6.10 shall not constitute the failure of any condition set forth in Article VII to be satisfied unless the underlying Material Adverse Effect or material breach would independently result in the failure of a condition set forth in Article VII to be satisfied. 

  

 6.11 _Dividends_. After the date of this Agreement, Omega shall coordinate with FNB the declaration of any dividends in respect of Omega Common Stock and the record dates and payment dates relating thereto such that holders of Omega Common Stock shall not receive two dividends, or fail to receive one dividend, for any quarter with respect to their shares of Omega Common Stock and any shares of FNB Common Stock any such holder receives in exchange therefor in the Merger. 

  

 6.12 _Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b)_. Prior to the Effective Time, FNB and Omega shall take such steps as may be required to cause any acquisitions or dispositions of capital stock of FNB or Omega (including derivative securities thereof) resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is subject to the 

   ##### 

  

    

reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to

 (h) Omega acknowledges that the agreements contained in Section 6.13(e) are an integral part of the transactions contemplated in this Agreement and that without these agreements FNB would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, in the event Omega fails to pay to FNB the Break-up Fee, promptly when due, Omega shall, in addition thereto, pay to FNB all costs and expenses, including attorneys fees and disbursements, incurred in collecting such Break-up Fee together with interest on the amount of the Break-up Fee or any unpaid portion thereof, from the date such payment was due until the date such

Commencing following the date hereof, FNB and Omega shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts to facilitate the integration, from and after the Closing, of Omega and its Subsidiaries with the businesses of FNB and its Subsidiaries. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, from the date hereof through the Closing Date and consistent with the performance of their day-to-day operations, the continuous operation of Omega and its Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business and applicable law, Omega shall cause the employees and officers of Omega and its Subsidiaries, including the Bank, to cooperate with FNB in performing tasks reasonably required in connection with such integration. 

  

 6.15 _Certain Post-Closing Matters_. 

  

 (a) FNB shall take all action necessary to appoint or elect, effective as of the Effective Time, as directors of FNB the Omega Designees. Such persons shall fill vacancies on the FNB Board of Directors in classes to be mutually agreed upon by FNB and Omega and shall serve until their successors are elected and qualified. Consistent with the fiduciary duties of the FNB Board, FNB agrees that to the extent that any Omega Designee dies or becomes incapacitated or is unwilling to serve prior to the Effective Time, Omega and FNB shall mutually agree upon a substitute person to serve as successor, and provided that such person is reasonably acceptable to the FNB Board, such person shall be appointed to fill the vacancy so created.

 (b) FNB agrees to take all action necessary to appoint or elect, effective as of the Effective Time, as directors of FNB Bank four current members of the Board of Directors of Omega (the "Omega Bank Designees") as are mutually agreed by FNB and Omega.

FNB agrees to cause the FNB Bank Board to recommend the annual reelection of the Omega Bank Designees through FNB Banks annual meeting of shareholders in 2010. 

   

 (c) FNB shall cause FNB Bank to establish and maintain for at least three years after the Effective Date a community advisory board of directors (the "Omega Advisory Board").

For not less than two years following the Effective Date, the membership of the Omega Advisory Board shall consist of the current members of the Omega Board of Directors, subject to confirmation of such initial members by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of FNB. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (d) (a) From and after the Effective Time, FNB shall cause FNB Bank to establish a new region that will consist of certain central and northeastern Pennsylvania branches of Omega and, at FNBs discretion, FNB Bank. 

   

 (e) The commitments set forth in this Section 6.15 shall survive the Effective Time as reflected in a formal resolution of the FNB Board and the FNB Bank Board to be reflected in the minutes of FNB as the Surviving Company of the Merger and FNB Bank as the Surviving Bank in the Bank Merger. The members of the Omega Advisory Board shall be deemed to be third party beneficiaries of the commitments set forth in this Section 6.15.

 (b) _Breach_. 

   

 (i) By FNB, if (A) any of the representations and warranties of Omega contained in this Agreement shall fail to be true and correct such that the condition set forth in Section 7.2(a) would not be satisfied or (B) Omega shall have breached or failed to comply with any of its obligations under this Agreement such that the conditions set forth in Sections 7.1 or 7.2(b) would not be satisfied, in either case other than as a result of a material breach by FNB of any of its obligations under this Agreement and such failure or breach with respect to any such representation, warranty or obligation cannot be cured, or, if curable, shall continue unremedied for a period of 30 days after Omega has received written notice from FNB of the occurrence of such failure or breach, but in no event shall such 30-day period extend beyond June 30, 2008.

 (d) _No Regulatory Approval_. By FNB or Omega, if its Board of Directors so determines by a vote of a majority of the members of its entire Board, in the event the approval of any Governmental Entity required for consummation of the Merger contemplated by this Agreement shall have been denied by final nonappealable action of such Governmental Entity or an application therefor shall have been permanently withdrawn at the request of a Governmental Entity, provided, however, that no party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(d) if such denial shall be due to

observe the covenants of such party set forth herein. 

   

 (e) _No Omega or FNB Shareholder Approval_. 

   

 (i) By FNB, or by Omega provided that Omega shall not be in material breach of any of its obligations under Section 6.3(a), if any approval of the shareholders of Omega contemplated by this Agreement shall not have been obtained by reason of the failure to obtain the required vote at the Omega Shareholder Meeting or at any adjournment or postponement thereof.

   ##### 

  

   

to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement such
that such Acquisition Proposal would no longer constitute a Superior
Proposal, (ii) Omegas Board of Directors has considered such adjustments in
the terms and conditions of this Agreement resulting from such negotiations
and has concluded in good faith, based upon consultation with its

Any agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party, but such extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.
