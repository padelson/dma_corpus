 (a) Promptly after receipt by a Person entitled to indemnity under Section 11.2 or 11.4 (an "Indemnified Person") of notice of the assertion of a Third-Party Claim against it, such Indemnified Person shall give notice to the Person obligated to indemnify under such Section (an "Indemnifying Person") of the assertion of such Third-Party Claim, provided that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person will not relieve the Indemnifying Person of any liability that it may have to any Indemnified Person, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Person demonstrates that the defense of such Third Party Claim is materially prejudiced by the Indemnified Persons failure to give such notice. 

   

 (b) If an Indemnified Person gives notice to the Indemnifying Person pursuant to Section 11.7(a) of the assertion of a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Person shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such Third-Party Claim and, to the extent that it wishes (unless (i) the Indemnifying Person is also a Person against whom the Third-Party Claim is made and the Indemnified Person determines in good faith that joint representation would be inappropriate or (ii) the Indemnifying Person fails to provide reasonable assurance to the Indemnified Person of its financial capacity to defend such Third-Party Claim and provide indemnification with respect to such Third-Party Claim), to assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim with counsel satisfactory to the Indemnified Person. After notice from the Indemnifying Person to the Indemnified Person of its election to assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Person shall not, so long as it diligently conducts such defense, be liable to the Indemnified Person under this Article 11 for any fees of other counsel or any other expenses with respect to the defense of such Third-Party Claim, in each case subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Person in connection with the defense of such Third-Party Claim, other than reasonable costs of investigation. If the Indemnifying Person assumes the defense of a Third-Party Claim, (i) such assumption will conclusively establish for purposes of this Agreement that the claims made in that Third-Party Claim are within the scope of and subject to indemnification, and (ii) no compromise or settlement of such Third-Party Claims may be effected by the Indemnifying Person without the Indemnified Persons Consent unless (A) there is no finding or admission of any violation of Legal Requirement or any violation of the rights of any Person; (B) the sole relief provided is monetary damages that are paid in full by the Indemnifying Person; and (C) the Indemnified Person shall have no liability with respect to any compromise or settlement of such Third-Party Claims effected without its Consent. If notice is given to an Indemnifying Person of the assertion of any Third-Party Claim and the Indemnifying Person does not, within ten (10) days after the Indemnified Persons notice is given, give notice to the Indemnified Person of its election to assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Person will be bound by any determination made in such Third-Party Claim or any compromise or settlement effected by the Indemnified Person.

EXECUTION VERSION 

      

 (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Indemnified Person determines in good faith that there is a reasonable probability that a Third-Party Claim may adversely affect it or its Related Persons other than as a result of monetary damages for which it would be entitled to indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnified Person may, by notice to the Indemnifying Person, assume the exclusive right to defend, compromise or settle such Third-Party Claim, but the Indemnifying Person will not be bound by compromise or settlement effected without its Consent (which may not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). 

   

 (d) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 13.4, each Seller Party hereby consents to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of any court in which a Proceeding in respect of a Third-Party Claim is brought against any Buyer Indemnified Person for purposes of any claim that a Buyer Indemnified Person may have under this Agreement with respect to such Proceeding or the matters alleged therein and agree that process may be served on any Seller Party with respect to such a claim anywhere in the world. 

   

 (e) With respect to any Third-Party Claim subject to indemnification under this Article 11: (i) both the Indemnified Person and the Indemnifying Person, as the case may be, shall keep the other Person reasonably informed of the status of such Third-Party Claim and any related Proceedings at all stages thereof where such Person is not represented by its own counsel, and (ii) the parties agree (each at its own expense) to render to each other such assistance as they may reasonably require of each other and to cooperate in good faith with each other in order to ensure the proper and adequate defense of any Third-Party Claim. 

   

 (f) With respect to any Third-Party Claim subject to indemnification under this Article 11, the parties agree to cooperate in such a manner as to preserve in full (to the extent possible) the confidentiality of all Confidential Information and the attorney-client and work-product privileges. In connection therewith, each party agrees that: (i) it will use its Best Efforts, in respect of any Third-Party Claim in which it has assumed or participated in the defense, to avoid production of Confidential Information (consistent with applicable law and rules of procedure), and (ii) all communications between any party hereto and counsel responsible for or participating in the defense of any Third-Party Claim shall, to the extent possible, be made so as to preserve any applicable attorney-client or work-product privilege. 

   

 11.8 _INDEMNIFICATION PAYMENT_  

  

 (a) All amounts payable by one party to another pursuant to this Article 11 shall be paid in immediately available funds within five (5) days after final determination of such amounts payable. Buyer Indemnified Persons may seek payment of any part or all amounts payable by Seller Parties pursuant to this Article 11 from the then remaining funds held under the Escrow Agreement in accordance with the terms, provisions and procedures set forth in the Escrow Agreement.

 13.5 _ENFORCEMENT OF AGREEMENT_  

  

 The parties each acknowledge and agree that the other party would be irreparably damaged if any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms and that any Breach of this Agreement by any party could not be adequately compensated in all cases by monetary damages alone. Accordingly, in addition to any other right or remedy to which either party may be entitled, at law or in equity, the non-Breaching party shall be entitled to enforce any provision of this Agreement by a decree of specific performance and to temporary, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to prevent Breaches or threatened Breaches of any of the provisions of this Agreement, without posting any bond or other undertaking. 

  

 13.6 _WAIVER; REMEDIES CUMULATIVE_  

  

 The rights and remedies of the parties to this Agreement are cumulative, not alternative and shall not be exclusive of any other right or remedy, or preclude the assertion of, any other right or remedy otherwise available to any party. Neither any failure nor any delay by any party in exercising any right, power or privilege under this Agreement or any of the documents referred to in this Agreement will operate as a waiver of such right, power or privilege, and no single or partial exercise of any such right, power or privilege will preclude any other or further exercise of such right, power or privilege or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, (a) no claim or right arising out of this Agreement or any of the documents referred to in this Agreement can be discharged by one party, in whole or in part, by a waiver or renunciation of the claim or right unless in writing signed by the other party; (b) no waiver that may be given by a party will be applicable except in the specific instance for which it is given; and (c) no notice to or demand on one party will be deemed to be a waiver of any obligation of that party or of the right of the party giving such notice or demand to take further action without notice or demand as provided in this Agreement or the documents referred to in this Agreement.

 No party may assign any of its rights or delegate any of its obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other parties, except that Buyer may assign any of its rights and delegate any of its obligations under this Agreement to any Subsidiary or Related Person of Buyer provided that Buyer shall remain responsible for all liabilities and obligations not satisfied by such Subsidiary or Related Person. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will apply to, be binding in all respects upon and inure to the benefit of the successors and permitted assigns of the parties. Nothing expressed or referred to in this Agreement will be construed to give any Person other than the parties to this Agreement any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or with respect to this Agreement or any provision of this Agreement, except such rights as shall inure to a successor or permitted assignee pursuant to this Section 13.9.

EXECUTION VERSION 

    

 (ii) in general, to do all things and to perform all acts, including executing and delivering all agreements, certificates, receipts, instructions and other instruments contemplated by or deemed advisable to effectuate the provisions of this Section 13.16. 

 

This appointment and grant of power and authority is coupled with an interest
and is in consideration of the mutual covenants made herein and is
irrevocable and shall not be terminated by any act of either of the
Shareholders or either Seller or by operation of law, whether by the death or
each incapacity of either Shareholder or by the occurrence of any other event.
Each Shareholder and Seller hereby consents to the taking of any and all
actions and the making of any decisions required or permitted to be taken or
made by the Selling Parties Representative pursuant to this Section 13.16. 

   

 (b) Buyer and the escrow agent designated in the Escrow Agreement shall be entitled to rely upon any document or other paper delivered by the Selling Parties Representative as (i) genuine and correct and (ii) having been duly signed or sent by the Selling Parties Representative, and neither Buyer nor such escrow agent shall be liable to either of the Shareholders or either Seller for any action taken or omitted to be taken by Buyer or such escrow agent in such reliance. 

   

 13.17 _CASUALTY AND CONDEMNATION_  

  

 In the event at any time prior to the Closing Date: 

  

 (a) If with respect to any Real Property or Facility, a fire or other casualty ("Casualty") shall occur and such Casualty shall cause Material Damage (as herein defined) or condemnation or eminent domain proceedings shall commence or shall be threatened ("Condemnation") which are reasonably expected to cause Material Damage, then Buyer may, at its election, terminate this Agreement by delivering written notice to either Seller within (i) if Material Damage by Casualty is applicable, within thirty (30) days after the later of (A) Buyers receipt of written notice of such Casualty or (B) Buyers receipt of written notice of a final offer of coverage under policies of insurance covering the Facility affected by such Casualty; or (ii) if a Condemnation that is reasonably expected to cause Material Damage is applicable, within thirty (30) days after Buyers receipt of written notice that such Condemnation has been commenced or is threatened, which written notice shall not be deemed received by Buyer until Buyer shall also have received reasonably satisfactory written evidence of the amount of the award or other compensation that will be paid or due to Sellers in connection with such Condemnation. In the event that Buyer terminates this Agreement as provided in the preceding sentence, neither party shall thereafter have any further obligations to the other hereunder except as provided in Section 9.2 hereof. 

   

 (b) In the event that any Casualty shall occur or Condemnation shall commence or be threatened for which Buyer is not entitled to terminate this Agreement as provided in clause (a) above or with respect to which Buyer is entitled to terminate this Agreement as provided in clause (a) above but fails to timely exercise such right in accordance with clause (a) above, Buyer shall proceed with the Closing. 

   

 (c) For purposes hereof, "Material Damage" shall mean: (i) in case of a Casualty, any damage, as reasonably estimated by Buyer, that would cost for the Facility affected by such 

      ##### 

  

  

EXECUTION VERSION 

     

Casualty more than Two Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($2,500,000) in
repairs or that would otherwise have a material adverse effect on the Assets
or Business; and (ii) in the case of a Condemnation, would likely result in
an award to Seller in an amount in excess of Two Million Five Hundred
Thousand Dollars ($2,500,000) or would otherwise have a material adverse
effect on the Assets or Business. 

   

 (d) In the event Buyer is required under clause (b) above to proceed with the Closing, (i) if a Casualty is applicable, at Closing, Buyer shall receive the affected Facility in its then existing condition and Buyer will be entitled to receive all insurance money paid and, to the extent not yet paid, an assignment of all insurance money payable to Sellers, or either of them, under all policies of insurance covering such Facility as a result of and with respect to the damage or destruction of such Facility caused by such Casualty and a credit against the Purchase Price in the amount of any applicable deductible; or (ii) if Condemnation is applicable, at Closing, Buyer shall be entitled to all proceeds, awards or compensation paid and, to the extent not yet paid, an assignment of all proceeds, awards or compensation payable to Sellers, or either of them, as a result of and with respect to such Condemnation. 

  

 13.18 _PRORATIONS_  

  

 (a) At the Closing, Buyer and Sellers shall reimburse each other, as appropriate, for the following expenses applicable to the Assets, all of which shall be prorated such that Sellers are responsible for the expenses accrued on or prior to the Closing Date and Buyer is responsible for expenses accrued after the Closing Date: 

   

 (i) all real estate taxes and assessments applicable to the Real Property, including taxes for the calendar year of Closing that are a lien against the Real Property but not due and payable until the following calendar year, provided, that in any case and notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Seller shall be responsible for all Taxes and assessments that are a lien against the Real Property but not yet due for years prior to the Closing Date, and a portion of such Taxes and assessments for the year of Closing, prorated on a daily basis through the Closing Date; 

  

 (ii) all personal property taxes; 

  

 (iii) utility expenses applicable to the Real Property; 

  

 (iv) rent payments and any common area charges or other similarly pro-rated charges due under the Leases that are part of the Acquired Contracts (including percentage rent on an annualized basis, as may be adjusted for recaptured landlord allowances); and 

  

 (v) any other items customarily prorated, as mutually agreed upon by the parties. 

  

 (b) If there are water, gas or electric meters located at any of the Real Property, Sellers shall obtain readings thereof to a date not more than thirty (30) days prior to the Closing Date and the unfixed water rates and charges, sewer taxes and rents and gas and electricity charges, if any, based thereon for the intervening time shall be apportioned on the basis of such readings. If such readings are not obtainable by the Closing Date, then, at the Closing, any water rates and charges, 

     ##### 

  

  

EXECUTION VERSION 

     

sewer taxes and rents and gas and electricity charges which are based on such
readings shall be prorated based upon the per diem charges obtained by using
the most recent period for which such readings shall then be available. Upon
the taking of subsequent actual readings, the apportionment of such charges
shall be recalculated and Sellers or Buyer, as the case may be, promptly
shall make a payment to the other based upon such recalculations. The parties
agree to make such final recalculations within ninety (90) days after the
Closing Date, which obligation shall survive the Closing. 

   

 (c) If any refunds of real property taxes or assessments, water rates and charges or sewer taxes and rents shall be made after the Closing, the same shall be held in trust by Sellers or Buyer, as the case may be, and shall first be applied to the unreimbursed costs incurred in obtaining the same, then the balance, if any, shall be paid to Sellers (for the period on or prior to the Closing Date) and to Buyer (for the period commencing after the Closing Date). 

   

 (d) If, on the Closing Date, any of the Real Property shall be or shall have been affected by any special or general assessment or assessments or real property taxes payable on a lump sum or which are or may become payable in installments of which the first installment is then a charge or lien and has become payable, Sellers shall pay or cause to be paid at the Closing the unpaid installments of such assessments, including those which are to become due and payable after the Closing Date. 

   

 (e) No insurance policies of Sellers are to be transferred to Buyer, and no apportionment of the premiums therefor shall be made. 

   

 (f) If any of the foregoing items to be prorated under this Section 13.18 cannot be prorated at the Closing because of the unavailability of the amounts which are to be prorated, such items shall be prorated on the basis of a good faith estimate by the parties and adjusted and reconciled as soon as practicable after the Closing Date; provided, however, all such adjustments and reconciliations shall occur no later than one (1) year after the Closing Date.
