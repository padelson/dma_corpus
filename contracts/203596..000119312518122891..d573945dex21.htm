vii _AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER_

 

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement"), dated as of April 19,
2018, is made and entered into by and among Wesbanco, Inc., a West Virginia
corporation ("Buyer"), Wesbanco Bank, Inc., a West Virginia banking
corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Buyer ("Buyer Sub"), Farmers
Capital Bank Corporation, a Kentucky corporation and financial holding
company ("Seller"), and United Bank and Capital Trust Company, a Kentucky
banking corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Seller ("Seller Sub").
Buyer and Seller are sometimes hereinafter collectively referred to as the
"Constituent Corporations."

W I T N E S S E T H:

 

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Seller, Seller Sub, Buyer and Buyer Sub
have each determined that it is in the best interests of their respective
corporations and shareholders for Buyer to acquire Seller pursuant to a merger
of Seller with and into Buyer (the "Merger") and, immediately after the
Merger, a merger of Seller Sub with and into Buyer Sub (the "Bank Merger"),
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement; and

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Seller, Seller Sub, Buyer and Buyer Sub
have each approved this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby; and

 

WHEREAS, as a result of the Merger, in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, Seller will cease to have a separate corporate existence and the
shareholders of Seller will receive from Buyer in exchange for each share of
common stock, $0.125 par value, of Seller (individually a "Seller Share" and
collectively "Seller Shares"), (a) $5.00 in cash, and (b) 1.053 shares of
common stock, $2.0833 par value per share, of Buyer (individually, a "Buyer
Share" and collectively, the "Buyer Shares"), as may be adjusted as provided
herein, all as determined in accordance with the terms of this Agreement; and

WHEREAS, as a condition to the willingness of Buyer to enter into this
Agreement, all of the directors and the executive officers of Seller listed
on _Exhibit A_ , in their capacity as shareholders (the "Voting Agreement
Shareholders"), have each entered into separate Voting Agreements, dated as of
the date hereof, with Buyer (each a "Voting Agreement"), a form of which is
attached to this Agreement as _Exhibit B_ , pursuant to which each Voting
Agreement Shareholder has agreed, among other things, to vote such
Voting Agreement Shareholders Seller Shares in favor of the approval of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, upon the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in the Voting Agreement; and

 



1 WHEREAS, for federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger and
the Bank Merger contemplated by this Agreement each qualify as a
"reorganization" under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") and that this Agreement is
intended to be and is adopted as a "plan of reorganization" for purposes of
the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder; and

 

WHEREAS, Seller has previously provided to Buyer a schedule disclosing
additional information about Seller (the "Seller Disclosure Schedule"), and
Buyer has previously provided to Seller a schedule disclosing additional
information about Buyer (the "Buyer Disclosure Schedule"); and

 

WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and
agreements in connection with the Merger and the Bank Merger and also to
prescribe certain conditions to the Merger and the Bank Merger.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants, agreements and conditions hereinafter
set forth, the parties, intending to be legally bound hereby, agree as
follows:

or any of their respective Subsidiaries (as defined below) (except for Trust
Account Shares and DPC Shares, as such terms are defined in Section 2.01(b)
hereof) and (ii) Seller Dissenting Shares (as defined in Section 2.04)) shall,

Ratio") Buyer Shares and (ii) $5.00 in cash, without interest. The 1.053

case may be, being referred to herein as "Trust Account Shares") or (y) held
by Buyer or Seller or any of their respective Subsidiaries, directly or
indirectly, in respect of a debt previously contracted (any such Seller
Shares, and Buyer Shares that are similarly held, being referred to herein as
"DPC Shares")) shall be cancelled and  

---|---|--- 
 



5 consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. At the Effective Time,
all Buyer Shares that are owned by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries (other
than Trust Account Shares and DPC Shares) shall become treasury stock of Buyer
without any consideration therefor. 
---|--- 
 

2.02. _Reserved_

 

2.03. _Exchange and Payment Procedures_



     | (a) | _Exchange Agent_. Buyer shall designate Computershare
Investor Services, LLC or such other entity as shall reasonably be selected by
Buyer to act as agent (the "Exchange Agent") for purposes of conducting the
exchange and payment procedures as described in this Section 2.03. Seller
shall provide to the Exchange Agent all information reasonably requested by
Buyer to be provided to the Exchange Agent in order for it to perform
as specified herein. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | _Deposit with Exchange Agent; Exchange Fund_. At least one
business day prior to the Effective Time, Buyer shall provide to the Exchange
Agent the aggregate number of Buyer Shares and an amount in cash
representing the aggregate cash component of the Merger Consideration,
together with aggregate cash to be paid in lieu of fractional shares pursuant
to Section 2.03(f) hereto, all of which shall be held by the Exchange Agent in
trust for the holders of Seller Shares (collectively, the "Exchange Fund").
The Exchange Agent shall not be entitled to vote or exercise any rights of
ownership with respect to the Buyer Shares held by it from time to time
hereunder, except that it shall receive and hold for the benefit of the
recipients of the Buyer Shares until distributed thereto pursuant to the
provisions of this Agreement any dividends or other distributions paid or
distributed with respect to such Buyer Shares for the account of the persons
entitled thereto. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose other
than as set forth in this paragraph. The Exchange Agent shall invest cash in
the Exchange Fund, as directed by Buyer, on a daily basis; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that all such investments shall be in (1) obligations of, or
guaranteed by, the United States of America, (2) commercial paper obligations
receiving the highest rating from either Moodys Investors Services, Inc.
or Standard and Poors Corporation, or (3) certificates of deposit of
commercial banks (not including any Subsidiary (as defined in Section 3.01(c))
or affiliate of Buyer) with capital exceeding $1.0 billion. All interest and
other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Buyer. 
---|---|--- 
 



6 practicable after the Effective Time, and in no event more than seven business
days thereafter, Buyer shall send or cause to be sent to each former holder
of record of Seller Shares transmittal materials (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificates
theretofore representing the Seller Shares shall pass only upon proper
delivery of such certificates to the Exchange Agent). Each holder of an
outstanding certificate or certificates which prior to the Effective Time
represented Seller Shares ("Seller Certificate"), who surrenders such Seller
Certificate to the Exchange Agent shall, upon acceptance thereof by the
Exchange Agent, be entitled to receive (a) the Merger Consideration for each
Seller Share represented by the Seller Certificate surrendered, (b) any cash
in lieu of fractional shares into which the Seller Shares represented by the
Seller Certificate have been converted, (c) any other dividend or distribution
with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to
Buyer Shares issuable in the Merger, and (d) subject to compliance with
Section 7.08, any dividend or distribution with respect to Seller Shares with
a record date prior to the Effective Time, in each case without interest. The
Exchange Agent shall accept such Seller Certificate upon compliance with such
reasonable terms and conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose to effect an
orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices and
shall as promptly as practicable issue the certificates representing Buyer
Shares and cash in accordance with this Agreement. Each Seller Certificate
that is not surrendered to the Exchange Agent in accordance with the
procedures provided for herein shall, except as otherwise herein provided, be
deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon such surrender (a) the Merger Consideration, (b) any cash in lieu
of fractional shares into which the Seller Shares represented by the Seller
Certificate have been converted, (c) any other dividend or distribution with
a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to Buyer
Shares issuable in the Merger, and (d) subject to compliance with Section
7.08, any dividend or distribution with respect to Seller Shares with a
record date prior to the Effective Time, in each case without interest. No
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
with respect to Buyer Shares shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Seller Certificate until the holder thereof shall surrender such Seller
Certificate in accordance with this Section 2.03(c). After the surrender of a
Seller Certificate in accordance with this Section 2.03(c), the record holder
thereof shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or other
distributions, without any interest thereon, which theretofore had become
payable with respect to Buyer Shares represented by such Seller Certificates.
After the Effective Time, there shall be no further transfer on the records of
Seller of a Seller Certificate representing Seller Shares and, if any such
Seller Certificate is presented to Seller for transfer, it shall be
canceled against delivery of the Merger Consideration for each Seller Share
represented by such Seller Certificate provided in Article Two. 
---|---|--- 
 



7 shall be delivered to the Exchange Agent by any person who is unable to
produce any Seller Certificate for Seller Shares for surrender to the Exchange
Agent in accordance with this Section 2.03: 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | evidence to the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving
Corporation that such Seller Certificate has been lost, wrongfully taken, or
destroyed; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (ii) | such security or indemnity as reasonably may be requested
by the Surviving Corporation to save it harmless (which may include the
requirement to obtain a third party bond or surety); and 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (iii) | evidence, to the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving
Corporation, that such person was the owner of the Seller Shares theretofore
represented by each such Seller Certificate claimed by him to be lost,
wrongfully taken or destroyed and that he is the person who would be entitled
to present such Seller Certificate for exchange pursuant to this Agreement; 
---|---|--- 
 

then the Exchange Agent, in the absence of actual notice to it that any Seller
Shares theretofore represented by any such Seller Certificate have been
acquired by a bona fide purchaser, shall deliver to such person (a) the Merger
Consideration for each Seller Share represented by the lost, stolen or
destroyed Seller Certificate, (b) any cash in lieu of fractional shares
into which the Seller Shares represented by the Seller Certificate have been
converted, (c) any other dividend or distribution with a record date after the
Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to Buyer Shares issuable in the
Merger, and (d) subject to compliance with Section 7.08, any dividend or
distribution with respect to Seller Shares with a record date prior to the
Effective Time, in each case without interest, that such person would have
been entitled to receive upon surrender of each such lost, wrongfully taken
or destroyed Seller Certificate.



     | (e) | _No Further Ownership Rights in Seller Shares_. All cash
and Buyer Shares issued upon conversion of Seller Shares in accordance with
the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of
all rights pertaining to such Seller Shares; subject, however, to the
Surviving Corporations obligation to pay any dividends or make any other
distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time that may have
been declared or made by Seller (but only in compliance with the terms of
this Agreement) on such Seller Shares prior to the Effective Time and which
remain unpaid at the Effective Time, subject to compliance with Section 7.08. 
---|---|--- 
 



8 ---|---|--- 



     | (i) | No certificates or scrip representing fractional Buyer
Shares shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Seller Certificates
evidencing Seller Shares, and such fractional Buyer Share interests will not
entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a shareholder of the
Surviving Corporation. 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | Each holder of Seller Shares who would otherwise be
entitled to receive a fractional Buyer Share shall instead receive from the
Exchange Agent an amount of cash, without interest, equal to the product
obtained by multiplying (a) the fractional Buyer Share (rounded to the
nearest thousandth when expressed in decimal form) interest to which such
holder (after taking into account all Seller Shares held at the Effective Time
by such holder) would otherwise be entitled by (b) the Average Closing Price
(as defined in Section 11.01(d)(iv)). 
---|---|--- 



     | (g) | _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund delivered to the Exchange Agent by Buyer pursuant to Section 2.03(b) that
remains undistributed to the shareholders of Seller for 12 months after the
Effective Time may be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon Buyers
demand, and any shareholders of Seller who have not theretofore complied with
this Article Two shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation
for payment of the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional Buyer
Share interest and any dividends or distributions with respect to Buyer Shares
issuable in the Merger, in each case without interest. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (h) | _No Liability_. None of Buyer, Seller, the Exchange Agent
or the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any former holder of Seller
Shares for any payment of the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu
of fractional Buyer Share interest or any dividends or distributions with
respect to Buyer Shares issuable in the Merger delivered to a public official
as and if required by any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
law. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (i) | _Withholding Rights_. Buyer or the Exchange Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the cash consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Seller Certificates such
amounts as Buyer or the Exchange Agent is required to deduct and withhold
with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any other
provision of domestic or foreign (whether national, federal, state,
provincial, local or otherwise) tax law. To the extent that amounts are
properly withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by Buyer
or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the
Seller Certificates in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made by Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent. 
---|---|--- 
 



9 to time, in the case of one or more persons, waive one or more of the rights
provided to it in this Article Two to withhold certain payments, deliveries
and distributions; and no such waiver shall constitute a waiver of its rights
thereafter to withhold any such payment, delivery or distribution in the case
of any person. 
---|---|--- 
 

2.04. _Seller Shareholders  Dissenters Rights_

 

Anything contained in this Agreement or elsewhere to the contrary
notwithstanding, if any holder of an outstanding Seller Share who is entitled
to demand and properly demands payment of the fair value of such Seller Share
in accordance with Section 271B.13-210 of the KBCA and which holder has not
voted in favor of the Merger and otherwise complied with the provisions of
Subtitle 13 of the KBCA to become a "Dissenter" as defined therein (each a
"Seller Dissenting Share"), then such Seller Dissenting Share shall not be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and instead:



     | (a) | Each such Seller Dissenting Share shall nevertheless be
deemed to be extinguished at the Effective Time as provided elsewhere in this
Agreement; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) | Each holder perfecting such dissenters rights shall
thereafter have only such rights (and shall have such obligations) as are
provided in Subtitle 13 of the KBCA; _provided, however_ , that if any such
person shall have failed to perfect or shall withdraw or lose such holders
rights under Subtitle 13 of the KBCA, each such holders Seller Dissenting
Share shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective
Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest
thereon. 
---|---|--- 

Seller shall give Buyer (i) prompt notice of any written demands for payment
of fair value of any Seller Shares, attempted withdrawals of such demands and
any other instruments served pursuant to the KBCL and received by Seller
relating to shareholders dissenters rights and (ii) the opportunity to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands under
the KBCL consistent with the obligations of Seller thereunder. Seller shall
not, except with the prior written consent of Buyer, (x) make any payment
with respect to such demand, (y) offer to settle or settle any demand for
payment of fair value or (z) waive any failure to timely deliver a written
demand for payment of fair value or timely take any other action to
perfect payment of fair value rights in accordance with the KBCL.

No holder of a Seller Dissenting Share shall be entitled to submit a letter
of transmittal, and any letter of transmittal submitted by a holder of a
Seller Dissenting Share shall be invalid, unless and until the demand for the
payment of the fair value made in respect of such Seller Dissenting Share
shall have been or is deemed to have been withdrawn.

 



10 2.05. _Anti-Dilution Provisions_

 

In the event that, subsequent to the date of this Agreement but prior to the
Effective Time, the outstanding Buyer Shares are increased, decreased,
changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or
securities (or Buyer establishes a record date for effecting any such change
to the outstanding Buyer Shares) as a result of a reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse
stock split or other similar changes in Buyers capitalization, excluding an
acquisition by Buyer involving an exchange of Buyer Shares not resulting in a
recapitalization of Buyer, appropriate and proportionate adjustment shall be
made to the Merger Consideration. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to
permit any action that may be proscribed by this Agreement.

 

2.06. _Conversion of Seller Sub Capital Stock_

 

Immediately after the Effective Time, each issued and outstanding share, and
each share held in the treasury, of capital stock of Seller Sub shall, by
virtue of the Bank Merger and without any action on the part of Buyer, Buyer
Sub, Seller, Seller Sub or the holder thereof, be canceled without any
conversion or issuance of any shares of capital stock of Buyer or Buyer Sub
with respect thereto. No shares of Buyer or Buyer Sub shall be issued or
exchanged and no consideration shall be given for shares of Seller Sub, and
each then-issued and outstanding share, and each share then held in the
treasury, of capital stock of Buyer Sub shall, by virtue of the Bank Merger
and without any action on the part of Buyer, Buyer Sub, Seller, Seller Sub or
the holder thereof, continue as one share of capital stock of the Surviving
Bank Corporation having the same designations, preferences, limitations, and
rights as such share of capital stock of Buyer Sub immediately prior to the
Bank Merger.

aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect
on Seller. 
---|---|--- 
 



12 As used in this Agreement, (A) any reference to any event, change or effect

the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided, however,_ that in no
event shall a decrease in the trading price of Seller Shares or Buyer Shares,
absent any other event, change or effect that has had or would reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect, or litigation relating thereto, be
considered a material adverse effect or material adverse change; and
_provided, further_ , __ that any state of facts, change, development, event,
effect, condition or occurrence referred to in clauses (i), (ii), (vi) or
(vii) immediately above shall be taken into account in determining whether a

that such state of facts, change, development, event, effect, condition or
occurrence has a disproportionate effect on Seller or Buyer, as the case may
be, compared to other similarly situated community

Compensation 

---|---|--- 
 



26 within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA (a "Seller Pension Plan") and
which is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has
received a favorable determination letter (including a determination that the
related trust under such Seller Compensation and Benefit Plan is exempt from
tax under Section 501(a) of the Code) from the IRS, or is in the form of a
prototype or volume submitter plan that is the subject of a favorable opinion
letter from the IRS upon which Seller is entitled to rely, and Seller is not
aware of any circumstances reasonably expected to result in revocation of any
such favorable determination letter or opinion letter. Each Seller
Compensation and Benefit Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation
plan" (within the meaning of Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code) has been
operated in material compliance with Section 409A of the Code, IRS Notice
2005-1, Treasury Regulations issued under Section 409A of the Code, and
any subsequent guidance relating thereto, and no additional tax under Section
409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code has been or is reasonably expected to be incurred by
a participant in any such Seller Compensation and Benefit Plan. There is no
material pending or, to the knowledge of Seller, threatened legal action,
suit or claim relating to the Seller Compensation and Benefit Plans other than
routine claims for benefits thereunder. Neither Seller nor any Seller
Subsidiary has engaged in a transaction, or omitted to take any action, with
respect to any Seller Compensation and Benefit Plan that would reasonably be
expected to subject Seller or any Seller Subsidiary to a tax or penalty
imposed by either Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502 of ERISA, assuming
for purposes of Section 4975 of the Code that the taxable period of any such
transaction expired as of the date hereof. 
---|--- 



     | (iii) |

No liability (other than for payment of premiums to the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation (the "PBGC") which have been made or will be made on a
timely basis) under Title IV of ERISA has been or is expected to be incurred
by Seller or any subsidiary of Seller with respect to any ongoing, frozen or
terminated "single-employer plan," within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(15)
of ERISA, currently or formerly maintained by any of them, or any single-
employer plan of any entity (a "Seller ERISA Affiliate Plan") which is
considered one employer with Seller under Section 4001(a)(14) of ERISA or
Section 414(b), (c) or (m) of the Code (a "Seller ERISA Affiliate"). During
the six years prior to the Effective Time, none of Seller, any Seller
Subsidiary nor any Seller ERISA Affiliate has contributed, or has been
obligated to contribute, to a multiemployer plan under Subtitle E of Title IV
of ERISA (as defined in ERISA Sections 3(37)(A) and 4001(a)(3)).  

---|---|--- 
 



27 Section 4043 of ERISA, for which the 30-day reporting requirement has not
been waived, has been required to be filed for any Seller Compensation and
Benefit Plan or by any Seller ERISA Affiliate Plan within the 12-month period
ending on the date hereof, and no such notice will be required to be filed as
a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The PBGC has not
instituted proceedings to terminate any Seller Pension Plan or Seller ERISA
Affiliate Plan and, to Sellers knowledge, no condition exists that presents
a material risk that such proceedings will be instituted. There is no pending
investigation or enforcement action by the PBGC, the Department of Labor
("DOL"), the IRS or any other Governmental Authority with respect to any
Seller Compensation and Benefit Plan and, to Sellers knowledge, no such
investigation or action is threatened or anticipated. Under each Seller
Pension Plan and Seller ERISA Affiliate Plan, as of the date of the most
recent actuarial valuation performed prior to the date of this Agreement, the
actuarially determined present value of all "benefit liabilities", within the
meaning of Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA (as determined on the basis of the
actuarial assumptions contained in such actuarial valuation of such Seller
Pension Plan or Seller ERISA Affiliate Plan), did not exceed the then current
value of the assets of such Seller Pension Plan or Seller ERISA Affiliate Plan
and since such date there has been neither an adverse change in the financial
condition of such Seller Pension Plan or Seller ERISA Affiliate Plan nor any
amendment or other change to such Seller Pension Plan or Seller ERISA
Affiliate Plan that would increase the amount of benefits thereunder which
reasonably could be expected to change such result and that, individually or
in the aggregate, would have a material adverse effect on Seller. 
---|--- 
 



     | (iv) |

All contributions required to be made under the terms of any Seller
Compensation and Benefit Plan or Seller ERISA Affiliate Plan or any employee
benefit arrangements under any collective bargaining agreement to which Seller
or any Seller Subsidiary is a party have been timely made or have been
reflected on the Seller Financial Statements. Neither any Seller Pension Plan
nor any Seller ERISA Affiliate Plan has an "accumulated funding deficiency"
(whether or not waived) within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code or
Section 302 of ERISA, and all required payments to the PBGC with respect to
each Seller Pension Plan or Seller ERISA Affiliate Plan have been made on or
before their due dates. None of Seller, any Seller Subsidiary nor any Seller
ERISA Affiliate (x) has provided, or would reasonably be expected to
be required to provide, security to any Seller Pension Plan or to any

28 the Code, and (y) has taken any action, or omitted to take any action, that
has resulted, or would reasonably be expected to result, in the imposition of
a lien under Section 412(n) of the Code or pursuant to ERISA that,
individually or in the aggregate, would have a material adverse effect on
Seller. 
---|--- 
 



     | (v) | Except as disclosed in Section 3.01(t)(v) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule, neither Seller nor any Seller Subsidiary has any
obligations to provide retiree health benefits, life insurance or other

than benefits mandated by Section 4980B of the Code or those derived from a
Seller Pension Plan. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (vi) | Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries do not maintain any
foreign Seller Compensation and Benefit Plans.

5330 filed within the past year with the IRS. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (viii) | Except as disclosed on Section 3.01(t)(viii) of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule, the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement would not, directly or indirectly (including, without
limitation, as a result of any termination of employment prior to or
following the Effective Time), reasonably be expected to (A) entitle any
Seller Employee, Seller Consultant or Seller Director to any payment from
Seller or any Seller Affiliate (including severance pay or similar
compensation, other than severance pay or compensation as otherwise provided
under Section 6.02(a)) or any increase in compensation, (B) result in the
vesting or acceleration of any benefits under any Seller Compensation and
Benefit Plan, or (C) result in any material increase in benefits payable under
any Seller Compensation and Benefit Plan.

Seller; all such permits, licenses, certificates of authority, orders and

suspension or cancellation of any of them has been threatened in writing,

Except as set forth in Section 3.01(gg) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule,
neither Seller nor any Seller Subsidiary has any reason to believe that
any facts or circumstances exist, which would cause Seller or the Seller

of the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970, as amended and its implementing regulations
(31 C.F.R. Chapter X) (the "Bank Secrecy Act"), the Uniting and Strengthening

Persons List) or under any statute, executive order (including, without
limitation, the September 24, 2001, Executive Order Blocking Property and

Except as set forth above, as of the date of this Agreement, there are no

regulation, ordinance, order, rule or administrative ruling of
any Governmental Authority 

---|---|--- 
 



41 properties; (B) the articles of incorporation or bylaws of Buyer or Buyer Sub;
(C) any material agreement, indenture or instrument to which Buyer or Buyer

aggregate, would not have a material adverse effect on Buyer; or (iii) violate
the terms or conditions of, or result in the cancellation,
modification, revocation or suspension of, any material license, approval,
certificate, permit or authorization held by Buyer or any of the Buyer
Subsidiaries, other than such violations, cancellations, modifications,

---|---|--- 



     | (i) | Buyer and the Buyer Subsidiaries have filed all reports,
registration statements, proxy statements and information statements required
to be filed by Buyer or any of the Buyer Subsidiaries subsequent to December
31, 2014 under the Securities Act or under Sections 13(a), 13(c), 14 and 15(d)
of the Exchange Act with the SEC (together with all information incorporated
therein by reference, the "Buyer SEC Documents"), except for any reports,
registration statements, proxy statements or information statements the
failure to file that would not have a material adverse effect on Buyer. All
such filings, at the time of filing, complied in all material respects as to
form and included all exhibits required to be filed under the applicable
rules of the SEC. None of such documents, when filed, contained any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) |

The records, systems, controls, data and information of Buyer and the Buyer
Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means
(including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether

42 and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e)

Buyer, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, is made known to the chief
executive officer and the chief financial officer of Buyer by others within
those entities, and (y) has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation

summarize and report financial information, and (ii) any fraud, whether or
not material, that involves management or other employees who have a
significant role in Buyers internal controls over financial reporting (as
defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). These disclosures were made
in writing by management to Buyers auditors and audit committee and a copy
has previously been made available to Seller. As of the date hereof, there is
no reason to believe that Buyers outside auditors and its chief executive
officer and chief financial officer will not be able to give the
certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations
adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without
qualification, when next due. 
---|---

Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by Buyer or any of the Buyer
Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a material violation of securities

have a material adverse effect on Buyer, each Buyer Compensation and Benefit
Plan has been operated and administered in accordance with its terms and
with applicable law, including, but not limited to, ERISA, the Code, the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, or
any regulations or rules promulgated thereunder, and all filings, disclosures

in material compliance with Section 409A of the Code, IRS Notice 2005-1,
Treasury Regulations issued under Section 409A of the Code, and any subsequent
guidance relating thereto, and no additional tax under Section 409A(a)(1)(B)

any Buyer Compensation and Benefit Plan that would reasonably be expected to
subject Buyer or any Buyer Subsidiary to a tax or penalty imposed by either
Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502 of ERISA, assuming for purposes of
Section 4975 of the Code that the taxable period of any such transaction
expired as of the date hereof.

formerly maintained by any of them, or any single-employer plan of any entity
(a "Buyer ERISA Affiliate Plan") which is considered one employer with Buyer
under Section 4001(a)(14) of ERISA or Section 414(b), (c) or (m) of the Code
(a "Buyer ERISA Affiliate"). None of Buyer, any Buyer Subsidiary or any Buyer
ERISA Affiliate has contributed, or has been obligated to contribute, to a
multi-employer plan under Subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA (as defined in ERISA
Sections 3(37)(A) and 4001(a)(3)) at any time since September 26, 1980. No
notice of a "reportable event", within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA,
for which the 30-day reporting requirement has not been waived, has been
required to be filed for any Buyer Compensation and Benefit Plan or by any
Buyer ERISA Affiliate Plan within the 12-month period ending on the date
hereof, and no such notice will be required to be filed as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The PBGC has not instituted
proceedings to terminate any Buyer Pension Plan or Buyer ERISA Affiliate Plan
and, to Buyers knowledge, no condition exists that presents a material risk
that such proceedings will be instituted. There is no pending investigation or
enforcement action by the PBGC, the DOL, the IRS or any other Governmental
Authority with respect to any Buyer Compensation and Benefit Plan and to
Buyers knowledge, no investigation or action is threatened or anticipated.
Except as disclosed in Section 4.01(s)(iii) of the Buyer Disclosure Schedule,

of the most recent actuarial valuation performed prior to the date of this
Agreement, the actuarially determined present value of all "benefit
liabilities", within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA (as
determined on the basis of the actuarial assumptions contained in such
actuarial valuation of such Buyer Pension Plan or Buyer ERISA Affiliate Plan),
did not exceed the then current value of the assets of such Buyer Pension Plan
or Buyer ERISA Affiliate Plan and since such date there has been neither an
adverse change in the financial condition of such Buyer Pension Plan or Buyer
ERISA Affiliate Plan nor any amendment or other change to such Buyer Pension
Plan or Buyer ERISA Affiliate Plan that would increase the amount of benefits
thereunder which reasonably could be expected to change such result and that,
individually or in the aggregate, would have a material adverse effect on
Buyer.

Plan nor any Buyer ERISA Affiliate Plan has an "accumulated funding
deficiency" (whether or not waived) within the meaning of Section 412 of the
Code or Section 302 of ERISA and all required payments to the PBGC with
respect to each Buyer Pension Plan and each Buyer ERISA Affiliate Plan have
been made on or before their due dates. None of Buyer, any Buyer Subsidiary

expected to be required to provide, security to any Buyer Pension Plan or to
any Buyer ERISA Affiliate Plan pursuant to Section 401(a)(29) of the Code,

63 5.02. _Notification_

 

Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, Seller shall promptly

(a) causes or constitutes a breach in any material respect of any of Sellers
or Seller Subs representations and warranties or (b) would (except as
expressly contemplated by this Agreement) cause or constitute a breach in any
material respect of any such representation or warranty had such
representation or warranty been made as of the time of occurrence or discovery
of such fact or condition. Should any such fact or condition require any
change in the Seller Disclosure Schedule, Seller shall promptly deliver to
Buyer a supplement to the Seller Disclosure Schedule specifying such change
("Updated Seller Disclosure Schedule"); _provided, however_ , that the
disclosure of such change in the Updated Seller Disclosure Schedule shall not
be deemed to constitute a cure of any breach of any representation or warranty
made pursuant to this Agreement unless consented to in writing by Buyer.
During the same period, Seller shall promptly notify Buyer of (i) the
occurrence of any breach in any material respect of any of Sellers or Seller
Subs covenants contained in this Agreement, (ii) the occurrence of any event
that may make the satisfaction of the conditions in this Agreement impossible
or unlikely in any material respect or (iii) the occurrence of any event that
is reasonably expected, individually or taken with all other facts, events or
circumstances known to Seller, to result in a material adverse effect with
respect to Seller.

5.03. _No Solicitation_

 

(a) Seller shall not and shall cause Seller Sub and the respective officers,
directors, employees, investment bankers, financial advisors, attorneys,
accountants, consultants, affiliates and other agents of Seller and Seller Sub
(collectively, the "Seller Representatives") not to, directly or indirectly,
(i) initiate, solicit, induce or knowingly encourage, or take any action to
facilitate the making of, any inquiry, offer or proposal which constitutes, or
could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal (as defined
below); (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding
any Acquisition Proposal or furnish, or otherwise afford access, to any
person (other than Buyer) any information or data with respect to Seller or
the Seller Subsidiaries or otherwise relating to an Acquisition Proposal;
(iii) release any person from, waive any provisions of, or fail to use
reasonable best efforts to enforce any confidentiality agreement or standstill
agreement to which Seller is a party; (iv) enter into any agreement, agreement
in principle or letter of intent with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or
approve or resolve to approve any Acquisition Proposal or any agreement,
agreement in principle or letter of intent relating to an Acquisition
Proposal; or (v) take any action to render the provisions of any Takeover
Laws inapplicable to any person (other than Buyer or the Buyer Subsidiaries)
or group in connection with any Acquisition Proposal. Any violation of the
foregoing restrictions by any of the Seller Representatives, whether or not
such Seller Representative is so authorized and whether or not such Seller
Representative is purporting to act on behalf of Seller or otherwise, shall be
deemed to be a breach of this Agreement by Seller. Seller and Seller Sub
shall, and shall cause each of the Seller Representatives to, immediately
cease and cause to be terminated all existing discussions, conversations,
negotiations and other communications with any person conducted heretofor with
respect to any of the foregoing.

 



64 For purposes of this Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal" shall mean any
inquiry, offer or proposal (other than an inquiry, offer or proposal from
Buyer), whether or not in writing, contemplating, relating to, or could
reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Transaction. For purposes of
this Agreement, "Acquisition Transaction" shall mean (A) any transaction or
series of transactions involving any merger, consolidation, recapitalization,
share exchange, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving
Seller or Seller Sub; (B) any transaction pursuant to which any third party
or group acquires or would acquire (whether through sale, lease or other
disposition), directly or indirectly, any assets of Seller or the Seller
Subsidiaries representing, in the aggregate, twenty percent (20%) or more of
the assets of Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis; (C)
any issuance, sale or other disposition (including by way of merger,
consolidation, share exchange or any similar transaction) of securities (or
options, rights or warrants to purchase or securities convertible into, such
securities) representing twenty percent (20%) or more of the votes attached to
the outstanding securities of Seller or the Seller Sub; (D) any tender offer
or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in any third party or
group beneficially owning twenty percent (20%) or more of any class of equity
securities of Seller or the Seller Sub; or (E) any transaction which is
similar in form, substance or purpose to any of the foregoing transactions, or
any combination of the foregoing.

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5.03(a), Seller may take any of
the actions described in clause (ii) of Section 5.03(a) if, but only if, (i)
Seller has received a bona fide unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal
that did not result from a breach of this Section 5.03; (ii) Sellers Board
of Directors (the "Seller Board") determines in good faith, after consultation
with and having considered the advice of its outside legal counsel,
that failure to take such actions would be reasonably likely to violate its
fiduciary duties under applicable Kentucky law; (iii) Seller has provided
Buyer with at least two (2) business days prior notice of such determination;
and (iv) prior to furnishing or affording access to any information or data
with respect to Seller or the Seller Subsidiaries or otherwise relating to an
Acquisition Proposal, Seller receives from such person a confidentiality
agreement with terms no less favorable to Seller than those contained in the
confidentiality agreement between Seller and Buyer. Seller shall promptly
provide to Buyer any non-public information regarding Seller or the
Seller Subsidiaries provided to any other person which was not previously
provided to Buyer, such additional information to be provided no later than
the date of provision of such information to such other party.

 

(c) Seller shall promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours)
notify Buyer in writing if any proposals or offers are received by, any
information is requested from, or any negotiations or discussions are sought
to be initiated or continued with, Seller or the Seller Representatives, in
each case in connection with any Acquisition Proposal, and such notice
shall indicate the name of the person initiating such discussions or
negotiations or making such proposal, offer or information request and the
material terms and conditions of any proposals or offers (and, in the case of
written materials relating to such proposal, offer, information request,
negotiations or discussion, such notice shall include copies of such materials

 



65  (including e-mails or other electronic communications) unless (i) such
materials constitute confidential information of the party making such offer
or proposal under an effective confidentiality agreement, (ii) disclosure of
such materials jeopardizes the attorney-client privilege or (iii) disclosure
of such materials contravenes any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment or
decree). Seller shall keep Buyer informed, on a current basis, of the status
and terms of any such proposal, offer, information request, negotiations or
discussions (including any amendments or modifications to such proposal, offer
or request).

 

(d) Neither the Seller Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw,
withhold, qualify or modify, or propose to withdraw, withhold, qualify or
modify, in a manner adverse to Buyer in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including the Merger and the Bank Merger), the
Seller Board Recommendation (as defined in Section 7.06(f)), or make
any statement, filing or release, in connection with the Seller Meeting (as
defined in Section 7.06(e)) or otherwise, inconsistent with the Seller Board
Recommendation; (ii) approve or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend,
any Acquisition Proposal; or (iii) enter into (or cause Seller or the Seller
Subsidiaries to enter into) any letter of intent, agreement in principle,
acquisition agreement or other agreement (A) related to any Acquisition
Transaction or (B) requiring Seller to abandon, terminate or fail to
consummate the Merger, the Bank Merger or any other transaction contemplated
by this Agreement.

 

(e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent Seller or its Board of
Directors from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange
Act with respect to an Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ that such rules will
in no way eliminate or modify the effect that any action pursuant to such
rules would otherwise have under this Agreement.

(f) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5.03(d), prior to the date of
the Seller Meeting (as defined in Section 7.06(e)), the Seller Board may
approve or recommend to the shareholders of Seller a Superior Proposal (as
defined below) and withdraw, qualify or modify the Seller
Board Recommendation in connection therewith (a "Seller Subsequent
Determination") after the third business day following Buyers receipt of a
notice (the "Notice of Superior Proposal") from Seller advising Buyer that
the Seller Board has decided that a bona fide unsolicited written Acquisition
Proposal that it received (that did not result from a breach of this Section
5.03) constitutes a Superior Proposal (it being understood that Seller shall
be required to deliver a new Notice of Superior Proposal in respect of any
revised Superior Proposal from such third party or its affiliates that Seller
proposes to accept) if, but only if, (i) the Seller Board has reasonably
determined in good faith, after consultation with and having considered the
advice of outside legal counsel, that failure to take such actions would be
reasonably likely to violate its fiduciary duties under applicable Kentucky
law, (ii) during the three (3) business day period after receipt of the
Notice of Superior Proposal by Buyer, Seller and the Seller Board shall have
cooperated and negotiated in good faith with Buyer and give due consideration
to such adjustments, modifications or amendments to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement as may be proposed by Buyer in making a determination
whether Seller will proceed with the Seller Board Recommendation without a
Seller Subsequent Determination; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that neither Buyer
nor Seller shall have any obligation to propose any adjustments, modifications
or amendments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and (iii) at the
end of such three (3) business day period, after taking into account any such
adjusted, modified or amended terms as

 



66  may have been proposed by Buyer since its receipt of such Notice of Superior
Proposal, the Seller Board has again in good faith made the determination (A)
in clause (i) of this Section 5.03(f) and (B) that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the changing,
qualifying or modifying of the Seller Board Recommendation or the making of a
Seller Subsequent Determination by the Seller Board shall not change the
approval of the Seller Board for purposes of causing any Takeover Laws to be
inapplicable to this Agreement and the Voting Agreements and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, including the Merger and the Bank Merger.

For purposes of this Agreement, "Superior Proposal" shall mean any bona
fide written proposal (on its most recently amended or modified terms, if
amended or modified) made by a third party to enter into an Acquisition
Transaction on terms that the Seller Board determines in its good faith
judgment, after consultation with and having considered the advice of outside
legal counsel and Sellers Financial Advisor (i) would, if consummated, result
in the acquisition of all, but not less than all, of the issued and
outstanding shares of Seller common stock or all, or substantially all, of
the assets of Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis; (ii)
would result in a transaction that (A) involves consideration to the holders
of the Seller Shares that is more favorable, from a financial point of view,
than the consideration to be paid to Sellers shareholders pursuant to this
Agreement, considering, among other things, the nature of the consideration
being offered and any material regulatory approvals or other risks associated
with the timing of the proposed transaction beyond or in addition to those
specifically contemplated hereby, and which proposal is not conditioned upon
obtaining additional financing and (B) is, in light of the other terms of
such proposal, more favorable to Sellers shareholders than the Merger and
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and (iii) is reasonably
likely to be completed on the terms proposed, in each case taking into account
all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal.

5.04. _Delivery of Information_

 

Seller shall furnish to Buyer promptly after such documents are available: (a)
all reports, proxy statements or other communications by Seller to its
shareholders generally; and (b) all press releases relating to any
transactions.

5.05. _Takeover Laws_

Seller shall take all necessary steps to (a) exempt (or cause the continued
exemption of) this Agreement, the Voting Agreements, the Merger and the Bank
Merger from the requirements of any Takeover Law applicable to it and
comparable provisions in the articles of incorporation or bylaws of Seller or
Seller Sub, and (b) assist in any challenge by Buyer to the validity, or
applicability to the Merger or the Bank Merger, of any Takeover Law.

 



67 5.06. _No Control_

 

Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Buyer, directly or indirectly,
the right to control or direct the operations of Seller or the Seller
Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each of
Seller and Buyer shall exercise, consistent with the terms of this Agreement,
complete control and supervision over its and its subsidiaries respective
operations. 

5.07. _Exchange Listing_

 

Seller shall take all necessary actions, and Buyer shall provide reasonable
cooperation in connection with same, in order to effect the delisting of the
Seller Shares from the Nasdaq Global Select Market and the termination of
Sellers registration under the Exchange Act effective contemporaneously with
the Effective Time.

 

5.08. _Section 16_

 

Prior to the Effective Time, Seller shall approve in accordance with the
procedures set forth in Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act and the
Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP SEC No-Action Letter (January 12,
1999) any disposition of equity securities of Seller (including derivative
securities) resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by
each officer and director of Seller who is subject to Section 16 of the
Exchange Act.

 

5.09. _Seller Classified Loans_

 

(a) Seller shall promptly (i) after the end of each quarter after the date
hereof, (ii) at other times after reasonably requested by Buyer and (iii)
upon Closing, provide Buyer with a complete and accurate list, including the
amount, of all Loans of Seller and its Subsidiaries subject to each type of
classification of the Classified Loans.

 

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, Seller shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to enter into contracts for the sale of the Classified Loans
identified in Section 5.09 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, which Classified
Loans have been selected by Buyer and Seller for disposition, on terms
reasonably satisfactory to Buyer and Seller; _provided_ , _however,_
that nothing herein shall require any such sale prior to the Effective Time
if Seller reasonably determines any such sale to be contrary to the best
interests of Seller or safe and sound banking practice; _provided, further_ ,
that nothing in this Section 5.09 shall give Buyer a controlling influence
over the management or policies of Seller or any of the Seller Subsidiaries
prior to the Effective Time. Buyer shall indemnify the Seller and the Seller
Subsidiaries for any losses, fees, expenses and charges incurred by Seller in
connection therewith if the Merger is not consummated in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement.

 



68 5.10. _401(k) Plan Matters; Other Benefit Plan Matters_

 

(a) _401(k) Plan Matters_. Buyer in its sole discretion may elect to (i) have
Seller terminate the Seller Subs 401(k) Plan (the "Seller 401(k) Plan")
immediately prior to the Effective Time and contingent upon the occurrence of
the Closing by resolutions adopted by the boards of directors of Seller and
Seller Sub, on terms acceptable to Buyer, or (ii) merge the Seller 401(k)
Plan with and into the Buyers Employee Stock Ownership and 401(k) plan (the
"Buyer 401(k) Plan") after the Effective Time. In no event shall the Seller
401(k) Plan be merged with and into the Buyer 401(k) Plan, unless Buyer
determines in its reasonable judgment that (A) the Seller 401(k) Plan is a
qualified plan under Section 401(a) of the Code, both as to the form of the
Seller 401(k) Plan and as to its operation, and (B) there are no facts in
existence that would be reasonably expected to adversely affect the qualified
status of the Seller 401(k) Plan.

 

If Buyer determines in its sole discretion not to merge the Seller 401(k) Plan
into the Buyer 401(k) Plan and that the Seller 401(k) Plan should be
terminated immediately prior to the Effective Time, Seller agrees to take all
action necessary to have the Seller 401(k) Plan terminated immediately prior
to the Effective Time; _provided_ , that Buyer has delivered to Seller
written notice of Buyers determination to terminate the Seller 401(k) Plan
at least thirty (30) days prior to the Closing Date; and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that Buyer agrees that prior to such termination, Seller is
permitted to amend the Seller 401(k) Plan, to the extent permitted under
applicable law and guidance, to allow the rollover in kind of any outstanding
plan loans held in participant accounts. If Buyer determines that the Seller
401(k) Plan should be so terminated, the accounts of all participants and
beneficiaries in the Seller 401(k) Plan as of such termination shall become
fully vested upon termination of the Seller 401(k) Plan. As soon as
practicable following the Effective Time, the account balances in the Seller
401(k) Plan shall be either distributed to participants and beneficiaries or
rolled over to an eligible tax-qualified retirement plan or individual
retirement account as a participant or beneficiary may direct in accordance
with plan terms. Buyer agrees to permit Continuing Employees to rollover their
account balances in the Seller 401(k) Plan to the Buyer 401(k) Plan, including
the in-kind rollover of plan loans, which Buyer agrees in such event to
administer according to their terms. Prior to taking any such action, Seller
and Seller Sub shall provide Buyer with a copy of such resolutions or consent
in connection with such Seller 401(k) Plan termination, and shall consider
any comments provided by Buyer in good faith. Buyer shall indemnify Seller and
the Seller Subsidiaries for any losses, fees, expenses and charges incurred by
Seller in connection with the termination of the Seller 401(k) Plan if the
Merger is not consummated in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

(b) _Other Benefit Plans_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time and
subject to the occurrence of the Effective Time, Seller and Seller Sub shall,
at the request of Buyer, freeze or terminate each other Seller Compensation
and Benefit Plan as requested by Buyer subject to and in accordance with
applicable law.

ARTICLE SIX

 

FURTHER COVENANTS OF BUYER

 

6.01. _Access to Information_

all reports, proxy statements or other communications by Buyer to its
shareholders generally; and (ii) all press releases relating to any
transactions.

 



69 6.02. _Opportunity of Employment;_ _Employee Benefits; Retention Pool
and Retention Restricted Stock Grants_



     | (a) |

Employees of Seller and Seller Sub (other than employees who are otherwise
parties to employment, severance or change in control agreements) (i) who are
not offered the opportunity to continue as employees following the Effective
Time or (ii) who are terminated without cause within six (6) months after the
Effective Time, shall be entitled to receive (A) the severance compensation
set forth in Section 6.02(a) of the Buyer Disclosure Schedule, (B) accrued
benefits, including paid time off, through the date of separation, (C) any
rights to continuation of medical coverage to the extent such rights are
required under applicable federal or state law and subject to the employees
compliance with all applicable requirements for such continuation coverage,
including payment of all premiums or other expenses related to such coverage,
and (D) outplacement consultation services of a type and nature to be agreed
upon by Seller and Buyer prior to the Effective Time and with a cost of up to
$2,000 for each such employee of Seller or Seller Sub. Nothing in this
Section 6.02 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be deemed to be a contract
of employment or be construed to give said employees any rights other than as
employees at will under applicable law. From and after the Effective Time,
the Employees of Seller and Seller Sub who remain employees of Buyer or any
Buyer Subsidiary after the Effective Time (including employees who are parties
to employment or change in control agreements) ("Continuing Employees") shall
be provided with employee benefits that are substantially similar to employee
benefits provided to other comparable employees under the Buyer Compensation
and Benefit Plans (excluding for this purpose any equity-based incentive
plans). Each Continuing Employee shall be credited with years of service with
Seller or Seller Sub for purposes of eligibility, vesting, entitlements to
benefits and levels of benefits (but not for benefit accrual purposes under
any defined benefit plan or agreement) in the employee benefit plans of
Buyer, and shall retain the vacation accrual earned under Sellers vacation
policy as of the Effective Time so that such Continuing Employee shall receive
under Buyers vacation policy a vacation benefit no less than what such
Continuing Employee had earned under Sellers vacation policy as of the
Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that any future accrual of benefits
shall be in accordance with Buyers vacation policy, subject to carryover
limitations applicable to such future accruals. In addition, Continuing
Employees who become eligible to participate in a Buyer Compensation and
Benefit Plan following the Effective Time (i) shall receive full credit under
such plans for any deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by such employees and their respective dependents under the
applicable Seller Compensation and Benefit Plan during the 

---|---|--- 
 



70 participation, and (ii) shall not be subject to any exclusion or penalty for
pre-existing conditions that were covered under Seller Compensation and
Benefit Plans immediately prior to the Effective Time, or to any waiting
period relating to such coverage. For purposes of clarification, and not by
way of limitation, all Continuing Employees shall commence participation in
Buyer 401(k) Plan as of the Effective Time, but such Continuing Employees
shall not be eligible to participate in Buyers Defined Benefit Pension Plan
(the "Defined Benefit Pension Plan"), participation in which has been frozen
since July 31, 2007. The foregoing covenants shall survive the Merger, and
Buyer shall, before the Effective Time, adopt resolutions that amend its tax-
qualified retirement plans to the extent necessary to provide for the service
credits applicable to Continuing Employees referenced herein. 
---|--- 



     | (b) | Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Seller,
Seller Sub, Buyer and Buyer Sub shall enter into amendments to the respective
employment agreements with each of Lloyd C. Hillard, Jr., J. David Smith,
Jr., Brenda Gayler and Mark A. Hampton. 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | As of the Effective Time and except as specifically provided
elsewhere in this Agreement, Buyer shall succeed Seller as sponsor and
administrator of the Seller Compensation and Benefit Plans and shall take such
action as necessary to effectuate such changes. Subject to Sections 6.02(a)
and except as specifically provided elsewhere in this Agreement, Buyer may
terminate, merge or amend any Seller Compensation and Benefit Plan or may
cease contributions to any Seller Compensation and Benefit Plan to the extent
permitted by applicable law; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer will provide
any benefits to which Seller Employees or their respective spouses, former
spouses or other qualifying beneficiaries may be entitled by reason of
qualifying events occurring prior to, on or after the Effective Time by virtue
of any provisions of any employee welfare benefit plan or group insurance
contract or any laws, statutes or regulations requiring any continuation of
benefit coverage upon the happening of certain events, such as the termination
of employment or change in beneficiary or dependent status, including, without
limitation, such requirements under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended, from and after the Effective Time
through the remaining legally-required period of coverage. 
---|---|--- 



     | (d) |

(i)Buyer shall provide a retention pool in the aggregate amount set forth in
Section 6.02(d)(i) of the Buyer Disclosure Schedule (the "Retention Pool")
for the purposes of retaining the services of employees of the Seller and the
Seller Subsidiaries ("Retention Employees") who are key employees. The Chief
Executive Officer of the Seller shall determine, subject to approval by the
President and Chief Executive Officer of the Buyer, the Retention Employees
eligible to receive retention 

---|---|--- 
 



71 and any criteria for payment of the Retention Bonus, and shall determine the
final allocation of payments from the Retention Pool. Any Retention Bonus
shall be intended to retain the services of the recipient through, and shall
be payable (unless such recipients employment is terminated (A) by Buyer or
Buyer Sub for cause or (B) by such recipient without good reason, as the case
may be, at such time) at, the end of the month following the conversion of the
data processing and information technology systems of Seller (the "Data
Conversion"). 
---|--- 
 

(ii) Buyer or Buyer Sub shall enter into agreements with the Seller Employees
identified in Section 6.02(d)(ii) of the Buyer Disclosure Schedule pursuant
to which agreements Buyer will agree to grant restricted Buyer Shares which
will cliff-vest on the third anniversary of the grant date if such Seller
Employee remains employed by Buyer or Buyer Sub at that time (the "Retention
Restricted Stock Agreements"), subject to the terms of the individual
Retention Restricted Stock Agreements. Grants under the Retention Restricted
Stock Agreements shall be made and become effective only upon the applicable
Seller Employees becoming employees of the Buyer or Buyer Sub at or after the
Effective Time. No grants under the Retention Restricted Stock Agreements will
be made or become effective before the Effective Time and Buyer will have
no obligation to make such grants if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
Section 11.01.

6.03. _Exchange Listing_

Buyer shall file a listing application with the Nasdaq for the Buyer Shares to
be issued to the former holders of Seller Shares in the Merger at the time
prescribed by applicable rules and regulations of the Nasdaq, and shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Buyer Shares to be issued in
connection with the Merger to be approved for listing on the Nasdaq Global
Select Market, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Closing
Date. In addition, Buyer will use its reasonable best efforts to maintain its
listing on the Nasdaq Global Select Market.

 

6.04. _Notification_

 

Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, Buyer shall promptly
notify Seller in writing if Buyer becomes aware of any fact or condition that
(i) causes or constitutes a breach in any material respect of any of Buyers
or Buyer Subs representations and warranties or (ii) would (except as
expressly contemplated by this Agreement) cause or constitute a breach in any
material respect of any such representation or warranty had such
representation or warranty been made as of the time of occurrence or discovery
of such fact or condition. Should any such fact or condition require any
change in the Buyer Disclosure Schedule, Buyer shall promptly deliver to
Seller a supplement to the Buyer Disclosure Schedule specifying such change
("Updated Buyer Disclosure Schedule"); _provided, however_ , that the 

 



72  disclosure of such change in the Updated Buyer Disclosure Schedule shall not
be deemed to constitute a cure of any breach of any representation or warranty
made pursuant to this Agreement unless consented to in writing by Seller.
During the same period, Buyer shall promptly notify Seller of (i) the
occurrence of any breach in any material respect of any of Buyers or Buyer
Subs covenants contained in this Agreement, (ii) the occurrence of any event
that may make the satisfaction of the conditions in this Agreement impossible
or unlikely in any material respect or (iii) the occurrence of any event that
is reasonably likely, individually or taken with all other facts, events or
circumstances known to Buyer, to result in a material adverse effect with
respect to Buyer.

 

6.05 _._ _Takeover Laws_

 

Buyer shall take all necessary steps to (a) exempt (or cause the continued

former director and officer of Seller and its Subsidiaries (in each case, when
acting in such capacity) (each an "Indemnified Party") against any costs or
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees ), judgments, fines, losses,
claims, damages or liabilities (collectively, "Costs") incurred in connection
with any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
whether arising before or after the Effective Time, arising out of the fact
that such person is or was a director or officer of Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries and pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time, including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
to the same extent as such persons are indemnified as of the date of this
Agreement by Seller pursuant to applicable law as effect on the date of this
Agreement, the Sellers articles of incorporation and bylaws or the governing
or organizational documents of any Subsidiary of Seller; and Buyer and the
Surviving Corporation shall also advance expenses as incurred by such
Indemnified Party to the same extent as such persons are entitled to
advancement of expenses as of the date of this Agreement by Seller pursuant to
the Sellers articles of incorporation and bylaws or the governing or
organizational documents of any Subsidiary of Seller; _provided_ , that the
Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to
repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Indemnified
Party is not entitled to indemnification under applicable law as effect on the
date of this Agreement or the Sellers articles of incorporation and bylaws. 
---|---|--- 
 



73 the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained in effect the current
policies of directors and officers liability insurance maintained by Seller
( _provided_ , that the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies
with a substantially comparable insurer of at least the same coverage and
amounts containing terms and conditions which are no less advantageous to the

premiums for such insurance would at any time exceed the Premium Cap, then the
Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained policies of insurance that,
in the Surviving Corporations good faith determination, provide the maximum
coverage available at an amount equal to the Premium Cap. In lieu of the
foregoing, Seller, in consultation with, but only upon the consent of Buyer,
may obtain at or prior to the Effective Time a six-year "tail" policy under
Sellers existing directors and officers insurance policy providing
equivalent coverage to that described in the preceding sentence if and to the
extent that the same may be obtained for an amount that does not exceed the
Premium Cap.

the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation
or merger, (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all its properties
and assets to any person or (iii) transfers, by means of a distribution, sale,
assignment or other transaction, all of the stock of the Surviving Corporation
or all or substantially all of its assets, to any person, then, and in each
such case, Buyer shall cause proper provision to be made so that the successor
and assign of Buyer or the Surviving Corporation assumes the obligations set
forth in this Section and in such event all references to the Surviving
Corporation in this Section shall be deemed a reference to such successor and
assign. 
---|---|--- 



     | (d) | Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under
Section 6.06(a), upon learning of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation described above, shall promptly notify Buyer thereof;
provided that the failure so to notify shall not affect the obligations of
Buyer under Section 6.06(a) unless and only to the extent that Buyer is
actually and materially prejudiced as a result of such failure. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (e) | The provisions of this Section 6.06 shall survive
consummation of the Merger and are intended to be for the benefit of, and to

Party and his or her heirs and representatives.

shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, reasonably assist
each other to facilitate the integration, from and after the Closing, of

Seller Subsidiaries, or otherwise violate applicable laws. From the date of
this Agreement through the Closing Date and consistent with the performance of
their day-to-day operations, the continuous operation of Seller and the
Seller Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business and applicable law,
Seller shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause the employees

action relative to third parties to facilitate the Data Conversion that
results in the imposition of any termination fees or other charges
or expenses, Buyer shall indemnify Seller for all such fees, charges and
expenses, and the costs of reversing the Data Conversion process, if the
Merger is not consummated for any reason, other than the breach of this
Agreement by Seller or Seller Sub or the termination of this Agreement by

Shareholder purchases, acquires the right to vote or acquires beneficial
ownership of (as defined in Rule 13d-3 of the Exchange Act, but excluding
Seller Shares held by the Shareholder in a fiduciary capacity) prior to the
Expiration Date (as defined in Section 2 below), whether by the exercise of
any stock options or otherwise;

 

WHEREAS, it is a condition to the willingness of Buyer to enter into the
Merger Agreement that the Shareholder execute and deliver this Agreement; and

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing recitals, the mutual
covenants and agreements contained herein, and other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged,
and intending to be legally bound hereby, the Shareholder and Buyer agree as
follows:

 

1\. _Agreement to Vote Shares_. The Shareholder agrees that, prior to the
Expiration Date (as defined in Section 2 hereof), at any meeting of the
shareholders of Seller, or any adjournment or postponement thereof, or in
connection with any written consent of the shareholders of Seller, with
respect to the Merger, the Merger Agreement or any Acquisition Proposal,

proposal, transaction or agreement that could reasonably be expected to
result in a breach of any covenant, representation or warranty, or any other
obligation or agreement, of Seller contained in the Merger Agreement or of the
Shareholder contained in this Agreement, or that could reasonably be expected
to impede, interfere with, delay, discourage, adversely affect, inhibit or
preclude the timely consummation of the Merger or the fulfillment of a
condition under the Merger Agreement to Sellers and Buyers respective
obligations to consummate the Merger or change in any manner the voting rights
of any class of shares of Seller (including any amendments to Sellers
articles of incorporation or bylaws); and (iii) against any
Acquisition Proposal, or any agreement or transaction that is intended, or

termination or expiration hereof.

3\. _Agreement to Retain Shares; No Voting Trusts_.

 

(a) Until the receipt of the requisite approval of the shareholders of Seller,
the Shareholder shall not, except as contemplated by this Agreement or the

---|---|--- 
 



\- 3 - 5\. _No Solicitation_. From and after the date hereof until the Expiration
Date, the Shareholder, solely in his or her capacity as a shareholder of
Seller, shall not, nor shall such Shareholder authorize any partner, officer,
director, advisor or representative of, such Shareholder or any of his or her

6. _Specific Enforcement_. The Shareholder has signed this Agreement intending to be legally bound thereby. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event any provision of this Agreement was not performed in accordance with the terms hereof and the Shareholder expressly agrees that this Agreement shall be specifically enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with its terms against the Shareholder, in addition to any other remedy that Buyer may have at law or in equity. All of the covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure to the benefit of, the respective parties and their permitted successors, assigns, heirs, executors, administrators and other legal representatives, as the case may be, but, except as otherwise specifically provided herein, neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations of the Shareholder hereunder may be assigned without the prior written consent of Buyer. 

 

7. _No Waivers_. No waivers of any breach of this Agreement extended by Buyer to the Shareholder shall be construed as a waiver of any rights or remedies of Buyer with respect to any other shareholder of Seller who has executed an agreement substantially in the form of this Agreement with respect to Shares beneficially owned by such shareholder or with respect to any subsequent breach by the Shareholder or any other such shareholder of Seller. No waiver of any provisions hereof by either party shall be deemed a waiver of any other provisions hereof by any such party, nor shall any such waiver be deemed a continuing waiver of any provision hereof by such party. 

 



\- 4 - 8. _No Ownership Interest_. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to vest in Buyer any direct or indirect ownership or incidence of ownership of or with respect to any of the Shares. All rights, ownership and economic benefits of and relating to the Shares shall remain vested in and belong to the Shareholder, and Buyer shall have no authority to direct the Shareholder in the voting or disposition of any of the Shares, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. 

 

9. _Capacity as Shareholder_. The Shareholder is signing this Agreement solely in the Shareholders capacity as a shareholder of Seller, and not in the Shareholders capacity as a director, officer or employee of Seller or any Seller Subsidiary or in the Shareholders capacity as a trustee or fiduciary of any employee benefit plan or trust. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, nothing herein shall in any way (a) restrict a director and/or officer of Seller in the exercise of his or her fiduciary duties, consistent with the terms of the Merger Agreement, as a director and/or officer of Seller or in his or her capacity as a trustee or fiduciary of any employee benefit plan or trust, or (b) prevent or be construed to create any obligation on the part of any director and/or officer of Seller or any trustee or fiduciary of any employee benefit plan or trust from taking any action or omitting to take any action in such capacity. 

 

10. _Entire Agreement; Amendments_. This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements, written or oral, between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and contains the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may not be amended, supplemented or modified, and no provisions hereof may be modified or waived, except by an instrument in writing signed by each party hereto. 

11. _Further Assurances_. From time to time and without additional consideration, the Shareholder shall execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, such additional transfers, assignments, endorsements, proxies, consents and other instruments, and shall take such further actions, as Buyer may reasonably request for the purpose of carrying out and furthering the purpose and intent of this Agreement. 

 

12. _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is determined to be invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public policy, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the greatest extent possible. 

 

13. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. 

 



\- 5 - 14. _Public Disclosure_. The Shareholder shall not issue or cause the publication of any press release or other public announcement (to the extent not previously issued or made in accordance with the Merger Agreement) with respect to this Agreement, the Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, without the prior consent of Buyer. The Shareholder hereby permits Buyer to publish and disclose in any document and/or schedule filed by Buyer with the SEC and in any press release or other disclosure document the Shareholders identity and ownership of Shares and the nature of the Shareholders commitments and obligations pursuant to this Agreement. 

 

15. _Governing Law; Waiver of Jury Trial_. 

 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
internal laws of the State of West Virginia, without giving effect to the
principles of conflicts of laws thereof that would cause the application of
the laws of any other jurisdiction.

(b) EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL
BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

 

16. _No Agreement Until Executed_. Irrespective of negotiations among the parties or the exchanging of drafts of this Agreement, this Agreement shall not constitute or be deemed to evidence a contract, agreement, arrangement or understanding between the parties hereto unless and until (a) the Board of Directors of Seller has approved, for purposes of any applicable anti-takeover laws and regulations and any applicable provision of Sellers articles of incorporation or bylaws, the Merger pursuant to the Merger Agreement, (b) the Merger Agreement is executed by all parties thereto, and (c) this Agreement is executed by all parties hereto.
