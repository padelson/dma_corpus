      AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of January 27, 2005 (this
"Agreement"), among The Procter & Gamble Company, an Ohio corporation
("Parent"), Aquarium Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), and The Gillette Company, a
Delaware corporation (the "Company" and collectively with Parent and Merger Sub,
the "parties").

                              W I T N E S S E T H:

      WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of the Company and Parent deem
it advisable and in the best interests of each corporation and its respective
stockholders that the Company and Parent engage in a business combination in
order to advance the long-term strategic business interests of the Company and
Parent;

      WHEREAS, the combination of the Company and Parent shall be effected by
the terms of this Agreement through a merger as outlined below (the "Merger");

      WHEREAS, in furtherance thereof, the respective Boards of Directors of the
Company and Parent have approved the Merger, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, pursuant to which each share of common
stock, par value $1.00 per share, of the Company ("Company Common Stock") issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (as defined in Section
1.03), other than shares owned or held directly or indirectly by Parent or
directly or indirectly by the Company, will be converted into the right to
receive shares of common stock, without par value, of Parent ("Parent Common
Stock") as set forth in Section 1.08; and

      WHEREAS, for Federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger
shall qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and the regulations
promulgated thereunder.

      NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this
Agreement, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as
follows:

                                   ARTICLE 1
                       THE MERGER; CERTAIN RELATED MATTERS

      Section 1.01 The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation
Law (the "DGCL"), Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company at the
Effective Time. Following the Merger, the separate corporate existence of Merger
Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation (the
"Surviving Corporation").

      Section 1.02 Closing. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in Article 6, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will take place on
the first Business Day
<PAGE>

after the satisfaction or waiver (subject to applicable law) of the conditions
(excluding conditions that, by their nature, cannot be satisfied until the
Closing Date, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions at
the Closing) set forth in Article 6, unless this Agreement has been previously
terminated pursuant to its terms or unless another time or date is agreed to in
writing by the parties (the actual date of the Closing being referred to herein
as the "Closing Date"). The Closing shall be held at the offices of Cadwalader,
Wickersham & Taft LLP, One World Financial Center, New York, New York 10281,
unless another place is agreed to in writing by the parties.

      Section 1.03 Effective Time. At the Closing the parties shall file a
certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger") in such form as is required
by and executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL. The
Merger shall become effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger is duly
filed with the Delaware Secretary of State or at such subsequent time as Parent
and the Company shall agree and as shall be specified in the Certificate of
Merger (the time the Merger becomes effective being the "Effective Time").

      Section 1.04 Effects of the Merger. At and after the Effective Time, the
Merger will have the effects set forth in the DGCL. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time all the
property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger
Sub shall be vested in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and
duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and
duties of the Surviving Corporation.

      Section 1.05 Certificate of Incorporation. The certificate of
incorporation of the Company, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation,
until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable law.

      Section 1.06 Bylaws. The bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable law.

      Section 1.07 Officers and Directors. From and after the Effective Time,
until successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified in accordance with
applicable law, (i) the directors of Merger Sub at the Effective Time shall be
the directors of the Surviving Corporation and (ii) the officers of the Company
at the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation.

      Section 1.08 Effect on Capital Stock.

      (a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of the holder thereof, each share of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of
Company Common Stock owned by Parent or Merger Sub or owned by the Company
(other than those held by the Company in a fiduciary or representative
capacity), all of which shall be canceled as provided in Section 1.08(c)),
together with the associated Company Rights (as defined in Section 3.02(b)) (the
"Shares"), shall be converted into the right to receive 0.975 shares (the
"Exchange Ratio")

                                      -2-
<PAGE>

of validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable Parent Common Stock (the
"Merger Consideration").

      (b) As a result of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
holders thereof, at the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock
(together with the associated Company Rights) shall cease to be outstanding and
shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented any such shares of Company Common Stock shall thereafter cease to
have any rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock (together
with the associated Company Rights), except as provided herein or by law.

      (c) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and owned by Parent, Merger
Sub or any other wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent or owned by the Company
(other than those held by the Company in a fiduciary or representative capacity)
at the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger, cease to be outstanding
and shall be canceled and retired and no stock of Parent or other consideration
shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

      (d) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of the holder thereof, each share of common stock, par value $.01
per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and
non-assessable share of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.

      Section 1.09 Company Stock Options and Other Equity-based Awards.

      (a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall amend the Company Stock
Option Plans (as defined in Section 3.02(b)), to provide that (i) each person
who holds a Company Stock Option (as defined in Section 3.02(b)) at the
Effective Time agrees prior to the Effective Time to be bound by the terms and
conditions that parallel the terms and conditions of Parent's 2001 Stock and
Incentive Compensation Plan with respect to non-compete agreements prohibiting
such holder's competing with Parent and the Company but only with respect to (A)
any business conducted by the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time or
(B) any business of Parent or an Affiliate in which the holder was employed from
the Effective Time through the termination of the holder's employment; (ii) with
respect to each Company Stock Option, a termination of employment for Good
Reason after the Effective Time shall be treated for all purposes under the
Company Stock Option Plans the same as (A) a "Special Separation," or (B) in the
case of a retirement eligible holder under the Company's Benefit Plans, as a
"Retirement," in each case under Parent's 2001 Stock and Incentive Compensation
Plan; and (iii) each holder of a Company Stock Option shall enter into an
agreement with the Company (an "Option Agreement") pursuant to which Company and
each such holder shall agree to the foregoing.

      (b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall amend the Company Stock
Option Plans to provide each Company Stock Option that was granted pursuant to
the Company Stock Option Plans prior to the Effective Time (other than Company
Stock Options granted pursuant to the terms of Section 4.02(c), the vesting and
exercisability of which shall not accelerate prior to or upon the Effective
Time) and which remains outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(whether or not previously vested and exercisable) shall be vested and
exercisable effective

                                      -3-
<PAGE>

immediately prior to the Effective Time, and that pursuant to a procedure to be
implemented by the Company, such holder may exercise such Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time, in whole or in part, and in respect thereof shall
be entitled to receive, at the holder's election, either (i) the Merger
Consideration with respect to the Shares issuable as a result of such exercise
(the "Merger Shares" ) or (ii) a cash payment equal to the product of (A) the
excess (if any) of the per share value of the Merger Shares over the per share
exercise price, multiplied by (B) the number of Shares with respect to which a
Company Stock option is exercised, in each case subject to applicable
withholding taxes.

      (c) Each Company Stock Option which remains outstanding at the Effective
Time shall cease to represent a right to acquire shares of Company Common Stock
and shall be converted, at the Effective Time, into an option to acquire, on the
same terms and conditions as were applicable under the Company Stock Option (but
taking into account any changes thereto, provided for in the Company Stock
Option Plans or in such option by reason of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby), that number of shares of Parent Common Stock determined by
multiplying the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company
Stock Option by the Exchange Ratio, rounded, if necessary, to the nearest whole
share of Parent Common Stock, at a price per share (rounded to the nearest
one-hundredth of a cent) equal to the per share exercise price specified in such
Company Stock Option divided by the Exchange Ratio; provided, however, that in
the case of any Company Stock Option to which Section 421 of the Code applies by
reason of its qualification under Section 422 of the Code, the option price, the
number of shares subject to such option and, except to the extent otherwise
required by this Section 1.09, the terms and conditions of exercise of such
option shall be determined in a manner consistent with the requirements of
Section 424(a) of the Code. On or prior to the Effective Time, the Company will
take all actions necessary such that all Company Stock Options outstanding at
the Effective Time under the Company Stock Option Plans are treated in
accordance with the immediately preceding sentences.

      (d) Subject to the execution and delivery to Parent of the Option
Agreement prior to the Effective Time, effective at the Effective Time Parent
shall assume, on the terms and conditions set forth in this Section 1.09, each
Company Stock Option Plan and each Company Stock Option granted thereunder that
was not exercised prior to the Effective Time. To the extent permitted by law
but not in derogation of the provisions of this Section 1.09, Parent shall take
such reasonable steps as may be necessary to cause the Company Stock Options
which qualified under Section 422 of Code as incentive stock options prior to
the Effective Time to continue to qualify as incentive stock options of Parent
after the Effective Time.

      (e) Prior to the Closing, Parent shall take all corporate action necessary
to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock for
delivery upon exercise of Company Stock Options or in connection with restricted
shares or in connection with the settlement of stock accounts in accordance with
this Section 1.09. Promptly after the Effective Time, but no later than five (5)
Business Days after the Effective Time, Parent shall file a registration
statement on Form S-3 or Form S-8, as the case may be (or any successor or other
appropriate forms), with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock subject to
such options or restricted shares or stock accounts and shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement
or registration statements (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or
prospectuses contained therein) for so long as such options, restricted

                                      -4-
<PAGE>

shares or stock accounts remain outstanding or for so long as such registration
statement is required with respect to any other Company Benefit Plan. With
respect to those individuals who subsequent to the Merger will be subject to the
reporting requirements under Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), where applicable, Parent shall administer
the Company Stock Option Plans in a manner consistent with the exemptions
provided by Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

      Section 1.10 Certain Adjustments. If, between the date of this Agreement
and the Effective Time, the outstanding Parent Common Stock or Company Common
Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or different
class by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split,
split-up, combination or exchange of shares or a stock dividend or dividend
payable in any other securities shall be declared with a record date within such
period, or any similar event shall have occurred (other than exchange of Company
Stock Options or Parent Stock Options), the Exchange Ratio shall be
appropriately adjusted to provide to the holders of Company Common Stock the
same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

                                   ARTICLE 2
                               EXCHANGE OF SHARES

      Section 2.01 Exchange Fund. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
appoint a commercial bank or trust company to act as exchange agent hereunder
for the purpose of exchanging Shares for the Merger Consideration (the "Exchange
Agent"). At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the
Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of holders of shares of Company Common
Stock, certificates representing the Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to
Section 1.08. Parent agrees to make available directly or indirectly to the
Exchange Agent from time to time as needed, cash sufficient to pay cash in lieu
of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.05 and any dividends and other
distributions pursuant to Section 2.03. Any cash and certificates of Parent
Common Stock deposited with the Exchange Agent shall hereinafter be referred to
as the "Exchange Fund."

      Section 2.02 Exchange Procedures. Promptly after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of
Shares (i) a letter of transmittal which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Shares shall pass, only upon proper
delivery of the Shares to the Exchange Agent, and which letter shall be in
customary form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify
(such letter to be reasonably acceptable to the Company prior to the Effective
Time) and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of such Shares in
exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of the Shares to the
Exchange Agent together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and
completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents
as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Shares
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (A) one or more shares of
Parent Common Stock (which shall be in uncertificated book-entry form unless a
physical certificate is requested by such holder) representing, in the
aggregate, the whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder
has the right to receive pursuant to Section 1.08 (after taking into account all
shares of Company Common Stock then held by such holder) and (B) a check in the
amount equal to the cash that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to
the provisions

                                      -5-
<PAGE>

of this Article 2, consisting of cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.05 and dividends and other distributions
pursuant to Section 2.03 ("Cash Payments"). No interest will be paid or will
accrue on any Cash Payments. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company
Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the
Merger Consideration and any Cash Payments to which such holder is entitled, may
be issued with respect to such Company Common Stock to such a transferee if the
Shares are presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents
required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any
applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid.

      Section 2.03 Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares. No
dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to shares of
Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to
the holder of any unsurrendered Shares with respect to the shares of Parent
Common Stock that such holder would be entitled to receive upon surrender of
such Shares and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 2.05 until such
holder shall surrender such Shares in accordance with Section 2.02. Subject to
the effect of applicable laws, following surrender of any such Shares, there
shall be paid to such holder of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable in
exchange therefor, without interest, (a) promptly after the time of such
surrender, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.05 and the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent
Common Stock, and (b) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends
or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to
such surrender and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with
respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock.

      Section 2.04 No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. All
shares of Parent Common Stock issued and cash paid upon conversion of shares of
Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of Article 1 and this Article
2 (including any cash paid pursuant to Section 2.03 or 2.05) shall be deemed to
have been issued or paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such
shares of Company Common Stock.

      Section 2.05 No Fractional Shares of Parent Common Stock. (a) No
certificates or scrip or shares of Parent Common Stock representing fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock or book-entry credit of the same shall be issued
upon the surrender for exchange of the Shares and such fractional share
interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to have any rights of a
stockholder of Parent or a holder of shares of Parent Common Stock.

      (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of
shares of Company Common Stock exchanged pursuant to the Merger who would
otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common
Stock (after taking into account all Shares delivered by such holder) shall
receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to the
product of (i) such fractional part of a share of Parent Common Stock multiplied
by (ii) the closing price for a share of Parent Common Stock on the New York
Stock Exchange, Inc. ("NYSE") Composite Transactions Tape on the Closing Date.
Such payment of cash consideration in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock is not expected to exceed, in the aggregate, 1% of the total merger
consideration.

                                      -6-
<PAGE>

      (c) As promptly as practicable after the determination of the amount of
cash, if any, to be paid to holders of fractional interests, the Exchange Agent
shall so notify Parent, and Parent shall deposit or cause the Surviving
Corporation to deposit such amount with the Exchange Agent and shall cause the
Exchange Agent to forward payments to such holders of fractional interests
subject to and in accordance with the terms hereof.

      Section 2.06 Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of Shares for six months after
the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, and any holders of the Shares
who have not theretofore complied with this Article 2 shall thereafter look only
to Parent for the Merger Consideration with respect to such Shares (including
any Cash Payments). Any such portion of the Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed by
holders of shares of Company Common Stock five years after the Effective Time
(or such earlier date immediately prior to such time as such amounts would
otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity (as defined
in Section 3.01(c)(iii)) shall, to the extent permitted by law, become the
property of the Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claims or interest
of any Person previously entitled thereto.

      Section 2.07 No Liability. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in
respect of any Merger Consideration from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

      Section 2.08 Investment of the Exchange Fund. The Exchange Agent shall
invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent on a daily
basis; provided, that no gain or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable
to the Company stockholders pursuant to Article 1 and the other provisions of
this Article 2. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments
shall promptly be paid to Parent.

      Section 2.09 Lost Certificates. If any certificate for Shares shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the Person claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in
such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such certificate,
the Exchange Agent will deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
certificate the applicable Merger Consideration (including any Cash Payments)
with respect to the shares of the Company Common Stock formerly represented
thereby.

      Section 2.10 Withholding Rights. Each of the Surviving Corporation and
Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common
Stock, Company Stock Options or any other equity rights in the Company such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under the Code and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case
may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common
Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be.

and directors of the Surviving Corporation will be authorized to execute and
deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, any deeds,
bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name and on
behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, any other actions and things to vest,
perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any and
all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties or
assets acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of,
or in connection with, the Merger.

      Section 2.12 Stock Transfer Books. The stock transfer books of the Company
shall be closed immediately upon the Effective Time and there shall be no
further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock thereafter
on the records of the Company. On or after the Effective Time, any Shares
presented to the Exchange Agent or Parent for any reason shall be converted into
the Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock
formerly represented thereby (including any cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to
Section 2.05) and any dividends or other distributions to which the holders
thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 2.03.

      Section 2.13 Affiliates. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
to the fullest extent permitted by law, no certificates representing shares of
Parent Common Stock or cash shall be delivered to a Person who is an "affiliate"

and delivered an Affiliate Agreement (as defined in Section 5.11) to Parent.

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

      Section 3.01 Representations and Warranties of Parent. Except as set forth

            (i) Each of Parent and each of its Subsidiaries (as defined in
      Section 8.11) is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
      under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or organization, has
      the requisite corporate (or similar) power and authority to own, lease and
      operate its properties and to carry on its business as now being
      conducted, except where the failures to be so organized, existing or in
      good standing or to have such power and authority, individually or in the
      aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
      Effect (as defined in Section 8.11) on Parent, and is duly qualified and
      in good standing to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature
      of its business or the ownership or leasing of its properties makes such
      qualification necessary except where the failures so to qualify or to be
      in good standing, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably
      be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. The copies of the
      amended articles of incorporation and regulations of Parent which were
      previously furnished or made available to the Company are true, complete
      and correct copies of such documents as in effect on the date of this
      Agreement.

      ended June 30, 2004 includes all the Subsidiaries of Parent which as of
      the date thereof were Significant Subsidiaries (as defined in Rule 1-02 of
      Regulation S-X of the SEC). All the outstanding shares of capital stock
      of, or other equity interests in, each such Significant Subsidiary have
      been validly issued and are fully paid and non-assessable and are, except
      as set forth in Exhibit 21, owned directly or indirectly by Parent, free
      and clear of all pledges, claims, liens, charges, encumbrances and
      security interests of any kind or nature whatsoever (collectively,
      "Liens") (including any restriction on the right to vote, sell or
      otherwise dispose of such capital stock or other ownership interests),
      except for restrictions imposed by applicable laws.

      (b) Capital Structure.

            (i) As of December 31, 2004, the authorized capital stock of Parent

      issued, fully paid and non-assessable and free of any preemptive rights.
      There were outstanding as of December 31, 2004, no options, warrants or
      other rights to acquire capital stock from Parent other than options,
      restricted stock and other rights to acquire capital stock from Parent
      representing in the aggregate the right to purchase 270,623,943 shares of

      Parent's 2001 Stock and Incentive Compensation Plan, Parent's 1992 Stock
      Plan, Parent's 1993 Non-Employee Directors' Stock Plan, Parent's Future

            (iii) Except as disclosed in the Parent SEC Reports filed prior to
      the date hereof or as otherwise set forth in this Section 3.01(b) and as
      contemplated by Section 1.08 and Section 1.09, as of January 24, 2005,
      there are no securities, options, warrants, calls, rights, commitments,
      agreements, arrangements or undertakings of any kind to which Parent or
      any of its Significant Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them is
      bound obligating Parent or any of its Significant Subsidiaries to issue,
      deliver or sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or sold, additional
      shares of capital stock or other voting securities of Parent or any of its
      Significant Subsidiaries or obligating Parent or any of its Significant
      Subsidiaries to issue, grant, extend or enter into any such security,

      option, warrant, call, right, commitment, agreement, arrangement or
      undertaking. Except as disclosed in the Parent SEC Reports filed prior to
      the date hereof, as of the date of this Agreement, there are no
      outstanding obligations of Parent or any of its Significant Subsidiaries
      to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of capital stock of
      Parent or any of its Significant Subsidiaries. Except as disclosed in the
      Parent SEC Reports filed prior to the date hereof, there are not
      outstanding any stock-appreciation rights, security-based performance
      units, "phantom" stock or other security rights or other agreements,
      arrangements or commitments of any character (contingent or otherwise)
      pursuant to which any Person is or may be entitled to receive any payment
      or other value based on the revenues, earnings or financial performance,
      stock price performance or other attribute of Parent or any of its
      Subsidiaries or assets or calculated in accordance therewith (other than
      payments or commissions to employees or agents of Parent or any of its
      Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
      practices) or to cause Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to file a
      registration statement under the Securities Act or which otherwise relate
      to the registration of any securities of Parent or its Subsidiaries.

      (c) Authority; No Conflicts.

            (i) Parent has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter
      into this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated
      hereby, subject to obtaining the requisite stockholder approval (the
      "Parent Stockholder Approval") of this Agreement and the issuance of the
      shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger (the "Share
      Issuance"). The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
      consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly
      authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of Parent,
      subject to obtaining the Parent Stockholder Approval. This Agreement has
      been duly executed and delivered by Parent and constitutes a valid and
      binding agreement of Parent, enforceable against it in accordance with its
      terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy,
      insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws relating to or
      affecting creditors generally or by general equity principles (regardless
      of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or
      at law).

            (ii) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent does not
      or will not, as the case may be, and the consummation by Parent of the
      Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby will not, conflict
      with, or result in any violation of, or constitute a default (with or
      without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right
      of, or result by its terms in the, termination, material amendment,
      cancellation or acceleration of any material obligation or the loss of a
      material benefit under, or the creation of a lien, pledge, security
      interest, charge or other encumbrance on, or the loss of, any material
      assets (any such conflict, violation, default, right of termination,
      amendment, cancellation or acceleration, loss or creation, a "Violation")
      pursuant to: (A) any provision of the amended articles of incorporation or
      regulations of Parent or except as, individually or in the aggregate,
      would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
      Parent, any provision of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of any
      Significant Subsidiary (as defined in Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X of the
      SEC) of Parent, or (B) except as, individually or in the aggregate, would
      not reasonably be

                                      -10-
<PAGE>

      expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent, subject to obtaining
      or making the consents, approvals, orders, authorizations, registrations,
      declarations and filings referred to in paragraph (iii) below, any loan or
      credit agreement, note, mortgage, bond, indenture, lease, benefit plan or
      other agreement, obligation, instrument, permit, concession, franchise,
      license, judgment, order, decree, statute, law, ordinance, rule or
      regulation applicable to Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent or their
      respective properties or assets.

            (iii) No consent, approval, order or authorization of, or
      registration, declaration or filing with, any supranational, national,
      state, municipal, local or foreign government, any instrumentality,
      subdivision, court, administrative agency or commission or other authority
      thereof, or any quasi-governmental or private body exercising any
      regulatory, taxing, importing or other governmental or quasi-governmental
      authority (a "Governmental Entity"), is required by or with respect to
      Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent in connection with the execution and
      delivery of this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub or the consummation of
      the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, except for
      those required under or in relation to (A) the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
      Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR Act"), (B) state securities
      or "blue sky" laws (the "Blue Sky Laws"), (C) the Securities Act, (D) the
      Exchange Act, (E) the DGCL with respect to the filing of the Certificate
      of Merger, (F) rules and regulations of the NYSE, (G) antitrust or other
      competition laws, of the European Union or other jurisdictions, and (H)
      such other consents, approvals, orders, authorizations, registrations,
      declarations and filings the failures of which to make or obtain,
      individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have
      a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Consents, approvals, orders,
      authorizations, registrations, declarations and filings required under or
      in relation to any of the foregoing clauses (A) through (G) are
      hereinafter referred to as "Specified Consents."

      (d) Reports and Financial Statements.

            (i) Parent has filed all required registration statements,
      prospectuses, reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents
      required to be filed by it with the SEC since June 30, 2003 (collectively,
      including all exhibits thereto, the "Parent SEC Reports"). No Subsidiary
      of Parent is required to file any form, report, registration statement,
      prospectus or other document with the SEC. None of the Parent SEC Reports,
      as of their respective dates (and, if amended or superseded by a filing
      prior to the date of this Agreement or the Closing Date, then on the date
      of such filing), contained or will contain any untrue statement of a
      material fact or omitted or will omit to state a material fact required to
      be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
      the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Each of the
      financial statements (including the related notes) included in the Parent
      SEC Reports presents fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
      financial position and consolidated results of operations and cash flows
      of Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the respective dates or
      for the respective periods set forth therein, all in conformity with
      generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") consistently applied
      during the periods involved except as otherwise noted therein, and
      subject, in the case of the unaudited interim financial statements, to the
      absence of notes and normal year-end adjustments that have not been and
      are not expected to be material in amount. All of

                                      -11-
<PAGE>

      such Parent SEC Reports, as of their respective dates (and as of the date
      of any amendment to the respective Parent SEC Report), complied as to form
      in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
      Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
      promulgated thereunder.

            (ii) Except as disclosed in the Parent SEC Reports filed prior to
      the date hereof, since December 31, 2003, Parent and its Subsidiaries have
      not incurred any liabilities that are of a nature that would be required
      to be disclosed on a balance sheet of Parent and its Subsidiaries or the
      footnotes thereto prepared in conformity with GAAP, other than (A)
      liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business and (B)
      liabilities that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably
      be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

      (e) Information Supplied.

            (i) None of the information supplied or to be supplied by Parent for
      inclusion or incorporation by reference in (A) the Form S-4 (as defined in
      Section 5.01) will, at the time the Form S-4 is filed with the SEC, at any
      time it is amended or supplemented or at the time it becomes effective
      under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact
      or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
      necessary to make the statements therein not misleading and (B) the Joint
      Proxy Statement/Prospectus will, on the date it is first mailed to the
      Company stockholders or Parent stockholders or at the time of the Company
      Stockholders Meeting or the Parent Stockholders Meeting (each as defined
      in Section 5.01), contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
      to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
      order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
      which they were made, not misleading.

            (ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section
      3.01(e), no representation or warranty is made by Parent with respect to
      statements made or incorporated by reference in the Form S-4 or the Joint
      Proxy Statement/Prospectus based on information supplied by the Company
      for inclusion or incorporation by reference therein.

      (f) Board Approval. The Board of Directors of Parent, by resolutions duly
adopted by unanimous vote at a meeting duly called and held (the "Parent Board
Approval"), has duly (i) determined that this Agreement and the Merger are
advisable and are fair to and in the best interests of Parent and its
stockholders, (ii) approved this Agreement, the Merger and the Share Issuance
and (iii) recommended that the stockholders of Parent approve this Agreement and
the Share Issuance and directed that this Agreement and the Share Issuance be
submitted for consideration by Parent's stockholders at the Parent Stockholders
Meeting.

      (g) Vote Required. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of
the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock to adopt this Agreement and
approve the Share Issuance is the only vote of the holders of any class or
series of Parent capital stock necessary to adopt this Agreement and approve the
Share Issuance.

      (h) Litigation; Compliance with Laws.

            (i) Except as disclosed in the Parent SEC Reports filed prior to the
      date of this Agreement, there are no suits, actions, claims, arbitrations,
      proceedings or investigations (collectively "Actions") pending or, to the
      knowledge of Parent, threatened, against or affecting Parent or any
      Subsidiary of Parent which, individually or in the aggregate, would
      reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent, nor
      are there any judgments, decrees, injunctions, rules or orders of any
      Governmental Entity or arbitrator outstanding against Parent or any
      Subsidiary of Parent which, individually or in the aggregate, would
      reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

            (ii) Except as disclosed in the Parent SEC Reports filed prior to
      the date of this Agreement and except as, individually or in the
      aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
      Effect on Parent, (A) Parent and its Subsidiaries hold all permits,
      licenses, variances, exemptions, orders and approvals of all Governmental
      Entities which are necessary for the operation of the businesses of Parent
      and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (the "Parent Permits"), and (B) no
      Parent Permit is subject to any pending revocation or forfeiture. Parent
      and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with the terms of the Parent
      Permits, except where the failures to so comply, individually or in the
      aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
      Effect on Parent. Except as disclosed in the Parent SEC Reports filed
      prior to the date of this Agreement, neither Parent nor any of its
      Subsidiaries is in violation of, and Parent and its Subsidiaries have not
      received any notices of violations with respect to, any laws, ordinances
      or regulations of any Governmental Entity, except for violations which,
      individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have
      a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

      (i) Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Except for liabilities incurred
in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby,
except as disclosed in the Parent SEC Reports filed prior to the date of this
Agreement, and except as permitted by Section 4.01, since September 30, 2004,
Parent and its Subsidiaries have conducted their business only in the ordinary
course and there have not been any changes, circumstances or events which,
individually or in the aggregate, have had, or would reasonably be expected to
have, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

      (j) Brokers or Finders. No agent, broker, investment banker, financial
advisor or other firm or Person is or will be entitled to any broker's or
finder's fee or any other similar commission or fee in connection with any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, based upon arrangements made by
or on behalf of Parent, except Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith
Incorporated ("Merrill Lynch"), whose fees and expenses will be paid by Parent.

      (k) Opinions of Parent Financial Advisors. Parent has received the opinion
of Merrill Lynch, dated the date of this Agreement, to the effect that, as of
such date, the Exchange Ratio is fair from a financial point of view to Parent.

                                      -13-

      (l) Employee Benefit Plans. Except as disclosed in the Parent SEC Reports,
there are no Benefit Plans maintained by Parent covering only Parent executive
officers. Each Benefit Plan maintained by Parent has been operated and
administered in accordance with its terms and applicable law, except where
failure to do so would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. The execution of this
Agreement and the consummation of the Merger will not constitute an event under
any Benefit Plan maintained by Parent that will or may result in any payment,
acceleration, termination, forgiveness of indebtedness, vesting, distribution,
increase in compensation or benefits or obligation to fund benefits with respect
to any Parent employee with such exceptions which, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Parent.

      (m) Taxes.

            (i) Parent and each of its Subsidiaries has timely filed, or has
      caused to be timely filed, all Tax Returns required to be filed, and all
      such Tax Returns are true, complete and accurate, except to the extent any
      failure to file or any inaccuracies in any filed Tax Returns would not,
      individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on
      Parent. All Taxes shown to be due on such Tax Returns, or otherwise owed,
      have been timely paid, except to the extent that any failure to pay,
      individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be
      expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

            (ii) The most recent financial statements contained in Parent SEC
      Reports reflect an adequate reserve for all Taxes payable by Parent and
      its Subsidiaries for all Taxable periods and portions thereof through the
      date of such financial statements. No deficiency with respect to any Taxes
      has been proposed, asserted or assessed against Parent or any of its
      Subsidiaries, and no requests for waivers of the time to assess any such
      Taxes are pending, except to the extent any such deficiency or request for
      waiver, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not
      reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

            (iii) The Federal income Tax Returns of Parent and each of its
      Subsidiaries consolidated in such Returns have been examined by and
      settled with the United States Internal Revenue Service for all years
      through 1998. All material assessments for Taxes due with respect to such
      completed and settled examinations or any concluded litigation have been
      fully paid.

            (iv) There are no material Liens for Taxes (other than for current
      Taxes not yet due and payable) on the assets of Parent or any of its
      Subsidiaries. (v) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has been a
      party to any distribution occurring during the previous three (3) years in
      which the parties to such distribution treated the distribution as one to
      which Section 355 applied.

            (vi) For purposes of this Agreement:

Parent SEC Reports filed prior to the date of this Agreement or except as would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Parent, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party

      organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its
      jurisdiction of incorporation or organization, has the requisite corporate
      (or similar) power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties
      and to carry on its business as now being conducted, except where the
      failures to be so organized, existing or in good standing or to have such
      power and authority, individually or in the aggregate, would not
      reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company,
      and is duly qualified and in good standing to do business in each
      jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the ownership or
      leasing of its properties makes such qualification necessary except where
      the failures so to qualify or to be in good standing, individually or in
      the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
      Effect on the Company. The copies of the certificate of incorporation and
      bylaws of the Company which were previously furnished or made available to
      Parent are true, complete and correct copies of such documents as in
      effect on the date of this Agreement.

      year ended December 31, 2003 includes all the Subsidiaries of the Company
      which as of the date thereof were Significant Subsidiaries (as defined in
      Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X of the SEC). All the outstanding shares of
      capital stock of, or other equity interests in, each such Significant
      Subsidiary have been validly issued and are fully paid and non-assessable
      and are, except as set forth in Exhibit 21, owned directly or indirectly
      by the Company, free and clear of all Liens (including any restriction on
      the right to vote, sell or otherwise dispose of such capital stock or
      other ownership interests), except for restrictions imposed by applicable
      laws.

      consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly
      authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company,
      subject in the case of the consummation of the Merger to the adoption of
      this Agreement by the Company Stockholder Approval. This Agreement has
      been duly executed and delivered by the Company and constitutes a valid
      and binding agreement of the Company, enforceable against it in accordance
      with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by
      bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws
      relating to or affecting creditors generally or by general equity
      principles (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a
      proceeding in equity or at law).

            (ii) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company
      does not or will not, as the case may be, and the consummation by the
      Company of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby will
      not, conflict with, or result in a Violation pursuant to: (A) any
      provision of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company or
      except as, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
      expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, any provision
      of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of any Significant
      Subsidiary (as defined in Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X of the SEC) of the

      indenture, lease, benefit plan or other agreement, obligation, instrument,

            (iii) No consent, approval, order or authorization of, or
      registration, declaration or filing with, any Governmental Entity is
      required by or with respect to the Company or any Subsidiary of the
      Company in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement by
      the Company or the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
      contemplated hereby, except the Specified Consents and such other
      consents,

                                      -17-
<PAGE>

      approvals, orders, authorizations, registrations, declarations and filings
      the failure of which to make or obtain, individually or in the aggregate,
      would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
      Company.

      (d) Reports and Financial Statements.

            (i) The Company has filed all required registration statements,
      prospectuses, reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents
      required to be filed by it with the SEC since January 1, 2003
      (collectively, including all exhibits thereto, the "Company SEC Reports").
      No Subsidiary of the Company is required to file any form, report,
      registration statement or prospectus or other document with the SEC. None
      of the Company SEC Reports, as of their respective dates (and, if amended
      or superseded by a filing prior to the date of this Agreement or the
      Closing Date, then on the date of such filing), contained or will contain
      any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or will omit to state a
      material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
      statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
      made, not misleading. Each of the financial statements (including the
      related notes) included in the Company SEC Reports presents fairly, in all
      material respects, the consolidated financial position and consolidated
      results of operations and cash flows of the Company and its consolidated
      Subsidiaries as of the respective dates or for the respective periods set
      forth therein, all in conformity with GAAP consistently applied during the
      periods involved except as otherwise noted therein, and subject, in the
      case of the unaudited interim financial statements, to the absence of
      notes and normal year-end adjustments that have not been and are not
      expected to be material in amount. All of such Company SEC Reports, as of
      their respective dates (and as of the date of any amendment to the
      respective Company SEC Report), complied as to form in all material
      respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the
      Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.

            (ii) Except as disclosed in the Company SEC Reports filed prior to
      the date hereof, since December 31, 2003, the Company and its Subsidiaries
      have not incurred any liabilities that are of a nature that would be
      required to be disclosed on a balance sheet of the Company and its
      Subsidiaries or the footnotes thereto prepared in conformity with GAAP,
      other than (A) liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business and
      (B) liabilities that, individually or in the aggregate, would not
      reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

            (iii) Since the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the
      "Sarbanes-Oxley Act"), the Company has been and is in compliance in all
      material respects with (A) the applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley
      Act and (B) the applicable listing and corporate governance rules and
      regulations of the NYSE. Section 3.01(d)(iii) of the Company Disclosure
      Letter sets forth, as of the date hereof, a schedule of all officers and
      directors of the Company who may have outstanding loans from the Company,
      and there has been no default on, or forgiveness or waiver of, in whole or
      in part, any such loan during the two years immediately preceding the date
      hereof.

                                      -18-
<PAGE>

            (iv) The Company has designed disclosure controls and procedures to
      ensure that material information relating to the Company, including its
      consolidated Subsidiaries, is made known to the chief executive officer
      and the chief financial officer of the Company by others within those
      entities.

            (v) The Company has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation
      prior to the date hereof, to the Company's auditors and the audit
      committee of the Company's Board of Directors (A) any significant
      deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of
      internal controls over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to
      adversely affect in any material respect the Company's ability to record,
      process, summarize and report financial information and (B) any fraud,
      whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who
      have a significant role in the Company's internal controls over financial
      reporting.

            (vi) As of the date hereof, the Company has not identified any
      material control deficiencies other than as disclosed in Section
      3.01(d)(vi) of the Company Disclosure Letter. To the knowledge of the
      Company, there is no reason to believe that its auditors and its chief
      executive officer and chief financial officer will not be able to give the
      certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and
      regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act,
      without qualification, when next due.

      (e) Information Supplied.

            (i) None of the information supplied or to be supplied by the
      Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (A) the Form S-4
      will, at the time the Form S-4 is filed with the SEC, at any time it is
      amended or supplemented or at the time it becomes effective under the
      Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
      state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
      the statements therein not misleading, and (B) the Joint Proxy
      Statement/Prospectus will, on the date it is first mailed to the Company
      stockholders or Parent stockholders or at the time of the Company
      Stockholders Meeting or the Parent Stockholders Meeting, contain any
      untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
      required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
      therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
      misleading.

            (ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section
      3.02(e), no representation or warranty is made by the Company with respect
      to statements made or incorporated by reference in the Form S-4 or the
      Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus based on information supplied by Parent
      or Merger Sub for inclusion or incorporation by reference therein.

      (f) Board Approval. The Board of Directors of the Company, by resolutions
duly adopted by unanimous vote of those voting at a meeting duly called and held
(the "Company Board Approval"), has duly (i) determined that this Agreement and
the Merger are advisable and are fair to and in the best interests of the
Company and its stockholders, (ii) approved this Agreement and the Merger and
(iii) recommended that the stockholders of the Company adopt this Agreement and
approve the Merger and directed that this Agreement and the transactions

                                      -19-

contemplated hereby be submitted for consideration by the Company's stockholders
at the Company Stockholders Meeting.

      (g) Vote Required. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of
the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock to adopt this Agreement and
approve the Merger (the "Company Stockholder Approval") is the only vote of the
holders of any class or series of the Company capital stock necessary to adopt
this Agreement and approve the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby.

      (h) Litigation; Compliance with Laws.

            (i) Except as disclosed in the Company SEC Reports filed prior to
      the date of this Agreement, there are no Actions pending or, to the
      knowledge of the Company, threatened, against or affecting the Company or
      any Subsidiary of the Company which, individually or in the aggregate,
      would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
      Company, nor are there any judgments, decrees, injunctions, rules or
      orders of any Governmental Entity or arbitrator outstanding against the
      Company or any Subsidiary of the Company which, individually or in the
      aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
      on the Company.

            (ii) Except as disclosed in the Company SEC Reports filed prior to
      the date of the Agreement and except as would, individually or in the
      aggregate, not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
      the Company, (A) the Company and its Subsidiaries hold all permits,
      licenses, variances, exemptions, orders and approvals of all Governmental

Agreement and except as permitted by Section 4.02, since September 30, 2004, the

      (m) Opinions of the Company Financial Advisor. The Company has received
the opinions of Goldman, Sachs & Co. and UBS Warburg LLC, each dated the date of

      all such Tax Returns are true, complete and accurate, except to the extent

      not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on
      the Company. All Taxes shown to be due on such Tax Returns, or otherwise
      owed, have been timely paid, except to the extent that any failure to pay,

      to any Taxes has been proposed, asserted or assessed against the Company
      or any of its Subsidiaries, and no requests for waivers of the time to
      assess any such Taxes are pending, except to the extent any such
      deficiency or request for waiver, individually or in the aggregate, has
      not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
      Effect on the Company.

      Subsidiaries consolidated in such Returns have been examined by and
      settled with the United States Internal Revenue Service for all years

      completed and settled examinations or any concluded litigation have been
      fully paid.

      Section 355 applied.

      (o) Certain Contracts. As of the date hereof, except as set forth in the

      been operated and administered in compliance with its terms and applicable
      law.

            (iii) The execution of this Agreement and the consummation of the
      Merger will not constitute an event under any Benefit Plan maintained by
      the Company that will or may result in any payment, acceleration,
      termination, forgiveness of indebtedness, vesting, distribution, increase

                              ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

      Section 5.01 Preparation of Proxy Statement; Stockholders Meetings.

      (a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date hereof,
Parent and the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC mutually acceptable
proxy materials which shall constitute the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus
(such proxy statement/prospectus, and any amendments or supplements thereto, the
"Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus") and Parent shall prepare and file a
registration statement on Form S-4 with respect to the issuance of Parent Common
Stock in the Merger (the "Form S-4"). The Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus will
be included in and will constitute a part of the Form S-4 as Parent's
prospectus. The Form S-4 and

                                      -31-
<PAGE>

the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall comply as to form in all material
respects with the applicable provisions of the Securities Act and the Exchange
Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. Each of Parent and the Company
shall use reasonable best efforts to have the Form S-4 declared effective by the
SEC and to keep the Form S-4 effective as long as is necessary to consummate the
Merger and the transactions contemplated thereby. Parent and the Company shall,
as promptly as practicable after receipt thereof, provide the other party copies
of any written comments and advise the other party of any oral comments, with
respect to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus received from the SEC. Parent
shall provide the Company with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
any amendment or supplement to the Form S-4 and any communications (other than
any communications filed pursuant to Rule 425 of the Securities Act) prior to
filing such with the SEC, and will provide the Company with a copy of all such
filings and communications made with the SEC. Notwithstanding any other
provision herein to the contrary, no amendment or supplement (including by
incorporation by reference) to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Form
S-4 shall be made without the approval of both parties, which approval shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided that, with respect to documents
filed by a party which are incorporated by reference in the Form S-4 or Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus, this right of approval shall apply only with respect
to information relating to the other party or its business, financial condition
or results of operations; and provided, further, that Parent, in connection with
a Change in the Parent Recommendation (as defined in Section 5.01(c)), and the
Company, in connection with a Change in the Company Recommendation (as defined
in Section 5.01(b)), may amend or supplement the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or Form S-4 (including by incorporation by reference)
pursuant to a Qualifying Amendment (as defined below) to effect such a Change in
the Company Recommendation or a Change in the Parent Recommendation (as the case
may be), and in such event, this right of approval shall apply only with respect
to information relating to the other party or its business, financial condition
or results of operations, and shall be subject to the right of the Company or
Parent (as the case may be) to have its Board of Directors' deliberations and
conclusions to be accurately described. A "Qualifying Amendment" means an
amendment or supplement to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or Form S-4
(including by incorporation by reference) to the extent it contains (i) a Change
in the Parent Recommendation or a Change in the Company Recommendation (as the
case may be), (ii) a statement of the reasons of the Board of Directors of
Parent or the Company (as the case may be) for making such Change the Parent
Recommendation or Change in the Company Recommendation (as the case may be) and
(iii) additional information reasonably related to the foregoing. Parent will
use reasonable best efforts to cause the Joint Proxy Statements/Prospectus to be
mailed to Parent's stockholders, and the Company will use reasonable best
efforts to cause the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to the
Company's stockholders, in each case after the Form S-4 is declared effective
under the Securities Act. Parent shall also take any action (other than
qualifying to do business in any jurisdiction in which it is not now so
qualified or to file a general consent to service of process) required to be
taken under any applicable state securities laws in connection with the Share
Issuance and the Company shall furnish all information concerning the Company
and the holders of Company Common Stock as may be reasonably requested in
connection with any such action. Each party will advise the other party,
promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time when the Form S-4 has
become effective, the issuance of any stop order, the suspension of the
qualification of the Parent Common Stock issuable in connection with the Merger
for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC for
amendment of the Joint Proxy

                                      -32-
<PAGE>

Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4. If at any time prior to the Effective Time
any information relating to Parent or the Company, or any of their respective
affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by Parent or the Company
which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to any of the Form S-4
or the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus so that any of such documents would not
include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such information
shall promptly notify the other party hereto and, to the extent required by law,
rules or regulations, an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such
information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and disseminated to the
stockholders of Parent and the Company.

      (b) The Company shall duly take all lawful and commercially reasonable
action to call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders
on a date as soon as reasonably practicable (the "Company Stockholders Meeting")
for the purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval with respect to
the adoption of this Agreement and shall take all lawful and commercially
reasonable action to solicit the adoption of this Agreement by the Company
Stockholder Approval; and the Board of Directors of the Company shall recommend
adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company to the effect as
set forth in Section 3.02(f) (the "Company Recommendation"), and shall not
withdraw, modify or qualify (a "Change") in any manner adverse to Parent such
recommendation (collectively, a "Change in the Company Recommendation");
provided the foregoing shall not prohibit accurate disclosure (and such
disclosure shall not be deemed to be a Change in the Company Recommendation) of
factual information regarding the business, financial condition or results of
operations of Parent or the Company or the fact that an Acquisition Proposal has
been made, the identity of the party making such proposal or the material terms
of such proposal (provided that the Board of Directors of the Company does not
withdraw, modify or qualify in any manner adverse to Parent its recommendation)
in the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or otherwise, to the
extent such factual information is required to be disclosed under applicable
law; and, provided further, that the Board of Directors of the Company may make
a Change in the Company Recommendation prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting
(x) following receipt of any Acquisition Proposal with respect to which the
Board of Directors of the Company believes in good faith, after consultation
with its independent financial advisor, there is a reasonable likelihood that
such Acquisition Proposal could result in a Superior Proposal or (y) if a
Material Adverse Effect has occurred with respect to Parent, and, in the case of
either (x) or (y), the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good
faith that the failure to effect such Change in the Company Recommendation could
be reasonably expected to result in a breach of the fiduciary duties of the
Company Board of Directors under applicable law. Notwithstanding any Change in
the Company Recommendation, this Agreement shall be submitted to the
stockholders of the Company at the Company Stockholders Meeting for the purpose
of adopting the Agreement and approving the Merger; provided that this Agreement
shall not be required to be submitted to the stockholders of the Company at the
Company Stockholders Meeting if this Agreement has been terminated pursuant to
Section 7.01 hereof.

      (c) Parent shall duly take all lawful and commercially reasonable action
to call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders on a
date as soon as reasonably practicable (the "Parent Stockholders Meeting") for
the purpose of obtaining the Parent Stockholder Approval and shall take all
lawful and commercially reasonable action to solicit the

                                      -33-
<PAGE>

approval of this Agreement and the Share Issuance and the Board of Directors of
Parent shall recommend approval of this Agreement and the Share Issuance by the
stockholders of Parent to the effect as set forth in Section 3.01(f) (the
"Parent Recommendation"), and shall not Change in any manner adverse to the
Company such recommendation (collectively, a "Change in the Parent
Recommendation"); provided the foregoing shall not prohibit accurate disclosure
(and such disclosure shall not be deemed to be a Change in the Parent
Recommendation) of factual information regarding the business, financial
condition or operations of Parent or the Company (provided that the Board of
Directors of Parent does not withdraw, modify or qualify in any manner adverse
to the Company its recommendation) in the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or otherwise, to the extent such factual information, is
required to be disclosed under applicable law; and provided further, that the
Board of Directors of Parent may make a Change in the Parent Recommendation
prior to Parent Stockholders Meeting if a Material Adverse Effect has occurred
with respect to the Company. Notwithstanding any Change in the Parent
Recommendation, a proposal to approve this Agreement and the Share Issuance
shall be submitted to the stockholders of Parent at the Parent Stockholders
Meeting for the purpose of obtaining the Parent Stockholder Approval; provided
that this Agreement shall not be required to be submitted to the stockholders of
Parent at the Parent Stockholders Meeting if this Agreement has been terminated
pursuant to Section 7.01 hereof.

      (d) For purposes of this Agreement, a Change in the Company Recommendation
shall be deemed to include, without limitation, a recommendation by the Company
Board of Directors of a third party Acquisition Proposal with respect to the
Company.

      (e) Parent and the Company shall cause the Company Stockholders Meeting
and the Parent Stockholders Meeting to be held on the same day.

      Section 5.02 Access to Information/Employees.

      (a) Upon reasonable notice, each party shall (and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to) afford to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel,
financial advisors and other representatives of the other party reasonable
access during normal business hours, during the period prior to the Effective
Time, to all its properties, books, contracts, commitments, records, business
plans, systems, officers and employees (provided that the Company's access to
the employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries shall be limited to confirming the
accuracy of Parent's and Merger Sub's representations and warranties contained
in this Agreement) and, during such period, such party shall (and shall cause
its Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to the other party (a) a copy of each
report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed, published,
announced or received by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of
Federal or state securities laws, as applicable (other than documents which such
party is not permitted to disclose under applicable law), and (b) all other
information concerning it and its business, properties and personnel as such
other party may reasonably request (including consultation on a regular basis
with such parties, agents, advisors, attorneys and representatives with respect
to litigation matters); provided, however, that either party may restrict the
foregoing access to the extent that (a) any law, treaty, rule or regulation of
any Governmental Entity applicable to such party requires such party or its
Subsidiaries to restrict or prohibit access to any such properties or
information or (b) the information is subject to confidentiality obligations to
a third party (provided that Parent or the Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts, as the case

                                      -34-
<PAGE>

may be, to obtain the consent of such third party to disclose such information).
Information obtained pursuant to this Section 5.02 shall be subject to the
provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement (as amended or supplemented from
time to time in accordance with the terms thereof), the terms of which are
incorporated herein by reference.

      (b) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to facilitate
Parent's efforts in connection with its transition and integration planning.

      (c) After the date hereof Parent and the Company shall establish a
mechanism reasonably acceptable to both parties by which Parent will be
permitted, prior to the Effective Time and subject to applicable law, to
communicate directly with the Company employees regarding employee related
matters after the Effective Time.

      Section 5.03 Commercially Reasonable Efforts.

      (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each party will
use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under this Agreement and applicable laws and regulations to consummate
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement as soon as
practicable after the date hereof, including (i) preparing and filing as
promptly as practicable all documentation to effect all necessary applications,
notices, petitions, filings, tax ruling requests and other documents and to
obtain as promptly as practicable all consents, waivers, licenses, orders,
registrations, approvals, permits, tax rulings and authorizations necessary or
advisable to be obtained from any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in
order to consummate the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and (ii) taking all reasonable steps as may be necessary to
obtain all such material consents, waivers, licenses, registrations, permits,
authorizations, tax rulings, orders and approvals. In furtherance and not in
limitation of the foregoing, each party hereto agrees to make an appropriate
filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act and any other
Regulatory Law (as defined in Section 5.03(b) below) with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable after the date
hereof and to supply as promptly as practicable any additional information and
documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act and any other
Regulatory Law and to take all other actions necessary to cause the expiration
or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act as soon as
practicable. If necessary to obtain any regulatory approval pursuant to any
Regulatory Law, or if any administrative or judicial action or proceeding,
including any proceeding by a private party, is instituted (or threatened to be
instituted by a Governmental Entity), challenging the Merger or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any Regulatory Law,
each of Parent and the Company shall cooperate with each other and, if necessary
to (I) obtain any regulatory approval, (II) contest, resist or resolve any such
action or proceeding, or (III) have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any
decree, judgment, injunction, or other order (whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent): (x) Parent shall take any and all actions with respect to its assets
or the assets of any of its Subsidiaries (including selling, holding separate,
licensing or otherwise disposing of such assets, or agreeing to, or permitting,
any of the foregoing with respect to such assets); and (y) Parent shall direct
the Company, and the Company at the direction of the Parent shall take any and
all actions with respect to its assets or the assets of any of its Subsidiaries
(including selling, holding separate,

                                      -35-
<PAGE>

licensing or otherwise disposing of such assets, or agreeing to, or permitting
any of the foregoing with respect to such assets); provided, however, that
neither Parent nor the Company shall be required to take any of the actions
pursuant to clauses (x) and (y) to the extent that the assets to be sold, held
separate, licensed or otherwise disposed of generated, in calendar year 2004
(based on the internal financial records of the Company or Parent, as the case
may be) more than $1.9 billion in net sales (each of the actions set forth in
clauses (x) or (y) (subject to the foregoing proviso) being referred to as
"Specified Efforts").

      (b) Each of Parent and the Company shall, in connection with the efforts
referenced in Section 5.03(a) obtain all requisite material approvals and
authorizations for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the HSR
Act or any other Regulatory Law, use its commercially reasonable efforts to (i)
cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or
submission and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry, including
any proceeding initiated by a private party, (ii) promptly inform the other
party of any communication received by such party from, or given by such party
to, the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the "DOJ"), the Federal
Trade Commission (the "FTC") or any other Governmental Entity and of any
material communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by a
private party, in each case regarding any of the transactions contemplated
hereby, and (iii) permit the other party to review any communication given by it
to, and consult with each other in advance of any meeting or conference with,
the DOJ, the FTC or any such other Governmental Entity or, in connection with
any proceeding by a private party, with any other Person. For purposes of this
Agreement, "Regulatory Law" means the Sherman Act, as amended, Council
Regulation No. 139/2004 of the European Community, as amended (the "EC Merger
Regulation"), the Clayton Act, as amended, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade
Commission Act, as amended, and all other Federal, state and foreign, if any,
statutes, rules, regulations, orders, decrees, administrative and judicial
doctrines and other laws that are designed or intended to prohibit, restrict or
regulate (i) foreign investment or (ii) actions having the purpose or effect of
monopolization or restraint of trade or lessening of competition.

      (c) If any objections are asserted with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby under any Regulatory Law or if any suit is instituted by any
Governmental Entity or any private party challenging any of the transactions
contemplated hereby as violative of any Regulatory Law, each of Parent and the
Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to resolve any such
objections or challenge as such Governmental Entity or private party may have to
such transactions under such Regulatory Law so as to permit consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, it is
agreed that for purposes of this Agreement "Specified Efforts" constitute
"commercially reasonable efforts."

      Section 5.04 Acquisition Proposals. The Company agrees that neither it nor
any of its Subsidiaries nor any of the officers and directors of it or its
Subsidiaries shall, and that it shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
cause its and its Subsidiaries' employees, agents and representatives (including
any investment banker, attorney or accountant retained by it or any of its
Subsidiaries) not to, directly or indirectly, initiate, solicit, encourage or
knowingly facilitate (including by way of furnishing information) any inquiries
or the making of any proposal or offer with respect to a merger, reorganization,
share exchange, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization,
liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving it, or any purchase or
sale of the consolidated assets (including without limitation stock of
Subsidiaries) of

                                      -36-
<PAGE>

the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, having an aggregate value
equal to 10% or more of the market capitalization of the Company, or any
purchase or sale of, or tender or exchange offer for, 10% or more of the equity
securities of the Company (any such proposal or offer (other than a proposal or
offer made by the other party or an affiliate thereof or any proposal or offer
made in conjunction with Specified Efforts) being hereinafter referred to as an
"Acquisition Proposal"). The Company further agrees that neither it nor any of
its Subsidiaries nor any of the officers and directors of it or its Subsidiaries
shall, and that it shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its
and its Subsidiaries' employees, agents and representatives (including any
investment banker, attorney or accountant retained by it or any of its
Subsidiaries) not to, directly or indirectly, have any discussion with or
provide any confidential information or data to any Person relating to an
Acquisition Proposal, or engage in any negotiations concerning an Acquisition
Proposal, or knowingly facilitate any effort or attempt to make or implement an
Acquisition Proposal or accept an Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company or the Company's Board of
Directors shall be permitted to (A) to the extent applicable, comply with Rule
14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act with regard to an
Acquisition Proposal, (B) effect a Change in the Company Recommendation in
accordance with Section 5.01(b), or (C) engage in any discussions or
negotiations with, or provide any information to, any Person in response to an
unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal by any such Person, if and
only to the extent that, in any such case as is referred to in clause (C), (i)
the Company's Stockholders Meeting shall not have occurred, (ii) the Company's
Board of Directors concludes in good faith (I) after consultation with its
independent financial advisor, that there is a reasonable likelihood that such
Acquisition Proposal could result in a Superior Proposal, and (II) after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action
could be reasonably expected to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under
applicable law, (iii) prior to providing any information or data to any Person
in connection with an Acquisition Proposal by any such Person, the Company's
Board of Directors receives from such Person an executed confidentiality
agreement customary for a transaction of this type (provided that such agreement
shall not be required to contain standstill provisions), and (iv) prior to
providing any information or data to any Person or entering into discussions or
negotiations with any Person, the Company notifies Parent promptly of such
inquiries, proposals or offers received by, any such information requested from,
or any such discussions or negotiations sought to be initiated or continued
with, any of its representatives indicating, in connection with such notice, the
name of such Person and the material terms and conditions of any inquiries,
proposals or offers. The Company agrees that it will promptly keep Parent
informed of the status and terms of any such proposals or offers and the status
and terms of any such discussions or negotiations. The Company agrees that it
will, and will cause its officers, directors and representatives to, immediately
cease and cause to be terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations
existing as of the date of this Agreement with any parties conducted heretofore
with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. The Company agrees that it will use
commercially reasonable efforts to promptly inform its directors, officers, key
employees, agents and representatives of the obligations undertaken in this
Section 5.04. Nothing in this Section 5.04 shall (x) permit Parent or the
Company to terminate this Agreement (except as specifically provided in Article
7 hereof) or (y) affect any other obligation of Parent or the Company under this
Agreement.

      Section 5.05 Fees And Expenses. Subject to Section 7.02, whether or not
the Merger is consummated, all Expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions

                                      -37-
<PAGE>

contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such Expenses, except
(a) if the Merger is consummated, the Surviving Corporation or its relevant
Subsidiary shall pay, or cause to be paid, any and all property or transfer
taxes imposed on the Company or its Subsidiaries, (b) Expenses incurred in
connection with the filing, printing and mailing of the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, which shall be paid 50% by Parent and 50% by the Company,
and (c) filing fees payable pursuant to the HSR Act, regulatory laws and other
filing fees incurred in connection with this Agreement, which shall be paid 50%
by Parent and 50% by the Company. As used in this Agreement, "Expenses" includes
all out-of-pocket expenses (including, without limitation, all fees and expenses
of counsel, accountants, investment bankers, experts and consultants to a party
hereto and its affiliates) incurred by a party or on its behalf in connection
with or related to the authorization, preparation, negotiation, execution and
performance of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the preparation, printing, filing and mailing of the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus and the solicitation of stockholder approvals and all other
matters related to the transactions contemplated hereby.

      Section 5.06 Directors' And Officers' Indemnification And Insurance. The
Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, (a) indemnify and hold harmless, and provide advancement of expenses to, all
past and present directors, officers and employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (in all of their capacities) (i) to the same extent such persons
are indemnified or have the right to advancement of expenses as of the date of
this Agreement by the Company pursuant to the Company's (or such Subsidiary's)
certificate of incorporation, bylaws and indemnification agreements, if any, in
existence on the date hereof with any directors, officers and employees of the
Company and its Subsidiaries and (ii) without limitation to clause (i), to the
fullest extent permitted by law, in each case for acts or omissions occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time (including for acts or omissions occurring in
connection with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby), (b) include and cause to be maintained in
effect in the Surviving Corporation's (or any successor's) certificate of
incorporation and bylaws, the current provisions regarding elimination of
liability of directors, indemnification of officers, directors and employees and
advancement of expenses contained in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws
of the Company and (c) cause to be maintained for a period of six years after
the Effective Time the current policies of directors' and officers' liability
insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the Company (provided
that the Surviving Corporation (or any successor) may substitute therefor
policies of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and
conditions which are, in the aggregate, no less advantageous to the insured)
with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before
the Effective Time; provided, however, that in no event shall Parent be required
to pay aggregate annual premiums for insurance under this Section 5.06 in excess
of 250% of the annual premiums paid by the Company as of the date hereof (the
"Current Premium") and if such premiums for such insurance at any time exceed
250% of the Current Premium, then Parent shall cause to be maintained policies
of insurance that provide the maximum coverage available at an annual premium
equal to 250% of the Current Premium. The obligations of the Surviving
Corporation under this Section 5.06 shall not be terminated or modified in such
a manner as to adversely affect any indemnitee to whom this Section 5.06 applies
without the consent of such affected indemnitee (it being expressly agreed that
the indemnitees to whom this Section 5.06 applies shall be third party
beneficiaries of this Section 5.06).

      Section 5.07 Public Announcements. Parent and the Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to develop a joint communications plan and each
party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that all press
releases and other public statements with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be consistent with such joint communications plan.
Unless otherwise required by applicable law or by obligations pursuant to any
listing agreement with or rules of any securities exchange, (x) prior to the
issuance by the Company of any press release or other public statement or
disclosure concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby,
the Company shall obtain the consent of Parent, and (y) prior to the issuance by
Parent of any press release or other public statement or disclosure concerning
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, Parent shall obtain the
consent of the Company. In addition to the foregoing, except to the extent
disclosed in or consistent with the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus in
accordance with the provisions of Section 5.01, neither Parent nor the Company
shall issue any press release or otherwise make any public statement or
disclosure concerning the other party or the other party's business, financial
condition or results of operations without the consent of the other party, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

      Section 5.08 Accountant's Letters.

      (a) Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be
delivered to the Company two letters from Parent's independent public
accountants, one dated approximately the date on which the Form S-4 shall become

Company, in form reasonably satisfactory to the Company and customary in scope
for comfort letters delivered by independent public accountants in connection
with registration statements similar to the Form S-4.

      (b) The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be
delivered to Parent two letters from the Company's independent public
accountants, one dated approximately the date on which the Form S-4 shall become

its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the shares of Parent Common Stock
to be issued in the Merger and the shares of Parent Common Stock to be reserved
for issuance upon exercise of the Company Stock Options to be approved for
listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the
Closing Date.

      Section 5.10 Dividends.

      (a) After the date of this Agreement, each of Parent and the Company shall
coordinate with the other the payment of dividends with respect to the Parent
Common Stock and Company Common Stock and the record dates and payment dates
relating thereto, it being the intention of the parties that holders of Parent
Common Stock and Company Common Stock shall not receive two dividends, or fail
to receive one dividend, for any single calendar quarter with respect to their
shares of Parent Common Stock and/or Company Common Stock or any

                                      -39-
<PAGE>

shares of Parent Common Stock that any such holder receives in exchange for such
shares of Company Common Stock in the Merger.

      (b) (i) After the date of this Agreement, the Company and Parent shall use
their best efforts to develop and agree on a plan for cash payments, prior to
the earlier of (a) the Closing and (b) December 31, 2005, by the foreign
Subsidiaries of the Company to the Company or its U.S. Subsidiaries that (x)
constitute dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes and (y) are intended
to qualify for the temporary dividends received deduction under Section
965(a)(1) of the Code (each such dividend, a "Section 965 Dividend"). The
parties agree that such plan shall maximize, to the extent commercially
practicable, the amount of Section 965 Dividends. In the event that the Company
and Parent reach agreement on all or any aspects of such a plan (an "Agreed
Plan"), the Company shall timely take all actions reasonably necessary to
implement such Agreed Plan, including but not limited to the payment of all
Section 965 Dividends contemplated by the Agreed Plan, making any necessary
election on any Tax Return and obtaining approval of a plan providing for the
reinvestment of each Section 965 Dividend in the United States for a permitted
purpose.

agreement on all or any aspects of such a plan, Parent shall provide to the
Company in writing a proposed plan for the payment of Section 965 Dividends that
are not part of an Agreed Plan (the "Parent Proposed Plan"). Upon the written
request of Parent, the Company shall (a) prior to the satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in Sections 6.01(a) and 6.02(g) (the "Specified
Conditions"), use its best efforts to take all preparatory actions or steps
contemplated by the Parent Proposed Plan other than such actions or steps that
the Company reasonably believes would impose material costs on or other material
detriment to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that the Company and its
Subsidiaries would not otherwise incur in connection with the payment of Section
965 Dividends, and (b) if the Specified Conditions are satisfied on or before
December 15, 2005, use its best efforts to take the remaining actions or steps
contemplated by the Parent Proposed Plan, including the payment of all Section
965 Dividends contemplated by the Parent Proposed Plan, as promptly as possible
after the satisfaction of such conditions, and timely take all actions
reasonably necessary to qualify such Section 965 Dividends for the temporary
dividends received deduction under Section 965(a)(1) of the Code, including but
not limited to making any necessary election on any Tax Return and obtaining
approval of a plan providing for the reinvestment of each Section 965 Dividend
in the United States for a permitted purpose.

      (iii) The Company shall not cause or permit any of its foreign
Subsidiaries to pay any Section 965 Dividend that is not part of an Agreed Plan,
provided that, if the Specified Conditions have not been satisfied on or before
December 15, 2005, with the written consent of Parent (not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), the Company shall be permitted to cause or permit one or
more of its foreign Subsidiaries to pay a Section 965 Dividend that is not part
of an Agreed Plan, and shall timely take all actions reasonably necessary to
qualify such Section 965 Dividends for the temporary dividends received
deduction under Section 965(a)(1) of the Code, including but not limited to
making any necessary election on any Tax Return and obtaining approval of a plan
providing for the reinvestment of each Section 965 Dividend in the United States

Time, the Company shall deliver to Parent a letter identifying all persons who,

submitted for adoption by the stockholders of the Company, "affiliates" of the
Company for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act and applicable SEC
rules and regulations, and such list shall be updated as necessary to reflect
changes from the date thereof. The Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause each person identified on such list to deliver to Parent not
less than 30 days prior to the Effective Time, a written agreement substantially
in the form attached as Exhibit 5.11 hereto (an "Affiliate Agreement").

      Section 5.12 Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, each of
Parent and the Company shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any
dispositions of Company Common Stock (including derivative securities with
respect to Company Common Stock) or acquisitions of Parent Common Stock
(including derivative securities with respect to Parent Common Stock) resulting
from the transactions contemplated by Article 1 or Article 2 of this Agreement
by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a)
of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act, such steps to be taken in accordance with
the No-Action Letter dated January 12, 1999, issued by the SEC to Skadden, Arps,
Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP.

      Section 5.13 Tax Treatment. Parent and the Company intend the Merger to
qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code. Each of Parent and
the Company, and each of their respective affiliates shall use their best
efforts to cause the Merger to so qualify and to obtain the opinions of
Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP and Davis Polk & Wardwell referred to in
Sections 6.02(c) and 6.03(c) of this Agreement. For purposes of the Tax opinions
described in Sections 6.02(c) and 6.03(c) of this Agreement, each of Parent and
the Company shall use their best efforts to provide representation letters
substantially in the form of Exhibits 6.02(c)(2) and 6.02(c)(3) hereto, each
dated on or about the date the Form S-4 shall become effective, and
subsequently, on the Closing Date. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
and each of their respective affiliates shall use their best efforts not to take
any action, shall not fail to take any action, cause any action to be taken or
not taken, or suffer to exist any condition, which action or failure to take
action or condition would prevent, or would be reasonably likely to prevent, the
Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)
of the Code.

      Section 5.14 Notification of Certain Matters. The Company shall give
prompt notice to Parent and Merger Sub, and Parent or Merger Sub, as the case
may be, shall give prompt notice to the Company, of the occurrence, or
non-occurrence, of any event the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of which is
likely to (a) to cause any representation or warranty of such party contained in
this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate if made as of any time at or prior to
the Effective Time and (b) to result in any failure of such party at Closing to
comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with
or satisfied hereunder; provided, however, that the delivery of any notice
pursuant to this Section 5.14 shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies
available hereunder to any of the parties sending or receiving such notice.

      Section 5.15 Employee Matters. (a) Parent shall and shall cause its
Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation) to:

                                      -41-
<PAGE>

               (i) assume and honor the terms of all Benefit Plans of the
      Company and its Subsidiaries set forth on Section 3.02(p) of the Company
      Disclosure Schedule and to pay or provide, or cause its Subsidiaries to
      pay or provide, the benefits required thereunder, recognizing that the
      consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will constitute a
      "change in control" for purposes of such Benefit Plans that include a
      provision for modifications to benefits in the event of a "change in
      control";

               (ii) until the second anniversary of the Effective Time (the
      "Benefits Maintenance Period"), with respect to employees of the Company
      and the Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time ("Company Employees") (other
      than those subject to collective bargaining obligations or agreements),
      provide a level of aggregate employee benefits and compensation (excluding
      equity-based awards), taking into account all such Company Benefit Plans
      and other programs sponsored or maintained by the Company and its
      Subsidiaries (other than equity-based plans) that is substantially
      comparable in the aggregate to the aggregate employee benefits and
      compensation provided, with respect to service to the Company or any of
      its Subsidiaries, to Company Employees immediately prior to the Effective
      Time; and

               (iii) following the Benefit Maintenance Period, Parent shall make
      no alteration or modification of any retiree welfare benefit covering any
      retired Company Employees or any Company Employee who, immediately prior
      to the Effective Time, is entitled to retiree welfare benefits and who
      retires during the Benefit Maintenance Period which would result in such
      individual (or such individual's eligible dependents) receiving retiree
      welfare benefits that are less favorable in the aggregate than those
      provided to such persons immediately prior to the Effective Time or upon
      retirement during the Benefits Maintenance Period (as applicable);
      provided that Parent may reduce or terminate the foregoing benefits to the
      extent Parent reduces or terminates retiree welfare benefits for similarly
      situated employees of Parent.

      (b) If Company Employees are included in any Benefit Plan, sponsored or
maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries following the Effective Time,
the Company Employees shall receive credit for service with the Company and its
Subsidiaries and their predecessors prior to the Effective Time to the same
extent and for the same purposes thereunder as such service was counted under
similar Benefit Plans set forth on Section 3.02(p) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule for all purposes (except that, with respect to benefit accrual, such
service shall not be counted to the extent that it would result in a duplication
of benefits and shall not be counted for purposes of benefit accrual under any
defined benefit plan); provided, however, that service of Company Employees
subject to collective bargaining agreements or obligations shall be determined
under such collective bargaining agreements or obligations. If Company Employees
or their dependents are included in any medical, dental or health plan (a
"Successor Plan") other than the plan or plans in which they participated
immediately prior to the Effective Time (a "Prior Plan"), any such Successor
Plan shall not include any restrictions or limitations with respect to
pre-existing condition exclusions or any actively-at-work requirements (except
to the extent such exclusions were applicable under any similar Prior Plan at
the Effective Time) and any eligible expenses incurred by any Company Employee
and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of such
Prior Plan ending on the date such employee's participation in such Successor
Plan begins shall be taken into account under such Successor

                                      -42-
<PAGE>

Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum
out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Company Employee and his or her
covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid
in accordance with such Successor Plan. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, for purposes of determining severance pay and benefits under any
applicable Severance Plan covering a Company Employee at or after the Effective
Time, each Company Employee shall receive credit for service prior to the
Effective Time with the Company and its Subsidiaries and their predecessors to
the same extent and for the same purposes as such service was counted under the
applicable Company Severance Plans as in effect before the Effective Time, as
well as for service from and after the Effective Time with Parent and any of its
Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation).

      (c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall determine which Benefit
Plans may be subject to the excise tax and penalties of Section 409A of the Code
and shall take such reasonable measures as may be necessary with respect to such
Benefit Plans to avoid the imposition of such tax and penalties; provided,
however, that to the extent any such change would accelerate the payment of any
amounts, or would, individually or in the aggregate, materially increase the
cost to, or liability of, the Company under any Benefit Plan(s), the Company
shall only take such actions with the consent of Parent (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld).

      Section 5.16 Director Resignations. On the Closing Date, the Company shall
cause to be delivered to Parent duly executed resignations, effective as of the
Effective Time, of each member of the Board of Directors of the Company and
shall take such other action as is necessary to accomplish the foregoing.

      Section 5.17 Dissenters' Rights. Parent shall give the Company prompt
notice of any demands received by Parent for the fair cash value of Parent
Common Stock. Parent shall (i) not, without the prior written consent of the
Company, waive any requirement under or compliance with the laws of the State of
Ohio applicable to any stockholder of Parent demanding the fair cash value of
shares of Parent Common Stock (a "Dissenting Stockholder") and (ii) require each
Dissenting Stockholder holding shares of Parent Common Stock in certificated
form to deliver such shares to Parent, and Parent shall endorse on such shares a
legend to the effect that a demand for the fair cash value of such shares has
been made.

of such party's shares) in the aggregate cease to own at least 50% of the voting
securities of the entity surviving or resulting from such transaction (or the
ultimate parent entity thereof) or, regardless of the percentage of voting
securities held by such stockholders, if any Person shall beneficially own,

parent entity, or (B) the individuals comprising the Board of Directors of the

and constitute liquidated damages and not a penalty. Acceptance by Parent of the
payment referred to in Section 7.02(b) shall constitute conclusive evidence that
this Agreement has been validly terminated and upon acceptance of the payment of
such amount, the Company shall be fully released and discharged from any
liability or obligation resulting from or under this Agreement.

      Section 7.03 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by the parties, by
action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, at any time
before or after approval of the matters presented in connection with the Merger
by the stockholders of the Company and Parent, but, after any such approval, no
amendment shall be made which by law or in accordance with the rules of any
relevant stock exchange requires further approval by such stockholders without
such further approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument
in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties.

      Section 7.04 Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
the parties, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of
Directors, may, to the extent legally allowed, (i) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties, (ii)
waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or
in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (iii) waive compliance with any of
the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a
party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in
a written instrument signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any party to
this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise
shall not constitute a waiver of those rights.

                                    ARTICLE 8
                               GENERAL PROVISIONS

covenants and other agreements, shall survive the Effective Time, except for
those covenants and agreements contained herein and therein (including Section
5.06) that by their terms apply or are to be performed in whole or in part after
the Effective Time and this Article 8.

      Section 8.04 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of
the parties and delivered to the other party, it being understood that both
parties need not sign the same counterpart.

      Section 8.05 Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries.

      (a) This Agreement (including the Exhibits and Schedules hereto) and the
Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all
prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof.

      (b) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit
of each party hereto, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is
intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any right, benefit or remedy
of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement, other than
Section 5.06 (which is intended to be for the benefit of the Persons covered
thereby and may be enforced by such Persons).

      Section 8.06 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed and construed
in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware (without giving effect to
choice of law principles thereof).

      Section 8.07 Severability. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any law or
public policy, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order
that the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated as originally
contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

      Section 8.08 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties, in
whole or in part (whether by operation of law or otherwise), without the prior
written consent of the other party, and any attempt to make any such assignment
without such consent shall be null and void, except that Merger Sub may assign,
in its sole discretion, any or all of its rights, interests and obligations
under this Agreement to any wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent without the
consent of the Company, but no such assignment shall relieve Merger Sub of any
of its obligations under this Agreement. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by
the parties and their respective successors and assigns. Parent agrees to cause
the Merger Sub to fulfill all of its obligations hereunder.

      Section 8.09 Submission To Jurisdiction; Waivers. Each of Parent and the
Company irrevocably agrees that any legal action or proceeding with respect to
this Agreement or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect
hereof brought by the other party hereto or its successors or assigns shall be
brought and determined exclusively in the Court of Chancery

                                      -51-
<PAGE>

of the State of Delaware, and each of Parent and the Company hereby irrevocably
submits with regard to any such action or proceeding for itself and in respect
to its property, generally and unconditionally, to the exclusive jurisdiction of
the aforesaid court. Each of Parent and the Company hereby irrevocably waives,
and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim or
otherwise, in any action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement, (a) any
claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above-named
court for any reason other than the failure to lawfully serve process, (b) that
it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or
from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of
notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of
judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise), and (c) to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, that (i) the suit, action or proceeding in any such
court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such suit, action
or proceeding is improper and (iii) this Agreement, or the subject matter
hereof, may not be enforced in or by such court. Process in any such suit,
action or proceeding may be served on any party anywhere in the world, whether
within or without the jurisdiction of the above-named court. Without limiting
the foregoing, each party agrees that service of process on such party as
provided in Section 8.02 shall be deemed effective service of process on such
party.

      Section 8.10 Enforcement. The parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms. It is accordingly agreed that
the parties shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity.

transaction (other than conditions that are in the aggregate as likely to result
in the consummation of such transaction as the aggregate of the conditions
contained in this Agreement) made by a third party in respect of a transaction
(or series of related transactions) that if consummated would result in such
third party (or in the case of a direct merger between such third party and the
Company or one of its Subsidiaries, the stockholders of such third party)
