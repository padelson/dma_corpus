merger (the "Certificate of Merger") with the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware, in such form as required by, and executed in accordance with, the

State of the State of Delaware or at such later time (or subsequent date and

Merger. The date and time at which the Merger becomes effective is referred to
in this Agreement as the "Effective Time."

duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and
duties of the Surviving Corporation.

  

  

Section 1.4 Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws.

  

  

(a) At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of the Company

terms and as provided by law.

  

  

(b) At the Effective Time, the bylaws of the Company shall be amended so that
they read in their entirety as set forth in Exhibit B annexed hereto, and, as
so amended, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter

the Surviving Corporation and as provided by law.

  

  

Section 1.5 Directors and Officers. The directors of Merger Sub immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the Surviving

ARTICLE II

  

EFFECTS OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS

  

  

Section 2.1 Conversion of Securities. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company
or the holders of any of the following securities:

  

  

(a) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the
"Company Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, other than any shares of Company Common Stock ("Shares")
described in Section 2.1(b) and any Dissenting Shares, shall be converted into
the right to receive $7.10 in cash (the "Merger Consideration") payable to the
holder thereof, without interest, in the manner provided in Section 2.3. All
Shares that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as provided in this Section 2.1 shall be automatically canceled
and shall cease to exist. If, between

  

  

 

 

2  

 

  

the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, there is any change in the
number of outstanding Shares as a result of a reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split, stock dividend, subdivision, combination or
exchange of shares with respect to, or rights issued in respect of, Shares,
the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted accordingly, without
duplication, to provide to the holders of Shares the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event;

  

  

(b) Each Share held in the treasury of the Company and each Share owned
directly or indirectly by Parent, Merger Sub, or any wholly-owned subsidiary
of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Shares held
on behalf of third parties) shall be canceled and shall cease to exist without
any conversion thereof and no payment or distribution shall be made with
respect thereto;

  

  

(c) Each share of common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Surviving Corporation; and

  

  

(d) Such Shares with respect to which appraisal shall have been properly
demanded in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL ("Dissenting Shares")
shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration at
or after the Effective Time unless and until the holder of such Shares
withdraws such holder's demand for appraisal (in accordance with Section
262(k) of the DGCL) or otherwise becomes ineligible for such appraisal, but
rather, the holder of the Dissenting Shares shall be entitled only to payment
of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with Section 262 of
the DGCL. If a holder of Dissenting Shares shall withdraw (in accordance with
Section 262(k) of the DGCL) the demand for such appraisal or otherwise shall
become ineligible for such appraisal, then, as of the Effective Time or the
occurrence of such event, whichever last occurs, each of such holder's
Dissenting Shares shall cease to be a Dissenting Share and shall be converted
into and represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration. At the
Effective Time, the Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of
Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
such rights provided in the preceding two sentences. The Company shall give
Parent prompt written notice of any demands received by the Company for
appraisal of Shares and Parent shall have the right to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall
not make any payments with respect to, or compromise or settle any demand for,
appraisal without the prior written consent of Parent.

  

  

Section 2.2 Stock Options, Restricted Shares and Warrants

  

  

(a) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each then-outstanding option to
purchase Shares (a "Company Stock Option") granted under any director or
employee stock option or compensation plan or arrangement of the Company
(collectively, the "Company Stock Plans") or otherwise, whether or not vested
or exercisable, shall become fully vested and exercisable contingent upon the
Effective Time, and shall be converted into the right to receive, and the
Company shall pay to each former holder of any such fully vested converted
Company Stock Option at or promptly after the Effective Time an amount in
cash, less any applicable tax

  

 

  

 

3  

  

withholding, equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of the Merger
Consideration over the applicable exercise price per Share of such Company
Stock Option and (ii) the number of Shares such holder could have purchased
had such holder exercised such Company Stock Option in full immediately prior
to the Effective Time. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Merger Consideration
is not greater than the applicable exercise price per Share of such Company
Stock Option, such Company Stock Option shall be cancelled and the holder of
such Company Stock Option shall not receive any cash payment in respect
thereof.

 

  

  

(b) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each then-outstanding restricted
Share granted under any Company Stock Plan (a "Company Restricted Share")
shall vest, contingent upon the Effective Time, in full (and all restrictions
thereon shall immediately lapse) and be converted at the Effective Time into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration, as provided in Section 2.1(a).

  

  

(c) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each then-outstanding option to
purchase Shares granted to KKR Capstone (formerly known as Capstone Consulting
LLC) (a "Capstone Option") whether or not vested or exercisable, shall become
fully vested and exercisable contingent upon the Effective Time, and shall be
converted into the right to receive, and the Company shall pay to each former
holder of any such fully vested converted Capstone Option at or promptly after
the Effective Time an amount in cash, less any applicable tax withholding,
equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration
over the applicable exercise price per Share of such Capstone Option and (ii)
the number of Shares such holder could have purchased had such holder
exercised such Capstone Option in full immediately prior to the Effective
Time. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Merger Consideration is not greater
than the applicable exercise price per Share of such Capstone Option, such
Capstone Option shall be cancelled and the holder of such Capstone Option
shall not receive any cash payment in respect thereof.

  

  

(d) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each then-outstanding warrant to
purchase Shares (a "Warrant") whether or not vested or exercisable, shall
become fully vested and exercisable contingent upon the Effective Time, and
shall be converted into the right to receive, and the Company shall pay to
each former holder of any such fully vested converted Warrant at or promptly
after the Effective Time an amount in cash, less any applicable tax
withholding, equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of the Merger
Consideration over the applicable exercise price per Share of such Warrant and
(ii) the number of Shares such holder could have purchased had such holder
exercised such Warrant in full immediately prior to the Effective Time. For
the avoidance of doubt, if the Merger Consideration is not greater than the
applicable exercise price per Share of such Warrant, such Warrant shall be
cancelled and the holder of such Warrant shall not receive any cash payment in
respect thereof.

  

  

(e) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Company Board and the
Compensation Committee of the Company Board, as applicable, shall adopt such
resolutions and take such actions as are necessary to effectuate the foregoing
provisions of this Section 2.2. Unless a later time for payment is expressly
provided in this Section 2.2 or is otherwise agreed to between Parent and an
individual holder, the Company shall pay the holders of Company Stock Options,
Company Restricted Shares, Capstone Options and Warrants the cash payments
described in this Section 2.2 promptly after the Effective Time, but in any
event not later than the

  

  

 

 

4  

  

second (2nd) Business Day after the Effective Time (with respect to the
Capstone Options and Warrants) or the first payroll date after the Effective
Time (with respect to Company Stock Options and Company Restricted Shares).

 

  

  

Section 2.3 Surrender of Shares

  

  

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall enter into an agreement (in a
form reasonably acceptable to the Company) with a paying agent reasonably
acceptable to the Company to act as agent for the stockholders of the Company
in connection with the Merger (the "Paying Agent") to receive the Merger
Consideration to which the stockholders of the Company shall become entitled
pursuant to Section 2.1. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit with the Paying Agent sufficient funds to make all payments pursuant
to Section 2.1. Such funds may be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by
Parent, provided that (i) no such investment or losses thereon shall affect
the Merger Consideration payable to the holders of Company Common Stock and
following any losses Parent shall promptly provide additional funds to the
Paying Agent for the benefit of the stockholders of the Company in the amount
of any such losses and (ii) such investments shall be in short term
obligations of the United States of America with maturities of no more than 30
days or guaranteed by the United States of America and backed by the full
faith and credit of the United States of America. Any interest or income
produced by such investments will be payable to the Surviving Corporation or
Parent, as Parent directs.

  

  

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time and in any event not later than the
second Business Day following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall cause to be mailed to each record holder, as of the Effective Time, of
an outstanding certificate or outstanding certificates ("Certificates") that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Shares, which
have converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration with respect
thereto pursuant to Section 2.1(a), a form of letter of transmittal (which
shall be in customary form and shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates held by such person shall pass,
only upon proper delivery of Certificates to the Paying Agent) and
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates. Upon
surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each Share formerly
represented by such Certificate and such Certificate shall then be canceled.
Promptly after the Effective Time and in any event not later than the second
Business Day following the Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall issue and
deliver to each holder of uncertificated Shares represented by book-entry
("Book-Entry Shares") a check or wire transfer for the amount of cash that
such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.1(a) of this
Agreement in respect of such Book-Entry Shares, without such holder being
required to deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the
Paying Agent, and such Book-Entry Shares shall then be canceled. No interest
shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares on the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. In the event of a transfer of ownership of
Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, it shall
be a condition of payment that such Certificate so surrendered shall be
properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer or such
Book-Entry Share shall be properly transferred and that the person requesting
such payment shall

  

 

  

 

5  

  

have paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment of
the Merger Consideration to a person other than the registered holder of the
Certificate or Book-Entry Share surrendered or shall have established to the
satisfaction of Parent that such Tax either has been paid or is not
applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.3(b), each
Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive upon such surrender the applicable Merger
Consideration as contemplated by this Article II.

  

 

  

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall cooperate to
establish procedures with the Paying Agent and the Depository Trust Company
("DTC") to ensure that (i) if the Closing occurs at or prior to 11:30 a.m.
(New York time) on the Closing Date, the Paying Agent will transmit to DTC or
its nominees on the Closing Date an amount in cash in immediately available
funds equal to the number of Shares held of record by DTC or such nominee
immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Merger Consideration
(such amount, the "DTC Payment"), and (ii) if the Closing occurs after 11:30
a.m. (New York time) on the Closing Date, the Paying Agent will transmit to
DTC or its nominees on the first Business Day after the Closing Date an amount
in cash in immediately available funds equal to the DTC Payment.

  

  

(d) At any time following the date that is six (6) months after the Effective
Time, Parent shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it
any funds (including any interest received with respect thereto) that have
been made available to the Paying Agent and that have not been disbursed to
holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares and thereafter such holders
shall be entitled to look to Parent and the Surviving Corporation (subject to
abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws) only as general creditors
thereof with respect to the Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender of
their Certificates and Book-Entry Shares. The Surviving Corporation shall pay
all charges and expenses, including those of the Paying Agent, in connection
with the exchange of Shares for the Merger Consideration. Notwithstanding any
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, none of the parties hereto, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any person for
Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar law. All cash paid upon the surrender
of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be
deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the
Shares formerly represented by such Certificates.

  

  

(e) After the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of
Shares that were outstanding prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for
transfer such Certificates shall be canceled and exchanged for the
consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth,
in this Article II.

  

  

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent, the
Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
any amount as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the
making of such payment under applicable Tax laws. To the extent that amounts
are so withheld by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been

  

  

 

 

6  

  

paid to the holder of Shares in respect of whom such deduction and withholding
was made by Parent or the Paying Agent.

  

 

  

(g) In the event that any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the holder's compliance with the replacement requirements
established by the Paying Agent, including, if necessary, the posting by the
holder of a bond in customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to the
Certificate, the Paying Agent will deliver in exchange for the lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration payable in respect
of the Shares represented by such Certificate pursuant to this Article II.

breach or violation of or constitute a default (or an event that with notice
or lapse of time or both would become a default) or result in the loss of a
benefit under, or give rise to any right of termination, cancellation,
amendment or acceleration of, or obligation or fee under, any note, bond,

creation of any lien on the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any of their
properties or assets, except, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), for any
such conflict, violation, breach, default, loss, right or other occurrence
that would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse
Effect.

  

  

(b) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company
and the consummation of the Merger by the Company do not and will not require
any consent, approval, authorization or permit of, action by, filing with or
notification to, any governmental or regulatory (including stock exchange)

sky" laws, (ii) the filing of a premerger notification and report form by the
Company under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as

or similar law of any jurisdiction ("Foreign Merger Control Laws"), (iii) the
applicable requirements of the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE"), (iv) the
filing with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware of the Certificate
of Merger as required by the DGCL and (v) any such consent, approval,
authorization, permit, action, filing or notification the failure of which to
make or obtain would not (A) prevent or materially delay the Company from
performing its obligations under this Agreement in any material respect or (B)
individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

Section 3.6 Compliance.

  

  

(a) Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries is, and since December 31,
2008 none have been, in violation of any law, rule, regulation, order,
judgment or decree applicable to the Company or any of its subsidiaries or by

(b) The Company and its subsidiaries have all permits, licenses,
authorizations, exemptions, orders, consents, approvals and franchises
("Licenses") from Governmental Entities required to conduct their respective
businesses as now being conducted or to own, lease or operate their

individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect. All Licenses
of the Company are in full force and effect and no cancellation or suspension
of any license is pending, except

  

  

 

 

10  

 

  

where the failure to be in full force and effect and the cancellation or the
suspension, would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect.

  

  

(c) This Section 3.6 does not relate to employee benefit matters, which are
the subject of Section 3.10, or Taxes, which are the subject of Section 3.14.

  

  

Section 3.7 SEC Filings; Financial Statements.

  

  

(a) The Company has filed or otherwise transmitted all forms, reports,
statements, certifications and other documents (together with all exhibits,

of the Shares in the Merger is fair, from a financial point of view, to such
holders (other than Shares held by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Co.), a signed
copy of which opinion has been or will be provided to Parent. Lazard Freres and
Co. LLC ("Lazard") has delivered to the members of the Company Board who are
not members of Company management or affiliated with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and
Co. (the "Independent Directors") its written opinion (or oral opinion to be
confirmed in writing), dated as of the date of this Agreement, to the effect
that, as of such date, the Merger Consideration to be paid in the Merger to
the holders of Shares entitled hereunder to payment thereof (other than
shareholders affiliated with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Co.) is fair, from a
financial point of view, to such holders, a signed copy of which opinion has
been or will be provided to Parent. It is agreed and understood that the
opinion delivered by Moelis is for the benefit of the Company's Board of
Directors and that the opinion delivered by Lazard is for the benefit of the
Independent Directors, in their capacity as such, and that neither such
opinion may be relied on by Parent or Merger Sub.

  

  

Section 3.22 Brokers. No broker, finder or investment banker (other than
Moelis and Lazard) is entitled to any brokerage, finder's or other fee or
commission in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement

subsidiaries. The Company has furnished to Parent a true and complete copy of
any Contract between the Company and Moelis and the Company and Lazard
relating to the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

Section 3.23 No Other Representations or Warranties. Except for the
representations and warranties contained in this Article III, each of Parent
and Merger Sub acknowledges that neither the Company nor any other person on
behalf of the Company makes any other express or implied representation or
warranty with respect to the Company or any of its subsidiaries with respect
to any other information provided to Parent or Merger Sub in connection with

Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by Parent and
Merger Sub and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery hereof by
the Company, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of each of

which Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective properties are bound,
except, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), for any such conflict,
violation, breach, default, acceleration, loss, right or other occurrence
which would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect.

  

  

(b) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by each of
Parent and Merger Sub and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby by each of Parent and Merger Sub do not and will not require any
consent, approval, authorization or permit of, action by, filing with or
notification to, any Governmental Entity, except for (i) the applicable
requirements, if any, of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, and state securities, takeover and "blue sky" laws,

no suits, claims, actions, proceedings, arbitrations, mediations or
investigations pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened against

neither Parent nor any of its subsidiaries nor any of their respective
properties is or are subject to any order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree
or award that would, individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect.

in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither
the Parent nor Merger Sub makes any representation or warranty with respect to
any information supplied by the Company or its subsidiaries or any of their

Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries shall be required to provide
access to or to disclose information where

indirectly, (A) initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage with any inquiries or
the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or could reasonably be
expected to constitute or result in, an Acquisition Proposal, (B) engage in,
continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding, or provide any non-public information or data concerning the
Company or its subsidiaries to any person relating to, any Acquisition
Proposal, (C) otherwise knowingly facilitate any effort or attempt to make an
Acquisition Proposal, or (D) enter into any letter of intent, agreement or
agreement in principle with respect to an Acquisition Proposal.

  

  

(b) Acquisition Proposals. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, at any time prior to, but not after, the Company Requisite Vote is
obtained, if the Company receives a written Acquisition Proposal, that did not
result from a breach of this Section 6.5, from any person the Company and its
Representatives may contact such person to clarify the terms and conditions
thereof and (i) the Company and its Representatives may provide non-public
information and data concerning the Company and its subsidiaries in response
to a request therefor by such person if the Company receives from such person
an executed confidentiality agreement on customary terms that are no more
favorable to the other party than the Confidentiality Agreement (it being
understood that such confidentiality agreement need not prohibit the making or
amendment of an Acquisition Proposal or otherwise contain any standstill or
similar provision); provided that the Company shall promptly (and in any event
within 24 hours) make available to Parent and Merger Sub any material non-
public information concerning the Company or its subsidiaries that the Company
made available to any person given such access which was not previously made
available to Parent or Merger Sub, and (ii) the Company and its
Representatives may engage or participate in any discussions or negotiations
with such person, if and only to the extent that, (x) prior to taking any
action described in clause (i) or (ii) above, the Company Board or any
committee thereof determines in good faith (after consultation

  

  

 

  

 

30  

  

with independent financial advisors and outside legal counsel) that failure to
take such action could be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties
under applicable law, and (y) in each such case referred to in clause (i) or
(ii) above, the Company Board or any committee thereof has determined in good
faith (after consultation with its independent financial advisors and outside
legal counsel) that such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior
Proposal or could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal.

 

  

  

(c) Definitions. For purposes of this Agreement:

  

  

(i) "Acquisition Proposal" means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any
person or group of persons other than Parent or one of its subsidiaries for
(A) a merger, reorganization, consolidation, share exchange, business
combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction
involving an acquisition of the Company (or any subsidiary or subsidiaries of
the Company whose business constitutes 20% or more of the net revenues, net
income or assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole) or (B)
the acquisition in any manner, directly or indirectly, of over 20% of the
equity securities or consolidated total assets of the Company and its
subsidiaries, in each case other than the Merger.

  

  

(ii) "Superior Proposal" means any bona fide written Acquisition Proposal
(with the percentages set forth in the definition of such term changed from
20% to 50%), that the Company Board has determined in its good faith judgment
after consultation with the Company's outside legal counsel and independent
financial advisors (A) is reasonably likely to be consummated in accordance
with its terms, taking into account all legal, financial and regulatory
aspects of the proposal and the person making the proposal, and (B) if
consummated, would result in a transaction more favorable to the Company's
stockholders (solely in their capacity as such) from a financial point of view
than the transaction contemplated by this Agreement (including any revisions
to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in response to such proposal
or otherwise).

  

  

(d) No Change in Recommendation or Alternative Acquisition Agreement. Except
as set forth in this Section 6.5(d), Section 6.5(e) or Section 8.3(a), the
Company Board and each committee thereof shall not:

  

  

(i) withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify, or publicly propose to withdraw,
qualify or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the Company
Recommendation (it being understood that the Company Board may take no
position with respect to an Acquisition Proposal until the close of business
as of the tenth (10th) Business Day after the commencement of such Acquisition
Proposal pursuant to Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act without such action
being considered an adverse modification);

  

  

(ii) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, any
Acquisition Proposal or any letter of intent or agreement in principle with
respect to a Acquisition Proposal;

  

  

(iii) except as expressly permitted by Section 8.3(a), cause or permit the
Company to enter into any acquisition agreement, merger agreement or similar
definitive

  

  

 

  

 

31  

  

agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in Section
6.5(b)) (an "Alternative Acquisition Agreement") relating to any Acquisition
Proposal; or

 

  

  

(iv) agree or resolve to take, or publicly announce any intention to take, any
of the actions set forth in clauses (i), through (iii) above.

  

  

Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 6.5(d), (I) at any time prior
to obtaining the Company Requisite Vote, if the Company Board determines or
any committee thereof believes in good faith, after consultation with outside
counsel that failure to take any of the actions set forth in clauses (i)
through (v) of this Section 6.5(d) (any of the foregoing, a "Change of
Recommendation")") could be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable law other than because the Company has a received a Superior
Proposal, the Company Board may take any of the actions set forth in clauses
(i), (ii) and (v) of this Section 6.5(d) and (II) at any time prior to
obtaining the Company Requisite Vote, if the Company Board determines, in good
faith, after consultation with independent financial advisors and outside
legal counsel, that (x) an Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal and (y)
failure to take such action could be inconsistent with the directors'
fiduciary duties under applicable law, the Company Board may, in response to
such a Superior Proposal, take any of the actions set forth in clauses (i)
through (v) of this Section 6.5(d) with respect to a Superior Proposal;
provided that prior to taking any such actions permitted pursuant to this
clause (II), (w) the Company has given Parent at least two (2) Business Days'
prior written notice of its intention to take such action (which notice shall
include an unredacted copy of the Superior Proposal, an unredacted copy of the
relevant proposed transaction agreements and an unredacted copy of any
financing commitments relating thereto), (x) the Company has negotiated, and
has caused its representatives to negotiate, in good faith with Parent during
such notice period, to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate, to enable Parent
to propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement, the Financing Commitments
and the Guarantees such that it would cause such Superior Proposal to no
longer constitute a Superior Proposal, (y) following the end of such notice
period, the Company Board shall have considered in good faith any proposed
revisions to this Agreement, the Financing Commitments and the Guarantees
proposed in writing by Parent, and shall have determined that the Superior
Proposal would continue to constitute a Superior Proposal if such revisions
were to be given effect and (z) in the event of any material change to the
material terms of such Superior Proposal, the Company shall, in each case,
have delivered to Parent an additional notice consistent with that described
in clause (w) above and the notice period shall have recommenced, except that
the notice period shall be at least one Business Day (unless the initial two
(2) Business Day period has not concluded, in which case such notice period
shall be at least one Business Day after such additional notice); and
provided, further that the Company has complied in all material respects with
its obligations under this Section 6.5.

  

  

(e) Certain Permitted Disclosure. Nothing contained in this Section 6.5 shall
be deemed to prohibit the Company or the Company Board or any committee
thereof from (i) complying with its disclosure obligations under U.S. federal
or state law with regard to an Acquisition Proposal, including taking and
disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule
14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to
stockholders), or (ii) making any "stop-look-and-listen" communication to the
stockholders of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the
Exchange Act (or any similar communications to the stockholders of the
Company).

  

 

  

 

32  

  

 

  

(f) Notice. The Company agrees that it will promptly (and, in any event,
within four (4) Business Days) notify Parent if any proposals or offers with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal are received by, any non-public information
is requested from, or any discussions or negotiations are sought to be
initiated or continued with, it or any of its Representatives indicating, in
connection with such notice, the material terms and conditions of any
proposals or offers (including, if applicable, copies of any written requests,
proposals or offers (including, if applicable, copies of any written requests,
proposals or offers, including proposed agreements, redacted, if necessary, to
remove the identity of the person making the proposal or offer or to comply
with confidentiality obligations to such person) the Company Representatives
and thereafter shall keep Parent reasonably informed of the status and terms
of any such proposals, offers (including any amendments thereto), discussions
and negotiations within 24 hours. Upon the request of Parent, the Company or
the Company Representatives shall promptly apprise Parent of the status of any
such Acquisition Proposal. The Company agrees that it and its subsidiaries
will not enter into any confidentiality agreement with any person subsequent
to the date hereof which prohibits the Company from providing any information
to Parent in accordance with this Section 6.5.

  

  

Section 6.6 Employment and Employee Benefits Matters.

  

  

(a) Without limiting any rights that any Company Employee may have under any
Company Plan, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and each of its
subsidiaries to maintain, for the period commencing at the Effective Time and
ending on December 31, 2012 (the "Benefit Continuation Period"), the
severance-related provisions of the Company Plans existing immediately prior
to the Effective Time and set forth on Section 6.6(a) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule and to provide the severance payments and benefits
contemplated by such provisions to any Person who is employed by the Company
or any of its subsidiaries as of the Effective Time (a "Continuing Employee" )
and to whom such provisions are applicable as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time whose employment is terminated during the Benefit Continuation
Period in accordance with the terms and conditions of such provisions (except
as otherwise agreed to by the applicable Continuing Employee).

  

  

(b) Without limiting any rights that any Company Employee may have under any
Company Plan, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and each of its
subsidiaries to maintain for any Continuing Employee, during the Benefit
Continuation Period, subject to paragraph (a) above and except as otherwise
agreed to by the applicable Continuing Employee: (i) compensation levels (such
term to mean salary and/or wages and annual cash incentive compensation
opportunities, excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any equity-based
compensation), (ii) health and welfare benefits and (iii) retirement benefits,
that for each category are no less favorable, in the aggregate, than, the
compensation levels, health and welfare benefits, and retirement benefits,
respectively, which such Continuing Employee was eligible to receive as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that neither
Parent nor any of its affiliates shall be obligated to continue to employ any
Continuing Employee or maintain any particular employee benefit plan for any
specific period of time following the Effective Time.

  

  

(c) As of and after the Effective Time, Parent will, or will cause the
Surviving Corporation to, give Continuing Employees full credit for purposes
of eligibility, participation,

  

  

 

 

33  

 

  

vesting and benefit accruals (but not for purposes of benefit accruals under
any defined benefit pension plans, to the extent this credit would result in a
duplication of benefits for the same period of service), under any employee
compensation and incentive plans, benefit (including vacation) plans,
programs, policies and arrangements established or maintained for the benefit
of Continuing Employees as of and after the Effective Time by Parent, its
subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation for the Continuing Employees'
service with the Company, its subsidiaries and their predecessor entities
(each, a "Parent Plan") to the same extent recognized by the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time. With respect to each Parent Plan that
is a "welfare benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA, regardless
as to whether or not such Parent Plan is subject to ERISA), Parent or its
subsidiaries shall, to the extent permitted under applicable law, (i) cause
there to be waived any pre-existing condition or eligibility limitations and
(ii) give effect, in determining any deductible and maximum out-of-pocket
limitations, to claims incurred and amounts paid by, and amounts reimbursed
to, Company Employees under similar plans maintained by the Company and its
subsidiaries in the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs.

  

  

(d) From and after the Effective Time, Parent will honor, and will cause its
subsidiaries to honor, in accordance with its terms, (i) each existing
employment, change in control, severance and termination protection plan,
policy or agreement of or between the Company or any of its subsidiaries and
any officer, director or employee of that company, (ii) all cash bonus plans
or programs and (iii) all obligations pursuant to Company Plans in effect as
of the Effective Time, in each case to the extent legally binding on the
Company or any of its subsidiaries.

  

  

(e) No later than ten (10) Business Days following the date of this Agreement
with respect to each "officer" of the Company (as defined in Rule 16a-1
promulgated under the Exchange Act) (each a "Section 16 Officer"); and no
later than 20 Business Days following the date of this Agreement with respect
to any other "disqualified individual" of the Company (as defined in Section
280G(c) of the Code), the Company shall furnish a schedule that sets forth (i)
the Company's reasonable, good faith estimate of the maximum amount
(separately identifying single and double-trigger amounts and any tax gross-up
payments) that could be paid to such Section 16 Officer or other disqualified
individual as a result of any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (alone or in combination with any other event), (ii) the "base
amount" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code) for each such Section
16 Officer or other disqualified individual, and (iii) underlying
documentation on which such calculations are based. The schedules and
underlying documentation required by this Section 6.6(e) shall be updated and
delivered to Parent not later than twenty (20) Business Days prior to the
anticipated Closing Date.

  

  

(f) The Parties acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in this
Section 6.6 are included for the sole benefit of the respective Parties and
shall not create any right in any other Person, including, any Company
Employee or Continuing Employee. No provision in this Agreement shall create
any right to employment or to continued employment or to a particular term or
condition of employment with the Company or any of its subsidiaries or Parent
or any of their respective affiliates. Nothing in this Section 6.6 or any
other provision of this Agreement (i) shall be construed to establish, amend,
or modify any benefit plan, program or

  

  

 

 

34  

  

arrangement, or (ii) shall limit the ability of the Company or Parent or any
of their respective affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any benefit plan,
program or arrangement.

 

  

  

Section 6.7 Directors' and Officers' Indemnification and Insurance.

  

  

(a) Without limiting any additional rights that any employee may have under
any employment agreement or Company Plan as in effect on the date hereof and
which has previously been made available to Parent, from the Effective Time
through the sixth anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time occurs,
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to indemnify and hold harmless
each present (as of the Effective Time) and former officer and director of the
Company and its subsidiaries (the "Indemnified Parties"), against all claims,
losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries, fines and reasonable fees,
costs and expenses, including attorneys' fees and disbursements, incurred in
connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining
to (i) the fact that an Indemnified Party is or was an officer or director of
the Company or any of its subsidiaries or is or was serving at the request of
the Company or any of its subsidiaries as a director, officer, employee,
fiduciary or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust
or other enterprise or non-profit entity or (ii) matters existing or occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time (including this Agreement and the
transactions and actions contemplated hereby), whether asserted or claimed
prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable law. In the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation, (A) each Indemnified Party will be entitled to advancement
of expenses incurred in the defense of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation from the Surviving Corporation within ten (10) Business Days of
receipt by the Surviving Corporation from the Indemnified Party of a request
therefor; provided that any person to whom expenses are advanced provides an
undertaking, if and only to the extent then required by the DGCL, to repay
such advances if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled
to indemnification, (B) neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall
settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any proceeding
or threatened action, suit, proceeding, investigation or claim (and in which
indemnification could be sought by such Indemnified Party hereunder), unless
such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of
such Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such action, suit,
proceeding, investigation or claim or such Indemnified Party otherwise
consents, and (C) the Surviving Corporation shall cooperate in the defense of
any such matter.

  

  

(b) The certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation of former or present directors and
officers than are presently set forth in the Company's Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified for a period of six years from the Effective Time in any
manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any such
individuals.

  

  

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall and, if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective
Time, to obtain and fully pay the premium for the extension of (i) the
directors' and officers' liability coverage of the Company's existing
directors' and officers' insurance policies, and (ii) the Company's existing
fiduciary liability insurance policies, in each case for a claims reporting or
discovery period of at least six

  

 

  

 

35  

  

years from and after the Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the
same or better credit rating as the Company's current insurance carrier with
respect to directors' and officers' liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance (collectively, "DandO Insurance") with terms, conditions,
retentions and limits of liability that are at least as favorable, in the
aggregate, as the Company's existing policies with respect to any actual or
alleged error, misstatement, misleading statement, act, omission, neglect,
breach of duty or any matter claimed against a director or officer of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries by reason of him or her serving in such
capacity that existed or occurred at or prior to the Effective Time (including
in connection with this Agreement or the transactions or actions contemplated
hereby); provided, however, that in no event shall the Company or the
Surviving Corporation expend for such policies pursuant to this sentence an
annual premium amount in excess of 300% of the annual premiums currently paid
by the Company for such insurance. If the Company and the Surviving
Corporation for any reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, continue to maintain in effect for a period of
at least six years from and after the Effective Time the DandO Insurance in
place as of the date hereof with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of
liability that are at least as favorable, in the aggregate, as provided in the
Company's existing policies as of the date hereof, or the Surviving
Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, use
reasonable best efforts to purchase comparable DandO Insurance for such six-year
period with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are at
least as favorable, in the aggregate, as provided in the Company's existing
policies as of the date hereof; provided, however, that in no event shall
Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend for such policies
pursuant to this sentence an annual premium amount in excess of 300% of the
annual premiums currently paid by the Company for such insurance; and
provided, further, that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage
exceed such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall obtain a policy with the
greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount.

 

  

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before, at or after the
Effective Time) is made against any Indemnified Party on or prior to the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time, the provisions and benefits of this Section
6.7 shall continue in full effect until the final disposition of such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation.

  

  

(e) This covenant is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and their respective heirs and
legal representatives. The indemnification provided for herein shall not be
deemed exclusive of any other rights to which an Indemnified Party is
entitled, whether pursuant to law, contract or otherwise.

  

  

(f) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or Parent or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or a
majority of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such
case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, shall succeed to the
obligations set forth in this Section 6.7.

  

  

 

  

 

36  

  

 

  

Section 6.8 Further Action; Efforts.

  

  

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, each of
the parties shall use (x) its reasonable best efforts, except as provided in
Section 6.14, to (i) take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or
cause to be done, and cooperate with each other in order to do, all things
necessary, proper or advisable (including under any Antitrust Law) to

practicable and (ii) do all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable laws and regulations to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement at the earliest practicable date,

and notices required to be filed to consummate the Merger and the taking of
such actions as are necessary to obtain any requisite consent or expiration of
any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act; (B) defending all lawsuits
and other proceedings by or before any Governmental Entity challenging this
Agreement or the consummation of the Merger; and (y) using reasonable best
efforts to resolve any objection asserted with respect to the transactions
contemplated under this Agreement under any Antitrust Law raised by any

or other action of any Governmental Entity that would prevent, prohibit,
restrict or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

  

  

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the provisions of Section 6.8(a),
each of the parties, as applicable, agrees to prepare and file as promptly as
practicable, and in any event by no later than ten (10) Business Days from the
date of this Agreement an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form
pursuant to the HSR Act. Parent shall pay all filing fees and other charges
for the filings required under the HSR Act by the Company and Parent.

  

  

(c) If a party receives a request for information or documentary material from
any Governmental Entity with respect to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby then such party shall in good faith make, or
cause to be made, as soon as reasonably practicable and after consultation
with the other party, a response which is, at a minimum, in substantial
compliance with such request.

  

  

(d) The parties shall keep each other apprised of the status of matters
relating to the completion of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and work cooperatively in connection with obtaining the approvals of or
clearances from each applicable Governmental Entity, including:

  

  

(i) cooperating with each other in connection with filings required to be made
by any party under any Antitrust Law and liaising with each other in relation
to each step of the procedure before the relevant Governmental Entities and as
to the contents of all material communications with such Governmental
Entities. In particular, to the extent permitted by law or Governmental
Entity, no party will make any notification in relation to the transactions
contemplated hereunder without first providing the other party with a copy of
such notification in draft form and giving such other party a reasonable
opportunity to discuss its content before it is filed with the relevant
Governmental Entities, and such first party shall consider and take account of
all reasonable comments timely made by the other party in this respect;

  

  

 

  

 

37  

  

 

  

(ii) furnishing to the other party all necessary information that the other
party may reasonably request in connection with filings required to be made by
the other party under Antitrust Laws;

to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

  

  

(iv) consulting and cooperating with one another in connection with all

and any other consents required to be obtained in order for the parties to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
obligations of Parent under Section 6.8(a)(y) shall mean Parent committing, if
necessary, to: (i) selling, divesting, or otherwise conveying particular
assets, categories, portions or parts of assets or businesses of the Company
and its subsidiaries; (ii) agreeing to sell, divest, or otherwise convey any
particular asset, category, portion or part of an asset or business of the
Company and its subsidiaries contemporaneously with or subsequent to the
Effective Time; (iii) permitting the Company to sell, divest, or otherwise
convey any of the particular assets, categories, portions or parts of assets

the HSR Act or consents from any Governmental Entity necessary, to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby. All efforts described in this Section
6.8(f) shall be unconditional and shall not be qualified by best efforts and
no actions taken pursuant to this Section 6.8 shall be considered for purposes
of determining whether a Material Adverse Effect has occurred.

  

  

(g) Notwithstanding the foregoing, commercially and/or competitively sensitive
information and materials of a party will be provided to the other party on an
outside counsel-

  

  

  

 

 

38  

 

  

only basis while, to the extent feasible, making a version in which the
commercial and/or competitively sensitive information has been redacted
available to the other party.

  

  

Section 6.9 Public Announcements. Unless and until a Change of Recommendation
has occurred, the Company and Parent will consult with and provide each other
the reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon any press release or
other public statement or comment prior to the issuance of such press release
or other public statement or comment relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated herein and shall not issue any such press release or
other public statement or comment prior to such consultation except as may be
required by applicable law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement
with any national securities exchange. Parent and the Company agree that the
press release announcing the execution and delivery of this Agreement shall be
a joint release of Parent and the Company.

  

  

Section 6.10 Anti-Takeover Statutes. If the restrictive provisions of any
Anti-Takeover Statute is or may become applicable to this Agreement (including
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby), each of Parent,
the Company and Merger Sub and their respective boards of directors shall
grant all such approvals and take all such actions as are reasonably necessary
so that such transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable
hereafter on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate or
minimize the effects of such statute or regulation on such transactions.

  

  

Section 6.11 Notification of Certain Matters. The Company shall give prompt
notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (a)
any notice or other communication received by such party from any Governmental
Entity in connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
hereby or from any person alleging that the consent of such person is or may
be required in connection with the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated hereby, if the subject matter of such communication or the
failure of such party to obtain such consent could be material to the Company,
the Surviving Corporation or Parent or (b) any actions, suits, claims,
investigations or proceedings commenced or, to such party's knowledge,
threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such party
or any of its subsidiaries which relate to the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated hereby; provided, however, that the delivery of any
notice pursuant to this Section 6.11 shall not (i) cure any breach of, or non-
compliance with, any other provision of this Agreement or (ii) limit the
remedies available to the party receiving such notice. The parties agree and
acknowledge that the Company's compliance or failure of compliance with this
Section 6.11 shall not be taken into account for purposes of determining
whether the condition referred to in Section 7.2(b) shall have been satisfied.

  

  

Section 6.12 Rule 16b-3. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall be
permitted to take such steps as may be reasonably necessary or advisable
hereto to cause dispositions of Company equity securities (including
derivative securities) pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this

and receive the Parent Fee pursuant to this Section 8.5, the Company agrees
that the maximum aggregate liability of Parent and Merger Sub and the

provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties
hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable
manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to
the fullest extent possible. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties intend
that the remedies and limitations thereon contained in Section 8.5(d) be

and limitations shall not be severable in any manner that increases a party's
liability or obligations hereunder or under the Financing Commitments or the
Guarantees.

Exhibits hereto), the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Financing Commitments,

the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof. This
Agreement shall not be assigned by operation of law or otherwise without the
prior written consent of each of the other parties.

  

  

Section 9.6 Parties in Interest. Except (i) as provided in Section 6.7 which
shall be enforceable by the current and former officers and directors and
their respective successors and assigns (and as to which each of the foregoing
is an express third party beneficiary), (ii) Section 8.5(d), Section 9.11(b)
and Section 9.13, which shall be enforceable by each financing source of the

foregoing is an express third party beneficiary) and (iii) Section 9.14, which
shall be enforceable by each Parent

  

  

 

 

52  

 

  

Related Party, Parent and the Company hereby agree that their respective
representations, warranties and covenants set forth herein are solely for the
benefit of the other party hereto, in accordance with and subject to the terms
of this Agreement, and this Agreement is not intended to, and does not, confer
upon any person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies
hereunder, including the right to rely upon the representations and warranties
set forth herein. The parties hereto further agree that the rights of third
party beneficiaries under Section 6.7 shall not arise unless and until the
Effective Time occurs. The representations and warranties in this Agreement
are the product of negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole
benefit of the parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such representations and
warranties are subject to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance with
Section 8.8 without notice or liability to any other person. In some
instances, the representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent
an allocation among the parties hereto of risks associated with particular
matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto.
Consequently, persons other than the parties hereto may not rely upon the
representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any
other date.

  

  

Section 9.7 Governing Law. This Agreement, and all disputes between the
parties under or related to this Agreement, shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware (without
giving effect to choice of law principles thereof).

  

  

Section 9.8 Headings. The descriptive headings contained in this Agreement are
included for convenience of reference only and shall not affect in any way the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

  

  

Section 9.9 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed and delivered
(including by facsimile, ".pdf," or other electronic transmission) in one or
more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate
counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original
but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.

  

  

Section 9.10 Specific Performance. The parties agree that irreparable damage
for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate
remedy, would occur in the event that the parties hereto do not perform the
provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are
required of it hereunder in order to consummate this Agreement) in accordance
with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. The parties
acknowledge and agree that, prior to the earlier of the Closing or the valid
termination of this Agreement, the parties shall be entitled to an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity. Without limitation of the foregoing and in accordance with the last
sentence of this Section 9.10, the parties hereby further acknowledge and
agree that prior to the earlier of the Closing or the valid termination of
this Agreement, the Company shall be entitled to seek specific performance (i)
to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of, and to prevent or cure
breaches of Sections 6.8 and 6.14 by Parent or Merger Sub, (ii) to cause
Parent and/or Merger Sub to draw down the full proceeds of the Equity
Financing, if (A) all conditions in Sections 7.1 and 7.2 (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing) have been
satisfied, (B) Parent and Merger Sub fail to complete the Closing by the date

  

  

 

 

53  

 

  

the Closing is required to have occurred pursuant to Section 1.2 and (C) the
Company has irrevocably confirmed that if specific performance is granted and
the Equity Financing is funded, then the Closing will occur and (iii) to
prevent or cure breaches of this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub and/or to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, including to
cause Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby,
including to effect the Closing in accordance with Section 1.2, on the terms
and subject to the conditions in this Agreement. Each of the parties agrees
that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance
and other equitable relief on the basis that (x) either party has an adequate
remedy at law or (y) an award of specific performance is not an appropriate
remedy for any reason (other than the likelihood of success on the merits) at
law or equity. For the avoidance of doubt, under no circumstances will the
Company be entitled to monetary damages from Parent, Merger Sub or any Parent
Related Party in excess of the aggregate amount of (A) the Parent Fee, (B) any
reimbursement obligation of Parent pursuant to the first sentence of Section
8.5(d), (C) the reimbursement and expense obligations of Parent contained in
the last sentence of Section 6.14(b), and (D) the indemnification obligations
of Parent contained in Section 6.14(d). Any party seeking an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide
any bond or other security in connection with any such order or injunction.
Until such time as Parent pays and the Company accepts the Parent Fee pursuant
to the terms of this Agreement, the remedies available to the Company pursuant
to this Section 9.10 shall be in addition to any other remedy to which it is
entitled at law or in equity, and the election to pursue an injunction or
specific performance shall not restrict, impair or otherwise limit the Company
from, in the alternative, terminating this Agreement in accordance with
Section 8.3 and collecting the Parent Fee under Section 8.5; provided, that
under no circumstances shall the Company be permitted or entitled to receive
both a grant of specific performance of the type contemplated by this Section
9.10 and any money damages, including all or any portion of the Parent Fee.

  

  

Section 9.11 Jurisdiction.

  

  

(a) Each of the parties hereto (a) consents to submit itself to the personal
jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (the "Delaware
Court of Chancery") and any state appellate court therefrom within the State
of Delaware (unless the Delaware Court of Chancery shall decline to accept
jurisdiction over a particular matter, in which case, in any federal court
located within the State of Delaware), in the event any dispute arises out of
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b)
agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction
by motion or other request for leave from any such court, (c) agrees that it
will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than the courts
of the State of Delaware, as described above, and (d) consents to service
being made through the notice procedures set forth in Section 9.2. Each of the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub hereby agrees that service of any process,
summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to the respective

any suit or proceeding in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby.

  

  

(b) With respect to any claim, suit, action or proceeding of any kind or
description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise, involving any financing sources under the Debt Financing or any
affiliate thereof arising out of or relating to the

  

 

  

 

54  

  

transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Financing Commitments, the
Debt Financing or the performance of services thereunder, the parties hereto
agree that (i) such claims, suits, actions or proceedings shall be subject to
the exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery and any state
appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (unless the Delaware
Court of Chancery shall decline to accept jurisdiction over a particular
matter, in which case, in any federal court located within the State of
Delaware) and (ii) they shall not bring or permit any of their affiliates to
bring or support anyone else in bringing any such claim, suit, action or
proceeding in any other court. The parties hereto further agree that the
financing sources under the Debt Financing (and their respective affiliates)
shall be beneficiaries of any liability cap and all other limitations on
remedies and damages in this Agreement and that the financing sources under
the Debt Financing (and their respective affiliates) are express third party
beneficiaries of this Section 9.11(b).

 

  

  

Section 9.12 Interpretation. When reference is made in this Agreement to a
Section, such reference shall be to a Section of this Agreement unless
otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including"
are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation." The words "hereof," "herein," "hereby" and "hereunder"
and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this
Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement.
The word "or" shall not be exclusive. This Agreement shall be construed
without regard to any presumption or rule requiring construction or
interpretation against the party drafting or causing any instrument to be
drafted.

  

  

Section 9.13 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH OF PARENT, MERGER SUB AND THE COMPANY
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING
OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF
OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING ANY SUCH ACTION INVOLVING THE
FINANCING SOURCES UNDER THE DEBT FINANCING), OR THE ACTIONS OF PARENT OR THE
COMPANY IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT
THEREOF.

  

  

Section 9.14 No Recourse. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and any
claims or causes of action that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to
this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement
may only be made against the entities that are expressly identified as parties
hereto and no Parent Related Party (other than the Guarantors to the extent
set forth in the Guarantees or Financing Commitments and other than the
parties to the Confidentiality Agreement to the extent set forth in the
Confidentiality Agreement) shall have any liability for any obligations or
liabilities of the parties to this Agreement or for any claim (whether in
tort, contract or otherwise) based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the
transactions contemplated hereby or in respect of any oral representations
made or alleged to be made in connection herewith. Without limiting the rights
of the Company against Parent or Merger Sub hereunder, in no event shall the
Company or any of its affiliates, and the Company agrees not to and to cause
its affiliates not to, seek to enforce this Agreement against, make any claims
for breach of this Agreement against, or seek to recover monetary damages
from, any Parent Related Party (other than payment of the Guarantors to the
extent set forth in the Guarantees).
