and, solely to the extent necessary under the NCBCA, the other provisions of
this Agreement shall constitute a "plan of merger" for the purposes of the
NCBCA, including Section 55-11-01 thereof.

 



 

 **ARTICLE II**

 



 

 ** _EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK_**

 



 

 **Section 2.1** **_Effect on Capital Stock_**. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent
or Merger Sub or any holder of any shares of common stock, no par value per
share, of the Company (" _Company Common Stock_ ") or any shares of capital
stock of Merger Sub:

 



 

(a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each issued and outstanding share of
capital stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become one validly
issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock, no par value per
share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(b) _Cancellation of Parent-Owned Stock_. Any shares of Company Common Stock
that are owned by Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective wholly-owned
Subsidiaries, in each case immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be
automatically canceled and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor.

 



 

(c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each issued and outstanding share of
Company Common Stock (other than shares to be canceled in accordance with
_Section 2.1(b)_) shall thereupon be converted automatically into and shall
thereafter represent solely the right to receive an amount in cash equal to
$60.00 without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). As of the Effective
Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding
and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and the holders
immediately prior to the Effective Time of shares of Company Common Stock not
represented by certificates (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") and the holders of
certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such
shares of Company Common Stock (each, a " _Certificate_ ") shall cease to have
any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration to be paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of such
Book-Entry Share or Certificate in accordance with _Section 2.2(b)_ without
interest (subject to any applicable withholding Tax).

 



      
 

 



 

 **Section 2.2** **_Exchange of Certificates_**.

 



 

(a) _Paying Agent; Investment by Paying Agent of Funds_. Prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably
acceptable to the Company (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the purpose of
exchanging shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger Consideration and
enter into an agreement reasonably acceptable to the Company with the Paying
Agent relating to the services to be performed by the Paying Agent. Parent
shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, the aggregate Merger Consideration
with respect to all shares of Company Common Stock (other than shares to be
cancelled in accordance with _Section 2.1(b)_) with the Paying Agent at or
prior to the Effective Time. The aggregate Merger Consideration deposited with
the Paying Agent shall, pending its disbursement to such holders, be invested
by the Paying Agent in (i) short-term commercial paper obligations of issuers
organized under the Laws of a state of the United States of America, rated A-1
or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors
Ratings Service, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase
agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding
$10,000,000,000, or in mutual funds investing in such assets, or (ii) short-
term obligations for which the full faith and credit of the United States of
America is pledged to provide for the payment of principal and interest, or in
mutual funds investing in such assets. Any interest and other income from such
investments shall become part of the funds held by the Paying Agent for
purposes of paying the Merger Consideration. No investment or investment
losses resulting from such investment by the Paying Agent of the aggregate
Merger Consideration shall relieve Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent from making the payments required by this _Article II_ and
Parent shall promptly replace any funds deposited with the Paying Agent lost
through any investment made pursuant to this _Section 2.2(a)_. No investment
by the Paying Agent of the aggregate Merger Consideration shall have
maturities that could prevent or delay payments to be made pursuant to this
Agreement. Following the Effective Time, Parent agrees to make available to
the Paying Agent, from time to time as needed, additional cash to pay the
Merger Consideration as contemplated by this _Article II_ without interest.

 



 

(b) _Payment Procedures_. As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time
(but in no event more than three (3) Business Days thereafter), the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of
Company Common Stock (i) a letter of transmittal (which, in the case of shares
of Company Common Stock represented by Certificates, shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent, and
shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company
may reasonably agree and shall be prepared prior to Closing) and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon
surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Paying Agent or, in the case
of Book-Entry Shares, receipt of an "agents message" by the Paying Agent (or
such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably
request), together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions (and such other customary
documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent), the holder of
such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor, subject to any required withholding Taxes, the Merger
Consideration, without interest, for each share of Company Common Stock
surrendered, and any Certificates surrendered shall forthwith be

 



      
 

 



 

canceled. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person
other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry
Share in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of payment
that (A) the Person requesting such exchange present proper evidence of
transfer or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer and (B) the Person
requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes required
by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than
the registered holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share surrendered or
shall have established to the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving
Corporation and the Paying Agent that such Tax either has been paid or is not
applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.2_, each
Certificate and Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration
as contemplated by this _Article II_, without interest.

 



 

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Stock_. The Merger
Consideration paid in respect of shares of Company Common Stock upon the
surrender for exchange in accordance with the terms of this _Article II_
shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock, and at the Effective Time,
the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there
shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of
the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and after the
Effective Time, the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares that
evidenced ownership of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to
such shares of Company Common Stock other than the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law.
If, at any time after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the
Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as
provided in this _Article II_.

 



 

(d) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, the posting by
such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as
indemnity against any claim with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent
will pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the
applicable Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company
Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this
_Article II_.

 



 

(e) _Termination of Fund_. At any time following the first (1st) anniversary
of the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require
the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received
with respect thereto) that had been made available to the Paying Agent and
which have not been disbursed in accordance with this _Article II_, and
thereafter Persons entitled to receive payment pursuant to this _Article II_
shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to
abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) as general creditors
thereof with respect to the payment of any Merger Consideration that may be
payable upon surrender of any Company Common Stock held by such holders, as
determined pursuant to this Agreement, without any interest thereon. Any
amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders at such time at which such amounts
would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority
shall become, to the extent

 



      
 

 



 

permitted by applicable Law, the property of the Surviving Corporation, free
and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 



 

(f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
none of Parent, the Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Company or the
Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person for Merger Consideration delivered
to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.

 



 

(g) _Withholding Taxes_. Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation and
the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable to a holder of shares of Company Common Stock,
Company RSUs or Company Performance Share Awards pursuant to this Agreement
such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to
the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the "
_Code_ "), or under any applicable provision of state, local or foreign Law
related to Taxes. To the extent amounts are so withheld and timely paid over
to the appropriate Taxing authority, the withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made. Parent, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation, and the Paying Agent shall reasonably cooperate with
such holders in all reasonable respects, and in compliance with applicable
Law, at their request and expense to minimize the amount of any applicable
withholding.

 



 

 **Section 2.3** **_Treatment of Equity Awards_**.

 



 

(a) _Company RSUs_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each (x) Company
RSU that was granted prior to the date of this Agreement and is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (y) each Company RSU that would
result, pursuant to the terms of the applicable Company RSU award agreement,
from crediting to an award recipients account the amount of cash dividends
accrued, but not yet credited, in respect of each share of Company Common
Stock subject to such Company RSU, shall be converted into a vested right to
receive cash in an amount equal to the Merger Consideration.

 



 

(b) _Currently Outstanding Company Performance Share Awards_. Immediately
prior to the Effective Time, each Company Performance Share Award that was
granted prior to the date of this Agreement and is outstanding and subject to
an incomplete performance period immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be converted into a vested right to receive cash in an amount equal to the
target number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company
Performance Share Award, multiplied by the Merger Consideration, subject to
proration consistent with past practice with respect to Applicable Retired
Company Employees. In addition, to the extent that the Effective Time occurs
within 2½ months following the end of the applicable performance period with
respect to a Company Performance Share Award but prior to settlement of such
Company Performance Share Award, such Company Performance Share Award shall be
converted into a vested right to receive cash in an amount equal to the
greater of (x) the target number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to
such Company Performance Share Award, multiplied by the Merger Consideration
and (y) the actual number of shares of Company Common Stock to which the
holder of such Company Performance Share Award would be entitled based on
actual performance with respect to the applicable performance

 



      
 

 



 

period, multiplied by the Merger Consideration, subject to proration
consistent with past practice with respect to Applicable Retired Company
Employees.

 



 

(c) _Future Company Performance Share Awards_. Each Company Performance Share
Award that is granted after the date of this Agreement and is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to represent an award that
can be settled in shares of Company Common Stock, shall be assumed by Parent
and shall be converted into a Parent restricted stock unit award (a " _Parent
RSU Award_ "), with the number of Parent Shares subject to such Parent RSU
Award being equal to the product (rounded down to the nearest whole number) of
(x) one hundred twenty-five percent (125%) of the target number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company Performance Share Award
immediately prior to the Effective Time _multiplied_ by (y) the Equity Award
Conversion Ratio. Any performance-related vesting conditions applicable to
each such Company Performance Share Award shall cease to apply upon the
conversion to Parent RSU Awards and the Parent RSU Awards shall be subject to
time-based vesting only and shall fully vest at the time the incomplete
performance period applicable to such Company Performance Share Awards would
otherwise have ended (the " _Parent RSU Award Vesting Date_ "), subject to the
holder of the Parent RSU Award (the " _Parent RSU Award Recipient_ ")
remaining continuously employed by the Surviving Corporation or its affiliates
through the applicable Parent RSU Award Vesting Date; _provided_ that in the
event, at any time prior to the Parent RSU Award Vesting Date, a Parent RSU
Award Recipient is terminated by the Surviving Corporation without "Cause" or
resigns for "Good Reason," each as defined in the Company Stock Plan, any
Parent RSU Awards held by the Parent RSU Award Recipient that would have
vested on such Parent RSU Award Vesting Date shall fully and immediately vest
as of the termination date. Except as provided herein, including with respect
to vesting conditions, each such Company Performance Share Award that is
assumed by Parent hereunder shall continue to be subject to the same terms and
conditions that apply to such Company Performance Share Award immediately
prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that the compensation
committee of Parents board of directors shall succeed to the authority and
responsibility of the Company Board or any committee thereof with respect to
such Company Performance Share Award and such Company Performance Share Award
shall be subject to administrative procedures consistent with those in effect
under Parents equity compensation plan. Parent shall register on a Form S-8
(or other appropriate form) all Parent Shares subject to the Parent RSU
Awards.

 



 

(d) The Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this _Section 2.3_ to any holder of
Company RSUs or Company Performance Share Awards such amounts as the Surviving
Corporation is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under the Code, or any applicable provision of state, or local
Law related to Tax, and the Surviving Corporation shall timely make any
required filings and payments to Tax authorities relating to any such
deduction or withholding. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and
withheld by the Surviving Corporation, such withheld amounts shall be treated
for the purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of
Company RSUs or Company Performance Share Awards in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(e) No later than the Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or shall cause to
be provided, to the Surviving Corporation all funds necessary to fulfill the
obligations under this

 



      
 

 



 

 _Section 2.3_. All payments required under this _Section 2.3_ shall be made
through the Companys payroll not later than the first payroll date following
the Effective Time.

 



 

 **Section 2.4** **_Treatment of Employee Stock Purchase Plan_**. Except as
otherwise provided in this Section 2.4, each current "Payroll Deduction
Period" (as defined in the Company ESPP) (a " _Payroll Deduction Period_ ") in
progress as of the date of this Agreement under the Company ESPP will
continue, and the shares of Company Common Stock will be issued to
participants thereunder on the next currently scheduled purchase dates
thereunder occurring after the date of this Agreement as provided under, and
subject to the terms and conditions of, the Company ESPP. New Payroll
Deduction Periods under the Company ESPP will be permitted to commence
following the date of this Agreement in the ordinary course of business. Any
Payroll Deduction Period in progress as of the Effective Time will be
shortened, and the last day of each such Payroll Deduction Period will be a
date specified by Parent that is not more than thirty (30) days preceding the
Effective Time or such other time as the parties otherwise agree, at which
time each participant in the Company ESPP shall have purchased for his or her
account as many shares of Company Common Stock as his or her payroll
deductions that have accumulated during the relevant Payroll Deduction Period
can purchase under the terms of the Company ESPP. Notwithstanding any
restrictions on transfer of stock in the Company ESPP, the treatment in the
Merger of any shares of Company Common Stock under this provision will be in
accordance with _Section 2.1_. The Company will terminate the Company ESPP as
of or prior to the Effective Time. The Company will, promptly after the date
of this Agreement, take all actions (including, if appropriate, amending the
terms of the Company ESPP) that are necessary to give effect to the
transactions contemplated by this _Section 2.4_.

 



 

 **Section 2.5** **_Adjustments_**. If at any time during the period between
the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company (or any other securities
convertible or exchangeable therefor) shall occur as a result of any
reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split) or
combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend or
stock distribution with a record date during such period, or any similar
event, the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted; _provided,
however_ , that nothing in this _Section 2.5_ shall be deemed to permit or
authorize any party hereto to effect any such change that it is not otherwise
authorized or permitted to undertake pursuant to this Agreement.

authorize the execution and delivery of and performance by the Company under
this Agreement and the consummation by it of the Transactions. This Agreement
has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming due
authorization, execution and delivery hereof by the other parties hereto,
constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable

applicable requirements of the applicable statute and the rules and
regulations thereunder, except for Regulatory Filings the failure of which to

 **Section 5.2** **_Preparation of the Proxy Statement; Shareholders
Meeting_**.

 



 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy
Statement, and Parent shall cooperate with the Company with the preparation of
the foregoing. The Company, with Parents cooperation, shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to and
resolve all comments received from the SEC or its staff concerning the Proxy
Statement. The Company agrees that (i) except with respect to any information
supplied in writing to the Company by Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement, the Proxy Statement will
comply in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the Exchange
Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and (ii) none of the information
supplied or to be supplied by the Company for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Proxy Statement will, on the date it is first mailed to
shareholders of the Company or at the time of the Company Shareholders
Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. The Company will cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the
Companys shareholders, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the SEC
confirms that it has no further comments on the Proxy Statement. No filing of,
or amendment or supplement to, or correspondence with the SEC with respect to,
the Proxy Statement will be made by the Company without providing Parent a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon and with the Company
considering in good faith such comments; _provided, however_ , that the
foregoing shall not apply with respect to a Takeover Proposal, a Superior
Proposal, a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or any matters relating
thereto. Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall cooperate with the Company in
connection with the preparation and filing of the Proxy Statement, including
promptly furnishing to the Company in writing upon request any and all
information relating to it as may be required to be set forth in the Proxy
Statement under applicable Law. Each of the Parent and Merger Sub agrees that
such information supplied by it in writing for inclusion (or incorporation by
reference) in the Proxy Statement will not, on the date it is first mailed to
shareholders of the Company and at the time of the Company Shareholders
Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in

 



      
 

 



 

light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. If, at
any time prior to the Effective Time, any information relating to Parent or
Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors,
should be discovered by Parent or Merger Sub which should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement so that the Proxy Statement
would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, Parent (or Merger
Sub, as the case may be) shall promptly notify the Company so that it may file
with the SEC an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such
information and, to the extent required by Law, disseminate such amendment or
supplement to the shareholders of the Company. If, at any time prior to the
Effective Time, any information relating to the Company or any of its
respective Affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by the
Company which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement so that the Proxy Statement would not include any misstatement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, the Company shall promptly notify Parent and the Company shall
file with the SEC an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such
information and, to the extent required by Law, disseminate such amendment or
supplement to the shareholders of the Company.

 



 

(b) The Company shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of
the mailing of the definitive Proxy Statement to the Companys shareholders,
in accordance with applicable Law, the Company Charter Documents and the NYSE
rules, duly give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its shareholders to
consider the approval of this Agreement and such other matters as may be then
reasonably required (including any adjournment or postponement thereof, the "
_Company Shareholders Meeting_ "); _provided, however_ , that the Company
shall be permitted to delay or postpone convening the Company Shareholders
Meeting (i) with the consent of Parent, (ii) for the absence of a quorum,
(iii) to allow reasonable additional time for any supplemental or amended
disclosure which the Company has determined in good faith (after consultation
with outside legal counsel) is necessary under applicable Law and for such
supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by the
Companys shareholders prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting as necessary
under applicable Law or (iv) to allow additional solicitation of votes in
order to obtain the Company Shareholder Approval. Except if there has been a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change in accordance with _Section 5.3(d)_,
the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to solicit and secure the
Company Shareholder Approval as promptly as practicable.

 



 

(c) Subject to _Section 5.3_ and the right of the Company Board to make a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant thereto, unless and until there
has been a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in accordance with _Section
5.3_, the Company shall include the Company Board Recommendation in the
preliminary and definitive Proxy Statement. The Company agrees that, unless
this Agreement has been terminated pursuant to _Section 7.1_, a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change shall not relieve the Company of its obligation
hereunder to submit this Agreement to the Companys shareholders at the
Company Shareholders Meeting.

 



      
 

 



 

 **Section 5.3** **_No Solicitation; Change in Recommendation_**.

 



 

(a) The Company agrees that it shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its
and its Subsidiaries directors, officers and employees to, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its other Representatives to, immediately
cease all existing discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted
heretofore with respect to any Takeover Proposal, immediately request the
prompt return or destruction of all confidential information previously
furnished and immediately terminate all physical and electronic data room
access previously granted to any such Person or its Representatives. Except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement, from the date of this Agreement until
the earlier of the Effective Time or the date, if any, on which this Agreement
is terminated pursuant to _Section 7.1_, the Company shall not, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries and its and its Subsidiaries directors, officers and
employees not to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its other
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate,
knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any Takeover Proposal or the
making or consummation thereof or (ii) enter into, or otherwise participate in
any discussions (except to notify such Person of the existence of the
provisions of this _Section 5.3_) or negotiations regarding, or furnish to
any Person any information in connection with, any Takeover Proposal.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any of its or their respective
Representatives receives an unsolicited _bona fide_ written Takeover Proposal
made after the date of this Agreement, the Company, the Company Board (or a
duly authorized committee thereof) and the Companys Representatives may
engage in negotiations and discussions with, or furnish any information and
other access to, any Person making such Takeover Proposal and any of its
Representatives or potential sources of financing if the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with the Companys outside legal
and financial advisors, that such Takeover Proposal is or could reasonably be
expected to lead to a Superior Proposal; _provided_ that prior to engaging in
any negotiations or discussions with, or furnishing any information to, any
such Person or its Representatives, the Company and the Person making such
Takeover Proposal shall have entered into an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement. The Company will promptly (and in any event within the later of
twenty-four (24) hours or 5:00 p.m. New York City time on the next Business
Day) notify Parent in writing of the receipt of such Takeover Proposal, the
material terms and conditions of any such Takeover Proposal and the identity
of the Person making such Takeover Proposal. The Company will keep Parent
informed in all material respects on a prompt basis (and in any event within
the later of twenty-four (24) hours or 5:00 p.m. New York City time on the
next Business Day) of the material terms and status of such Takeover Proposal
(including any change in the price or any other material terms thereof). The
Company shall not terminate, amend, modify, waive or fail to enforce any
provision of any "standstill" or similar obligation of any Person unless the
Company Board (or a duly authorized committee thereof) determines in good
faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to
take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 



 

(c) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, neither the Company Board
nor any committee thereof shall (i)(A) withdraw, change, qualify, withhold or
modify, or publicly propose to withdraw, change, qualify, withhold or modify,
in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Board Recommendation, (B) adopt,
approve or recommend, or publicly propose to adopt, approve or recommend, any
Takeover Proposal, (C) fail to include in the Proxy Statement the Company
Board Recommendation, (D) fail to recommend against any Takeover

 



      
 

 



 

Proposal subject to Regulation 14D under the Exchange Act in any solicitation
or recommendation statement made on Schedule 14D-9 within ten (10) Business
Days after Parent so requests reaffirmation in writing (provided, that Parent
shall be entitled to make such a written request for reaffirmation only once
for each Takeover Proposal and once for each material amendment to such
Takeover Proposal), or (E) resolve or publicly propose to do any of the
foregoing (any action described in this clause (i) being referred to herein as
a " _Company Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") or (ii) cause or permit the
Company or any of its Affiliates to execute or enter into, any letter of
intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, agreement or
commitment (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) constituting,
or that would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Takeover Proposal (a "
_Company Acquisition Agreement_ ").

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, at any time
prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, the Company Board (or a
duly authorized committee thereof) may make a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change (and, solely with respect to a Superior Proposal, terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)(ii)_), if (i) (A) a Company Intervening
Event has occurred or (B) the Company has received a Superior Proposal other
than as a result of a breach of this _Section 5.3_ (other than immaterial
breach), in each case, if the Company Board (or a duly authorized committee
thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel, that the failure to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change as a
result of the occurrence of such Company Intervening Event or in response to
the receipt of such Superior Proposal, as the case may be, would reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law and
(ii) (A) the Company provides Parent prior written notice of its intent to
make any Company Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)(ii)_ at least four (4) Business Days prior to
taking such action to the effect that, absent any modification to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, the Company Board has resolved to effect a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change or to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to _Section 7.1(d)(ii)_, which notice shall specify the basis for such
Company Adverse Recommendation Change or termination and attaching the most
current draft of any Company Acquisition Agreement with respect to, the
Superior Proposal (or, if no such draft exists, a summary of the material
terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal), if applicable (a " _Notice of
Recommendation Change_ ") (it being understood that such Notice of
Recommendation Change shall not in itself be deemed a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change and that any change in price or material revision or
amendment to the terms of a Superior Proposal, if applicable, shall require a
new notice to which the provisions of clauses (ii)(A), (B) and (C) of this
_Section 5.3(d)_ shall apply _mutatis mutandis_ except that, in the case of
such a new notice, all references to four (4) Business Days in this _Section
5.3(d)_ shall be deemed to be two (2) Business Days); (B) during such four (4)
Business Day period, if requested by Parent, the Company shall make its
Representatives available to negotiate in good faith with Parent and its
Representatives regarding any modifications to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement that Parent proposes to make; and (C) at the end of such four
(4) Business Day period and taking into account any modifications to the terms
of this Agreement proposed by Parent, if any, in a written, binding and
irrevocable offer, the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside legal counsel) that the failure to make such a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and that, in the
case of a Company

 



       
 

 



 

Adverse Recommendation Change with respect to a Takeover Proposal, such
Takeover Proposal still constitutes a Superior Proposal.

 



 

(e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board (or a duly authorized committee thereof) from (i) taking and
disclosing to the shareholders of the Company a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or making a statement contemplated by Item
1012(a) of Regulation M-A or Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act, (ii) making
any disclosure to the shareholders of the Company if the Company Board (or a
duly authorized committee thereof) determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to make such
disclosure would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with applicable Law,
(iii) informing any Person of the existence of the provisions contained in
this _Section 5.3_ or (iv) making any "stop, look and listen" communication
to the shareholders of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the
Exchange Act.

 



 

(f) As used in this Agreement, " _Takeover Proposal_ " shall mean any inquiry,
proposal or offer (whether or not in writing) from any Person (other than

securities of Subsidiaries) that account for 15% or more of the Companys
consolidated assets or from which 15% or more of the Companys revenues or
earnings on a consolidated basis are derived or (b) 15% or more of the
outstanding Company Common Stock pursuant to a merger, consolidation or other
business combination, sale or issuance of shares of capital stock, tender
offer, share exchange, other business combination, recapitalization,
liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving the Company, in each
case other than the Merger.

 



 

(g) As used in this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean any
unsolicited _bona fide_ written Takeover Proposal on terms which the Company
Board (or a duly authorized committee thereof) determines in good faith, after
consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel and independent
financial advisors, to be more favorable to the holders of Company Common
Stock than the Transaction (after taking into account any revisions to the
terms of this Agreement that are proposed by Parent pursuant to _Section
5.3(d)_), taking into account, to the extent applicable, the legal, financial,
regulatory and other aspects of such proposal and this Agreement that the
Company Board considers relevant; _provided_ that for purposes of the
definition of Superior Proposal, the references to "15%" in the definition of
Takeover Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "50%."

 



 

(h) As used in this Agreement, " _Company Intervening Event_ " means any fact,
circumstance, effect, change, event, occurrence or development that (1) is
unknown to or by the Company Board as of the date hereof (or if known, the

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, but subject to the
other terms and conditions of this _Section 5.4, _Parent and Merger Sub agree
to take promptly any and all steps necessary to avoid, eliminate or resolve
each and every impediment and obtain all clearances, consents, approvals and

(e) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, but subject to the
other terms and conditions of this _Section 5.4_, in the event that any

Merger Sub shall, nor shall they permit their respective Subsidiaries to,

Transactions, or would reasonably be expected to

 



      
 

 



 

materially prevent or prohibit or impede, interfere with or delay obtaining

undertakings, terms, conditions, liabilities, obligations, commitments,
sanctions or other measures shall not constitute or be taken into account in

extent such undertakings, terms, conditions, liabilities, obligations,
commitments, sanctions or other measures are described in _Section 1.7_.

 



 

(h) Parent shall promptly notify the Company and the Company shall notify

issuing, and give each other the opportunity to review and comment upon, any
press release or other public statements with respect to the Transactions and
shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior
to such consultation, except as such party may reasonably conclude may be
required by applicable Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any
listing agreement with any national securities exchange or national securities
quotation system (and then only after as much advance notice and consultation
as is feasible); _provided, however_ , that the restrictions set forth in this

 **Section 5.6** **_Access to Information; Confidentiality_**.

 



 

(a) From the date hereof until the earlier of the Effective Time or the date
on which this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, the
Company shall afford to the Parent and its Representatives reasonable access
(at Parents sole cost and expense) during normal business hours and upon
reasonable advance notice to the Companys properties (but excluding for the
conduct of Phase I or Phase II environmental assessments or testing), books,
Contracts and records and the Company shall furnish promptly to the other
party such information concerning its business and properties as such party
may reasonably request (other than any publicly available document filed by it
pursuant to the requirements of federal or state securities Laws); _provided_
that the Parent and its Representatives shall conduct any such activities in
such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the business or operations
of the other party; _provided, further_ , (x) that the Company shall not be
obligated to provide such access or information if the Company determines, in
its reasonable judgment, that doing so would violate applicable Law or a
Contract or obligation of confidentiality owing to a third party, jeopardize
the protection of the attorney-client privilege, or expose such party to risk
of liability for disclosure of sensitive or personal information (provided
that the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to provide such access
or information (or as much of it as possible) in a manner that does not result
in the events set out in this clause (x)), and (y) the conduct of such
activities shall be subject to the rights and obligations of the Company
referred to in the final proviso of the final sentence of _Section 5.4(c)_
hereof. Until the Effective Time, the information provided will be subject to
the terms of the confidentiality letter agreement, dated as of October 2,
2015, between Parent and the Company (as it may be amended from time to time,
the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

 



 

(b) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 7.1_, the
Confidentiality Agreement shall automatically be deemed to be amended and
restated such that (i) the "Restricted Period" for all purposes of the
Confidentiality Agreement shall be the period of eighteen (18) months from the
date of such termination, as if the Parties had never entered into this
Agreement, and (ii) the other provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement
shall remain in force and effect for a period of two (2) years after such
termination, as if the parties hereto had never entered into this Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 5.7** **_Takeover Laws_**. If any Takeover Statute or similar
statute or regulation becomes applicable to the Transactions, the Company and
the Company Board will use reasonable best efforts to ensure that such
Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such
statute or regulation on the Transactions.

 



 

 **Section 5.8** **_Indemnification and Insurance_**.

 



 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, (i) indemnify, defend and hold harmless each current
and former director, officer and employee of the Company and any of its
Subsidiaries and each person who served as a director, officer, member,
trustee or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership, joint venture,
trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise if such service
was at the request or for the benefit of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (each, an " _Indemnitee_ " and, collectively, the " _Indemnitees_
") against all claims, liabilities, losses, damages, judgments, fines,
penalties, costs (including amounts paid in settlement or compromise) and
expenses

 



      
 

 



 

(including fees and expenses of legal counsel) in connection with any actual
or threatened claim, suit, action, proceeding or investigation (whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative) (each, a " _Claim_ "), whenever
asserted, arising out of, relating to or in connection with any action or
omission relating to their position with the Company or its Subsidiaries
occurring or alleged to have occurred before or at the Effective Time
(including any Claim relating in whole or in part to this Agreement or the
Transactions), to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law and (ii)
assume all obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Indemnitees
in respect of limitation of liability, exculpation, indemnification and
advancement of expenses as provided in (A) the Company Charter Documents and
the respective organizational documents of each of the Companys Subsidiaries
as currently in effect and (B) any indemnification agreements with an
Indemnitee (but only to the extent such indemnification agreement was made
available to Parent prior to the date hereof), which shall in each case
survive the Transactions and continue in full force and effect to the extent
permitted by applicable Law.

 



 

(b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, pay and advance to an Indemnitee any expenses
(including fees and expenses of legal counsel) in connection with any Claim
relating to any acts or omissions covered under this _Section 5.8_ or the
enforcement of an Indemnitees rights under this _Section 5.8_ as and when
incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, _provided_ that
the person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking in accordance
with applicable Law to repay such expenses if it is ultimately determined by a
court of competent jurisdiction that such Indemnitee is not entitled to
indemnification for such matter (but only to the extent such repayment is
required by applicable Law, the Company Charter Documents, applicable
organizational documents of Subsidiaries of the Company or applicable
indemnification agreements).

 



 

(c) For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
to be maintained in effect coverage not materially less favorable than the
coverage provided by the policies of directors and officers liability
insurance and fiduciary liability insurance in effect as of the date hereof
maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to matters arising
on or before the Effective Time either through the Companys existing
insurance provider or another provider reasonably selected by Parent;
_provided, however_ , that, after the Effective Time, Parent shall not be
required to pay annual premiums in excess of 300% of the annual premium
currently paid by the Company in respect of the coverages required to be
obtained pursuant hereto, but in such case shall purchase as much coverage as
reasonably practicable for such amount; _provided, further_ , that in lieu of
the foregoing insurance coverage, the Company may purchase "tail" insurance
coverage, at a cost no greater than the aggregate amount which Parent would be
required to spend during the sixyear period provided for in this _Section
5.8(c)_, that provides coverage not materially less favorable than the
coverage described above to the insured persons than the directors and
officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance coverage
currently maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the date hereof
with respect to matters arising on or before the Effective Time.

 



 

(d) The provisions of this _Section 5.8_ are (i) intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs and
his or her representatives from and after the Effective Time, and (ii) in
addition to, and not in substitution for or limitation of, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have by contract or

 



      
 

 



 

otherwise. The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this
_Section 5.8_ shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to
adversely affect the rights of any Indemnitee to whom this _Section 5.8_
applies unless (A) such termination or modification is required by applicable
Law or (B) the affected Indemnitee shall have consented in writing to such
termination or modification (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnitees to
whom this _Section 5.8_ applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this
_Section 5.8_).

 



 

(e) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent
and the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the obligations thereof set
forth in this _Section 5.8_.

 



 

 **Section 5.9** **_Transaction Litigation_**. Each of Parent and the Company
shall notify the other promptly of the commencement of any shareholder
litigation relating to this Agreement or the Transactions of which it has
received notice (" _Transaction Litigation_ "). The Company shall give Parent
the opportunity to participate in, but not control, the defense or settlement
of any shareholder litigation against the Company or any of its directors or
officers relating to this Agreement or the Transactions, and no such
settlement of any shareholder litigation shall be agreed to by the Company or
any of its Representatives without Parents prior written consent, such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 



 

 **Section 5.10** **_Section 16_**. Prior to the Effective Time, each of the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall take all such steps reasonably necessary
to cause any dispositions of Company Common Stock (including derivative
securities with respect to Company Common Stock) directly resulting from the

Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company immediately
prior to the Effective Time to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under
the Exchange Act.

 



 

 **Section 5.11** **_Employee Matters_**.

 



 

(a) Until the later of twelve (12) months from the Closing Date or December
31, 2017 (the " _Continuation Period_ "), Parent shall provide, or shall cause
to be provided, to each individual who is employed by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries)
immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a " _Company Employee_ "),
annual base salary and base wages, annual target bonus opportunities (based on
target amounts calculated as an applicable percentage of annual base salary
for the bonus opportunities established for the most recent Company fiscal
year commencing before the Effective Time), and the target value (based on
target amounts calculated as an applicable percentage of annual base salary)
of the annual Company Performance Share Award granted during the most recent
Company fiscal year commencing before the Effective Time (without taking into
account any discount to the value of Company Stock for purposes of applying
such target value to a long-term incentive compensation opportunity granted by
Parent) (the " _LTIP Target Amount_ "), provided that the LTIP Target Amount
may be paid in cash rather than granted in equity, and aggregate employee
benefits, in each case, that are no less favorable than such annual base
salary and base wages, annual target bonus opportunities, LTIP Target Amounts
and

 



      
 

 



 

aggregate employee benefits provided to the Company Employees immediately
prior to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary and without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide
any Company Employee whose employment terminates following the Effective Time
and during the applicable protected period, as described on _Section 5.11(b)_
of the Company Disclosure Schedule, either without "Cause" or for "Good
Reason," in each case as defined on _Section 5.11(a)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, with severance benefits no less favorable than as set
forth on _Section 5.11(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

 



 

(b) For all purposes (including purposes of vesting, eligibility to
participate and level of benefits, but not for purposes of defined benefit
pension plan accrual or, for the avoidance of doubt, with respect to the
vesting or restoration of any otherwise forfeited benefits accrued prior to
the Effective Time under a defined benefit pension plan maintained by Parent
or its Subsidiaries (except as required by Law)) under the employee benefit
plans of Parent and its Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Company
Employee after the Effective Time (including the Company Plans) (the " _New
Plans_ "), each Company Employee shall be credited with his or her years of
service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective
predecessors before the Effective Time, to the same extent as such Company
Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such service
under any Company Plan in which such Company Employee participated or was
eligible to participate immediately prior to the Effective Time, _provided_
that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent that its application would
result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of
service. Furthermore, to the extent a Company Employee or a "Company Retired
Employee" (as defined below) becomes eligible to participant in Parents
retiree medical plan, for all purposes (including purposes of vesting,
eligibility to participate and level of benefits) under the retiree medical
plan of Parent and its Subsidiaries, each (x) Company Employee and (y) former
employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries whose employment with the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries ended as a result of such former employees
retirement and who is eligible to participate in the Companys retiree medical
plan as of the Effective Time (the " _Company Retired Employees_ "), shall be
credited with his or her years of service with the Company and its
Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors before the Effective Time, to
the same extent as such Company Employee or Company Retired Employee was
entitled, immediately before the Effective Time, to credit for such service
under the Companys retiree medical plan as of the Effective Time. Parent
shall, or shall cause an Affiliate to, provide post-retirement medical
benefits to Eligible Retirees (as defined below) that are no less favorable
than those provided (i) under the Companys post-retirement medical program in
effect as of January 1, 2016 (the "Companys Retiree Health Plan") or (ii) to
similarly situated, as applicable, employees and retirees who participate in
the post-retirement programs of Parent or its Subsidiaries (other than the
Surviving Corporation). "Eligible Retirees" means Company Retired Employees
and Company Employees who are or become eligible to participant in the
Companys Retiree Health Plan as in effect on January 1, 2016. In addition,
and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) each Company
Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting
time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan is
replacing comparable coverage under a Company Plan in which such Company
Employee participated immediately before the Effective Time (such plans,
collectively, the " _Old Plans_ "), and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan
providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any
Company Employee, Parent shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and
actively-at-work

 



      
 

 



 

requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such Company Employee and his
or her covered dependents, to the extent such conditions were inapplicable or
waived under the comparable Old Plans of the Company or its Subsidiaries in
which such Company Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective
Time. Parent shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by any Company
Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year
of the Old Plan ending on the date such Company Employees participation in
the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan
for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-
pocket requirements applicable to such Company Employee and his or her covered
dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in
accordance with such New Plan.

 



 

(c) Without limiting the generality of _Section 5.11(a)_, from and after the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to assume, honor, and continue all obligations under the Company
Plans and compensation and severance arrangements and agreements in accordance
with their terms as in effect immediately before the Effective Time and the
Transactions shall be deemed to constitute a "change in control," "change of
control", "corporate transaction" or similar words to such effect under such
Company Plans, arrangements or agreements.

 



 

(d) At the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay
to each Company Employee and each Applicable Retired Company Employee a pro-
rata portion of any bonus that such Company Employee or Applicable Retired
Company Employee would have been entitled to receive under the Companys
Annual Incentive Plans and any other applicable annual bonus plan for the
performance period during which the Effective Time occurs, consistent with
past practice and based on achievement of applicable performance criteria at
target level. In addition, to the extent that the Effective Time occurs within
2.5 months following the end of a performance period with respect to the
Annual Incentive Plans or any other applicable annual bonus plan, but prior to
payment of the bonuses for such completed performance, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to pay to each Company Employee, and to each Applicable
Retired Company Employee on a prorated basis consistent with past practice,
the greater of (i) the Company Employees or Applicable Retired Company
Employees, as applicable, target bonus for such performance period and (ii)
the bonus to which the Company Employee or Applicable Retired Company
Employee, as applicable, would be entitled for such performance period based
on actual performance.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the provisions of this
_Section 5.11_ are solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement,
and no provision of this _Section 5.11_ is intended to, or shall, constitute
the establishment or adoption of or an amendment to any Company Plans for
purposes of ERISA or otherwise and no Company Employee or any other individual
associated therewith shall be regarded for any purpose as a third-party
beneficiary of this Agreement or have the right to enforce the provisions
hereof including in respect of continued employment (or resumed employment).
Nothing contained herein shall alter the at-will employment relationship of
any Company Employee.

 



 

(f) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing provisions of this
_Section 5.11_, the parties hereby agree to take the additional actions set
forth in _Section 5.11(f)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

Sub shall not engage in any activity of any nature except for activities
related to or in furtherance of the Transactions.

 



 

 **Section 5.13** **_No Control of Other Party s Business_**. Nothing
contained in this Agreement is intended to give Parent or Merger Sub, directly
or indirectly, the right to control or direct the Companys or its
Subsidiaries operations prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective
Time, the Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its and its
Subsidiaries respective operations.

 



 

 **Section 5.14** **_Financing Cooperation_**.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement
(including this _Section 5.14_): (i) nothing in this Agreement (including
this _Section 5.14_) shall require any such cooperation to the extent that it
would (1) require the Company to pay any commitment or other fees, reimburse
any expenses or otherwise incur any liabilities or give any indemnities prior
to the Closing, (2) unreasonably interfere with the ongoing business or
operations of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries of the Company, (3)

relating to the Company and required by the Financing), or (6) require the
Company, any of the Subsidiaries of the Company or any of their respective
boards of directors (or equivalent bodies) to approve or authorize the
Financing, and (ii) no action, liability or obligation (including any
obligation to pay any commitment or other fees or reimburse any expenses) of

such later date shall then, for all purposes under this Agreement, be the "End
Date"); _provided_ , _further_ , that neither the Company nor Parent may
terminate this Agreement or extend the End Date pursuant to this _Section
7.1(b)(i)_ if it (or, in the case of Parent, Merger Sub) is in breach of any
of its covenants or agreements and such breach has primarily caused or

obligations to consummate the Closing set forth in _Article VI_ prior to the
End Date or (2) the failure of the Closing to have occurred prior to the End
Date;

 



 

(ii) if any Law having the effect set forth in _Section 6.1(c)_ shall not
have been reversed, stayed, enjoined, set aside, annulled or suspended and

however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section

perform any of its obligations under this Agreement, including under _Section
5.4_:

Shareholders Meeting duly convened (unless such Company Shareholders Meeting
has been adjourned, in which case at the final adjournment thereof); or

 



 

(c) by Parent:

 



 

(i) if the Company shall have breached or failed to perform any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A) would give rise to the
failure of a condition set forth in _Section 6.2(a)_ or _Section 6.2(b)_,
respectively, and (B) cannot be cured by the Company by the End Date or, if
capable of being cured, shall not have been cured within thirty (30) calendar
days following receipt of written notice from the Parent stating the Parents
intention to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1(c)(i)_
and the basis for such termination; _provided_ that Parent shall not have the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1(c)(i)_ if it
or Merger Sub is then in material breach of any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or other agreements hereunder; or

 



 

(ii) if the Company Board (or a duly authorized committee thereof) shall have
effected a Company Adverse Recommendation Change; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Parent shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement under this
_Section 7.1(c)(ii)_ if the Company Shareholder Approval shall have been
obtained; or

 



      
 

 



 

(d) by the Company:

 



 

(i) if Parent or Merger Sub shall have breached or failed to perform any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A) would give rise to the
failure of a condition set forth in _Section 6.3(a)_ or _Section 6.3(b)_,
respectively, and (B) cannot be cured by Parent or Merger Sub by the End Date
or, if capable of being cured, shall not have been cured within thirty (30)
calendar days following receipt of written notice from the Company stating the
Companys intention to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
7.1(d)(i)_ and the basis for such termination; _provided_ that, Company shall
not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
7.1(d)(i)_ if it is then in material breach of any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or other agreements hereunder; or

 



 

(ii) prior to the receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval, if the Company
Board shall have effected a Company Adverse Recommendation Change with respect
to a Superior Proposal in accordance with _Section 5.3_ and shall have
approved, and concurrently with the termination hereunder, the Company shall
have entered into, a Company Acquisition Agreement providing for the
implementation of such Superior Proposal; _provided_ that such termination
pursuant to this _Section 7.1(d)(ii)_ shall not be effective and the Company
shall not enter into any such Company Acquisition Agreement, unless the
Company has paid the Company Termination Fee to Parent or causes the Company
Termination Fee to be paid to Parent substantially concurrently with such
termination in accordance with _Section 7.3_; ( _provided_ that Parent shall
have provided wiring instructions for such payment or, if not, then such
payment shall be paid promptly following delivery of such instructions).

 



 

 **Section 7.2** **_Effect of Termination_**. In the event of the termination
of this Agreement as provided in _Section 7.1_, written notice thereof shall
be given to the other party or parties, specifying the provision hereof
pursuant to which such termination is made, and this Agreement shall forthwith
become null and void and have no further force or effect (other than _Section
5.6(b)_, _Section 7.2_ and _Section 7.3_, and _Article VIII_, all of which
shall survive termination of this Agreement), and there shall be no liability
on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company or their respective
directors, officers, other Representatives or Affiliates, whether arising
before or after such termination, based on, arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the negotiation, execution, performance or subject matter hereof
(whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, or whether at law (including at
common law or by statute) or in equity); _provided, however_ , that, subject
to _Section 7.3_ (including the limitations on liability contained therein),
no party shall be relieved or released from any liabilities or damages arising
out of any willful and material breach of this Agreement prior to such
termination that gave rise to the failure of a condition set forth in _Article
VI_. The Confidentiality Agreement shall survive in accordance with its terms
following termination of this Agreement. Without limiting the meaning of a
willful and material breach, the parties acknowledge and agree that any
failure by a party hereto to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby after the applicable conditions to the Closing set forth
in _Article VI_ have been satisfied or waived (except for those conditions
that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, which conditions
would be capable of being satisfied at the time of such failure to consummate
the Merger) shall constitute a willful and material breach of this Agreement.

that regardless of whether the Company pays or is obligated to pay the Company
Termination Fee, nothing in this _Section 7.3(f)_ shall release the Company
from liability for a willful and material breach of this Agreement. In no
event shall Parent be required to pay the Parent Termination Fee on more than
one occasion. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
parties agree that if this Agreement is terminated under circumstances in
which Parent is obligated to pay the Parent Termination Fee under this
_Section 7.3_ and the Parent Termination Fee is paid, the payment of the
Parent Termination Fee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy available to the
Company with respect to this Agreement and the Transactions, and, upon payment
of the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to this _Section 7.3_, Parent, Merger

 **Section 8.8** **_Governing Law; Jurisdiction_**.

that every such suit, action or proceeding shall be brought, heard and

(provided that, in the event subject matter jurisdiction is unavailable in or

 **Section 8.9** **_Specific Enforcement_**.

 



 

(a) The parties agree that immediate, extensive and irreparable damage would
occur for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy in the event

agree that, if for any reason Parent, Merger Sub or the Company shall have
failed to perform its obligations under this Agreement or otherwise breached

relief without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of money damages as a
remedy, and the parties further agree to waive any requirement for the
securing or posting of any bond in connection with the obtaining of any such
injunctive or other equitable relief, this being in addition to and not in
limitation of any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity.
If any party hereto brings any Claim to enforce specifically the performance
of the terms and provisions of this Agreement when expressly available to such
party pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, then, notwithstanding anything
to the contrary herein, the End Date shall automatically be extended by the
