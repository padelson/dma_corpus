Section 2.5 _Determination of Purchase Price Adjustment_. The
Parties recognize the Estimated Closing Statement is being delivered to Parent
prior to the Closing Date and therefore the estimated amount of Cash, Working
Capital, Indebtedness and Transaction Expenses included therein may be
different than the actual amount of such items were the determination of such
items to occur on the Closing Date. Accordingly, this _Section 2.5_  sets
forth the process by which such estimates may be adjusted; _provided_ that, in
order to ensure that the adjustment of any such estimated item reflects an
adjustment only between the estimate thereof and the actual amount thereof,
each of Cash, Working Capital, Indebtedness and Transaction Expenses shall be
finally and solely determined by applying the Company Accounting
Principles (i.e., no accounting methods, policies, principles, practices,
procedures, classifications, judgments or estimation
methodologies inconsistent with the Company Accounting Principles may be used
by Parent (or, if applicable, the Accounting Firm) in calculating any such
items, as the sole purpose of the purchase price adjustment is to measure the
difference, if any, between the estimate of an item and the actual amount of
such item).

  



  

(a)  No later than 45 calendar days after the Closing Date,
Parent shall deliver to Representative a statement (" _Closing Statement_ ")
setting forth in reasonable detail Parent\'s good faith calculation of the
following items (each, a " _Closing Item_ "): (i) Cash (as finally determined
pursuant to this _Section 2.5_ , " _Final Cash_ "), (ii) Working Capital (as
finally determined pursuant to this _Section 2.5_ , " _Final Working Capital_
"), (iii) the aggregate amount of Indebtedness (as finally determined
pursuant to this _Section 2.5_ , " _Final Indebtedness_ "), (iv) the
aggregate amount of Transaction Expenses (as finally determined pursuant to
this _Section 2.5_ , " _Final Transaction Expenses_ ") and (v) the resulting
calculation of the Final Purchase Price.

  



  

(b)  From and after Representative\'s receipt of the Closing
Statement until the Closing Items are finally determined pursuant to this
_Section 2.5_ , Representative, its Affiliates and their respective Agents
shall be permitted reasonable access to the Surviving Corporation, its
subsidiaries and their auditors, accountants, personnel, books and records and
any other documents or information reasonably requested by Representative or
such Agents (including the information, data and work papers used by
auditors or accountants that assisted in the preparation of the Closing
Items).

  



   

15

 



    

  

(c)  Representative shall have 30 calendar days after its
receipt of the Closing Statement (" _Review Period_ ") during which to review
Parent\'s calculation of the Closing Items. If Representative disputes any of
the Closing Items, Representative shall notify Parent in writing of its
objection to such Closing Items within the Review Period, together with a
description of the basis for and dollar amount of such disputed items (to the
extent reasonably possible) (a " _Dispute Notice_ "). The Closing Items, as
set forth in the Closing Statement, shall become final, conclusive and binding
on the Parties unless Representative delivers to Parent a Dispute Notice
within the Review Period. If Representative delivers a Dispute Notice, any
amounts on the Closing Statement not objected to by Representative in the
Dispute Notice shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Parties, and
Parent and Representative shall, within 30 calendar days following Parent\'s
receipt of such Dispute Notice (" _Resolution Period_ "), attempt in good
faith to resolve their differences with respect to the matters set forth in
the Dispute Notice and any such written resolution shall be final, conclusive
and binding on the Parties. If, at the conclusion of the Resolution Period,
any amounts remain in dispute, then each of Parent and Representative shall
submit all items remaining in dispute to a nationally or regionally
recognized accounting firm mutually acceptable to Parent and Representative
(" _Accounting Firm_ ") for resolution by delivering within 10 calendar days
after the expiration of the Resolution Period to Accounting Firm their written
position with respect to such items remaining in dispute. The fees and
expenses of Accounting Firm pursuant to this _Section 2.5(c)_ shall be
divided equally between Parent and Representative (it being understood that
Representative shall be entitled to pay all such fees out of the Expense
Holdback Amount). Accounting Firm shall determine, based solely on the
submissions by Representative and Parent, and not by independent review, only
those issues set forth in the Dispute Notice that remain in dispute and shall
determine a value for any such disputed item which is equal to or between the
final values proposed by Parent and Representative in their
respective submissions. Parent and Representative shall request that
Accounting Firm make a decision with respect to all disputed items within 10
business days after the submissions of Parent and Representative, and in any
event as promptly as practicable. The final determination with respect to all
disputed items shall be set forth in a written statement by Accounting Firm
delivered to Parent and Representative and shall be final, conclusive and
binding on Parent and Representative. Parent and Representative shall promptly
execute any reasonable engagement letter requested by Accounting Firm and
shall each cooperate fully with Accounting Firm, including by providing
the information, data and work papers used by each Party or Representative to
prepare or calculate the Closing Items, making its personnel and accountants
available to explain any such information, data or work papers, so as to
enable Accounting Firm to make such determination as quickly and as
accurately as practicable.

  



  

(d)  If the Final Purchase Price is greater than the Initial
Purchase Price (such excess amount, " _Excess Amount_ "), then, within two
business days after the Final Purchase Price is finally determined pursuant to
this _Section 2.5_ , Parent shall pay the Paying Agent, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account of Paying Agent, an aggregate
amount equal to the Excess Amount and instruct the Paying Agent to pay to
Equityholders the aggregate portion of the Excess Amount that such
Equityholders are entitled in accordance with _Section 2.5(f)_. Upon such
payment of the Excess Amount by Parent, Parent and Representative shall
jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to disburse to the Paying Agent (for further
payment to the Equityholders pursuant to _Section 2.5_ ), by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account of the Paying Agent, an
aggregate amount equal to the Adjustment Escrow Amount.

  



  

(e)  If the Final Purchase Price is less than the Initial
Purchase Price (such shortfall amount, " _Shortfall Amount_ "), Parent and
Representative shall, within two business days after the Final Purchase Price
is finally determined pursuant to this  _Section 2.5_ , jointly instruct the
Escrow Agent to disburse from the Adjustment Escrow Amount to Parent, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the account of Parent, an amount
equal to the lesser of the Shortfall Amount and the Adjustment Escrow Amount
(it being understood that in no event shall Parent be entitled to any amount
pursuant to this _Section 2.5(e)_  in excess of the Adjustment Escrow
Amount). If the Shortfall Amount is less than the Adjustment Escrow Amount
(such difference, the " _Remaining Escrow Amount_ "), then Parent and
Representative shall, within two business days after the Final Purchase Price
is finally determined pursuant to this _Section 2.5_ , jointly instruct the
Escrow Agent to disburse the Remaining Escrow Amount to Equityholders
pursuant to _Section 2.5(f)_. Unless Representative determines otherwise, on
the 18-month anniversary of the Closing Date, Representative shall pay to the
Paying Agent (for further payment to Equityholders pursuant to
_Section 2.5(f)_ ) an aggregate amount equal to the remaining Expense
Holdback Amount.

  



   

16

 



    

  

(f)  All amounts payable to the Equityholders pursuant to this
_Section 2.5_ shall be allocated among and paid to the Equityholders, without
interest, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
Equityholders\' accounts set forth in the Funds Flow, as if such amounts had
been included in the Closing Merger Consideration; _provided_ that, any
amounts payable to Option Holders shall be paid to the Operating Company and
the Operating Company shall pay such amounts to the Option Holders net of the
applicable withholding amount pursuant to _Section 2.4_ , in each case, as
determined by Representative and the Operating Company, and such applicable
withholding amount shall be paid by the Operating Company to the applicable
Governmental Entities in accordance with applicable Law.

  



  

(g)  Any payments made pursuant to this _Section 2.5_ shall be
deemed an adjustment to the Final Purchase Price.

  



  

Section 2.6 _Notice to Stockholders and Option Holders_. The
Company shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date hereof,
deliver to Stockholders by email or through the Paying Agent\'s online web
portal (a) notice in accordance with applicable law notifying Stockholders of:

The Company shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date

to do business in good standing in each jurisdiction where the conduct of the
business of, or the character of the assets and properties owned, leased, or
operated by, the Company or such Company Subsidiary, as the case may be,
requires such qualification, except in such jurisdictions where the failure to
be so qualified would not have a Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

(c)  SPV was formed solely for the purpose of owning equity
interests in the Company and except as set forth on _Schedule 3.1(c)_ , has
not engaged in any business activities or conducted any operations, has not
had any employees and has not incurred liabilities or obligations of any

(d)  The Company and Representative have delivered (i) duly
executed copies of consents of the managing member of SPV and all of the

transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. This Agreement and the
execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement and each
of the Ancillary Documents to which it is party has been approved by the board
of directors of the Company in accordance with applicable Law, and this

matters and are fully capable of evaluating the merits and risks of its
investment in such shares. Parent can bear the economic risk of its

the 2016 Unaudited Financial Statements and cash generated from operations by
the Company thereafter if the Company is also in compliance with
_subsection (x)_ as to collection of receivables and payment of payables or
pay any Transaction Expenses or Indebtedness, in each case, prior to the
Adjustment Time. For purposes of clarity, compliance by the Company Group with
the various restrictions set forth in _Sections 5.1(a)(i)_ through _(a)(xiv)_
shall not be deemed to be a breach of any of the affirmative obligations
set forth in the first sentence of _Section 5.1(a)_.

  



   

39

 



    

  

(b)   _Reasonable Best Efforts_. Subject to the terms and
conditions set forth herein, and to applicable legal requirements, the
Parties shall cooperate and use their respective reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, and do, or cause to be
done, and assist and cooperate with each other in doing, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious
manner practicable, the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Section 2.7_. The Company and
Representative shall take all actions necessary to consummate the SPV Merger
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

(c)   _Exclusivity_. From the date hereof until the earlier of
(i) the date this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Article VII_ and (ii)
the Closing Date, the Company Group shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates
and direct its Agent to not, directly or indirectly: (i) encourage, solicit,
initiate, facilitate or continue inquiries regarding an Acquisition Proposal;
(ii) enter into discussions or negotiations with, or provide any information
to, any Person concerning a possible Acquisition Proposal; or (iii) enter
into any agreements or other instruments (whether or not binding) regarding an
Acquisition Proposal. The Company Group shall immediately cease and cause to
be terminated, and shall direct its Agents and cause its Affiliates to
immediately cease and cause to be terminated, all existing discussions or
negotiations with any Persons conducted heretofore with respect to, or
that could lead to, an Acquisition Proposal. For purposes hereof, "
_Acquisition Proposal_ " shall mean any inquiry, proposal or offer from any
Person (other than Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates) concerning
(i) a merger, consolidation, liquidation, recapitalization, share exchange or
other business combination transaction involving the Company or either Company
Subsidiary; (ii) the issuance or acquisition of shares of capital stock or
other equity securities of the Company or either Company Subsidiary; or (iii)
the sale, lease, exchange or other disposition of any significant portion of
the Company Group\'s properties or assets, in each case, other than in
respect of the transactions contemplated hereby or by the Ancillary Documents.
The Company Group agrees that the rights and remedies for noncompliance with
this _Section 5.1(c)_ shall include having such provision
specifically enforced by any court having equity jurisdiction, it being
acknowledged and agreed that any such breach or threatened breach shall cause
irreparable injury to Parent and that money damages would not provide an
adequate remedy to Parent.

  



  

(d)   _Access to Information_. From the date hereof until the
earlier of (i) the date this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Article
VII_ and (ii) the Closing Date, the Company shall grant to Parent and its
authorized Agents reasonable access, during normal business hours and upon
reasonable notice, to senior management, the properties and the books and
records of the Company Group; _provided_ that (A) such access does not
unreasonably interfere with the normal operations of the Company Group, (B)
all requests for access shall be directed to William Blair and Company, L.L.C.
or Financial Technology Partners LP and FTP Securities LLC or such other
Persons designated by the Company in writing and (C) nothing herein shall
require the Company Group to provide access to, or to disclose any
information to, Parent or any other Person if such access or disclosure (1)
would be in violation of applicable laws or regulations of any Governmental
Entity (including Antitrust Laws), (2) would be a violation or constitute a
breach of any provision of any Contract to which the Company or any Company
Subsidiary is a party or (3) could jeopardize any attorney/client privilege
(provided that the Company shall, to the extent reasonably feasible, advise
Parent in writing of the subject matter of any information the Company is not
furnishing to Parent pursuant to the foregoing and shall to the
extent reasonably feasible enter into arrangements with Parent to allow
Parent access to such information).

  



   

40

 



    

  

(e)   _Communications_. Prior to the Closing, Parent and John
Shagoury, the president and chief executive officer of the Company (or his
successor in the event of death or disability), will coordinate and mutually
agree upon a communications plan in respect of the employees, customers and
other material business relations of the Company Group and in accordance
therewith Parent and its Agents will be provided with reasonable access to
such Persons; provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, nothing herein is
intended to prohibit Parent and its Agents from communicating with, or
engaging in business with, any customers or suppliers that are also customers
or suppliers of the Company Group so long as such communication is in the
Ordinary Course of Business and unrelated to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

  



  

(f)  With respect to the matter set forth on _Schedule 6.2(a)_
, the Company covenants and agrees that, during the period from the date of
this Agreement until the Closing, the Company shall (i) promptly notify Parent
of each substantive communication made to or received by the Company Group
from the claimant in such matter, each pleading or filing with or submission
to any Governmental Entity by the claimant or the Company Group and any
communication received by the Company Group from any Governmental Entity
with respect to such matter; (ii) permit Parent to review in advance each
proposed material written communication by the Company Group to the claimant
and each proposed pleading or filing with or submission to any Governmental
Entity by the Company Group with respect to the matter and incorporate
reasonable comments of Parent thereto; (iii) not admit any liability with
respect to such matter without the prior written consent of Parent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); and
(iv) not, without the prior written consent of the Parent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), consent to a
settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, such matter that (A)
does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant
to the Company Group of a complete release from all liability in respect of
such matter, (B) includes any relief (including any amendment of any
restrictive covenant to which the claimant is a party) other than (x) payment
of a monetary amount that is paid by the Company Group prior to Closing or, if
payable after Closing, the Company agrees at or prior to Closing to reduce
the Closing Merger Consideration otherwise payable to Equityholders hereunder
by such payment or (y) in respect of confidentiality (except for disclosure
required by law) and a release by the Company Group of claims
against claimant in respect of such matter, or (C) includes a finding or
admission of any violation of Law or any violation of the rights of any
Person by the Company Group or any employee of the Company Group.

  



  

Section 5.2 _Confidentiality_. Subject to _Section 5.5_ , each
of the Company (on behalf of itself, the Company Subsidiaries and their
respective Agents) and Parent (on behalf of itself, Merger Sub and their
respective Agents) acknowledges that it remains bound by the provisions
of the Confidentiality Agreement by and between the Company and Parent, dated
November 8, 2016 (" _Confidentiality Agreement_ ") until the Closing, at
which time the Confidentiality Agreement will terminate and be of no further
force and effect. The terms of the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive
the termination of this Agreement and continue in full force and effect
thereafter for the two years from the date of termination of this Agreement;
provided, however, nothing therein shall be deemed to limit disclosures in
connection with legal proceedings between the Parties, including to the extent
necessary to enforce the Parties\' rights hereunder.

  



  

Section 5.3 _Antitrust Laws_.

  



  

(a)  Each of Parent and the Company shall (i) as promptly as
practicable, but in no event later than three business days after the date
hereof, take all actions necessary to file or cause to be filed any filings
required of it or any of its Affiliates under any applicable Antitrust Laws
in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Notification and Report Forms required pursuant to the HSR Act
(and, in connection therewith, request early termination); (ii) use
reasonable best efforts to take all actions necessary to obtain the required
consents from Antitrust Authorities and (iii) at the earliest practicable
date, comply with any formal or informal written request for additional non-
privileged information or non-privileged documentary material received by it
or any of its Affiliates from any Antitrust Authority. Subject to applicable
Law, each of Parent and the Company will: (A) promptly notify each other of
any written communication made to or received by Parent or the Company, as
the case may be, from any Antitrust Authority regarding any of the
transactions contemplated hereby; (B) permit each other to review in advance
any proposed written communication to any such Antitrust Authority and
incorporate reasonable comments thereto; (C) not agree to participate in any
substantive meeting or discussion with any such Antitrust Authority in respect
of any filing, investigation or inquiry concerning this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby unless, to the extent reasonably
practicable, it consults with the other Party in advance and, to the extent
permitted by such Antitrust Authority, gives the other Party the opportunity
to attend and (D) furnish each other with copies of all correspondence,
filings (other than attachments to each Party\'s Notification and Report Form
under the HSR Act) and written communications between such Party and their
Affiliates and their respective Agents, on one hand, and any such Antitrust
Authority, on the other hand, in each case, with respect to this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby.

  



   

41

 



    

  

(b)  Without limiting the foregoing, Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to avoid or eliminate any impediment under any
Antitrust Law so as to (i) enable the Parties hereto to close the transactions
contemplated hereby as promptly as possible and (ii) avoid any lawsuit by any
Governmental Entity which would otherwise have the effect of preventing or
materially delaying the Closing beyond the End Date. In furtherance of the
foregoing, Parent\'s efforts shall include (A) defending through
litigation on the merits, including appeals, any Action under any Antitrust
Law asserted against Parent in any court; (B) proposing,
negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate
Order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of such assets or
businesses of Parent, its Affiliates or the Company Group, including entering
into customary ancillary agreements on commercially reasonable terms relating
to any such sale, divestiture or disposition of such assets or businesses; (C)
agreeing to any limitation on the conduct of Parent, its Affiliates and the
Company Group; and (D) using its commercially reasonable efforts to take any
other action as may be required by a Governmental Entity in order to (1)
obtain all necessary consents, approvals and authorizations as soon as
reasonably possible, and in any event before the End Date; (2) avoid the entry
of or to have vacated, lifted, dissolved, reversed or overturned any decree,
judgment, injunction or other Order, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that is in effect as part of any lawsuit and that prohibits,
prevents or restricts consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
and (3) effect the expiration or termination of any waiting period, which
would otherwise have the effect of preventing or materially delaying the
Closing beyond the End Date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, including this  _Section 5.3_ , in no event will Parent or any of
its Affiliates be required to (x) sell, divest, lease, license,
transfer, dispose of or hold separate any portion of the assets or businesses
of Parent or any of its Affiliates or the Company Group representing, in the
aggregate, in excess of $15,000,000 of revenue generated by Parent and its
Affiliates and the Company Group on a combined basis between (and inclusive
of) January 1, 2016 and December 31, 2016, (y) agree or consent to any
restriction or limitation on the conduct of Parent, its Affiliates and the
Company Group or otherwise take or commit to take any action, including any
action that limits Parent's or any of its Affiliates' freedom of action with
respect to, or their ability to retain and operate, the businesses or the
assets of Parent and its Affiliates (including the Company Group) to the
extent such restrictions, limitations and actions, individually or in the
aggregate, would reasonably be expected to increase the costs of Parent and
its Affiliates (including the businesses and assets of the Company Group) by
over $2,000,000 in any 12-month period or to reduce the revenue of Parent and
its Affiliates (including the businesses and assets of the Company Group) by
over $15,000,000 in any 12-month period or (z) agree or consent to any
limitations or restrictions on Parent\'s ability to own, vote, transfer,
receive dividends or otherwise exercise full ownership rights with respect to
the stock of the Surviving Corporation. For the avoidance of doubt, except as
expressly set forth in the immediately preceding sentence, in no event will
Parent or any of its Affiliates be required to sell, divest, dispose of or
hold separate any portion of its or their assets or businesses or the assets
and business of the Company Group or agree to any restriction or limitation
on the conduct of Parent, its Affiliates and the Company Group or take any
action, including any action that limits in any way Parent\'s or any of its
Affiliates\' freedom of action with respect to, or their ability to
retain and operate, the assets and businesses of Parent and its Affiliates
and the assets and businesses of the Company Group. The Company Group shall
not agree or consent to the sale, divestiture or disposition of assets or
businesses of the Company Group or any limitation on the conduct of the
Company Group without the prior written consent of Parent (such consent not to
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed in accordance with the
foregoing provisions of this Section).

  



   

42

 



    

  

(c)  Subject to Parent's obligations under clause (b) above,
Parent's and the Company's obligations under this  _Section 5.3_ shall
include the obligation to cooperate and use their respective reasonable best
efforts to defend any Actions, whether judicial or administrative,
challenging the consummation of the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated hereby, including any Action under the HSR Act or pursuant to
federal or state antitrust laws; provided that the Parties shall not be
obligated to appeal or to pursue any proceedings to vacate, lift, reverse or
overturn any permanent or final Order that prohibits, prevents, or restricts
the consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby.
In the event any such Action is commenced against any member of the Company
Group, Parent shall have the right, at its own expense, to participate
therein, and the Company will not settle any such Action without the consent
of Parent, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed.

  



  

Section 5.4 _Directors\' and Officers\' Insurance_. With respect
to the ForeFront Portfolio 3.0 insurance policy, No. 8223-9803, issued by
Federal Insurance Company for the policy period of July 1, 2016-July 1, 2017
(" _Policy No. 8223-9803_ "), at or prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall purchase and maintain an extended reporting period or other similar
applicable run-off coverage provision extending coverage under the "Directors
and Officers and Entity Liability Coverage Part" and the "Fiduciary Liability
Coverage Part" of Policy No. 8223-9803 for claims made for a period of six
years after the Closing Date based on alleged wrongful acts occurring through
the Closing Date (" _Run-Off Coverage_ "); provided, however, that Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay annual premiums for any
such policy or policies in excess of 300% of the last annual premium for
Policy No. 8223-9803 paid by the Company Group prior to the date hereof. If
any future annual premiums exceed 300% of the last annual premium for the
coverage provided by Policy No. 8223-9803, then Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall remain obligated to provide and maintain the broadest amount
of coverage as may be obtained to replace such policy for an annual premium
equal to 300% of the last annual premium for Policy No. 8223-9803. Parent
shall upon receipt thereof furnish a copy of such insurance policy to
Representative to provide to each current beneficiary thereto. The
Surviving Corporation shall control in good faith all claims submitted for
coverage under the Run-Off Coverage or any replacement insurance policy;
provided that the Surviving Corporation may not settle any such claims without
the prior written consent of the Representative, which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

  



  

Section 5.5 _Press Release_. The Parties agree that (i) there
will be an initial press release with respect to the execution of this
Agreement to be mutually agreed upon and issued at a date to be mutually
agreed upon by Parent and Representative following the execution and delivery
of this Agreement, which shall be a release by Parent and (ii) there will be
press releases with respect to the closing of the transactions contemplated
hereby to be mutually agreed upon and issued promptly following the Closing by
both Parent and Representative. Nothing herein shall restrict or prohibit (A)
the Company Group from making announcements to its employees, customers and
other business relations in accordance with _Section 5.1(e)_ to the extent
such it determines in good faith that such announcement is necessary or
advisable or (B) Representative and its Affiliates from providing information
about the subject matter of this Agreement and the Company Group (including
their performance and improvements) in connection with fund raising marketing,
informational or reporting activities. Nothing herein limits any Party from
making announcements, statements or acknowledgements that such Party is
required by applicable Laws or the requirements of any national securities
exchange to make, issue or release, or limit Parent from making any
disclosures that it deems necessary or advisable to be made in filings with
the SEC.

  



   

43

 



    

  

Section 5.6 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided
in this Agreement, each Party shall be liable for and pay all of its own costs
and expenses (including attorneys\', accountants\' and investment bankers\'
fees and other out-of-pocket expenses) in connection with the negotiation and
execution of this Agreement, the performance of such Party\'s obligations
hereunder and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby;
_provided_ that, Parent shall pay (or reimburse the Company) and be fully
responsible for (a) all filing fees under the Antitrust Laws; (b) the
premiums and any other costs related to the policy providing for Run-Off
Coverage pursuant to _Section 5.4_ and any other tail policies required to be
obtained pursuant to the RandW Policy; and (c) all premiums, commitment,
diligence, underwriting and similar fees or expenses incurred with respect to
the RandW Policy.

  



  

Section 5.7 _Preservation of Records_. For a period of seven
years after the Closing Date or such other longer period as required by
applicable law, the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries shall preserve
and retain all corporate, accounting, legal, auditing, human resources and
other books and records of the Company Group (including (a) any documents
relating to any lawsuits or investigations and (b) all Tax Returns,
schedules, work papers and other material records or other documents relating
to Tax matters of the Company Group for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods) relating
to the conduct of the business and operations of the Company Group prior to
the Closing Date.

  



  

Section 5.8 _Tax Matters_. 

  



  

(a)   _Intermediary Transaction Tax Shelter_. Parent will not
take any action with respect to the Company Group that would cause the
transactions contemplated hereby to constitute part of a transaction that is
the same as, or substantially similar to, the " _Intermediary Transaction Tax
Shelter_ " described in Internal Revenue Service Notices 2001-16 and 2008-111.

  



  

(b)   _Post-Closing Actions_. Following the Closing, none of
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its or their subsidiaries or
Affiliates shall make any election under Code Sections 336(e) or 338 (or any
similar provision of local, state, or non-U.S. law) with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby. Following the Closing, none of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of its or their subsidiaries or Affiliates
shall, without the prior written consent of Representative (which written
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, it being
understood that it would be unreasonable to withhold consent if any such
action is required by applicable Tax Laws): (i) amend any Tax Return to the
extent that such Tax Return relates to the activities of the Company in any
Pre-Closing Tax Period, (ii) make or change any Tax election or Tax accounting
method or practice with respect to or that has retroactive effect to the
activities of the Company in any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Pre-Closing
Straddle Period, or (iii) initiate or participate in any voluntary disclosure
(or other communication reasonably expected to have a similar effect) with
any taxing authority with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Pre-Closing
Straddle Period; provided, in each case, however, that following (A) either
the expiration of the applicable survival period pursuant to _Section 6.1_
 or (B) if earlier, the time at which Parent or its Affiliates could no
longer make a claim against the Indemnity Escrow Amount, Parent, the
Surviving Corporation, or any of its or their subsidiaries or Affiliates may
take such action without the consent of the Representative if such action
does not adversely affect the Equityholders.

  



  

(c)   _Responsibility for Filing Tax Returns_.

  



   

44

 



    

  

(i)  Parent shall prepare and timely file or cause to be
prepared and timely filed all Tax Returns of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries for Pre-Closing Tax Periods after giving effect to any
valid extensions of the due date for filing any such Tax Returns. Such Tax
Returns will be prepared in a manner consistent with the Tax positions taken
by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries in prior years so long as such
Tax positions are in compliance with applicable Law. Such Tax Return will
treat the SPV Merger in a manner consistent with such tax treatment as set
forth in the SPV Merger Agreement. Parent will submit such Tax Returns to
Representative for review and approval at least 20 business days prior to the
due date (after giving effect to any valid extensions), which approval shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; provided, in each case,
however, that following either (A) the expiration of the applicable survival
period pursuant to _Section 6.1_ or (B) if earlier, the time at which Parent
or its Affiliates could no longer make a claim against the Indemnity Escrow
Amount, Parent, may take such action without the consent of the
Representative if such action does not adversely affect the Equityholders.
Within 10 business days after receipt thereof, Representative will give
notice to Parent of any dispute with respect to such Tax Returns. Parent and
Representative will attempt to resolve any disputes with respect thereto
within 10 business days. Any matters unresolved after such period will be
resolved using the dispute resolution procedures set forth in _Section
2.5(c)_ _mutatis mutandis_. If any dispute with respect to a Tax Return is not
resolved prior to the due date of such Tax Return, such Tax Return shall be
filed in the manner which Parent deems correct without prejudice to the
resolution of such dispute; _provided_ that, once resolution of such dispute
has been determined, such Tax Return shall be amended, if necessary, to
include the final resolution of such dispute. Transaction Tax Deductions shall
be claimed on the U.S. federal (and applicable state, local and non-U.S.) tax
returns of the Company Group for the Pre-Closing Tax Period ending on
the Closing Date to the extent such items are "more likely than not"
deductible in such Pre-Closing Tax Period. To the extent the Transaction Tax
Deductions are not fully utilized in such period, Parent shall cause the
Company Group to elect to carry back any item of loss, deduction or credit
from any Transaction Tax Deductions to prior taxable years to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law.

  



  

(ii)  Parent will prepare and file in a timely manner all Tax
Returns required to be filed by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for
any Straddle Period after giving effect to any valid extensions of the due
date for filing any such Tax Returns. Such Tax Returns will be prepared in a
manner consistent with the Tax positions taken by the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries in prior years so long as such Tax positions comply with
applicable Law. Parent will submit such Tax Returns to Representative for
review and approval at least 10 business days prior to the due date (after
giving effect to any valid extensions), which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; provided, in each case,
however, that following either (A) the expiration of the applicable survival
period pursuant to _Section 6.1_ or (B) if earlier, the time at which Parent
or its Affiliates could no longer make a claim against the Indemnity Escrow
Amount, Parent, may take such action without the consent of the
Representative if as such action does not adversely affect the Equityholders.
Within 10 business days after receipt thereof, Representative will give
notice to Parent of any dispute with respect to such Tax Returns. Parent and
Representative will attempt to resolve any disputes with respect thereto with
10 business days. Any matters unresolved after such period will be resolved
using the dispute resolution procedures set forth in _Section 2.5(c)_
_mutatis mutandis_. If any dispute with respect to a Tax Return is not
resolved prior to the due date of such Tax Return, such Tax Return shall be
filed in the manner which Parent deems correct without prejudice to the
resolution of such dispute; _provided_ that, once resolution of such dispute
has been determined, such Tax Return shall be amended, if necessary, to
include the final resolution of such dispute.

  



   

45

 



    

  

(d)   _Straddle Period Allocation_. In the case of any Taxes
based on or measured by income, gross or net sales payments or receipts, or
payroll that are payable with respect to a Straddle Period, the portion of
such Taxes attributable to the Pre-Closing Straddle Period will be determined
on the basis of a deemed closing of the books and records of the Company Group
as of the close of business on the Closing Date. In the case of any other
Taxes that are payable with respect to a Straddle Period, the portion of such
Taxes attributable to the portion of such Straddle Period ending on the
Closing Date will be equal to the product of all such Taxes multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the Pre-Closing
Straddle Period, and the denominator of which is the number of days in the
entire Straddle Period.

  



  

(e)   _Cooperation_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation,
Representative and their respective Agents will provide each other with such
cooperation and information (including copies of Tax Returns, together with
accompanying schedules, related work papers and documents relating to rulings
or other determinations by Tax authorities) as any of them reasonably may
request in connection with any Tax matters relating to the Company Group. Any
information obtained under this _Section 5.8(e)_ shall be kept
confidential except as may be otherwise necessary in connection with the
filing of Tax Returns or claims for refund or in conducting an audit or other
proceeding. Parent, the Company and Representative shall, upon request, use
their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other
document from any Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate
any Tax that could be imposed on the Company Group (including with respect to
the transaction contemplated thereby).

  



  

(f)   _Tax Claims_. Parent will promptly notify Representative
in writing of the commencement of any audit or examination of any Tax Return
for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Pre-Closing Straddle Period and any other
proposed change or adjustment, claim, dispute, arbitration or litigation in
respect of Taxes for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or Pre-Closing Straddle Period
(each, a " _Tax Claim_ "). Such notice shall describe the asserted Tax Claim
in reasonable detail and include copies of any documents received from any
taxing authority in respect of any such asserted Tax Claim. Parent shall have
the right to control any such Tax Claims, with Representative having the
right to observe such proceedings and be kept informed of all correspondence
between the parties. Parent shall not settle or otherwise compromise any such
Tax Claim without the prior written consent of Representative (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
provided, in each case, however, that following (A) the expiration of the
applicable survival period pursuant to _Section 6.1_ of this Agreement or (B)
if earlier, the time at which Parent or its Affiliates could no longer make a
claim against the Indemnity Escrow Amount, Parent may settle any Tax Claim
without the consent of the Representative if such action does not adversely
affect the Equityholders. In the event that Parent does not exercise its
right to control any such Tax Claim, Representative shall control such Tax
Claim; _provided_ , however, that Representative shall inform Parent of the
status and progress of such Tax Claim and Parent will have the opportunity to
participate in such Tax Claim at its expense. Parent shall not settle any Tax
Claim (either at the audit or examination stage or thereafter) without
first obtaining Representative\'s written consent, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, provided, in each case,
however, that following (A) the expiration of the applicable survival period
pursuant to _Section 6.1_ or (B) if earlier, the time at which Parent or its
Affiliates could no longer make a claim against the Indemnity Escrow Amount,
Parent may settle such Tax Claim without the consent of the Representative if
such action does not adversely affect the Equityholders. Representative shall
not settle any Tax Claim (either at the audit or examination stage or
thereafter) controlled by Representative without first obtaining Parent\'s
written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed.

  



  

(g)   _Payments_. The parties hereto agree to treat payments
made pursuant to this _Section 5.8_ and payments made pursuant to _Section
2.5_ as adjustments to the Final Purchase Price for all Tax purposes. The
payments to Equityholders under this Agreement with respect to their Options
are intended to satisfy the requirements of Section 409A of the Code in
accordance with the rules for certain transaction-based compensation in
Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(i)(5)(iv)(A), and the provisions of this
Agreement related to the payments to Equityholders under this Agreement with
respect to their Options shall be interpreted and administered in accordance
with such intention.

  



   

46

 



    

  

(h)   _Tax Sharing Agreements_. The Company Group shall
terminate at Closing any tax sharing agreements to which the Company Group is
a party.

  



  

Section 5.9 _Employee Compensation_. During the period beginning
on the Closing Date and ending on December 31, 2017, Parent shall cause
employees of the Operating Company who are employed at the Closing (the "
_Company Employees_ ") to be provided with base compensation that is no less
favorable in the aggregate than the base compensation provided to such
employees immediately prior to the Closing (excluding opportunities for bonus
and commission and equity-based compensation). Parent further agrees that,
from and after the Closing Date, Parent shall cause the Company Employees to
be granted credit for all service with the Operating Company (including any
predecessors of the Operating Company) earned prior to the Closing Date for
all purposes (except benefit accrual for a defined benefit pension plan)
under any compensation plan, program, policy, agreement or arrangement that is
sponsored by or may be established or maintained by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation, its subsidiaries or any of their Affiliates on or after the
Closing Date; provided, however, such service shall not be recognized to the
extent that such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits.
Nothing in this _Section 5.9_ , express or implied, shall confer upon any
Company Employee, any beneficiary, or any other Person (other than the
Parties to this Agreement) any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever
under or by reason of this _Section 5.9_. For the avoidance of doubt, and
without limiting any remedies of Parent for breach of any representations and
warranties in this Agreement, other than in respect of the matter set forth
in _Schedule 6.2(a)_ , the Company Group shall be solely responsible for any
liability or legally binding obligation that arises as a result of the

of any Company Employees following the Closing. Nothing contained herein,
express or implied: (i) shall be construed to establish, amend, or modify any
benefit plan, program, agreement, or arrangement; (ii) subject to complying
with this _Section 5.9_ , shall alter or limit the ability of the Surviving

Section 5.12 _Investigation; No Other Representations; Non-

with the business of the Company Group and understand the risks inherent

independent

  



   

47

 



    

  

investigation, verification, review and analysis of the business, operations,
properties, technology, assets, liabilities, results of operations,
financial condition, and prospects of the Company Group and Parent Persons
have had access to the personnel, properties, premises and records of the
Company Group for such purpose. In entering into this Agreement, Parent and
the other Parent Persons have relied solely upon the aforementioned
investigation, review and analysis and not on any factual representations or
opinions of the Company Group or any Stockholder or any of their respective
Agents or any other Person, except for the specific representations and
warranties expressly made by the Company in _Article III_ , in each case, as
qualified by the Schedules (" _Express Representations_ "). Parent (for
itself and on behalf of the other Parent Persons and each of the successors
and assigns of the foregoing): (a) specifically acknowledges and agrees that,
except for the Express Representations, none of the Company, either Company
Subsidiary, any Stockholder or any other Person is making and has not made
any representation or warranty, expressed or implied, at law or in equity, in
respect of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective
businesses, assets, liabilities, operations, prospects or
condition (financial or otherwise), including with respect to merchantability
or fitness for any particular purpose of any assets, the nature or extent of
any liabilities, the prospects of the business, the effectiveness or the
success of any operations, or the accuracy or completeness of any
confidential information memoranda, management presentations, projections,
documents, material or other information (financial or otherwise) regarding
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries furnished or made available to any
Parent Person in any data room, management presentation or in any other
manner or form in expectation of, or in connection with, the
transactions contemplated hereby; (b) except for the Express Representations,
specifically and irrevocably disclaims that Parent is relying upon or has
relied upon any such other representations or warranties that may have been
made by any Person and acknowledges that the Company, the Company
Subsidiaries, the Stockholders and their respective Affiliates hereby
specifically disclaim any such other representation or warranty made by any
Person; (c) specifically and irrevocably disclaims any obligation or duty by
the Company, the Company Subsidiaries, the Stockholders and their respective
Affiliates or any other Person to make any disclosures of fact not required
to be disclosed by the Express Representations; and (d) specifically
acknowledges and agrees that Parent is entering into this Agreement and
acquiring the Company and the Company Subsidiaries subject only to the Express
Representations, all of which representations shall expire and terminate as
set forth in _Article VI_. Without limiting the generality of any of
the foregoing, Parent (for itself and on behalf of the other Parent Persons
and each of the successors and assigns of the foregoing) hereby agrees that:
(i) except for the Express Representations, none of the Company, the Company
Subsidiaries, the Stockholders or any of their Affiliates or Agents makes any
representation or warranty regarding any third party beneficiary rights or
other rights which Parent or any other Parent Person might claim under any
studies, reports, tests or analyses prepared by any third parties for the
Company, the Company Subsidiaries or any of their Affiliates, even if the same
were made available for review by the Parent Persons; and (ii) none of the
documents, information or other materials provided to Parent at any time or in
any format by the Company, the Company Subsidiaries, the Stockholders or any
of their Affiliates or Agents constitutes legal advice and Parent (for itself
and on behalf of the other Parent Persons and each of the successors and
assigns of the foregoing) waives all rights to assert that it received any
legal advice therefrom or that it had any sort of attorney-client relationship
with any of such Persons.

  



  

Section 5.13 _Notification_. From the date hereof until the earlier
to occur of the Closing and the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
_Article VII_ , (a) the Company shall disclose to Parent in writing any
matter arising or discovered after the date hereof which would cause any of
the conditions set forth in _Section 2.7(a)_ or _Section 2.7(b)_ not to be
satisfied on the day the Closing is required to occur pursuant to _Section
2.3_ , and (b) Parent shall disclose to the Company in writing any matter
arising or discovered after the date hereof which would cause any of the
conditions set forth in _Section 2.7(a)_ or _Section 2.7(c)_  not to be
satisfied on the day the Closing is required to occur pursuant to _Section
2.3_. No such disclosure shall eliminate the Company\'s or Parent\'s remedies
hereunder or right, if any, to terminate this Agreement; provided, however,
that the failure to notify Parent or the Company of a breach of any
representation or warranty or covenant pursuant to this _Section 5.13_  shall
not be deemed to constitute a failure of the condition set forth in _Section
2.7(b)(i)_ or _(c)(i)_ , as the case may be, to be satisfied.

  



   

48

 



    

  

Section 5.14 _280G_. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to submit to the Stockholders, for
approval by the Stockholders holding the number of Shares required by the
terms of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code, a written consent in favor of a
single proposal to render the parachute payment provisions of Section 280G of
the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder (collectively, " _Section
280G_ ") inapplicable to any and all payments or benefits provided pursuant
to Employee Benefit Plans or other Contracts to which the Company or either
Company Subsidiary is a party or is otherwise bound that are reasonably
likely to result, separately or in the aggregate, in the payment of any amount
or the provision of any benefit that would not be deductible by reason of
Section 280G or that would be subject to an excise Tax under Section 4999 of
the Code; provided that in no event shall this _Section 5.14_ be construed to
require the Company or either Company Subsidiary to compel any Person to
waive any existing rights under any contract or agreement that such Person has
with the Company or such Company Subsidiary, and in no event shall the
Company or either Company Subsidiary be deemed in breach of this _Section
5.14_ if any such Person refuses to waive any such rights or such stockholder
approval is not obtained. Any such stockholder approval shall be sought
by the Company in a manner that satisfies all applicable requirements of
Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder,
including Q-7 of Section 1.280G-1 of the Treasury Regulations. The form and
substance of all stockholder approval documents contemplated by this _Section
5.14_ , including the waivers, shall be subject to the prior review and
reasonable approval of Parent which will not be unreasonably delayed or
withheld.

  



  

Section 5.15 _Representations and Warranties Insurance_. Parent
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the RandW Policy at the
Closing consistent with the terms set forth in the conditional binder
attached hereto as _Exhibit 2_. The Company Group shall, and shall direct its
Agents to, cooperate and promptly provide the insurer under the RandW Policy and
its attorneys with access to all information reasonably requested during
normal business hours to complete the due diligence process with respect to
the RandW Policy (in a manner so as not to interfere with the normal business
operations of the Company).

  



  

Section 5.16 _Capitalization_. Prior to the Closing, the Company
shall deliver to Parent an updated _Schedule 3.3(a)-1_ to reflect the
capitalization of the Company as of the Closing and after giving effect to
the SPV Merger, which shall be the basis for the Equityholder
Payment Schedule.

  



  

 _ARTICLE VI_ 
 SURVIVAL; INDEMNIFICATION

  



  

Section 6.1 _Survival_. The representations and warranties of
the Parties in this Agreement shall survive until, and shall expire upon, the
first anniversary of the Closing Date (" _Expiration Date_ "); provided that,
the Expiration Date for the Tax Representations and the Fundamental
Representations shall be the date that is eighteen months after the Closing
Date. All covenants of the Parties and Representative requiring performance
after the Closing contained herein shall survive the Effective Time until such
covenants are performed or performance thereof has been duly waived.
Following the Effective Time, no Party shall be entitled to any
recovery under this _Article VI_ in respect of any inaccuracy or breach of
any representation or warranty or to make any claim in respect thereof
(whether in contract, in tort or at law or in equity) unless such claim is
asserted with reasonable specificity (to the extent known at such time) in
writing from the non-breaching Party to the breaching Party on or prior to the
applicable Expiration Date (whether or not a claim has been filed in court at
the expiration of the specified period of survival), in which case
the representation or warranty pursuant to which an inaccuracy or breach has
been claimed shall survive (but solely for purposes of such claim) until the
final resolution thereof.

  



   

49

 



    

  

Section 6.2 _General Indemnity_.

  



  

(a)  Subject to the limitations, conditions and other
provisions set forth in this _Article VI_ , after the Effective Time, if
Parent or the Company Group or their respective stockholders, members,
partners, officers, managers, directors or employees after the Effective Time
(each a " _Parent Indemnitee_ ") suffers any Losses, whether or not involving
a third party claim, arising out of any inaccuracy in or breach of any
representation or warranty of the Company contained in _Article III_  (as
qualified by the Schedules and without giving effect to any limitation or
qualification on any representation or warranty indicated by the words
Material Adverse Effect, materially or material (which shall be disregarded
both for purposes of determining the amount of any Losses under this _Article
VI_ and the existence of any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or
warranty);  _provided_ that such materiality read-out shall not apply to the
representations and warranties contained in _Section 3.5_  (Financial
Statements), the first sentence of _Section 3.7_ (Absence of Certain Changes),
the first sentence of _Section 3.11(a)_ (Employee Benefit Plans), _Section
3.17_ (Customers and Suppliers) or the defined term " _Material Contracts_
"), then subject to the Minimum Claim Amount and Deductible (except for
Fundamental Representations and Tax Representations, which are not subject to
the Minimum Claim Amount and Deductible) and _Section 6.2(d)_ , Parent
Indemnitees shall be entitled to recover such Losses from the Indemnity
Escrow Amount until the Indemnity Escrow Amount has been exhausted.

  



  

(b)  From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall indemnify
the Equityholders for any Losses arising out of any breach of any
representation or warranty of Parent contained in _Article IV_ or any non-
fulfillment or breach of any covenant in this Agreement requiring performance
after the Effective Time by Parent or the Company.

  



  

(c)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, except with respect to Losses in respect of any third party claim
relating to any inaccuracy in or breach of the Fundamental Representations or
to Losses relating to any inaccuracy in or breach of the Tax Representations
(subject to _Section 5.8(b)_ ), Parent Indemnitees shall not be entitled to
recover on any claim for indemnifiable Losses pursuant to _Section 6.2(a)_
unless the Losses relating to such claim (or series of claims arising from
the same or substantially similar facts or circumstances) exceed $50,000 ("
_Minimum Claim Amount_ "); and if a claim for indemnifiable Losses pursuant
to _Section 6.2(a)_ exceeds the Minimum Claim Amount, Parent
Indemnitees shall not be entitled to recover such Losses unless and until
Parent Indemnitees have suffered indemnifiable Losses pursuant to  _Section
6.2(a)_ in aggregate in excess of $850,000 (" _Deductible_ "), in which case
Parent Indemnitees shall be entitled to recover from the Indemnity Escrow
Amount all Losses relating to such claim in excess of the Deductible up to
but in no event in excess of the Cap, in the aggregate.

  



  

(d)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
in the event Parent Indemnitees incur Losses resulting from any inaccuracy in
or breach of any Fundamental Representation or any Tax Representation, Parent
Indemnitees shall be entitled to recover such Losses from the Indemnity
Escrow Amount until the Indemnity Escrow Amount has been exhausted; provided,
that in the event such Losses in respect of any inaccuracy in or breach of
Fundamental Representations exceeds the coverage under the RandW Policy (i.e.,
after exhausting the Indemnity Escrow Amount and the coverage then available
under the RandW Policy), then Parent Indemnitees shall be entitled to recover
such excess Losses directly from the Equityholders on a several (and not joint
and several) basis; provided further, that in no event shall any
Equityholder\'s liability in respect of such Losses exceed 95% of the net
proceeds received by such Equityholder.

  



  

(e)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement
and solely if the matter set forth on _Schedule 6.2(a)_  has not been
resolved or settled prior to Closing by the Company, the Special Indemnity
Escrow shall be set aside to provide funds for the defense, settlement and
payment of amounts with respect to the matter set forth on _Schedule 6.2(a)_.
Parent shall, in good faith and in reasonable consultation with John
Shagoury, control the defense and settlement of such matter on behalf
of Parent, the Company Group and their respective Affiliates. For the
avoidance of doubt, Parent shall not be required to obtain the approval of
John Shagoury with respect to Parent\'s handling of the defense or settlement
of such matter. Upon any such settlement or final resolution of such matter,
Representative and Parent shall direct the Escrow Agent to pay from the
Special Indemnity Escrow Amount the amounts payable for the defense,
settlement or payment of awards relating to such matter and any remaining
amount shall be paid to the Paying Agent for further payment to the
Equityholders pursuant to _Section 2.5_.

  



   

50

 



    

  

(f)  Losses in respect of which Parent would otherwise be
entitled to indemnification shall be offset by: (i) any amounts or benefits
actually received by Parent (whether in the form of cash, credit or some other
beneficial arrangement) from any third party in respect of such Loss less the
reasonable costs incurred in obtaining such amounts or benefits; (ii) the
aggregate amount of any insurance proceeds actually received by Parent
(whether in the form of cash or credit) in respect of such Loss less
the reasonable costs incurred in obtaining such proceeds, provided that
insurance proceeds actually received by Parent under the RandW Policy shall not
offset the portion of Losses which are not covered by the RandW Policy because
they are less than the retention amount of the RandW Policy; and (iii) the
aggregate amount of any Tax benefit actually realized by Parent or the Company
Group through a reduction in Taxes paid in respect of such Loss in the year
of Loss or the two subsequent years (in which case the amount of such offset
under this clause (iii) shall be repaid to Representative on behalf of
Equityholders to the extent indemnification has already been paid to Parent
on behalf of the Equityholders under _Article VI_ ). In furtherance of the
foregoing, in respect of any Losses covered by insurance or for which an
indemnity, contribution or other similar right against a third party is
available, Parent and the Company Group shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to seek recovery under such insurance or indemnity, contribution or
similar right (and, in the case of the RandW Policy, consistent with this
_Article VI_ ).

  



  

(g)  Parent shall not be entitled to recover under _Section
6.2(a)_ for any Losses: (i) consisting of or relating to Taxes with respect
to any Post-Closing Tax Period, as a result of any breach of the
representations and warranties set forth in  _Section 3.13_ (other than the
representations and warranties set forth in _Section 3.13(h)_ ), including,
consisting of or relating to Taxes incurred as a result of actions outside
the Ordinary Course of Business taken after the Closing; or (ii) consisting
of or relating to Taxes that are due to the unavailability in any Post-Closing
Tax Period of any net operating losses, credits or other Tax attributes from
a taxable period (or portion thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing Date).

  



  

(h)  In no event shall any Party (or any successor or assign
thereof) be entitled to any punitive or exemplary damages (except to the
extent paid to a third party).

  



  

(i)  For purposes of clarity, and notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, neither Parent nor the Company Group shall be
deemed to have suffered any Loss arising from any liability to the extent such
liability was included in the determination of Final Working Capital, Final
Indebtedness or Final Transaction Expenses, as it is the intent of the Parties
that the procedures set forth in _Section 2.5_ shall provide the sole and
exclusive remedy for claims relating thereto.

  



  

(j)  Parent shall provide Representative with written and
reasonably detailed notice of any event, state of facts, circumstances or
developments of which Parent has knowledge that is reasonably likely to result
in any claim for indemnification under _Section 6.2(a)_ promptly after Parent
has knowledge of such potential claim. Representative shall provide Parent
with written and reasonably detailed notice of any event, state of facts,
circumstances or developments of which Representative has knowledge that are
reasonably likely to result in any claim for indemnification under _Section
6.2(b)_ promptly after Representative has knowledge of such potential claim.
To the extent consistent with the common law doctrine of mitigation, Parent
and the Company Group shall take, and shall cause their respective Affiliates
to take, all commercially reasonable steps to mitigate any Loss upon becoming
aware of any event, state of facts, circumstances or developments giving rise
thereto and, to the extent curable without materially adversely affecting any
relationship of Parent or the Company Group with any senior employee, material
customer, supplier or other Person having a material business relationship
with any of them as determined in good faith by Parent and Representative,
Parent shall provide Representative and its Agents a reasonable opportunity
to cure any breach. Parent shall control the defense of any third party claim
unless such third party claim is in respect of Taxes of the Company
(including, but not limited to, any such claim in respect of a breach of the
representations and warranties in _Section 3.13_ hereof or any breach or
violation of or failure to fully perform any covenant, agreement, undertaking
or obligation in _Section 5.8_ ) in which case control thereof shall be
governed exclusively by _Section 5.8_ hereof. In no event shall Parent or the
Company Group enter into (or permit any Person to enter into) any settlement
in respect of any third party claim that could result in any claim against the
Indemnity Escrow Amount or against the Equityholders under _Section 6.2(d)_
without the prior written consent of Representative (such consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

  



   

51

 



    

  

(k)  Any amount finally determined to be due and owing under
_Section 6.2(a)_ shall be satisfied, subject to the Minimum Claim Amount and
Deductible (other than in respect of breaches of the Fundamental
Representations or Tax Representations, which shall not be subject to the
Minimum Claim Amount or Deductible), solely from (A) first, the then-remaining
balance of the Indemnity Escrow Amount, (B) second, the RandW Policy to the
extent covered thereby, subject, in each case, to the other limitations
set forth in this _Article VI_ and (C) third, solely with respect to
Fundamental Representations, as provided in _Section 6.2(d)_.

  



  

(l)  Any amount finally determined to be due and owing under
_Section 6.2(b)_ shall be satisfied directly by Parent or the Company Group.

  



  

(m)  From and after the Closing, the sole and exclusive remedies
for any and all claims arising under, out of, related to or in connection
with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be the
remedies provided in _Section 2.5_ ,  _Section 5.8_ , this _Section 6.2_ ,
the last sentence of _Section 8.4_ , _Section 8.6_ , _Section 8.10(d)_  and
good faith claims for Fraud, and no Person will have any other entitlement,
remedy or recourse, whether in contract, tort or otherwise against any
Contracting Party or any other Person, it being agreed that all such other
remedies, entitlements and recourse are expressly waived and released by the
Parties to the fullest extent permitted by law; provided that, for the
avoidance of doubt, this _Section 6.2(m)_ shall not affect the rights of any
party under any Letter of Transmittal, OCA, restrictive covenant agreement,
employment agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the Advisory Services Agreement
Termination Agreement entered into in connection with this Agreement, which
shall be governed by the terms thereof and available remedies therein. For the
avoidance of doubt, no Party shall be entitled to a rescission of this
Agreement (or any agreements contemplated hereby). The provisions of this
_Section 6.2(m)_ and the limited remedies provided in _Section 2.5_ , _Section
5.8_ , this _Section 6.2_ , the last sentence of _Section 8.4_ , _Section
8.6_ and _Section 8.10(d)_ were specifically bargained for by the Parties and
were taken into account by them in arriving at the Enterprise Value and the
terms and conditions of this Agreement. For purposes of clarity, with respect
to any claim for Fraud (i) except in respect of the _Sections 6.2(f)_ through
_(j)_ , the provisions of this _Article VI_ shall not be applicable and (ii)
consistent with _Section 6.2(f)_ , Parent shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to seek recovery for any Losses against the RandW Policy or any other
insurance of the Parent or the Company Group to the fullest extent covered
thereby.

  



  

(n)  On the first anniversary of the Closing Date, Parent and
Representative shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to disburse to the
Paying Agent (for further payment to the Equityholders pursuant to _Section
2.5(f)_ ) an aggregate amount equal to: (i) $850,000; _minus_ (ii) the sum of
(A) the aggregate amount of all indemnifiable Losses paid from the Indemnity
Escrow Amount prior to such first anniversary (if any) _plus_ , (B) if
applicable, the estimated amount of any then-unresolved good faith claims, in
each case, made solely in respect of any breach of any Fundamental
Representations or any Tax Representation under  _Section 6.2(d)_ prior to
such date. On the date that is eighteen months after the Closing Date, Parent
and Representative shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to disburse to the
Paying Agent (for further payment to the Equityholders pursuant to
_Section 2.5(f)_ ) an aggregate amount equal to the: (1) the then-remaining
balance of the Indemnity Escrow Amount; _minus_ (2) the aggregate amount of
all Losses specified or reasonably estimated in good faith in any then-
unresolved good faith claims made in accordance with this Agreement prior to
such date. Any such amount paid to the Equityholders shall be paid without
interest and as if such amounts had been included in the Closing Merger
Consideration; provided that any amounts payable to the Option Holders shall
be paid to the Operating Company and the Operating Company shall pay such
amounts to the Option Holders net of any applicable withholding amount
pursuant to _Section 2.4_ , in each case as determined by the Operating
Company and Representative. In respect of any amounts that are not released
from the Indemnity Escrow Amount because claims are pending or otherwise
unresolved, any such amounts not paid with respect to any indemnification
claim shall be released promptly upon the settlement or resolution
thereof and paid to the Paying Agent for further payment to the Equityholders
pursuant to _Section 2.5(f)_ ; provided that any amounts payable to the
Option Holders shall be paid net of the applicable withholding amount pursuant
to _Section 2.4_.

compliance by Parent with any covenant or condition thereof or a breach by
Parent of any representation or warranty contained herein and (b) Parent may
extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts
of the Company, or waive compliance by the Company with any covenant or
condition thereof or a breach by the Company of any representation or
warranty contained herein. Any agreement on the part of any Party or
Representative to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed by such Party or Representative. No
failure or delay on the part of any Party or Representative in the exercise of
any right hereunder shall impair such right or be construed as a waiver of,
or acquiescence in, any breach of any representation, warranty or covenant
contained herein, and no single or partial exercise of any such right shall
preclude other or further exercise thereof or of any other right.

  



  

Section 8.3 _Non-Recourse; Releases_.

for any claims, obligations, liabilities or causes of action based upon, in
respect of, arising under, out or by reason of, in connection with, or
relating in any manner to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby or based on, in respect of or by reason of this Agreement

law, each Contracting Party hereby waives and releases all such claims,

Company and the Surviving Corporation on its own behalf and on behalf of each

and each other Person owing fiduciary duties to the Company Group at any time
prior to and through the Closing (collectively, the " _Company Releasees_ ")

Business and occurring, existing or arising up until and through the Closing,

in respect of the provisos set forth in  _Section 6.2(d)_ or such
Equityholder\'s Letter of Transmittal or OCA, as applicable, (ii) any employee
or former employee of the Company Group in respect of any (x) restrictive

(c)  As part of the consideration for and as a condition to
Parent\'s entry into this Agreement, effective as of the Effective Time, each
Stockholder, on its, his or her own behalf and, to the extent applicable, on
behalf of its, his or her heirs, administrators, executors, successors and
assigns (collectively, the " _Stockholder Releasors_ ") hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally waives, releases and forever discharges, to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law, the Company Group and its
Affiliates, successors and assigns and each of their respective current and
former directors, officers, employees, partners, members,
shareholders, successors and assigns (collectively, the " _Stockholder
Releasees_ ") of and from any and all liabilities and obligations to, or

any kind or nature whatsoever, whether in law or in equity, whether known or
unknown to such Stockholder Releasor, whether absolute or contingent,
liquidated or unliquidated, in respect of any cause, matter or thing relating
to the Company Group or its business and occurring, existing or arising up

discharge is given solely with respect to such Stockholder\'s ownership of
equity interests in the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, and provided,
further that the Stockholder Releasors do not release any rights such
Stockholder has under this Agreement or under any Letter of Transmittal,
Escrow Agreement, OCA, restrictive covenant agreement or employment agreement
or other agreement entered into in connection with this Agreement.

  



  

Section 8.4 _Binding Effect; Benefit; Assignment;
Prevailing Party_. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be
binding upon the Parties and, except as expressly set forth herein, including
in respect of _Section 5.4_ ,  _Article VI_ , _Section 8.3_ , _Section 8.6_
and _Section 8.10_ , nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is
intended to or shall confer any other Person any rights, benefits or remedies
of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement. Neither this
Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be
assigned by any of the Parties without the prior written consent of each of
the other Parties (and in the case of the Company, without the prior
written consent of Representative); _provided_ , however, that Representative
may assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement to any of its
Affiliates ( _provided_ , however, that any such assignment shall not relieve
Representative of any liability or obligation in connection with this
Agreement) without prior written consent and Parent may assign its rights
under this Agreement to any of its Affiliates ( _provided_ , however, that
any such assignment shall not relieve Parent of any liability or
obligation in connection with this Agreement). Any attempted assignment in
violation of this _Section 8.4_ will be void. The party prevailing in any
Action under this Agreement against the other party shall be entitled to
recover from the non-prevailing party, in addition to any damages the
prevailing party may have been awarded, all reasonable and documented out-of-
pocket attorneys\' fees and expenses that the prevailing party may have
incurred in connection with such Action (it being understood that the intent
of this provision is to discourage claims not made in good faith or otherwise
made for an improper purpose by awarding the party prevailing in
such litigation attorneys\' fees incurred thereby).

  



   

56

 



    

  

Section 8.5 _Applicable Law; Waiver of Jury Trial_. This
Agreement and the legal relations between the Parties shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware, without
regard to the conflict of laws rules thereof, except that the DGCL shall apply
to the extent required in connection with the Merger. The state and federal
courts located within the state of Delaware shall have exclusive
jurisdiction over any and all disputes between the parties, whether in law or
in equity, arising out of or relating to this Agreement and the agreements,
instruments and documents contemplated hereby and the Parties and
Representative consent to and agree to subject to the exclusive jurisdiction
of such courts. The Parties and Representative hereby waive to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law, and shall not assert in any such dispute,
any claim that (a) such Party or Representative is not personally subject to
the jurisdiction of such courts, (b) such Party or Representative and such
Party\'s or Representative\'s property is immune from any legal process
issued by such courts or (c) any Action commenced in such courts is brought in
an inconvenient forum. The mailing of process of other papers in connection
with any such Action in the manner provided in _Section 8.12_ (or in
such other manner as may be permitted by law) shall be valid and sufficient
service thereof and the Parties and Representative hereby waive any
objections to service accomplished in the manner provided herein. The Parties
and Representative hereby irrevocably waive all right to a trial by jury in
any Action or counterclaim arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

Section 8.6 _Specific Enforcement_. The Parties and
Representative hereby stipulate that irreparable damage would occur in the
event that any provision of this Agreement is not performed in accordance
with its specific terms or is otherwise breached or threatened to be breached
and that an award of money damages would be inadequate in such event.
Accordingly, it is acknowledged that the Parties, Representative and the
third party beneficiaries of this Agreement shall be entitled to equitable
relief, without proof of actual damages, including an injunction or Orders
for specific performance to prevent breaches of this Agreement (including any
Order sought by any Party or Representative to cause the other Parties or
Representative to perform their obligations and covenants contained in this
Agreement) and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law
or in equity as a remedy for any such breach or threatened breach. Each Party
and Representative further agrees that no other Party or any other Person
shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in
connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this
_Section 8.6_ and each Party and Representative hereby irrevocably waives any
right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such
bond or similar instrument. The only objection that a Party or Representative
may raise in response to any Action for equitable relief is that such Party or
Representative contests the existence of a breach or threatened breach of
this Agreement. For purposes of clarity, Equityholders are third party
beneficiaries to this Agreement by virtue of the Merger Consideration that
they are entitled to receive and for the purposes of seeking
specific performance and other remedies to which they are entitled at law or
in equity, it being understood that this Agreement may be enforced for the
benefit of Equityholders by the Company and Representative.

  



  

Section 8.7 _Rules of Construction_. The parties have been
represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement
and have participated jointly in the drafting of this Agreement and,
therefore, waive the application of any law, holding or rule of construction
providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document will be
construed against the party drafting such agreement or document.
Exhibits, Annexes and Schedules to this Agreement are attached hereto and by
this reference incorporated herein for all purposes. Any reference in this
Agreement to an "Article," "Exhibit," "Annex," "Section" or "Schedule" refers
to the corresponding Article, Exhibit, Section or Schedule of or to this
Agreement, unless expressly provided otherwise. The table of contents and the
headings of Articles, Annexes, Exhibits and Sections of this Agreement are for
convenience only, do not constitute any part of this Agreement and shall be
disregarded in construing the language herein. The words "this
Agreement," "herein," "hereby," "hereunder" and "hereof," and words of
similar import, refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular
subdivision unless expressly so limited. The word "including" (in its various
forms) means "including without limitation." Where this Agreement states that
a Party or Representative "shall," "will" or "must" perform in some manner or
otherwise act or omit to act, it means the Party or Representative is legally
obligated to do so in accordance with this Agreement. Any reference to a
statute is deemed also to refer to any amendments or successor legislation as
in effect at the relevant time and any reference to any law includes the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder. Any reference to an agreement or
other document as of a given date means the agreement or other document as
amended, supplemented and modified from time to time through such date;
provided that each such amendment, supplement or modification is disclosed to
the other Parties to this Agreement. All references to "$" and dollars shall
be deemed to refer to U.S. currency unless otherwise specifically provided.

  



   

57

 



    

  

Section 8.8 _Schedules_. Matters reflected in the schedules
attached hereto (" _Schedules_ ") are not necessarily limited to matters
required by this Agreement to be reflected in the Schedules. To the extent
any such additional matters are included, they are included for informational
purposes and do not necessarily include other matters of a similar nature.
Headings and subheadings have been inserted in the Schedules for convenience
of reference only and shall not have the effect of amending or changing the
express description thereof as set forth in this Agreement. Disclosure of any
fact or item in this Agreement or any Schedule referenced by a
particular Section in this Agreement shall be deemed to have been disclosed
with respect to every other Section in this Agreement to the extent that it
is reasonably apparent from the face of such disclosure that such disclosure
would apply to such other Sections. Neither the specification of any dollar
amount in the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement nor
the inclusion of any specific item in any Schedule is intended to imply that
such amounts, higher or lower amounts, or the item so included or
other items, are or are not material or are within or outside the Ordinary
Course of Business, and no Party shall use the fact of the setting forth of
such amounts or the fact of the inclusion of any such item in any Schedule in
any dispute or controversy between the Parties as to whether any obligation,
item or matter is or is not required to be disclosed (including, whether such
amounts or items are or are not material), or may constitute an event or
condition which could be considered to have a Material Adverse Effect. No
matter or item disclosed on a Schedule admitting or indicating a possible
breach or violation of any Contract, law or Order shall be construed as an
admission or indication that an actual breach or violation exists, has
actually occurred or will occur. The Parties do not assume any responsibility
to any Person that is not a party to this Agreement for the accuracy of
any information set forth in the Schedules. Subject to applicable law, the
information on the Schedules is disclosed in confidence for the purposes
contemplated in this Agreement and is subject to the confidentiality
provisions of any other agreements, including the Confidentiality Agreement,
entered into by the Parties or their Affiliates. Moreover, without limiting
the rights of the other Parties to this Agreement with respect to such
information, in disclosing the information in the Schedules, each Party
expressly does not waive any attorney-client privilege associated with such
information or any protection afforded by the work-product doctrine with
respect to any of the matters disclosed or discussed therein.

  



  

Section 8.9 _Time of the Essence_. Time is of the essence in
this Agreement. If the date specified for giving any notice or taking any
action is not a business day (or if the period during which any notice is
required to be given or any action taken expires on a date which is not a
business day), then the date for giving such notice or taking such action
(and the expiration date of such period during which notice is required to be
given or action taken) shall be the next date which is a business day.

  



  

Section 8.10 _Representative_. 

  



  

(a)  At the Effective Time, and without further act of any
Equityholder, Representative shall be appointed as the exclusive agent and
attorney-in-fact to act on behalf of each Equityholder, in connection with and
to facilitate the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which
shall include the power and authority to (i) negotiate, execute and deliver
such waivers, consents and amendments under this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby as Representative, in its
sole discretion, may deem necessary or desirable, (ii) enforce and protect
the rights and interests of the Equityholders, (iii) take any and
all actions, or waive or refrain from enforcing any and all rights, which
Representative believes are necessary, reasonable or appropriate under this
Agreement for and on behalf of the Equityholders including, consenting to,
compromising or settling any such claims, conducting negotiations with
Parent, the Surviving Corporation and their respective Agents regarding such
claims and any other actions that Representative may consider necessary or
proper or convenient in connection with, or to carry out the
transactions contemplated by, this Agreement, (iv) engage outside counsel,
accountants and other advisors and incur such other expenses on behalf of the
Equityholders in connection with any matter arising under this Agreement and
(v) collect, hold and disburse the Indemnity Escrow Amount, Adjustment Escrow
Amount, the Expense Holdback Amount and, solely to the extent the matter set
forth on _Schedule 6.2(a)_ is not resolved and all claims related thereto
satisfied or released prior to the Closing, the Special Indemnity
Escrow Amount in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. The grant of
authority provided for herein (A) is coupled with an interest and shall be
irrevocable and survive the death, incompetency, bankruptcy or liquidation of
any Equityholder and (B) shall survive the consummation of the Merger, and
any action taken by Representative pursuant to the authority granted in this
Agreement shall be effective and binding on each Equityholder notwithstanding
any contrary action of or direction from such Equityholder.

  



   

58

 



    

  

(b)  Representative shall be entitled to receive reimbursement
from, and be indemnified by, the Equityholders for certain expenses, charges
and liabilities as provided below. In connection with this Agreement, and in
exercising or failing to exercise all or any of the powers conferred upon
Representative hereunder, (i) Representative shall incur no responsibility
whatsoever to any Equityholders by reason of any act or omission performed or
omitted hereunder, excepting only responsibility for any act or failure to act
which represents willful misconduct in bad faith and (ii) Representative
shall be entitled to rely on the advice of counsel, accountants or other
independent experts experienced in the matter at issue, and any act or
omission of Representative pursuant to such advice shall in no event subject
Representative to liability to any Equityholder. Each Equityholder shall
indemnify, severally and not jointly, based on such Equityholder\'s portion
of the Merger Consideration, Representative against all Losses, damages,
liabilities, claims, obligations, costs and expenses, including reasonable
attorneys\', accountants\' and other experts\' fees and the amount of any
judgment against them, of any nature whatsoever, arising out of or relating to
any acts or omissions of Representative hereunder. The foregoing
indemnification shall not apply in the event of any lawsuit which finally
adjudicates the liability of Representative hereunder for its willful
misconduct in bad faith. Representative shall have the right to recover, at
its sole discretion, from the Expense Holdback Amount, prior to any
distribution to the Equityholders, any amounts to which it is entitled
pursuant to the expense reimbursement and indemnification provisions of this
_Section 8.10(b)_. All of the indemnities, immunities and powers granted to
Representative under this Agreement shall survive the Effective Time or any
termination of this Agreement.

  



  

(c)  Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall have the right
to conclusively rely upon all actions taken or omitted to be taken by
Representative pursuant to this Agreement, all of which actions or omissions
shall be legally binding upon the Equityholders. Parent, Merger Sub and the
Surviving Corporation are hereby relieved from any liability to any Person
(including any Equityholder) for any acts done by them in accordance with any
written notice, consent or instruction of Representative.

  



  

(d)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, each of
the Company, Merger Sub and Parent acknowledges and agrees
that Representative is a party to this Agreement solely to perform certain
administrative functions in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby. Accordingly, Representative shall have no
liability to, and shall not be liable for any Losses of, any of the Company,
Parent or Merger Sub in connection with any obligations of Representative
under this Agreement or otherwise in respect of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, in each case, in its capacity as
Representative, except to the extent such Losses shall be proven to be the
direct result of the knowing and willful breach of this Agreement
by Representative or willful misconduct in bad faith by Representative in
connection with the performance of its obligations hereunder.

  



   

59

 



    

  

Section 8.11 _Legal Representation_.

  



  

(a)  Parent and the Company hereby expressly agree, on behalf
of themselves and the Surviving Corporation, its Affiliates and subsidiaries
and their respective current and future members, partners, equityholders,
Agents and each of the successors and assigns of the foregoing (all such
Persons, " _Waiving Parties_ "), that Kirkland and Ellis LLP (or any successor
thereto) may represent Representative, any Equityholder or any other Nonparty
Affiliate in connection with any dispute, litigation, claim, proceeding or
obligation arising out of or relating to this Agreement, any agreement entered
into in connection herewith or the transactions contemplated hereby (any such
representation, " _Post-Closing Representation_ ") notwithstanding
its representation of the Company Group prior to the Closing, and each of
Parent and the Company on their own behalf and on behalf of the Waiving
Parties hereby consents thereto and irrevocably waives (and will not assert)
any conflict of interest or any objection arising therefrom or relating
thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision hereof, no
conflict of interest or objection is waived arising from any representation
other than solely representation of the Company Group prior to the Closing.

  



  

(b)  Parent and the Company, on behalf of themselves and the
Waiving Parties, hereby acknowledge and agree that all Sale Materials are the
exclusive property of Representative and, as such, Representative shall have
exclusive control over access, disclosure and use thereof. In furtherance of
the foregoing, Parent and the Company (on behalf of themselves and the Waiving
Parties) hereby stipulate that in no event shall any Sale Materials be
admissible by any of them (or any other Person purporting to act on behalf
thereof or any of the other Waiving Parties) in any action or proceeding.

  



  

(c)  Parent and the Company, on behalf of themselves and the
Waiving Parties, hereby acknowledge and agree that all emails and other
communications that are subject to the attorney-client privilege and/or the
attorney work product doctrine among Kirkland and Ellis LLP, the Company Group,
Representative, any Equityholder or any other Nonparty Affiliate made in
connection with, and concerning the subject matter of, the negotiation,
preparation, execution, delivery and performance under, or any dispute or
proceeding arising out of or relating to, the sale process, this Agreement,
any agreement entered into in connection herewith, the
transactions contemplated hereby or any matter relating to any of the
foregoing, are privileged communications and the attorney-client
privilege and the expectation of client confidence belongs solely to
Representative, Equityholder and/or other Nonparty Affiliate, as
applicable, and, subject to the exceptions set forth below, shall be
exclusively controlled thereby and shall not pass to or be claimed by Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or a Company Subsidiary thereof and from and after
the Closing none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation, a Company Subsidiary
thereof or any other Person purporting to act on behalf thereof or any of the
Waiving Parties will seek to obtain the same by any process. From and after
the Closing, Parent and the Company, on behalf of themselves and the Waiving
Parties, hereby waive and will not assert any attorney client privilege with
respect to any files, emails or other communications.

  



  

Section 8.12 _Notices_. Except as otherwise provided herein, all
