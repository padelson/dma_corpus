Parent is acquiring shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation for its own account, for investment purposes only and not
with any present intention of distributing or selling such shares in violation of the federal securities Laws or any applicable
foreign or state securities law. Parent qualifies as an &quot;accredited investor,&quot; as such term is defined in Rule 501(a)
promulgated pursuant to the Securities Act. Parent understands that the acquisition of the shares being acquired hereunder involves
substantial risk. Parent and its Affiliates have substantial knowledge and experience in financial and business matters and are
fully capable of evaluating the merits and risks of its investment in such shares. Parent can bear the economic risk of its investment
(which may be for an indefinite period). Parent understands that the shares it is acquiring have not been registered under the
Securities Act and therefore may not be transferred, sold, offered for sale, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of without
registration under the Securities Act and any other provision of applicable state securities Laws or pursuant to an applicable
exemption therefrom. Parent acknowledges that there is no public market for the shares and that there can be no assurance that
a public market will develop. </FONT></P>

The Parties and Representative hereby stipulate that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any provision of this Agreement
is not performed in accordance with its specific terms or is otherwise breached or threatened to be breached and that an award
of money damages would be inadequate in such event. Accordingly, it is acknowledged that the Parties, Representative and the third
party beneficiaries of this Agreement shall be entitled to equitable relief, without proof of actual damages, including an injunction
or Orders for specific performance to prevent breaches of this Agreement (including any Order sought by any Party or Representative
to cause the other Parties or Representative to perform their obligations and covenants contained in this Agreement) and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity as a remedy for any such breach or threatened breach. Each Party and Representative further agrees that no other Party or
any other Person shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a condition
to obtaining any remedy referred to in this </FONT><U>Section 8.6</U> and each Party and Representative hereby irrevocably waives
any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument. The only objection
that a Party or Representative may raise in response to any Action for equitable relief is that such Party or Representative contests
the existence of a breach or threatened breach of this Agreement. For purposes of clarity, Equityholders are third party beneficiaries
to this Agreement by virtue of the Merger Consideration that they are entitled to receive and for the purposes of seeking specific
performance and other remedies to which they are entitled at law or in equity, it being understood that this Agreement may be enforced
for the benefit of Equityholders by the Company and Representative.</P>

The parties have been represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and have participated jointly
in the drafting of this Agreement and, therefore, waive the application of any law, holding or rule of construction providing that
ambiguities in an agreement or other document will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or document. Exhibits,

in this Agreement to an &quot;Article,&quot; &quot;Exhibit,&quot; &quot;Annex,&quot; &quot;Section&quot; or &quot;Schedule&quot;

Matters reflected in the schedules attached hereto (&quot;<U>Schedules</U>&quot;) are not necessarily limited to matters required
by this Agreement to be reflected in the Schedules. To the extent any such additional matters are included, they are included for
informational purposes and do not necessarily include other matters of a similar nature. Headings and subheadings have been inserted

setting forth of such amounts or the fact of the inclusion of any such item in any Schedule in any dispute or controversy between
the Parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter is or is not required to be disclosed (including, whether such amounts

Effect. No matter or item disclosed on a Schedule admitting or indicating a possible breach or violation of any Contract, law or
