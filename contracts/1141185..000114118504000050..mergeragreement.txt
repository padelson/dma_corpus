AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement"), dated as of  April 6, 2004,
among KERR-MCGEE CORPORATION, a Delaware  corporation ("Parent"), KERR-MCGEE
(NEVADA) LLC, a Nevada  limited liability company and wholly-owned subsidiary
of  Parent ("Merger Sub"), and WESTPORT RESOURCES CORPORATION, a  Nevada
corporation (the "Company").    INTRODUCTION    The respective Boards of
Directors of each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company have unanimously (i)
approved and declared advisable the merger of the Company with and into
Merger Sub (the "Merger"), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement and (ii) approved this Agreement.    As a result of
the Merger, and in accordance with the Nevada Revised Statutes (the "NRS"),
each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value $.01 per share
of the Company (the "Company Common Stock") (other than shares of Company
Common Stock owned by the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any wholly-owned
Subsidiary (as defined in Section 3.4(a)) of the Company or
Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.4)),
will, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (as defined in
Section 2.2(a)).    As a condition and inducement to Parent to enter into
this Agreement and incur the obligations set forth herein, concurrently with
the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Parent is entering into a
Voting Agreements with certain stockholders of the Company named therein,
substantially in the form of Exhibit A attached to this Agreement (the
"Voting Agreements"), pursuant to which, among other things, such
stockholders have agreed to vote the shares of Company Common Stock held by
such stockholders in favor of the approval of this Agreement and the Merger
provided for herein.    The parties to this Agreement intend that the
Merger qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), for Federal
income tax purposes, and that this Agreement constitutes a plan of
reorganization.    In consideration of the foregoing and of the mutual
covenants contained in this Agreement, the Voting Agreements and for other
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby agree as follows:  
ARTICLE 1  THE MERGER   SECTION 1.1. The Merger. At the Effective Time, in
accordance with this Agreement and the NRS, the Company shall be merged with
and into Merger Sub, the separate existence of the Company shall cease, and
Merger Sub shall continue as the surviving entity. For purposes of this
Agreement, (i) the entity surviving the Merger after the Effective Time may
be referred to as the "Surviving Entity" and (ii) the Company and Merger Sub
are collectively referred to as the "Constituent Entities."   SECTION 1.2.
Effects of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in Section
92A.250 of the NRS.   SECTION 1.3. Closing. The closing of the Merger (the
"Closing") will take place at 10:00 a.m. (East Coast time) on a date to be
specified by the parties, which shall be no later than the second business
day after satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by applicable law) waiver
of the conditions set forth in Article 7 (other than any such conditions
which by their nature cannot be satisfied until the Closing Date, which shall
be required to be so satisfied or (to the extent permitted by applicable law)
waived on the Closing Date), at the offices of Akin Gump Strauss Hauer and Feld
LLP, 1111 Louisiana Street, 44th Floor, Houston, Texas 77002 unless another
time, date or place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto (such date
upon which the Closing occurs, the "Closing Date").   SECTION 1.4.
Consummation of the Merger. As soon as practicable after the Closing, the
parties hereto will cause the Merger to be consummated by filing with the
Secretary of State of the State of Nevada articles of merger or
other appropriate documents (in any such case, the "Articles of Merger") in
such form as required by, and executed in accordance with, the relevant
provisions of the NRS and shall make all other filings or recordings required
under the NRS. The Merger shall become effective at such time as the Articles
of Merger are duly filed with such Secretary of State, or at such later time
as Parent and the Company shall agree and specify in the Articles of Merger
(the time and date the Merger becomes effective being the "Effective Time"
and "Effective Date," respectively).   SECTION 1.5. Organizational
Documents; Directors and Officers. The articles of organization of Merger
Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the
articles of organization of the Surviving Entity until thereafter amended as
provided therein and under the NRS. The operating agreement of Merger Sub, as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the operating
agreement of the Surviving Entity until thereafter amended as provided
therein and under the NRS. The managers of Merger Sub immediately prior to
the Effective Time will be the initial managers of the Surviving Entity and
shall serve until their successors have been duly elected or appointed and
qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance
with the Surviving Entity\'s operating agreement and the NRS. The officers of
Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time will be the initial
officers of the Surviving Entity and shall serve until their successors have
been duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier
death, resignation or removal in accordance with the Surviving Entity\'s
operating agreement and the NRS.   ARTICLE 2  EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE
EQUITY OF THE CONSTITUENT ENTITIES;  EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES   SECTION
2.1. Conversion of Merger Sub Membership Interests. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger
Sub, the Company or any holder of any shares of Company Common Stock or any
member\'s interests of Merger Sub, all of the member\'s interests of Merger
Sub ("Merger Sub Membership Interests") outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be deemed to represent all of the outstanding
member\'s interests of the Surviving Entity ("Surviving Entity Member\'s
Interests").   SECTION 2.2. Conversion of Company Common Stock At the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any holder of shares of Company Common
Stock:   (a) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any shares to be canceled
pursuant to Section 2.2(b)) shall be canceled and shall be converted
automatically into the right to receive 0.71 (the "Exchange Ratio") of a
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $1 per share,
of Parent ("Parent Common Stock") (the "Merger Consideration"). As of the
Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and
each holder of a certificate representing any such shares of Company Common
Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right
to receive the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares
of Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor upon
surrender of such certificate in accordance with Section 2.3, without
interest.   (b) Each share of Company Common Stock held in the treasury of
the Company and each share of Company Common Stock owned by Merger Sub,
Parent or any wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent or of the Company immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled without any conversion thereof
and no payment or distribution shall be made with respect thereto.   (c)
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if, between the
date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares
of Parent Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number of
shares or a different class by reason of any reclassification,
recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or readjustment,
or a stock dividend thereon shall have been declared with a record date
within such period, the Exchange Ratio shall be correspondingly adjusted.  
SECTION 2.3. Exchange of Certificates.   (a) Exchange Agent. As of the
Effective Time, Parent shall enter into an agreement with such bank or trust
company as may be designated by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the
Company (the "Exchange Agent"), which shall provide that Parent shall deposit
with the Exchange Agent as of the Effective Time, for the benefit of the
holders of shares of Company Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with
this Article 2, through the Exchange Agent, certificates representing the
shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 2.2 (such shares
of Parent Common Stock, together with any dividends or distributions with
respect thereto with a record date after the Effective Time and any cash
payable in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock being
hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund") in exchange for outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock. From time to time as necessary, Parent shall
deposit with the Exchange Agent cash to be paid in lieu of fractional shares
as contemplated by Section 2.3(e) and any dividends or other distributions to
which holders of Certificates are entitled pursuant to Section 2.3(c). The
Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.   (b) Exchange
Procedures. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time but in
any event not later than five business days thereafter, the Exchange Agent
shall mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock (the "Certificates") whose shares were converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.2, (i) a
letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery
of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have
such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions
for use in surrendering the Certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration. Parent will use its reasonable efforts to cause provision to
be made for holders of Certificates to procure in person immediately
after the Effective Time a letter of transmittal and instructions and to
deliver in person immediately after the Effective Time such letter of
transmittal and Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration and, if
applicable, cash in lieu of fractional shares as contemplated by Section
2.3(e) and any dividends or other distributions to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to Section 2.3(c). Upon surrender of a Certificate for
cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal,
duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the
Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall receive in exchange
therefor a certificate representing that number of whole shares of Parent
Common Stock which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the
provisions of this Article 2, certain dividends or other distributions in
accordance with Section 2.3(c) and cash in lieu of any fractional share of
Parent Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.3(e), and the Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Company Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer
records of the Company, a certificate representing the proper number
of shares of Parent Common Stock may be issued to a Person other than the
Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if such
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and the Person requesting such issuance shall pay any transfer or
other taxes required by reason of the issuance of shares of Parent Common
Stock to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such tax has been paid or is not
applicable. Each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective
Time to represent only the right to receive upon surrender in accordance with
this Section 2.3 the Merger Consideration into which the shares of Company
Common Stock shall have been converted pursuant to Section 2.2, cash in lieu
of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock as contemplated by Section
2.3(e) and any dividends or other distributions to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to Section 2.3(c). No interest shall be paid or will accrue
on any cash payable to holders of Certificates pursuant to the provisions of
this Article 2.   (c) Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares. No
dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock with a
record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock
represented thereby, and no cash payment in lieu of any fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to Section
2.3(e), in each case until the surrender of such Certificate in accordance
with this Article 2. Subject to the effect of applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar laws, following surrender of any such Certificate, there
shall be paid to the holder of the certificate representing whole shares of
Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the
time of such surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a
record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such
whole shares of Parent Common Stock, and the amount of any cash payable in
lieu of a fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to Section 2.3(e) and (ii) at the appropriate payment date,
the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time but prior to such surrender and with a payment date subsequent
to such surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common
Stock.   (d) No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. All
Merger Consideration issued or paid upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates in accordance with the terms of this Article 2 (including any
cash paid pursuant to this Article 2) shall be deemed to have been issued
(and paid) in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of
Company Common Stock theretofore represented by such Certificates, and there
shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of
the Company of the shares of Company Common Stock which were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Entity or the Exchange Agent for
any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article
2, except as otherwise provided by law.   (e) No Fractional Shares. (i) No
certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, no dividend
or distribution of Parent shall relate to such fractional share interests and
such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or
to any rights of a stockholder of Parent.   (ii) In lieu of such fractional
share interests, Parent shall either (A) pay to each former holder of Company
Common Stock an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying
(x) the fractional share interest to which such former holder (after taking
into account all shares of Company Common Stock held at the Effective Time by
such holder) would otherwise be entitled by (y) the average of the last
reported sale prices for a share of Parent Common Stock on the New York Stock
Exchange (the "NYSE") (as reported in The Wall Street Journal, or, if not
reported thereby, any other authoritative source) for the five trading days
prior to the Closing Date or (B) instruct the Exchange Agent to follow the
procedures set forth in Section 2.3(e)(iii).   (iii) If Parent shall have
instructed the Exchange Agent to follow the procedures in this Section
2.3(e)(iii):   (A) The Exchange Agent shall determine the excess of (x) the
aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock that would be distributed
to holders of the Certificates pursuant to Section 2.1 if no effect were
given to Section 2.3(e)(i) over (y) the aggregate number of whole shares of
Parent Common Stock to be distributed to holders of the Certificates pursuant
to Section 2.1, taking into account the effect of Section 2.3(e)(i) (such
excess, the "Excess Shares").   (B) As soon as practicable after the
Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall sell the Excess Shares at then-
prevailing prices on the NYSE, in the manner set forth below.   (C) The
sale of the Excess Shares by the Exchange Agent shall be executed on the NYSE
and shall be executed in round lots to the extent practicable. The Surviving
Entity shall pay all commissions, transfer taxes and other out-of-pocket
transaction costs, including the expenses and compensation of the Exchange
Agent, incurred in connection with such sale of the Excess Shares. Until the
proceeds of such sale or sales have been distributed to the holders of the
Certificates (or paid to Parent pursuant to Section 2.3(f)), the
Exchange Agent shall hold such proceeds in trust for the holders of the
Certificates (the "Common Stock Trust"). The Exchange Agent shall determine
the portion of the Common Stock Trust to which each holder of a Certificate
shall be entitled, if any, by multiplying the amount of the aggregate net
proceeds comprising the Common Stock Trust by a fraction, the numerator of
which is the amount of the fractional share interest in the Parent Common
Stock to which such holder of a Certificate is entitled and the denominator
of which is the aggregate amount of fractional share interests in the Parent
Common Stock to which all holders of the Certificates are entitled. Parent
shall comply with the provisions of Rule 236(c) under the Securities Act.  
(D) As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if
any, to be paid to holders of Certificates in lieu of any fractional
share interests, the Exchange Agent shall make available such amounts,
without interest, to such holders of Certificates that have surrendered
their Certificates in accordance with this Section 2.3.   (f) Termination
of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains
undistributed to the holders of the Certificates for six months after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holders
of the Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this Article 2
shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of their claim for
Merger Consideration, any dividends or distributions with respect to Parent
Common Stock and any cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock.   (g) No Liability. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the
Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any shares of
Parent Common Stock, any dividends or distributions with respect thereto, any
cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock or any cash from
the Exchange Fund, in each case delivered to a public official pursuant to
any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If any Certificate
shall not have been surrendered prior to five years after the Effective Time
(or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any amounts payable
pursuant to this Article 2 would otherwise escheat to or become the property
of any governmental authority), any such amounts shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable law, become the property of the Surviving Entity,
free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled
thereto.   (h) Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable
amount as Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall issue
in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable
Merger Consideration with respect thereto and, if applicable, any unpaid
dividends and distributions on shares of Parent Common Stock deliverable in
respect thereof and any cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock, in each case pursuant to this Agreement.   (i) Withholding
Rights. The Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
shares of Company Common Stock such amounts as it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of
state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld
by the Parent and paid to the appropriate taxing authorities, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made by the Parent.   SECTION 2.4.
Company Options; Restricted Stock. (a) At the Effective Time, each of the
then outstanding Options (as defined below) shall be (i) assumed by Parent,
in accordance with the terms of the applicable Stock Plan (as defined below)
and option agreement by which it is evidenced, except that from and after the
Effective Time, Parent and its Board of Directors or Compensation
Committee, as the case may be, shall be substituted for the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries (as defined in Section 3.1) and their respective Boards
of Directors and committees thereof administering any such Stock Plan, and
(ii) converted into an option to purchase that number of shares of Parent
Common Stock determined by multiplying the number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to such Option at the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio, at
an exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock equal to the exercise
price per share of such Option immediately prior to the Effective Time
divided by the Exchange Ratio; except that, in the case of an Option to which
Section 421 of the Code applies by reason of its qualification under Section
422 of the Code, the conversion formula shall be adjusted, if the Company
determines that such adjustment is necessary, to comply with Section 424(a)
of the Code. If the foregoing calculation results in an assumed Option being
exercisable for a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock, then the number
of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to such option shall be rounded up
to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock. Except as
otherwise set forth in this Section 2.4, the term, status as an "incentive
stock option" under Section 422 of the Code, if applicable, all applicable
restrictions or limitations on transfer and vesting and all other terms and
conditions of the Options will, to the extent permitted by law and otherwise
reasonably practicable, be unchanged. As soon as practicable following the
date of this Agreement, the Board of Directors of the Company (or, if
appropriate, any committee thereof administering the Stock Plans) shall adopt
such resolutions or take such other actions as may be required to effect the
provisions of this Section 2.4(a). As used in this Agreement, "Options" means
any option granted, and not exercised, expired or terminated, to a current or
former employee, director or independent contractor of the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries or any predecessor thereof to purchase shares of
Company Common Stock pursuant to Westport Resources Corporation 2000 Stock
Incentive Plan, as amended, Westport Resources Corporation 2000 Directors\'
Stock Option Plan, Westport Resources Corporation 2000 Stock Option Plan,
Belco Oil and Gas Corp. 1996 Non-employee Directors\' Stock Option Plan, as
amended, Belco Oil and Gas Corp. 1996 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended, or any
other stock option, stock bonus, stock award, or stock purchase plan,
program, or arrangement of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or
any predecessor thereof (collectively, the "Stock Plans") or any
other contract or agreement entered into by the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries.   (b) At the Effective Time, each of the then
outstanding awards of Restricted Stock (as defined below) shall be (i)
assumed by Parent, in accordance with the terms of the applicable Stock Plan
and award agreement by which it is evidenced, except that from and after the
Effective Time, Parent and its Board of Directors or Compensation Committee,
as the case may be, shall be substituted for the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries and their respective Boards of Directors and committees thereof
administering any such Stock Plan, and (ii) converted into an award of
restricted Parent Common Stock that is determined by the Exchange Ratio. Each
such award of restricted Parent Common Stock will be subject to the same
restrictions (including with respect to transfer and vesting) as in the
original award of Restricted Stock. If the foregoing calculation results in
the assumption of an award of Restricted Stock that would include a fraction
of a share of Parent Common Stock, then the number of shares of Parent Common
Stock subject to such award shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number
of shares of Parent Common Stock. As soon as practicable following the date
of this Agreement, the Board of Directors of the Company (or, if appropriate,
any committee thereof administering the Stock Plans) shall adopt such
resolutions or take such other actions as may be required to effect the
provisions of this Section 2.4(b). As used in this Agreement, "Restricted
Stock" means any outstanding award of restricted Company Common Stock with
respect to which the restrictions have not lapsed, and which award shall not
have previously expired or terminated, to a current or former employee,
director or independent contractor of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries or any predecessor thereof pursuant to any applicable Stock Plan
or any other contract or agreement entered into by the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries.   (c) As soon as reasonably practicable following the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY   Except as publicly disclosed
with reasonable specificity by the Company in the Company SEC Reports (as
defined in Section 3.5(a)) filed with the SEC prior to the date of this
Agreement (excluding the exhibits thereto) and except as set forth on the
disclosure letter (each section of which qualifies the correspondingly
numbered representation and warranty or covenant to the extent specified
therein, provided that any disclosure set forth with respect to
any particular section shall be deemed to be disclosed in reference to all
other applicable sections of this Agreement if the disclosure in respect of
the particular section is sufficient on its face without further inquiry
reasonably to inform Parent of the information required to be disclosed in
respect of the other sections to avoid a breach under the representation and
warranty or covenant corresponding to such other sections) previously
delivered by the Company to Parent (the "Company Disclosure Letter"), the
Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as
follows:   SECTION 3.1. Organization. The Company and each of the
Subsidiaries of the Company (the "Company Subsidiaries") is a corporation,
limited liability company or partnership duly organized, validly existing and
in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization and
has all requisite power and authority to own, operate and lease its
properties and to carry on its business as now conducted. The Company and
each of the Company Subsidiaries is duly qualified and/or licensed, as may be
required, and in good standing in each of the jurisdictions in which the
nature of the business conducted by it or the character of the property
owned, leased or used by it makes such qualification and/or licensing
necessary, except in such jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified
and/or licensed, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. A "Company
Material Adverse Effect" means a material adverse effect on (i) the business,
operations, assets, liabilities, condition (financial or otherwise)
or results of operations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
considered as a single enterprise or (ii) the ability of the Company to
perform its obligations under this Agreement or to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that any
event, condition, change, occurrence or development of a state of
circumstances which (i) adversely affects the oil and gas exploration and
development industry generally (including without limitation changes in
commodity prices, general market prices and regulatory changes), in the Gulf
of Mexico or in any basin in which at least 10% of the Company\'s proved
reserves are located, (ii) arises out of general economic or industry
conditions (and in each case does not disproportionately affect the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries considered as a single enterprise) or (iii)
(other than with respect to Sections 3.3 and 3.23) arise out of, result from
or relate to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
announcement thereof, shall not be considered in determining whether
a Company Material Adverse Effect has occurred. The copies of the articles
of incorporation and bylaws of the Company which are incorporated by
reference as exhibits to the Company\'s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 2003 are complete and correct copies of such
documents and contain all amendments thereto as in effect on the date of this
Agreement. The copies of the certificate or articles of incorporation and
bylaws of the Company Subsidiaries which were delivered to Parent prior to
the date of this Agreement are complete and correct copies of such documents
and contain all amendments thereto as in effect on the date of this
Agreement.   SECTION 3.2. Capitalization.   (a) As of the date of this
Agreement, the authorized capital stock of the Company consists of (i)
100,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock, 67,867,122 of which are issued
and outstanding, and (ii) 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $.01 par
value, of which 4,370,000 have been designated as 6-1/2% convertible
preferred stock (the "Convertible Preferred Stock"), 2,930,000 of which are
issued and outstanding. As of the date of this Agreement, there are 40,268
shares of Company Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company.
Such issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock and Convertible
Preferred Stock have been duly authorized and validly issued, are fully paid
and nonassessable, and are free of preemptive rights. The Company has
not, subsequent to December 31, 2003, declared or paid any dividend, or
declared or made any distribution on, or authorized the creation or issuance
of, or issued, or authorized or effected any split-up or any other
recapitalization of, any of its capital stock, or directly or indirectly
redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired any of its outstanding capital
stock, other than regular quarterly cash dividends paid on the Convertible
Preferred Stock. Except as set forth in Section 2.5, the Company has not
heretofore agreed to take any such action, and there are no outstanding
contractual obligations of the Company of any kind to redeem, purchase or
otherwise acquire any outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company.
Other than the Company Common Stock, there are no outstanding bonds,
debentures, notes or other indebtedness or securities of the Company having
the right to vote (or, other than issued and outstanding shares of
the Convertible Preferred Stock and the outstanding Options, convertible
into, or exchangeable for, securities having the right to vote) on any
matters on which stockholders of the Company may vote.   (b) Section 3.2(b)
of the Company Disclosure Letter lists all outstanding options, warrants or
other rights to subscribe for, purchase or acquire from the Company or any
Company Subsidiary any capital stock of the Company or securities convertible
into or exchangeable for capital stock of the Company (and the exercise,
conversion, purchase, exchange or other similar price thereof) and
all outstanding Restricted Stock awards. There are no stock appreciation
rights attached to the options, warrants or rights listed in Section 3.2(b)
of the Company Disclosure Letter. Except as set forth above in this Section
3.2 and Section 3.2(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter, no shares of capital
stock or other voting securities of the Company are issued, reserved for
issuance or outstanding, and there are no outstanding securities, options,
warrants, calls, rights, commitments, agreements, arrangements or
undertakings of any kind to which the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them is bound obligating the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to issue, deliver or sell, or
cause to be issued, delivered or sold, additional shares of capital stock or
other voting securities of the Company or of any of the Company Subsidiaries
or obligating the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to issue, grant,
extend or enter into any such security, option, warrant, call, right,
commitment, agreement, arrangement or undertaking.   SECTION 3.3.

transactions contemplated hereby, except for the approval of this Agreement
by the Required Company Stockholder Vote (as defined in Section 3.11(b)).

in accordance with its terms, except to the extent that its enforceability
may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
transfer, reorganization or other laws affecting the enforcement of

Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company nor the

result in a violation or breach of or conflict with the certificate or
articles of incorporation or bylaws of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries, (ii) result in a violation or breach of or conflict with any
provisions of, or constitute a default (or an event which, with notice or
lapse of time or both, would constitute a default) under, or result in the

accelerate the performance required by, or result in a right of termination
or acceleration under, or result in the creation of any Lien (as defined in
Section 3.4) upon any of the properties or assets owned or operated by the

detriment to the Company or any Company Subsidiary under any of the terms,
conditions or provisions of any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of
trust, license, contract, lease, agreement or other instrument or obligation
of any kind to which the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries is a
party or by which the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or any of
their respective properties or assets may be bound or (iii) subject to
obtaining or making the consents, approvals, orders, authorizations,
registrations, declarations and filings referred to in paragraph (c) below,
violate any judgment, ruling, order, writ, injunction, decree, statute, law
(including the common law), rule or regulation applicable to the Company or
any of the Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or
assets, other than any such event described in items (ii) or (iii)
which, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably
be expected to have or result in a Company Material Adverse Effect.   (c)
No consent, approval, order or authorization of, or registration, declaration
or filing with, any governmental or regulatory authority is necessary to be

redemption (including any rights of conversion or exchange under any
outstanding security or other instrument) for any of the capital stock or
other equity interests of, or other ownership interests in, any Company
Subsidiaries. There are no agreements requiring the Company or any Company
Subsidiary to make contributions to the capital of, or lend or advance funds
to, any Company Subsidiary. As used in this Agreement, "Lien" means,
with respect to any asset, any mortgage, lien, pledge, charge, security
interest or encumbrance of any kind in respect of such asset.   SECTION
3.5. SEC Reports and Financial Statements.   (a) Since January 1, 2001, the
Company has filed with the SEC all forms, reports, schedules, registration

effect to any amendments or supplements thereto filed prior to the date of

of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to such Company SEC Reports, and
none of the Company SEC Reports contained any untrue statement of a material

(b) The consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated

respects with applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, have been prepared in conformity
with United States generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") (except,

position and the consolidated results of operations and cash flows of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries as of the dates or for the periods
presented therein (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal

Except as reflected in the Company Financial Statements, neither the Company
nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations of any

liabilities incurred since December 31, 2003 which, individually or in the
aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have
a Company Material Adverse Effect.   (c) Since January 1, 2001, the Company

Disclosure Letter is a list of all off-balance sheet special purpose entities
and financing arrangements of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries.  
(d) With respect to each annual report on Form 10-K, each quarterly report on
Form 10-Q and each amendment of any such report included in the Company
SEC Reports filed since August 29, 2002, the chief executive officer and
chief financial officer of the Company have made all certifications required
by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the "Sarbanes-Oxley Act") and any related
rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC and the NYSE, and the statements
contained in any such certifications are complete and correct.   (e) The
Company has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as
such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act);
such disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that material
information relating to the Company required to be disclosed in the
Company\'s Exchange Act Reports, including its consolidated
Company Subsidiaries, is made known to the Company\'s principal executive
officer and its principal financial officer by others within those entities,
particularly during the periods in which the periodic reports required under
the Exchange Act are being prepared; and, to the knowledge of the Company,
such disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting the
Company\'s principal executive officer and its principal financial officer to
material information required to be included in the Company\'s periodic
reports required under the Exchange Act.   (f) The Company is, or will
timely be, in compliance in all material respects with all current and

destruction or other casualty loss (whether or not covered by insurance)
affecting the business or assets owned or operated by the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries; or   (c) any event, condition, action or occurrence

Effective Time, would constitute a breach of Section 5.1(b).   SECTION 3.7.
Litigation. There are no suits, actions or legal, administrative, arbitration
or other proceedings or governmental investigations pending or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened, to which the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries is a party which, individually or in the aggregate, has
had or would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. There are no judgments, decrees, injunctions, rules, awards or orders
of any governmental or regulatory entity or arbitrator outstanding against
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries which, individually or in the
aggregate, have had or would reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.   SECTION 3.8. Information Supplied. None

Form S-4 to be filed with the SEC by Parent in connection with the issuance
of Parent Common Stock in the Merger (the "Form S-4") will, at the time the
Form S-4 is filed with the SEC, at any time it is amended or supplemented or

Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. No representation or
warranty is made by the Company with respect to statements made or
incorporated by reference therein based on information supplied by Parent
specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Form S-4 or
the Joint Proxy Statement.   SECTION 3.9. Broker\'s or Finder\'s Fees. (a)
Except for Credit Suisse First Boston LLC (the "Company Financial Advisor")
and Petrie Parkman and Co., no agent, broker, Person or firm acting on behalf
of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or under the Company\'s or any
Company Subsidiary\'s authority is or will be entitled to any advisory,
commission or broker\'s or finder\'s fee or commission from any of the
parties hereto in connection with any of the transactions contemplated
hereby. The Company has furnished to Parent a true and complete copy of the
Company\'s agreement with the Company Financial Advisor (the
"Company Engagement Letter") and the Company\'s agreement with Petrie Parkman
and Co. pursuant to which each of the Company Financial Advisor and Petrie
Parkman and Co., respectively, is entitled to a fee in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby.   SECTION 3.10. Employee Plans. (a) There
are no Company Employee Benefit Plans established, maintained, adopted,
participated in, sponsored, contributed or required to be contributed to,
provided, promised to provide, terminated by, or resulting in any material
liability to the Company or any entity with which the Company is considered a
single employer under Section 414(b), (c) or (m) of the Code ("Company ERISA
Affiliates"). As used in this Agreement, "Company Employee Benefit Plan"
means any plan, program, policy, practice, agreement or other arrangement
providing compensation or benefits in any form to any current or former
employee, independent contractor, officer or director of the Company or any
of the Company Subsidiaries or any beneficiary or dependent thereof, whether
written or unwritten, formal or informal, including without limitation any
"employee welfare benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(1) of
ERISA ("Company Employee Welfare Benefit Plan"), any "employee pension
benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA (whether or not
such plan is subject to ERISA) ("Company Employee Pension Benefit Plan") and
any other pension, profit-sharing, bonus, incentive compensation, deferred
compensation, vacation, sick pay, stock purchase, stock option, phantom
equity, severance, employment, consulting, unemployment, hospitalization or
other medical, life, or other insurance, long- or short-term disability,
change of control, fringe benefit, or any other plan, program or policy.  
(b) With respect to each Company Employee Benefit Plan, the Company has made
available to Parent a true, correct and complete copy of: (i) each
writing constituting a part of such Company Employee Benefit Plan (including,
but not limited to, the plan document(s), adoption agreement, prototype or
volume submitter documents, trust agreement, annuity contract, third
party administrative contracts, and insurance contracts) and all amendments
thereto; (ii) the three most recent Annual Reports (Form 5500 Series)
including all applicable schedules, if required; (iii) the current summary
plan description and any material modifications thereto, if required to be
furnished under ERISA, or any written summary provided to participants with
respect to any plan for which no summary plan description exists; (iv) the
most recent determination letter (or if applicable, advisory or opinion
letter) from the Internal Revenue Service, if any, or if an application for a
determination letter is pending, the application with all attachments; and
(v) all notices given to such Company Employee Benefit Plan, the Company, or
any ERISA Affiliate by the Internal Revenue Service, Department of Labor,
Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation, or other governmental agency relating
to such Company Employee Benefit Plan.   (c) Each Company Employee Benefit
Plan that is intended to be "qualified" within the meaning of Section 401(a),
401(f), or 403(a) of the Code and, to the extent applicable, Section 401(k)
of the Code ("Qualified Company Employee Benefit Plan"), has received a
favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service that has not
been revoked, and no event has occurred and no condition exists that could
reasonably be expected to adversely affect the qualified status of any such
Company Employee Benefit Plan. For the avoidance of doubt, the term
"favorable determination letter" as used in this Section 3.10(c) does not
include an opinion letter or advisory letter issued with respect to a master
and prototype or volume submitter plan. Any favorable determination
letters referenced in this Section 3.10(c) cover "GUST" as defined in
footnote 2 of IRS Notice 2003-49. Each Qualified Company Employee Benefit
Plan has timely made "good faith" amendments to comply with the Economic
Growth and Tax Reconciliation Relief Act of 2001 as required by IRS Notice
2001-42. The trusts established under the Qualified Company Employee Benefit
Plans are exempt from federal income taxes under Section 501(a) of the Code
and any potential excise taxes.   (d) The Company has (i) filed or caused
to be filed all returns and reports on the Company Employee Benefit Plans
that it and/or any such plan are required to file and (ii) paid or made
adequate provision for all fees, interest, penalties, assessments or
deficiencies that have become due pursuant to those returns or reports or
pursuant to any assessment or adjustment that has been made relating to those
returns or reports. All other fees, interest, penalties and assessments that
are payable by or for the Company have been timely reported, fully paid and
discharged. There are no unpaid fees, penalties, interest or assessments due
from the Company or from any other person or entity relative to any Company
Employee Benefit Plan. The Company has collected or withheld all amounts that
are required to be collected or withheld by it to discharge its obligations,
and all of those amounts have been paid to the appropriate governmental
authority or set aside in appropriate accounts for future payment when
due.   (e) The funding, if any, under each Company Employee Welfare Benefit
Plan does not exceed and has not exceeded the limitations under Sections
419A(b) and 419A(c) of the Code. The Company is not subject to taxation on
the income of any Company Employee Welfare Benefit Plan\'s welfare benefit
fund (as such term is defined in Section 419(e) of the Code) under Section
419A(g) of the Code. All Company Welfare Employee Benefit Plans required to
comply with the health care continuation coverage ("COBRA") provisions of
ERISA and the Code have complied with such requirements in all material
respects.   (f) Each Company Employee Benefit Plan has been operated and
administered in all material respects in accordance with its provisions. All
contributions required to be made to any Company Employee Benefit Plan (or to
any person pursuant to the terms thereof) have been made or the amount of
such payment or contribution obligation has been reflected in the Company SEC
Reports which are publicly available prior to the date of this Agreement. All
such contributions representing participant contributions have been made
within the time required by Department of Labor regulation section
2510.3-102.   (g) The Company and the Company Subsidiaries have complied,
and are now in compliance, in all material respects, with all provisions of
ERISA, the Code and all laws and regulations applicable to the Company
Employee Benefit Plans. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has
engaged in any prohibited transaction, within the meaning of Section 4975 of
the Code or Section 406 of ERISA, as a fiduciary or party in interest with
respect to any Company Employee Benefit Plan, and, to the knowledge of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary, (x) no prohibited transaction has occurred
with respect to any Company Employee Benefit Plan and (y) no fiduciary has
any liability for breach of fiduciary duty or any other failure to act or
comply in connection with the administration or investment of assets of any
Company Employee Benefit Plan.   (h) Neither the Company nor any ERISA
Affiliate has ever established, maintained, contributed to, or had an
obligation to contribute to, any Company Employee Benefit Plan that is a
"multiemployer plan," as that term is defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA, or
is subject to Title IV of ERISA, and no liability under Title IV of ERISA
(including a liability to pay premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation) has been or is expected to be incurred by the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries.   (i) The Company and the Company Subsidiaries
have not offered to provide life, health or medical benefits or insurance
coverage to any individual, or to the family members of any individual, for
any period extending beyond the termination of the individual\'s employment,
except to the extent required by the COBRA provisions in ERISA and the Code
or similar provisions of state law.   (j) The consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not, either alone or in
connection with termination of employment, (i) entitle any current or former
employee, independent contractor, director, or officer of the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries to severance pay, any change in control payment, or any
other material payment, except as expressly provided in this Agreement, (ii)
accelerate the time of payment or vesting, change the form or method of
payment, or increase the amount of compensation due, any such employee,
independent contractor, director, or officer, or (iii) entitle any such
employee, independent contractor, director or officer to any gross-up
or similar material payment in respect of the excise tax described in Section
4999 of the Code. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has taken
any action that would result in its incurring any obligation for any payments
or benefits described in subsections (i), (ii) or (iii) of this Section
3.10(j) (without regard to whether the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are consummated) except to the extent required in a written
contract or agreement in existence as of the date of this Agreement.   (k)
There are no suits, actions, proceedings, investigations, claims or orders
pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company,
any Company Subsidiary or any Company Employee Benefit Plan related to any
Company Employee Benefit Plan (other than claims in the ordinary course
of business). No Employee Benefit Plan is subject to any ongoing
audit, investigation, or other administrative proceeding of any governmental
entity, and no Plan is the subject of any pending application for
administrative relief under any voluntary compliance program or closing
agreement program of the Internal Revenue Service or the Department of
Labor.   (l) The Company has the right to amend or terminate each Company
Employee Benefit Plan at any time without incurring any liability other than
with respect to benefits that have already accrued under a Company Employee
Pension Benefit Plan.   (m) Without limiting the generality of any other
representation contained herein, there exists no lien against the Company,
any Company Subsidiary, any ERISA Affiliate, or any of their assets arising
under sections 302(f) or 4068(A) of ERISA or section 412(n) of the Code.  
(n) Neither the Company nor any Company ERISA Affiliate has a formal
plan, commitment, or proposal, whether legally binding or not, nor has any of
them made a commitment to employees, officers, directors, consultants or
independent contractors to create any additional Company Employee Benefit
Plan or modify, change or terminate any existing Company Employee Benefit
Plan, and no such plan, commitment or proposal is under serious
consideration. No events have occurred or are expected to occur with respect
to any Company Employee Benefit Plan that would cause a material change in
the cost of providing the benefits under such plan or would cause a material
change in the cost of providing for other liabilities of such plan.   (o)
As used in this Agreement "ERISA" means the Employee Retirement
Income Securities Act of 1974, as amended, and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder.   SECTION 3.11. Board Recommendation; Company
Action; Requisite Vote of the Company\'s Stockholders.   (a) The Board of
Directors of the Company has, by resolutions duly adopted by the requisite
vote of the directors present at a meeting of such board duly called and held
on April 6, 2004 and not subsequently rescinded or modified in any way,
unanimously (i) determined that this Agreement, the Merger, in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement, and the other transactions contemplated
hereby are advisable and in the best interests of the Company, (ii) approved
and adopted this Agreement and approved the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby, (iii) directed that this Agreement be submitted for
consideration by the stockholders of the Company at the Company Stockholders
Meeting and (iv) recommended that the stockholders of the Company approve
this Agreement (provided that any change in or modification or recission of
such recommendation by the Board of Directors of the Company in
accordance with Section 6.10(a) shall not be a breach of the representation
in this clause (iv)). The Company hereby confirms that (A) the Company has
properly opted out of, and is not subject to, Sections 78.411 through 78.444
of the NRS, and (B) to the knowledge of the Company, no other "fair price,"
"moratorium," "control share acquisition" or other antitakeover statute or
similar statute or regulation, applies or purports to apply to this Agreement
or the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The
Board of Directors of the Company has received from the Company Financial
Advisor an opinion, a written copy of which will be provided to Parent,
solely for informational purposes promptly after receipt thereof by the
Company, to the effect that, as of the date of the opinion, the Exchange
Ratio is fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of the Company
Common Stock. The Company has been authorized by the Company Financial
Advisor to include such opinion in its entirety in the Joint Proxy Statement
included in the Form S-4, so long as such inclusion is in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Company Financial Advisor and its counsel.  
(b) The affirmative vote of stockholders of the Company required for adoption
of this Agreement and the Merger is and will be no greater than a majority of
the issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the "Required
Company Stockholder Vote").   SECTION 3.12. Taxes.   (a) Each of the
Company and each Company Subsidiary has timely filed all material federal,

prescribed by applicable law and all such Tax Returns are true, complete and
correct in all material respects. All Taxes shown as due on such Tax Returns
have been paid in full and the Company and each Company Subsidiary has made
adequate provision (or adequate provision has been made on its behalf) for
all accrued Taxes not yet due. The accruals and reserves for Taxes
reflected in the Company\'s Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31,
2003 are adequate to cover all Taxes accruing through such date. The Company
and the Company Subsidiaries have withheld and paid over all material Taxes
required to have been withheld and paid over, and complied in all material
respects with all information reporting and backup withholding requirements,
including the maintenance of required records with respect thereto, in
connection with amounts paid or owing to any employee, creditor, independent
contractor or other third party. There are no material Liens on any of the
assets, rights or properties of the Company or any Company Subsidiary with
respect to Taxes, other than Liens for Taxes not yet due and payable or for
Taxes that the Company or a Company Subsidiary is contesting in good faith
through appropriate proceedings. Except as has not, and would not reasonably
be expected to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect, all hedging
transactions entered into by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries
have been properly identified for federal income tax purposes.   (b) As of
the date of this Agreement, no federal, state, local or foreign audits or
other administrative proceedings or court proceedings are presently pending
with regard to any Taxes or Tax Returns of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary, and neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has
received a written notice of any material pending or proposed claims, audits
or proceedings with respect to Taxes. No material deficiencies have been
asserted in writing against the Company or any Company Subsidiary as a result
of examinations by any state, local, federal or foreign taxing authority and
no material issue has been raised by any examination conducted by any state,
local, federal or foreign taxing authority that, by application of the same
principles, might result in a proposed deficiency for any other period not so
examined which deficiency (or deficiencies), in either case, is not (or are
not) adequately reserved for in the most recent Company Financial Statements.
Each material deficiency resulting from any audit or examination relating to
Taxes of the Company or any Company Subsidiary by any taxing authority has
been paid or is being contested in good faith and in accordance with law and
is adequately reserved for on the balance sheets contained in the Company
Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP. No claim is pending and no
claim has ever been made that has not been resolved by an authority in a
jurisdiction where the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries does not
file Tax Returns that the Company or any Company Subsidiary, as the case may
be, is or may be subject to Tax in that jurisdiction. Neither the Company nor
any Company Subsidiary is subject to any private letter ruling of the
Internal Revenue Service or comparable rulings of other tax authorities that
will be binding on the Company or any Company Subsidiary with respect to any
period following the Closing Date. Neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary has granted any power of attorney which is currently in force with
respect to any income, franchise or similar Taxes or any income, franchise or
similar Tax Returns.   (c) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary

Return which Tax Return has not yet been filed. There are no agreements,
waivers of statutes of limitations, or other arrangements providing for
extensions of time in respect of the assessment or collection of any unpaid
Taxes against the Company or any Company Subsidiary. The Company and each
Company Subsidiary have disclosed on their federal income tax returns all
positions taken therein that could, if not so disclosed, give rise to a
substantial understatement penalty within the meaning of Section 6662 of the
Code. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has been a party to a

Tax sharing agreement, Tax indemnity obligation or similar agreement,
arrangement or practice with respect to Taxes (including any advance pricing
agreement, closing agreement or other agreement relating to Taxes with any
taxing authority).   (e) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is a
party to any agreement, contract, or arrangement that, individually or
collectively, would give rise to the payment of any amount (whether in cash
or property, including shares of capital stock) that would not be deductible
pursuant to the terms of Section 280G of the Code or would be subject to the
excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code, or, to the knowledge of the
Company, that would not be deductible pursuant to the terms of Sections
162(a)(1), 162(m) or 162(n) of the Code.   (f) Neither the Company nor any

Subsidiary, or any assets held by the Company or any Company Subsidiary any
consent under Section 341 of the Code.   (g) Neither the Company nor any

of Section 168(f)(8) of the Code, as in effect prior to amendment by The Tax
Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982. None of the property owned by
the Company or a Company Subsidiary is "tax-exempt use property" within the
meaning of Section 168(h) of the Code. Neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary is required to make any adjustment under Code Section 481(a) by
reason of a change in accounting method or otherwise.   (j) There have not
been, within two years of the date of this Agreement, any (i) redemptions by

MERGER SUB    Except as publicly disclosed with reasonable specificity by
Parent in the Parent SEC Reports (as defined in Section 4.4(a)) filed with
the SEC prior to the date of this Agreement (excluding the exhibits thereto)
and except as set forth on the disclosure letter (each section of which
qualifies the correspondingly numbered representation and warranty or
covenant to the extent specified therein, provided that any disclosure set
forth with respect to any particular section shall be deemed to be disclosed
in reference to all other applicable sections of this Agreement if the
disclosure in respect of the particular section is sufficient on its face
without further inquiry reasonably to inform the Company of the information
required to be disclosed in respect of the other sections to avoid a breach
under the representation and warranty or covenant corresponding to such other
sections) previously delivered by Parent to the Company (the "Parent
Disclosure Letter"), the Parent and Merger Sub hereby jointly and severally
represent and warrant to the Company as follows:   SECTION 4.1.
Organization. Parent and each of the Subsidiaries of the Parent (the "Parent

own, operate and lease its properties and to carry on its business as now
conducted. Parent and each of the Parent Subsidiaries is duly
qualified and/or licensed, as may be required, and in good standing in each
of the jurisdictions in which the nature of the business conducted by it or
the character of the property owned, leased or used by it makes such
qualification and/or licensing necessary, except in such jurisdictions where

aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent

adverse effect on (i) the business, operations, assets, liabilities,
condition (financial or otherwise) or results of operations of the Parent and
the Parent Subsidiaries considered as a single enterprise or (ii) the ability
of the Parent to perform its obligations under this Agreement or to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided,
however, that any event, condition, change, occurrence or development of a
state of circumstances which (i) adversely affects the oil and gas

Subsidiaries and their respective jurisdictions of organization are
identified in Section 4.4(a) of the Parent Disclosure Letter. All of the
outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity securities of, or other

funds to, any Parent Subsidiary.   SECTION 4.5. SEC Reports and Financial
Statements. (a) Since January 1, 2001, Parent has filed with the SEC all
forms, reports, schedules, registration statements, definitive proxy
statements and other documents (collectively, including all exhibits thereto,
the "Parent SEC Reports") required to be filed by Parent with the SEC. As of
their respective dates, and giving effect to any amendments or supplements
thereto filed prior to the date of this Agreement, the Parent SEC Reports
complied in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act
and the Exchange Act, and the respective rules and regulations of the SEC
promulgated thereunder applicable to such Parent SEC Reports, and none of the
Parent SEC Reports contained any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. None of the Parent Subsidiaries is
required to file any forms, reports or other documents with the SEC pursuant
to Section 13 or 15 of the Exchange Act.   (b) The consolidated balance
sheets and the related consolidated statements of operations, consolidated
statements of stockholders\' equity and comprehensive income (loss) and
consolidated statements of cash flows (including, in each case, any related
notes and schedules thereto) (collectively, the "Parent Financial
Statements") of Parent contained in the Parent SEC Reports have been prepared
from the books and records of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries, comply as
to form in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and
the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, have
been prepared in conformity with GAAP (except, in the case of unaudited
statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) applied on a consistent
basis during the periods involved (except as otherwise noted therein) and
present fairly the consolidated financial position and the
consolidated results of operations and cash flows of Parent and the Parent
Subsidiaries as of the dates or for the periods presented therein (subject,
in the case of unaudited statements, to normal and recurring year-end
adjustments in the ordinary course of business). Except as reflected in the
Parent Financial Statements, neither Parent nor any of the Parent
Subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether

incurred since December 31, 2003 which, individually or in the aggregate,
have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect.   (c) Parent has not received written notice from the SEC or
any other governmental entity that any of its accounting policies or
practices are or may be the subject of any review, inquiry, investigation or
challenge by the SEC or other governmental entity. Since January 1, 2001,
Parent\'s independent public accounting firm has not informed Parent that it
has any material questions, challenges or disagreements regarding or
pertaining to Parent\'s accounting policies or practices. Since January 1,
2001, to the knowledge of Parent, no officer or director of Parent has
received, or is entitled to receive, any material compensation from any
entity that has engaged in or is engaging in any material transaction with
Parent or any Parent Subsidiary. Set forth in Section 4.4(d) of the Parent
Disclosure Letter is a list of all off-balance sheet special purpose entities
and financing arrangements of the Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries.   (d)
With respect to each annual report on Form 10-K, each quarterly report on
Form 10-Q and each amendment of any such report included in the Parent
SEC Reports filed since August 29, 2002, the chief executive officer and
chief financial officer of Parent have made all certifications required by
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and any related rules and regulations promulgated by
the SEC and the NYSE, and the statements contained in any such certifications
are complete and correct.   (e) Parent has established and maintains
disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e)
or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act); such disclosure controls and procedures
are designed to ensure that material information relating to Parent required
to be disclosed in Parent\'s Exchange Act Reports, including its consolidated
Parent Subsidiaries, is made known to Parent\'s principal executive officer
and its principal financial officer by others within those entities,
particularly during the periods in which the periodic reports required under
the Exchange Act are being prepared; and, to the knowledge of Parent, such
disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting Parent\'s
principal executive officer and its principal financial officer to material
information required to be included in Parent\'s periodic reports required
under the Exchange Act.   (f) Parent is, or will timely be, in compliance in
all material respects with all current and proposed listing and corporate
governance requirements of the NYSE, and is in compliance in all material
respects, and will continue to remain in compliance from the date hereof
until immediately after the Effective Time, with all rules, regulations and
requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the SEC.   SECTION 4.6. Absence

would reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect;  
(b) any material damage, destruction or other casualty loss (whether or
not covered by insurance) affecting the business or assets owned or operated
by the Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries; or   (c) any event, condition,
action or occurrence that, if taken during the period from the date of this
Agreement through the Effective Time, would constitute a breach of Section
5.2.   SECTION 4.7. Litigation. There are no suits, actions or
legal, administrative, arbitration or other proceedings or governmental
investigations pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened, to which
Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries is a party which, individually or in
the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. There are no judgments, decrees, injunctions, rules,
awards or orders of any governmental or regulatory entity or arbitrator
outstanding against Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries which,
individually or in the aggregate, have had or would reasonably be expected to
have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.   SECTION 4.8. Information Supplied.
None of the information supplied or to be supplied by Parent specifically for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i) the Form S-4 will, at the time
the Form S-4 is filed with the SEC, at any time it is amended or supplemented
or at the time it becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any

Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the

form in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act and
the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the rules and regulations thereunder. No
representation or warranty is made by Parent with respect to statements made
or incorporated by reference therein based on information supplied by the
Company specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Joint
Proxy Statement or the Form S-4.   SECTION 4.9. Broker\'s or Finder\'s Fees.
Except for Lehman Brothers Inc. (the "Parent Financial Advisor"), no agent,
broker, Person or firm acting on behalf of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary or
under Parent\'s or any Parent Subsidiary\'s authority is or will be entitled
to any advisory, commission or broker\'s or finder\'s fee or commission from
any of the parties hereto in connection with any of the transactions
contemplated hereby. Parent has furnished to the Company a true and complete
copy of Parent\'s agreement with the Parent Financial Advisor (the "Parent
Engagement Letter") pursuant to which the Parent Financial Advisor is
entitled to a fee in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby.   SECTION 4.10. Employee Plans.   (a) There are no Parent Employee
Benefit Plans established, maintained, adopted, participated in, sponsored,
contributed or required to be contributed to, provided, promised to provide,
terminated by, or resulting in any material liability to the Parent or any
entity with which the Parent is considered a single employer under Section
414(b), (c) or (m) of the Code ("Parent ERISA Affiliates"). As used in this
Agreement, "Parent Employee Benefit Plan" means any plan, program, policy,
practice, agreement or other arrangement providing compensation or benefits
in any form to any current or former employee, independent contractor,
officer or director of the Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries or any
beneficiary or dependent thereof, whether written or unwritten, formal or
informal, including without limitation any "employee welfare benefit plan"
within the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA ("Parent Employee Welfare Benefit
Plan"), any "employee pension benefit plan" within the meaning of Section
3(2) of ERISA (whether or not such plan is subject to ERISA) ("Parent
Employee Pension Benefit Plan") and any other pension, profit-sharing, bonus,
incentive compensation, deferred compensation, vacation, sick pay,
stock purchase, stock option, phantom equity, severance, employment,
consulting, unemployment, hospitalization or other medical, life, or other
insurance, long- or short-term disability, change of control, fringe benefit,
or any other plan, program or policy.   (b) With respect to each Parent
Employee Benefit Plan, Parent has made available to the Company a true,
correct and complete copy of: (i) each writing constituting a part of such
Parent Employee Benefit Plan (including, but not limited to, the plan
document(s), adoption agreement, prototype or volume submitter documents,
trust agreement, annuity contract, third party administrative contracts, and
insurance contracts) and all amendments thereto; (ii) the three most recent
Annual Reports (Form 5500 Series) including all applicable schedules, if
required; (iii) the current summary plan description and any material
modifications thereto, if required to be furnished under ERISA, or any
written summary provided to participants with respect to any plan for which
no summary plan description exists; (iv) the most recent determination letter
(or if applicable, advisory or opinion letter) from the Internal
Revenue Service, if any, or if an application for a determination letter is
pending, the application with all attachments; and (v) all notices given to
such Parent Employee Benefit Plan, the Parent, or any Parent ERISA Affiliate
by the Internal Revenue Service, Department of Labor, Pension Benefit
Guarantee Corporation, or other governmental agency relating to such Parent
Employee Benefit Plan.   (c) Each Parent Employee Benefit Plan that is
intended to be "qualified" within the meaning of Section 401(a), 401(f), or
403(a) of the Code and, to the extent applicable, Section 401(k) of the Code
("Qualified Parent Employee Benefit Plan"), has received a favorable
determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service that has not been
revoked, and no event has occurred and no condition exists that could
reasonably be expected to adversely affect the qualified status of any such
Parent Employee Benefit Plan. For the avoidance of doubt, the term "favorable
determination letter" as used in this Section 4.10(c) does not include an
opinion letter or advisory letter issued with respect to a master and prototype
or volume submitter plan. Any favorable determination letters referenced in
this Section 4.10(c) cover "GUST" as defined in footnote 2 of IRS Notice
2003-49. Each Qualified Parent Employee Benefit Plan has timely made "good
faith" amendments to comply with the Economic Growth and Tax Reconciliation
Relief Act of 2001 as required by IRS Notice 2001-42. The trusts established
under the Qualified Parent Employee Benefit Plans are exempt from federal
income taxes under Section 501(a) of the Code and any potential
excise taxes.   (d) Parent has (i) filed or caused to be filed all returns
and reports on the Parent Employee Benefit Plans that it and/or any such plan
are required to file and (ii) paid or made adequate provision for all fees,
interest, penalties, assessments or deficiencies that have become due
pursuant to those returns or reports or pursuant to any assessment or
adjustment that has been made relating to those returns or reports. All other
fees, interest, penalties and assessments that are payable by or for Parent
have been timely reported, fully paid and discharged. There are no unpaid
fees, penalties, interest or assessments due from Parent or from any other
person or entity relative to any Parent Employee Benefit Plan. Parent has
collected or withheld all amounts that are required to be collected or
withheld by it to discharge its obligations, and all of those amounts have
been paid to the appropriate governmental authority or set aside
in appropriate accounts for future payment when due.   (e) The funding, if
any, under each Parent Employee Welfare Benefit Plan does not exceed and has
not exceeded the limitations under Sections 419A(b) and 419A(c) of the Code.
Parent is not subject to taxation on the income of any Parent Employee
Welfare Benefit Plan\'s welfare benefit fund (as such term is defined in
Section 419(e) of the Code) under Section 419A(g) of the Code. All Parent
Welfare Employee Benefit Plans required to comply with the health
care continuation coverage ("COBRA") provisions of ERISA and the Code have
complied with such requirements in all material respects   (f) Each Parent
Employee Benefit Plan has been operated and administered in all material
respects in accordance with its provisions. All contributions required to be
made to any Parent Employee Benefit Plan (or to any person pursuant to the
terms thereof) have been made or the amount of such payment or contribution
obligation has been reflected in the Parent SEC Reports which are publicly
available prior to the date of this Agreement. All such
contributions representing participant contributions have been made within
the time required by Department of Labor regulation section 2510.3-102.  
(g) Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries have complied, and are now
in compliance, in all material respects, with all provisions of ERISA, the
Code and all laws and regulations applicable to the Parent Employee Benefit
Plans. Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has engaged in any
prohibited transaction, within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code or
Section 406 of ERISA, as a fiduciary or party in interest with respect to any
Parent Employee Benefit Plan, and, to the knowledge of Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary, (x) no prohibited transaction has occurred with respect to any
Parent Employee Benefit Plan and (y) no fiduciary has any liability for
breach of fiduciary duty or any other failure to act or comply in connection
with the administration or investment of any Parent Employee Benefit
Plan.   (h) Neither Parent nor any Parent ERISA Affiliate has ever
established, maintained, contributed to, or had an obligation to contribute
to, any Parent Employee Benefit Plan that is a "multiemployer plan," as that
term is defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA, or is subject to Title IV of
ERISA. Neither Parent nor any Parent ERISA Affiliate has any liability under
Title IV of ERISA (including a liability to pay premiums to the Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corporation), and no such liability has been or is expected
to be incurred by Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries.   (i) Parent
and Parent Subsidiaries have not offered to provide life, health or medical
benefits or insurance coverage to any individual, or to the family members of
any individual, for any period extending beyond the termination of the
individual\'s employment, except to the extent required by the
COBRA provisions in ERISA and the Code or any similar provisions of state
law.   (j) The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will not, either alone or in connection with termination of
employment, (i) entitle any current or former employee, independent
contractor, director, or officer of the Parent or the Parent Subsidiaries to
any material payment, except as expressly provided in this Agreement, or (ii)
accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or increase the amount of
compensation due, any such employee, independent contractor, directors, or
officer. Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has taken any action that
would result in its incurring any obligation for any payments described in
this Section 4.10(j) except to the extent required in a written plan,
contract or agreement in existence as of the date of this Agreement.   (k)
There are no suits, actions, proceedings, investigations, claims or orders
pending or, to the knowledge of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, threatened
against the Parent, any Parent Subsidiary, or any Parent Employee Benefit
Plan related to any Parent Employee Benefit Plan (other than claims in the
ordinary course of business). No Parent Employee Benefit Plan is subject
to any ongoing audit, investigation, or other administrative proceeding of
any governmental entity, and no Plan is the subject of any pending
application for administrative relief under any voluntary compliance program
or closing agreement program of the Internal Revenue Service or the
Department of Labor.   (l) Parent has the right to amend or terminate each
Parent Employee Benefit Plan at any time without incurring any liability
other than with respect to benefits that have already accrued under a Parent
Employee Pension Benefit Plan.   (m) Without limiting the generality of any
other representation contained herein, there exists no lien against Parent,
any Parent Subsidiary, any Parent ERISA Affiliate, or any of their assets
arising under sections 302(f) or 4068(A) of ERISA or section 412(n) of the
Code.   (n) Neither Parent nor any Parent ERISA Affiliate has a formal
plan, commitment, or proposal, whether legally binding or not, nor has any of
them made a commitment to employees, officers, directors, consultants or
independent contractors to create any additional Parent Employee Benefit Plan
or modify, change or terminate any existing Parent Employee Benefit Plan, and
no such plan, commitment or proposal is under serious consideration. No
events have occurred or are expected to occur with respect to any Parent
Employee Benefit Plan that would cause a material change in the cost of
providing the benefits under such plan or would cause a material change in
the cost of providing or other liabilities of such plan.   SECTION 4.11.
Taxes   (a) Each of Parent and each Parent Subsidiary has timely filed all
material federal, state, local, and other Tax Returns required to be filed by
it in the manner prescribed by applicable law and all such Tax Returns are
true, complete and correct in all material respects. All Taxes shown as due
on such Returns have been paid in full and Parent and each Parent Subsidiary
has made adequate provision (or adequate provision has been made on its
behalf) for all accrued Taxes not yet due. The accruals and reserves for
Taxes reflected in the Parent\'s Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December
31, 2003 are adequate to cover all Taxes accruing through such date. Parent
and the Parent Subsidiaries have withheld and paid over all material Taxes
required to have been withheld and paid over, and complied in all material
respects with all information reporting and backup withholding requirements,
including the maintenance of required records with respect thereto, in
connection with amounts paid or owing to any employee, creditor, independent
contractor or other third party. There are no material Liens on any of the
assets, rights or properties of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary with respect
to Taxes, other than Liens for Taxes not yet due and payable or for Taxes
that Parent or a Parent Subsidiary is contesting in good faith through
appropriate proceedings. Except as has not, and would not reasonably be
expected to have, a Parent Material Adverse Effect, all hedging transactions
entered into by Parent or a Parent Subsidiary have been properly identified
for federal income tax purposes.   (b) As of the date of this Agreement, no
federal, state, local or foreign audits or other administrative proceedings
or court proceedings are presently pending with regard to any Taxes or Tax
Returns of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, and neither Parent nor any Parent
Subsidiary has received a written notice of any material pending or proposed
claims, audits or proceedings with respect to Taxes. No material deficiencies
have been asserted in writing against Parent or any Parent Subsidiary as a
result of examinations by any state, local, federal or foreign taxing
authority and no material issue has been raised by any examination conducted
by any state, local, federal or foreign taxing authority that, by application
of the same principles, might result in a proposed deficiency for any other
period not so examined which deficiency ( or deficiencies), in either case,
is not (or are not) adequately reserved for in the most recent Parent
Financial Statements. Each material deficiency resulting from any audit or
examination relating to Taxes of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary by any
taxing authority has been paid or is being contested in good faith and in
accordance with law and is adequately reserved for on the balance sheets
contained in the Parent Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP.
No claim is pending and no claim has ever been made that has not been
resolved by an authority in a jurisdiction where the Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary does not file Tax Returns that the Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary, as the case may be, is or may be subject to Tax in that
jurisdiction. Neither the Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary is subject to any
private letter ruling of the Internal Revenue Service or comparable rulings
of other tax authorities that will be binding on the Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary with respect to any period following the Closing Date. Neither
Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has granted any power of attorney which is
currently in force with respect to any income, franchise or similar Taxes or
any income or franchise or similar Tax Returns.   (c) Parent and each Parent
Subsidiary have disclosed on their federal income tax returns all positions
taken therein that could, if not so disclosed, give rise to a substantial
understatement penalty within the meaning of Section 6662 of the Code.
Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has been a party to a "listed
transaction" within the meaning of Treas. Reg. Sec. 1.6011-4(b).   (d)
Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary is a party to any Tax
sharing agreement, Tax indemnity obligation or similar agreement, arrangement
or practice with respect to Taxes (including any advance pricing agreement,
closing agreement or other agreement relating to Taxes with any taxing
authority).   (e) To the knowledge of Parent, neither Parent nor any Parent
Subsidiary is party to any agreement, contract or arrangement that,
individually or collectively, would give rise to the payment of any amount
(whether in cash or property, including shares of capital stock), that would
not be deductible pursuant to the terms of Section 162(a)(1), 162(m) or
162(n) of the Code.   (f) Neither Parent nor any affiliate of Parent has
made with respect to Parent, any Parent Subsidiary, or any assets held by
Parent or any Parent Subsidiary any consent under Section 341 of the
Code.   (g) The statutes of limitations for the federal income Tax Returns
of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries have expired or otherwise have been
closed for all taxable periods ending on or before December 31, 1994.   (h)
Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary is a party to any safe harbor lease
within the meaning of Section 168(f)(8) of the Code, as in effect prior
to amendment by The Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982. None of
the property owned by Parent or a Parent Subsidiary is "tax-exempt use
property" within the meaning of Section 168(h) of the Code. Neither Parent
nor any Parent Subsidiary is required to make any adjustment under Code
Section 481(a) by reason of a change in accounting method or otherwise.  
(i) Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has been a member of
an affiliated group filing a consolidated federal income Tax Return (other
than a group the common parent of which was Parent). To the knowledge of
Parent, neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has been notified in writing
that it will be required to incur any liability for Taxes of any person
(other than Parent or a Parent Subsidiary) under Treasury Regulation Section
1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local or foreign law) with
respect to any Tax claim that has been made by a Taxing authority with
respect to such other person.   (j) Based on the assumption (which it
considers reasonable) that the standardized measure of discounted future net
cash flows disclosed in Parent\'s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2003, including the financial statements and accompanying
footnotes, represents the fair market value of the underlying assets, Parent
believes that it is a United States real property holding corporation under
Section 897(c)(2) of the Code, although the Parent has not performed a
detailed examination to make this determination.   SECTION 4.12.
Environmental Matters. Except as, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect:   (a)
There are no conditions existing on any real property owned, leased
or operated by Parent or any Parent Subsidiary that give rise to any or
would reasonably be expected to constitute a violation of or result in any
liability under any Environmental Law, and Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries
have been and are otherwise in compliance in all material respects with all
applicable Environmental Laws and there are no pending or, to the knowledge
of the Parent, threatened demands, claims, information requests or notices of
non-compliance or violation regarding Parent or any Parent Subsidiary
relating to any liability under any Environmental Law.   (b) To the
knowledge of Parent, Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries have used,
manufactured, generated, received, handled, used, stored, labeled, released,
discharged, distributed, treated, shipped and disposed of all Hazardous
Substances (as defined below) (whether or not on or from its owned, leased or
operated properties or properties owned, leased or operated by others) in
compliance with all applicable Environmental Laws.   (c) Neither the Parent
nor Parent Subsidiaries nor any real property owned, leased or operated by
Parent or any Parent Subsidiary is subject to any pending or, to the
knowledge of Parent, threatened action, suit, investigation, inquiry, notice
of non-compliance, request for information or proceeding relating to
any liability under any Environmental Laws.   (d) All permits, notices,
approvals and authorizations, if any, required to be obtained or filed in
connection with the operation of Parent\'s and the Parent Subsidiaries\'
businesses and the operation or use of any real property owned, leased or
operated by Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, including all permits, notices,
approvals and authorizations pertaining to the past and present generation,
treatment, storage, disposal or release of a Hazardous Substance, have been
duly obtained or filed, are currently in effect, and Parent and the Parent
Subsidiaries are in compliance with the terms and conditions of all
such permits, notices, approvals and authorizations. The transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will not result in the non-renewal,
revocation, expiration, withdrawal or termination of any such permits,
notices, approvals or authorizations.   (e) None of Parent and the Parent
Subsidiaries has assumed, contractually or, to the knowledge of Parent, by
operation of law, any liabilities or obligations of third parties under any
Environmental Laws.   (f) Neither Parent nor any of the Parent Subsidiaries
has, in the course of their businesses, sent or disposed, or otherwise had
taken or transported, arranged for the taking or disposal of, or in any other
manner participated or been involved in the taking of or disposal or release
of a Hazardous Substance to or at a site that, pursuant to any Environmental
Law, (A) has been placed on the National Priorities List under CERCLA or any
similar state or federal list, or (B) is subject to or the source of a claim,
an administrative order or other request to take removal, remedial,
corrective or any other response action as defined in any Environmental Law
or to pay for the costs of any such action at the site.   SECTION 4.13.
Compliance with Laws. Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, Parent and
the Parent Subsidiaries are in compliance with all applicable laws, rules or
regulations of any United States federal, state or local or
foreign government or agency thereof that materially affect the business,
properties or assets owned or leased by Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries,
and no notice, charge, claim, action or assertion has been received by Parent
or any Parent Subsidiary or, to Parent\'s knowledge, has been filed,
commenced or threatened against Parent or any Parent Subsidiary alleging any
such non-compliance. All licenses, permits and approvals required under such
laws, rules and regulations are in full force and effect, except where the
failure to be in full force and effect, individually or in the aggregate, has
not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no representation or warranty
in this Section 4.12 is made with respect to permits issued under or matters
relating to Environmental Laws, which are covered exclusively by the
provisions of Section 4.11.   SECTION 4.14. Employment Matters. Neither
Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary: (i) is a party to, or bound by, any consent
decree with, or citation by, any governmental agency relating to employees or
employment practices which, individually or in the aggregate, has had or
would reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect; or
(ii) is the subject of any proceeding asserting that it has committed an
unfair labor practice or is seeking to compel it to bargain with any labor
union or labor organization nor, as of the date of this Agreement, is there
pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened, any labor strike,
dispute, walkout, work stoppage, slow-down or lockout involving Parent or any
Parent Subsidiary which, with respect to any event described in this clause
(ii), individually or in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.   SECTION 4.15. Tax
Matters. Neither Parent nor any of the Parent Subsidiaries has taken any
action or knows of any fact, agreement, plan or other circumstance that could
reasonably be expected to prevent the Merger from qualifying as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.   SECTION
4.16. Investment Company. Neither Parent nor any of the Parent Subsidiaries
is an "investment company" or a company "controlled" by an "investment
company" within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.   SECTION
4.17. Reserve Reports. Parent has furnished to the Company Parent\'s estimate
of Parent\'s and Parent Subsidiaries\' oil and gas reserves for Parent and
the Parent Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2003 (the "Parent
Reserve Report"). Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, the factual,
non-interpretive data on which the Parent Reserve Report was based for
purposes of estimating the oil and gas reserves set forth in the Parent
Reserve Report was accurate. The estimates of proved reserves used by Parent
in connection with the preparation of the Parent Reserve Report are in
accordance with definitions contained in Rule 4-10(a) of Regulation S-X
promulgated by the SEC.   SECTION 4.18. Hedging. The Parent SEC Reports
accurately summarize the outstanding Hydrocarbon and financial Hedging
positions attributable to the production of the Parent and the Parent
Subsidiaries as of the date reflected therein, and, as of the date hereof,
there have been no changes since the date thereof.   SECTION 4.19.
Properties. All major items of operating equipment owned or leased by Parent
or any of the Parent Subsidiaries (i) are, in the aggregate, in a state of
repair so as to be adequate in all material respects for reasonably prudent
operations in the areas in which they are operated and (ii) are adequate,
together with all other properties of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries, to
comply in all material respects with the requirements of all applicable
contracts, including sales contracts. Except for goods and other property
sold, used or otherwise disposed of since January 1, 2004 in the ordinary
course of business, Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries have good
and defensible title to all oil and gas properties forming the basis for
the reserves reflected in the Parent Reserve Report as attributable to
interests owned by Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries, and to all other
properties, interests in properties and assets, real and personal, reflected
in the Parent SEC Reports filed prior to the date of this Agreement as owned
by Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries, free and clear of any Liens, except:
(i) Liens associated with obligations reflected in the parent Reserve Report
or the Parent SEC Reports filed prior to the date of this Agreement, (ii)
Liens for current taxes not yet due and payable, and (iii) such imperfections
of title, easements, Liens, government or tribal approvals or other matters
and failures of title as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. The leases
and other agreements pursuant to which the Parent or any of the Parent
Subsidiaries leases or otherwise acquires or obtains operating rights
affecting any real or personal property given value in the Parent Reserve
Report are in good standing, valid and effective, and the rentals due by
Parent or any Parent Subsidiary to any lessor of any such oil and gas leases
have been properly paid, except in each case as would not reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.   SECTION 4.20. Natural
Gas Act. Any gas gathering system constituting a part of the properties of
Parent or the Parent Subsidiaries has as its primary function the provision
of natural gas gathering services, as the term "gathering" is interpreted
under Section 1(b) of the Natural Gas Act (the "NGA"); none of the properties
have been or are certificated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
(the "FERC") under Section 7(c) of the NGA or to the knowledge of Parent are
now subject to FERC jurisdiction under the NGA; and none of the properties
have been or are providing service pursuant to Section 311 of the NGA.  
SECTION 4.21. Insurance. Section 4.21 of the Parent Disclosure
Letter contains a true and complete list of all insurance policies held by
either Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries. Parent and the Parent
Subsidiaries maintain insurance coverage adequate and customary in the
industry for the operation of their respective businesses (taking into
account the cost and availability of such insurance). All such insurance
policies are in full force and effect and all related premiums have been paid
to date.   SECTION 4.22. Certain Contracts and Arrangements. Neither Parent
nor any of the Parent Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by any agreement or
other arrangement that limits or otherwise restricts the Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries or any successor thereto, or that would, after the Effective
Time, to the knowledge of Parent, materially limit or restrict Company, the
Surviving Entity or any of their subsidiaries or any successor thereto, from
engaging or competing in the oil and gas exploration and production business
in any significant geographic area, except for joint ventures, area of mutual
interest agreements entered into in connection with prospect reviews and
similar arrangements entered into in the ordinary course of business. Except
as would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect,
neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary is in breach or default under any
contract filed or incorporated by reference as an exhibit to Parent\'s Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2003 nor, to the
knowledge of Parent, is any other party to any such contract in breach or
default thereunder.   ARTICLE 5  CONDUCT OF BUSINESS PENDING THE MERGER

S-4 and Joint Proxy Statement; Stockholders Meetings.   (a) As soon as
practicable following the date of this Agreement, Parent and the Company
shall prepare and file with the SEC the Joint Proxy Statement and Parent
shall file with the SEC the Form S-4, in which the Joint Proxy Statement will
be included as a prospectus. Each of the Company and Parent shall use
their reasonable best efforts to have the Form S-4 declared effective under
the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing. Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company will cooperate with each other in the preparation
of the Joint Proxy Statement and the Form S-4; without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the
Company, on the other hand, will furnish to each other the information
relating to the party furnishing such information required by the Exchange
Act or the Securities Act, as applicable, to be set forth in the Joint Proxy
Statement and the Form S-4, and Company and its counsel shall be given the
opportunity to review and comment on the Joint Proxy Statement and the Form
S-4 prior to the filing thereof with the SEC. Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company each agree to use its reasonable best efforts, after consultation
with the other parties hereto, to respond promptly to any comments made by
the SEC with respect to the Joint Proxy Statement and the Form S-4. The
Company and Parent will use their reasonable best efforts to cause the Joint
Proxy Statement to be mailed to their stockholders as promptly as practicable
after the Form S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act. No filing
of, or amendment or supplement (including by incorporation by reference) to,
or correspondence to the SEC or its staff with respect to, the Form S-4 or
the Joint Proxy Statement will be made by Parent or the Company, without the
approval of both parties, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed; provided that with respect to documents filed by a party which
are incorporated by reference in the Form S-4 or Joint Proxy Statement, this
right of approval shall apply only with respect to information relating to
the other party or its business, financial condition or results
of operations, or this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.
Each party will advise the other party, promptly after it receives notice
thereof, of the time when the Form S-4 has become effective or any supplement
or amendment has been filed, the issuance of any stop order, the suspension
of the qualification of the Parent Common Stock issuable in connection with
the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any request by the
SEC for amendment of the Form S-4, Joint Proxy Statement or comments thereon
and responses thereto or requests by the SEC for additional information. If
at any time prior to the Effective Time any information relating to the
Company or Parent, or any of their respective affiliates, officers or
directors, should be discovered by the Company or Parent which should be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to any of the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy
Statement, so that any of such documents would not include any misstatement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the
extent required by law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company and
Parent.   (b) The Company shall, as soon as practicable after the date
hereof, and in accordance with the Company\'s articles of incorporation and
bylaws and applicable law, establish a record date (which will be as soon as
practicable after the date hereof) for, duly call, give notice of, convene
and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the "Company Stockholders Meeting")
solely for the purpose of considering and taking action upon this Agreement
(it being understood that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
in this Agreement, the Company shall have no obligation to convene the
Company Stockholders Meeting unless the recommendation of the Board described
in this Section 6.1(b) has been made and remains in effect). Once the
Company Stockholders Meeting has been called and noticed, the Company shall
not postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting without the consent
of Parent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed (other than
(i) for the absence of a quorum, (ii) to allow reasonable additional time for
the filing and mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure which it
believes in good faith is necessary under applicable law and for such
supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by the
Company\'s stockholders prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting, or (iii)
in the event the Board of Directors of the Company withdraws, modifies or
changes in accordance with the terms of this Agreement its recommendation
that this Agreement and the Merger are in the best interests of the Company;
provided that in the event that the Company Stockholders Meeting is delayed
to a date after the Termination Date (as defined in Section 8.1(b)) as a
result of either (i) or (ii) above, then the Termination Date shall be
extended to the fifth business day after such date). The Board of Directors
of the Company shall declare that this Agreement and the Merger are advisable
and in the best interests of the Company and recommend that this Agreement be
approved by the stockholders of the Company and include in the Form S-4 and
the Joint Proxy Statement a copy of such recommendations; provided that the
Board of Directors of the Company may withdraw, modify or change
such recommendation if but only if (i) it believes in good faith, based on
such matters as it deems relevant, and after receiving the advice of the
Company\'s financial advisors, that a Superior Proposal (as defined in
Section 6.10(b) hereof) has been made and (ii) it has determined in good
faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that withdrawal, modification
or change of such recommendation is, in the good faith judgment of the Board
of Directors of the Company, required by the Board of Directors to comply
with its fiduciary duties imposed by applicable law. Unless the Board of
Directors of the Company has withdrawn its recommendation of this Agreement
in compliance with this Section 6.1(b), the Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to solicit from stockholders of the Company proxies in favor of
the adoption of this Agreement and shall take all other action necessary or
advisable to secure the vote or consent of stockholders required by
applicable law to effect the Merger.   (c) Parent shall, as soon as
practicable after the date hereof, and in accordance with the Parent\'s
certificate of incorporation and bylaws and applicable law, establish a
record date (which will be as soon as practicable after the date hereof) for,

unreasonably withheld or delayed (other than (i) for the absence of a quorum
or (ii) to allow reasonable additional time for the filing and mailing of any
supplemental or amended disclosure which it believes in good faith is
necessary under applicable law and for such supplemental or
amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by the Parent\'s

through its Board of Directors, recommend such approval by the stockholders
of Parent and include in the Form S-4 and the Joint Proxy Statement a copy of

accountants in connection with registration statements similar to the Form
S-4.   (e) Parent shall use all reasonable efforts to cause to be delivered
to the Company a letter of Ernst and Young LLP, the Company\'s independent
public accountants, dated a date within two business days before the date on

SECTION 6.2. Employee Benefit Matters. From and after the Effective
Time, Parent and the Surviving Entity shall have the rights and obligations
described in this Section 6.2 regarding the individuals who were employees of
the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time ("Acquired
Employees").   (a) Employment. All Acquired Employees shall be employed
solely on an "at will" basis, except to the extent required by the provisions
of written employment contracts or as required by applicable law. An Acquired
Employee whose employment is terminated ceases immediately to be an "Acquired
Employee" for purposes of this Agreement.   (b) Benefit Plans. The
Surviving Entity shall assume the Company Employee Benefit Plans as of the
Effective Time and operate such plans in accordance with their respective
terms, and the Company shall take any steps necessary to permit such
assumption. Acquired Employees shall continue after the Effective Time
to participate in such assumed Plans. At such time as determined by Parent or
the Surviving Entity, Acquired Employees shall participate in Parent\'s
compensation, severance, bonus, stock option and other incentive plans for
which they are eligible pursuant to the terms and conditions of such plans,
or in similar plans maintained by the Surviving Entity, in each case
consistent with the participation offered to Parent\'s employees holding
similar positions. Each such plan shall grant credit to each Acquired
Employee for all service prior to the Effective Time with the Company
(including any predecessors) for vesting and eligibility purposes, but not
for benefit accrual. No Acquired Employee shall be simultaneously covered
under similar employee benefit plans of the Parent or the Surviving Entity
and of the Company. Nothing in this Section 6.2 shall restrict in any manner
the right of Parent or the Surviving Entity to amend or terminate any assumed
Company Employee Benefit Plan or to modify any compensation arrangement of
any Acquired Employee for any reason at any time (in each case subject to the
provisions of any written employment contracts).   (c) Group Health Plans.
During the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs, any group health
plan established or maintained by Parent or the Surviving Entity shall, with
respect to any eligible Acquired Employee or, as applicable, a family member
of an eligible Acquired Employee, (i) waive any waiting period, (ii) waive
any exclusion or limitation for preexisting conditions which were covered
under any group health plan maintained by the Company prior to the Effective
Time, (iii) grant credit (for purposes of annual deductibles, co-payments and
out-of-pocket limits) for any covered claims incurred or payments made prior
to the Effective Time, and (iv) accept rollovers of the health flexible
spending account and dependent care accounts of eligible Acquired
Employees.   SECTION 6.3. Consents and Approvals.   (a) The Company,
Parent and Merger Sub shall each, as promptly as practicable after the date
of this Agreement, file or cause to be filed with the Federal Trade
Commission and the United States Department of Justice any notifications
required to be filed under the HSR Act with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby. The parties shall use reasonable best efforts to respond
promptly to any requests for additional information made by either of such
agencies, and to cause the waiting periods under the HSR Act to terminate or
expire at the earliest possible date after the date of filing.   (b) The
Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall cooperate with each other and (i)
promptly prepare and file all necessary documentation, (ii) effect
all necessary applications, notices, petitions and filings and execute
all agreements and documents, (iii) use all reasonable efforts to obtain
all necessary permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all
governmental bodies and (iv) use all reasonable efforts to obtain all
necessary Permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all other
parties, in the case of each of the foregoing clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and
(iv), necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or required by the terms of any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of
trust, license, franchise, permit, concession, contract, lease or other
instrument to which the Company, Merger Sub, Parent or any of their
respective Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them is bound;
provided, however, that no note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust,
license, franchise, permit, concession, contract, lease or other instrument
shall be amended or modified to increase in any material respect the amount
payable thereunder or to be otherwise more burdensome, or less favorable, in
each case in any material respect, to the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries considered as one enterprise in order to obtain any
permit, consent, approval or authorization without first obtaining the
written consent of Parent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed. The Company shall have the right to review and approve in advance
all characterizations of the information relating to the Company; Parent
shall have the right to review and approve in advance all characterizations
of the information relating to Parent or Merger Sub; and each of the Company
and Parent shall have the right to review and approve in advance all
characterizations of the information relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, in each case which appear in any material
filing (including the Joint Proxy Statement) made in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby. The Company, Parent and Merger Sub agree
that they will consult with each other with respect to the obtaining of all
such necessary Permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third
parties and governmental bodies.   SECTION 6.4. Public Statements. The
Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall consult with each other prior to
issuing, and provide each other with the opportunity to review and comment
upon, any public announcement, statement or other disclosure with respect to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue
any such public announcement or statement prior to such consultation, except
as may be required by law or any listing agreement with a national securities
exchange or trading market.   SECTION 6.5. Affiliates. As soon as
practicable after the date hereof, the Company shall deliver to Parent a
letter identifying all Persons who are at the time this Agreement is
submitted for adoption by the stockholders of the Company, "affiliates" of
the Company for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act. The Company
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause each such Person to
deliver to Parent at least 30 days prior to the Closing Date a written
agreement substantially in the form attached as Exhibit B hereto.   SECTION
6.6. Further Assurances. Subject to the terms and conditions provided herein,
each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub agrees to use all commercially
reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action, and to do, or
cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable laws and regulations to consummate and make effective
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including obtaining all
consents, approvals and authorizations required for or in connection with the
consummation by the parties hereto of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and, only if Parent and the Company mutually agree, contesting and
resisting of any action, including any legislative, administrative or
judicial action, and seeking to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned,
any decree, judgment, injunction or other order (whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent) that restricts, prevents or prohibits the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In the event
any litigation is commenced by any Person involving the Company or its
directors and relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including any other Takeover Proposal (as defined in Section 6.10(b)), Parent
shall have the right, at its own expense, to participate therein.   SECTION
6.7. Tax Treatment Each of Parent and the Company shall use all commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Merger to qualify as a reorganization under
the provisions of Section 368 of the Code and to obtain the opinions of
counsel referred to in Sections 7.2(e) and 7.3(d). Each of Parent and the
Company shall execute the officers\' certificates substantially in the form
attached as Exhibits B-1 and B-2 hereto, as of the date the Form S-4
is declared effective by the SEC and as of the Closing Date; provided,
however, that the failure of Parent or the Company to certify as to any
matter in such officer certificate because of an event, or change in facts or
law, in any such case outside of such party\'s control, shall not constitute
a breach of this covenant.   SECTION 6.8. Notification of Certain Matters.
The Company agrees to give prompt notice to Parent and Merger Sub, and to use
commercially reasonable efforts to prevent or promptly remedy, (i) the
occurrence or failure to occur, or the impending or threatened occurrence or
failure to occur, of any event which occurrence or failure to occur would be
reasonably likely to cause the failure of any of the conditions set forth in
Section 7.2(a) or (b); provided, however, that the delivery of any notice
pursuant to this Section 6.8 shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies
available hereunder to the party receiving such notice. Each of Parent and
Merger Sub agrees to give prompt notice to the Company, and to use
commercially reasonable efforts to prevent or promptly remedy, (i) the
occurrence or failure to occur, or the impending or threatened occurrence or
failure to occur, of any event which occurrence or failure to occur would be
reasonably likely to cause the failure of any of the conditions set forth in
Section 7.3(a) or (b); provided, however, that the delivery of any notice
pursuant to this Section 6.8 shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies
available hereunder to the party receiving such notice.   SECTION 6.9.

cause the Company Subsidiaries and the officers, directors, employees and
agents of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, to, afford the officers,
employees and agents of Parent and Merger Sub, at their sole cost and risk,
reasonable access at all reasonable times from the date hereof through the
Effective Date to its officers, employees, agents, properties, facilities,

right to make such due diligence investigations as Parent and Merger Sub
shall deem necessary or reasonable, upon reasonable notice to the Company and

otherwise affect the remedies available to Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to
this Agreement.   (b) Parent shall, and shall cause the Parent Subsidiaries
and the officers, directors, employees and agents of Parent and the Parent
Subsidiaries, to, afford the officers, employees and agents of the Company,

not, nor shall it permit any of the Company Subsidiaries to, nor shall it
authorize or permit any officer, director or employee of the Company, or any

negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any information with respect
to, or knowingly take any action to facilitate any inquiries or the making of
any proposal that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to,
any Takeover Proposal; provided, however, that (x) nothing contained in
subclauses (i) or (ii) above shall prohibit the Company or its Board of
Directors from disclosing to the Company\'s stockholders a position with
respect to a tender or exchange offer by a third party pursuant to Rules
14d-9 and 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any similar
disclosure, in either case to the extent required by applicable law, provided
that the Board of Directors of the Company shall not recommend that the
stockholders of the Company tender their Company Common Stock in connection
with any such tender or exchange offer unless the Board of Directors of the
Company determines in good faith (after receiving the advice of its financial
adviser) that such Takeover Proposal is a Superior Proposal; (y) if (under
circumstances in which the Company has complied with all of its obligations
under this Section 6.10(a)), prior to this Agreement having been approved by
the Required Company Stockholder Vote, the Company receives an unsolicited
written Takeover Proposal from a third party that the Board of Directors of
the Company determines in good faith (after receiving the advice of its
financial adviser) is, or is reasonably likely to result in, a Superior
Proposal, the Company and its representatives may conduct such additional
discussions and provide such information as the Board of Directors of the
Company shall determine, but only if, prior to such provision of
such information or conduct of such additional discussions (A) such third
party shall have entered into a confidentiality agreement in customary form
that is no less favorable to the Company as the Company Confidentiality
Agreement (and containing additional provisions that expressly permit the
Company to comply with the provisions of this Section 6.10) and (B) the Board
of Directors of the Company determines in its good faith judgment, after
consultation with and based upon the advice of outside legal counsel, that it
is required to do so in order to comply with its fiduciary duties under
applicable law; and (z) at any time prior to this Agreement having been
approved by the Required Company Stockholder Vote, and subject to the
Company\'s compliance with its obligations under this Section 6.10(a), the
Company\'s Board of Directors may (i) withdraw (or amend or modify in a
manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub), or publicly propose to withdraw (or

and in compliance with Section 8.1(f)(i), allow the Company to enter into a
binding written agreement concerning a transaction that constitutes a
Superior Proposal, in the case of either subclause (i) or (ii) of this clause
(z) only after (A) the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good
faith (after receiving the advice of its financial advisor) that such
Takeover Proposal is a Superior Proposal and (B) the Board of Directors of
the Company determines in its good faith judgment, after consultation with
and based upon the advice of outside legal counsel, that it is required to do
so in order to comply with its fiduciary duties under applicable law. The
Company shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated and shall cause
its affiliates and the Company Subsidiaries and its or their respective
officers, directors, employees, representatives or agents, to terminate all
existing discussions or negotiations, if any, with any Persons conducted
heretofore with respect to, or that could reasonably be expected to lead to,
a Takeover Proposal and will cause any such parties (and their agents or
advisors) in possession of confidential information regarding the Company
or any of the Company Subsidiaries to return or destroy such information.
The Company shall ensure that its officers, directors and key employees and

the provisions of this Section.   (b) For purposes of this Agreement, (i)
"Takeover Proposal" shall mean any inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person
(other than Parent, Merger Sub or any of their affiliates) relating to any
acquisition, merger, consolidation, reorganization, share exchange,
recapitalization, liquidation, direct or indirect business combination, asset
acquisition or other similar transaction involving the Company or any Company
Subsidiary of (A) assets or businesses that constitute or represent 10% or
more of the total revenue, operating income, EBITDAX or assets of the Company
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (B) 10% or more of the outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock or any other Company capital stock or capital
stock of, or other equity or voting interests in, any of the Company\'s
Subsidiaries directly or indirectly holding, individually or taken together,
the assets or business referred to in clause (A) above, in each case other
than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) the term
"Superior Proposal" means any bona fide written Takeover Proposal to effect a
merger, consolidation, reorganization, share exchange, recapitalization,
liquidation, direct or indirect business combination, or other similar
transaction as a result of which the Company\'s stockholders cease to own at
least 50% of the voting securities of the ultimate parent entity
resulting from such transaction or sale of all or substantially all of the
assets of the Company, which in any such case is on terms that the Board of
Directors of the Company determines in its good faith judgment (after receipt
of the advice of its financial advisor and outside counsel), taking into
account all relevant factors, including any conditions to such Takeover
Proposal, the timing of the closing thereof, the risk of nonconsummation, the
ability of the Person making the Takeover Proposal to finance the transaction
contemplated thereby, any required governmental or other consents, filings
and approvals, (A) would, if consummated, result in a transaction that is
more favorable to the Company\'s stockholders from a financial point of view
than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the terms of
any proposal by the Parent to modify the terms of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement) and (B) is reasonably likely to be financed
and otherwise completed without undue delay.   (c) In addition to the other
obligations of the Company set forth in this Section 6.10, the Company shall

Insurance.   (a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to
indemnification by the Company now existing in favor of each person who is
now, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to
the Effective Time an officer or director of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary or an employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or who
acts as a fiduciary under any of the Company Employee Benefit Plans (each an
"Indemnified Party") as provided in the Company\'s articles of incorporation
or bylaws, in each case as in effect on the date of this Agreement, or
pursuant to any other agreements in effect on the date hereof, copies of
which have been provided to Parent, including provisions relating to the
advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of any action or suit, shall
survive the Merger and shall remain in full force and effect. From and after
the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Entity shall be jointly and
severally liable to pay and perform in a timely manner such
indemnification obligations.   (b) For six years after the Effective Time,
to the full extent permitted under applicable law, Parent and the Surviving
Entity (the "Indemnifying Parties") shall, jointly and severally indemnify,
defend and hold harmless each Indemnified Party against all losses, claims,
damages, liabilities, fees, expenses, judgments and fines arising in whole or
in part out of actions or omissions in their capacity as such occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time, and will reimburse each Indemnified Party for
any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Party in
connection with investigating or defending any such losses, claims, damages,
liabilities, fees, expenses, judgments and fines as such expenses are
incurred; provided that nothing herein shall impair any rights to
indemnification of any Indemnified Party referred to in clause (a) above.
Promptly after receipt by an Indemnified Party under this Section 6.11(b) of
notice of the commencement of any action, such Indemnified Party will, if a
claim in respect thereof is to be made against an Indemnifying Party under
this Section 6.11(b), notify the Indemnifying Party of the commencement
thereof; but the omission so to notify an Indemnifying Party will not relieve
it from any liability which it may have to any Indemnified Party except to
the extent that the Indemnifying Party is actually and materially prejudiced
by such omission. In case any such action is brought against any Indemnified
Party and it notifies an Indemnifying Party of the commencement thereof, the
Indemnifying Party will be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent
that it may wish, jointly with any other Indemnifying Party
similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably
satisfactory to such Indemnified Party (who shall not, except with the
consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), be counsel to the Indemnifying Party), and after notice
from the Indemnifying Party to such Indemnified Party of its election so to
assume the defense thereof (and so long as the Indemnifying Party satisfies
such obligations), the Indemnifying Party will not be liable to such
Indemnified Party under this Section 6.11(b) for any legal or other expenses
subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with the
defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No Indemnifying
Party shall, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party
(which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), effect any
settlement of any pending or threatened action in respect of which any
Indemnified Party is or would reasonably be expected to be have been a party
and indemnity could properly have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified
Party unless such settlement (i) includes an unconditional release of such
Indemnified Party from all liability on any claims that are the subject
matter of such action and (ii) does not include a statement as to, or
an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of
an Indemnified Party. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
herein, no Indemnifying Party shall be obligated pursuant to this Section
6.11(b) to pay the fees and disbursements of more than one counsel for all
Indemnified Parties in any single action in any one jurisdiction except to
the extent that, in the opinion of counsel for the Indemnified Parties, two
or more of such Indemnified Parties have conflicting interests in the outcome
of such action.   (c) Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity to maintain
the Company\'s officers\' and directors\' liability insurance policies, in
effect on the date of this Agreement (the "DandO; Insurance"), for a period of
not less than six years after the Effective Time, but only to the extent
related to actions or omissions prior to the Effective Time; provided, that
(i) the Surviving Entity may substitute therefor policies of at least the
same coverage and amounts containing terms no less advantageous to such
former directors or officers and (ii) such substitution shall not result in
gaps or lapses of coverage with respect to matters occurring prior to the
Effective Time; provided, further, that in no event shall Parent or the
Surviving Entity be required to expend more than an amount per year equal to
150% of current annual premiums paid by the Company for such insurance (the
"Maximum Amount") to maintain or procure insurance coverage pursuant hereto;
provided, further, that if the amount of the annual premiums necessary to
maintain or procure such insurance coverage exceeds the Maximum Amount,
Parent and the Surviving Entity shall procure and maintain for such six-year
period as much coverage as reasonably practicable for the Maximum Amount.
Parent shall have the right to cause coverage to be extended under the
Company\'s DandO; Insurance by obtaining a six-year "tail" policy on terms and
conditions no less advantageous than the Company\'s existing DandO;
Insurance, and such "tail" policy shall satisfy the provisions of this
Section 6.11(c).   (d) The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Entity
under this Section 6.11 shall survive the consummation of the Merger and
shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect
any Indemnified Party to whom this Section 6.11 applies without the consent
of such affected Indemnified Party (it being expressly agreed that the
Indemnified Parties to whom this Section 6.11 applies shall be third party
beneficiaries of this Section 6.11, each of whom may enforce the provisions
of this Section 6.11).   (e) If Parent or the Surviving Entity or any of
their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into
any other Person and shall not be the continuing or Surviving Entity or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent
or the Surviving Entity, as the case may, be shall assume the obligations set
forth in this Section 6.11.   SECTION 6.12. Existing Registration Rights
Agreement. The Company acknowledges that it has entered into an agreement (a
copy of which has been provided to Parent) (the "Termination Agreement") with
each of the other parties to the Registration Rights Agreement, dated as of
October 1, 2003 (the "Existing Registration Rights Agreement"), pursuant to
which the parties thereto have agreed that the Existing Registration Rights
Agreement will terminate and be of no further force or effect as of the
Closing. The Company agrees that, without the consent of Parent, it will not
agree to amend, modify or terminate, or waive any rights under, the
Termination Agreement or otherwise amend the Existing Registration Rights
Agreement.   SECTION 6.13. Certain Hedging Activities.   (a) Parent has
entered into certain Hydrocarbon Hedges relating to the Company\'s projected
2004, 2005 and 2006 Hydrocarbon production (the significant economic terms of
which are set forth on Schedule 6.13(a) of the Parent Disclosure Letter) (the
"2004-6 Hedges").   (b) If this Agreement is terminated by the Company
pursuant to Section 8.1(f)(i), Parent shall immediately terminate all of the
2004-6 Hedges (unless Parent elects to continue such Hedges in accordance
with clause (d) below or the Company elects to assume such Hedges in
accordance with clause (e) below).   (c) In connection with any such
termination of the 2004-6 Hedges in each case in accordance with this Section
6.13, Parent shall immediately pay to the Company by wire transfer of
immediately available funds the net amount, if any, received by Parent from
the counterparties to the terminated Hedges or (ii) if Parent is required to
pay a net amount to the counterparties to the terminated Hedges, the Company
shall immediately pay to Parent by wire transfer of immediately available
funds such net amount required to be paid by Parent.   (d) Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in lieu of terminating any of the 2004-6 Hedges pursuant to
clause (b) above, Parent may elect to continue such Hedges, and Parent shall
pay to the Company, or the Company shall pay to Parent, as the case may be,
an amount equal to the amount such Person would be required to pay the other
if such Hedges were so terminated in accordance with clause (b) above.   (e)
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Parent does not elect to continue
the Hedges pursuant to clause (d) above and to the extent all of the rights
and obligations of Parent under any of the and 2004-6 Hedges that would
otherwise be terminated pursuant to this Section 6.13 may pursuant to the
terms of such Hedges be assigned by Parent to the Company and with no further
liability on the part of Parent, at the request of the Company, Parent will
in lieu of terminating such Hedges assign all of its rights to the Company,
and the Company will assume all of Parent\'s obligations, under such
Hedges.   SECTION 6.14. Stock Exchange Listing. Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of Parent Common Stock to be
issued in the Merger to be approved for listing on the New York Stock

Time.   SECTION 6.15. Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time,
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall take all such steps as may be
required to cause the transactions contemplated by Section 2.4 and any other
dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including derivative

securities) in connection with this Agreement by each individual who is
subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act
with respect to the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange
Act.   SECTION 6.16. Board Membership. Prior to the mailing to stockholders

the Board of Directors of Parent subject to the approval of the Nominating
and Corporate Governance Committee of Parent\'s Board of Directors in
accordance with Parent\'s governance practices and procedures. Subject to the
foregoing, Parent shall take such action as is necessary to cause the Company
