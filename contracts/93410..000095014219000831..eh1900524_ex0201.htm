in accordance with the applicable provisions of the DGCL, with Merger

defined below) and a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent;

  

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Parent, at a meeting duly called and held
on or prior to the date hereof, has unanimously (a) determined that this

Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), and this Agreement is
hereby adopted as a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Treas. Reg.
section 1.368-(2)(g).

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, the
parties hereto agree as follows:

Effective Time, shall be the by-laws of the First Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended or changed as provided therein or by the DGCL, except that
all references therein to Merger Subsidiary 1 shall be automatically amended
and shall become references to the First Surviving Corporation.

  

(c) At the Second Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation shall be the certificate of incorporation of Merger
Subsidiary 2 as set forth on _Exhibit B_ , except for Article FIRST thereof
which shall be amended to read as follows: "The name of this corporation is

(d) The by-laws of Merger Subsidiary 2, as in effect immediately prior to the

amended or changed as provided therein or by the DGCL, except that all
references therein to Merger Subsidiary 2 shall be automatically amended and
shall become references to the Surviving Corporation.

  

Section 1.3 _Directors and Officers of the First Surviving Corporation and the
Surviving Corporation_.

  

(a) The directors of Merger Subsidiary 1 immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the initial directors of the First Surviving Corporation, each
to hold office in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and by-laws
of the First Surviving Corporation, and the officers of Merger Subsidiary 1
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the
First Surviving Corporation, in each case until their respective successors

Section 1.4 _Effect on Capital Stock_.

  

(a) At the Effective Time, subject to the other provisions of _Articles_ _I_
and _II_ , each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of Company Common
Stock to be canceled pursuant to _Section 1.4(d)_ and except for any
Dissenting Shares or any shares of Company Common Stock covered under _Section
1.6_) shall, by virtue of this Agreement and without any action on the part of
the holder thereof, be converted into and shall thereafter represent the right
to receive the following consideration (collectively, the " _Merger
Consideration_ "): (x) $16.25 in cash, without interest (the " _Per Share Cash
Amount_ ") and (y) 0.3869 of a share of validly issued, fully paid and non-
assessable shares of Parent Common Stock (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ").

  

(b) From and after the Effective Time, all of the shares of Company Common
Stock converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
this _Article __I_ shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of (x) a
certificate (each a " _Certificate_ ") or (y) non-certificated shares
represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") previously representing
any such shares of Company Common Stock shall thereafter cease to have any
rights with respect to such securities, except the right to receive (i) the
Merger Consideration, (ii) any dividends or other distributions with a record
date prior to the Effective Time which have been declared by the Company in
accordance with this Agreement and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time,
and any dividends and other distributions in accordance with _Section 2.1(f)_
and (iii) any cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional share of Parent Common
Stock in accordance with _Section 2.2_.

  

 

4  

  


 

  

(c) If at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and
the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of
Parent or the Company shall occur by reason of any reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange or readjustment of
shares, or any stock dividend thereon with a record date during such period,
the Merger Consideration, the Per Share Cash Amount, the Exchange Ratio and
any other similarly dependent items, as the case may be, shall be
appropriately adjusted to provide the holders of shares of Company Common
Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such
event; _provided_ that (i) nothing in this _Section 1.4_ shall be construed to
permit the Company or Parent to take any action with respect to its securities
that is otherwise prohibited by the terms of this Agreement and (ii) cash
dividends and grants of equity compensation not prohibited by the terms hereof
shall not result in any adjustment to the Exchange Ratio.

  

(d) At the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock that are owned
by Parent, Merger Subsidiary 1, Merger Subsidiary 2 or the Company or any of
their respective direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiaries (the "
_Cancelled Shares_ ") shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist
and no stock of Parent, cash or other consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor. For the avoidance of doubt, this _Section 1.4(d)_ shall not
apply to shares of Company Common Stock held in trust or otherwise set aside
from shares held in the Company's treasury pursuant to a Company Benefit Plan
(as such term is defined in _Section 3.15_).

  

(e) (i) At the Effective Time, each issued and outstanding share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Subsidiary 1 issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding
as one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of the First Surviving Corporation and (ii) at the Second Effective
Time, (A) each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of the First Surviving Corporation shall no longer be outstanding
and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist and
no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor and (B) each issued
and outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger
Subsidiary 2 issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Second Effective
Time shall remain outstanding as one fully paid and nonassessable share of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

  

Section 1.5 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, with respect to each share of Company Common Stock as to which
the holder thereof shall have properly complied with the provisions of Section
262 of the DGCL as to appraisal rights (each, a " _Dissenting Share_ "), if
any, such holder shall be entitled to payment, solely from the Surviving
Corporation, of the appraisal value of the Dissenting Shares to the extent
permitted by and in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if any holder of Dissenting Shares (a)
affirmatively withdraws his demand for appraisal of such Dissenting Shares
under the circumstances permitted by and in accordance with the DGCL, (b)
fails to establish his entitlement to appraisal rights as provided in the DGCL
or (c) takes or fails to take any action the consequence of which is that such
holder is not entitled to payment for his shares under the DGCL, such holder
or holders (as the case may be) shall forfeit the right to appraisal of such
shares of Company Common Stock and such shares of Company Common Stock shall
thereupon cease to constitute Dissenting Shares and if such

  

 

5  

  


 

  

forfeiture shall occur following the Effective Time, each such share of
Company Common Stock shall thereafter be deemed to have been converted into
and to have become, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive, without
interest thereon, the Merger Consideration. The Company shall give Parent
prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of shares
of Company Common Stock or any written threats thereof, any written withdrawal
or purported withdrawal of any such demand and any other demand, notice or
instrument delivered to the Company prior to the Effective Time that relates
to such demand, and Parent shall have the right to participate in and direct
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company
shall not settle, make any payments with respect to, offer to settle, approve
the withdrawal of any claim or agree to any of the foregoing with respect to
Dissenting Shares, in each case, without the written consent of Parent.

  

Section 1.6 _Stock Options and Equity Awards_.

  

(a) At the Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase shares of
Company Common Stock (each, a " _Company Stock Option_ "), whether or not
vested, shall cease to represent a right to acquire shares of Company Common
Stock, and shall thereafter constitute an option to acquire, on the same terms
and conditions as were applicable under such Company Stock Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time, including any provisions for acceleration, the
number (rounded down to the nearest whole number) of shares of Parent Common
Stock determined by _multiplying_ (x) the number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective
Time by (y) the Stock Award Exchange Ratio. The exercise price per share of
Parent Common Stock subject to any such Company Stock Option at and after the
Effective Time shall be an amount (rounded up to the nearest one hundredth of
a cent) equal to (A) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time
divided by (B) the Stock Award Exchange Ratio. For purposes of this _Section
1.6_, the " _Stock Award Exchange Ratio_ " shall mean the sum of (i) the
Exchange Ratio _plus_ (ii) the fraction resulting from dividing the Per Share
Cash Amount by the closing price per share of the Parent Common Stock on the
NYSE on the last trading day immediately preceding the Closing Date (the "
_Parent Closing Price_ ").

  

(b) At the Effective Time, each award of restricted stock units (each, a "
_Company RSU Award_ ") that corresponds to shares of Company Common Stock that
is outstanding as of the Effective Time, whether or not vested, shall cease to
represent a Company RSU Award with respect to Company Common Stock and shall
thereafter constitute a restricted stock unit award (a " _Parent RSU Award_
"), on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such Company RSU
Award immediately prior to the Effective Time, including any provisions for
acceleration, with respect to the number (rounded to the nearest whole number)
of shares of Parent Common Stock determined by _multiplying_ (x) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company RSU Award immediately
prior to the Effective Time by (y) the Stock Award Exchange Ratio.

  

(c) Pursuant to the resolutions of the Compensation and Benefits Committee of
the Board of Directors of the Company adopted as of April 11, 2019 and
provided to Parent prior to the date hereof (the " _PU Resolutions_ "), at the
Effective Time, each performance unit (a " _Company PU Award_ ") granted under
any Company Benefit Plan that is

  

 

6  

  

  

outstanding as of the Effective Time, whether or not vested, shall immediately
vest, shall cease to represent a Company PU Award with respect to Company
Common Stock and shall thereafter represent the right to receive at such time
specified in the PU Resolutions the amount provided in the PU Resolutions.

  

  

(d) At the Effective Time, each award of shares of restricted Company Common
Stock (each, a " _Company RS Award_ ") granted under any Company Benefit Plan,
outstanding as of the Effective Time, whether or not vested, shall cease to
represent a Company RS Award with respect to Company Common Stock and shall
thereafter constitute an award, on the same terms and conditions as were
applicable under such Company RS Award immediately prior to the Effective
Time, including any provisions for acceleration, with respect to the number
(rounded to the nearest whole number) of shares of Parent Common Stock
determined by _multiplying_ (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company RS Award immediately prior to the Effective Time by
(y) the Stock Award Exchange Ratio.

  

  

(e) At the Effective Time, each deferred stock award granted or deferred under
any Company Benefit Plan (each, a " _Company Deferred Stock Award_ ") granted
to a non-employee member of the Company's Board of Directors that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the
Combination and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be
canceled and converted into the right to receive, within five Business Days
following the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration in respect of each
share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Deferred Stock Award
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with
respect to any Company Deferred Stock Award that constitutes nonqualified
deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code and that is not
permitted to be paid as described in the immediately preceding sentence
without triggering a Tax under Section 409A of the Code, such payment shall be
made at the earliest time permitted under the applicable Company Stock Plan
and Award Agreement that will not trigger a Tax under Section 409A of the
Code.

  

(f) Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of the Company and/or
the Compensation and Benefits Committee of the Board of Directors of the
Company shall adopt resolutions approving the treatment of the Company equity
awards pursuant to the terms of this _Section 1.6_.

  

(g) (i) Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to assume as of the
Effective Time the Company's obligations under the Company Stock Options,
Company RSU Awards, Company PU Awards and Company RS Awards and reserve for
issuance a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery
pursuant to the terms set forth in this _Section 1.6_. (ii) As soon as
practicable after the Effective Time and in any event no later than five days
after the Effective Time, Parent shall file with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") a registration statement on an appropriate
form or a post-effective amendment to a previously filed registration
statement under the Securities Act with respect to the Parent Common Stock
subject to options and other equity-based awards described in this _Section
1.6_ and shall use its reasonable best efforts to maintain the current status
of the prospectus contained therein, as well as comply with any applicable
state securities or "blue sky" laws, for so long as such options or other
equity-based awards remain outstanding.

ARTICLE II 
  
 EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

  

Section 2.1 _Surrender and Payment_.

  

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a bank, trust company or
nationally recognized stockholder services provider or such other Person
reasonably acceptable to the Company as the exchange agent (the " _Exchange
Agent_ ") for the purpose of exchanging Certificates and Book-Entry Shares
representing shares of Company Common Stock. Parent will make available to the
Exchange Agent, as needed, the Merger Consideration to be delivered in respect
of the shares of Company Common Stock. Promptly after the Effective Time,
Parent will send, or will cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of
record of shares of Company Common Stock as of the Effective Time, a letter of
transmittal for use in such exchange (which shall specify that the delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper
delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent) in such form as the
Company and Parent may reasonably agree, for use in effecting delivery of
shares of Company Common Stock to the Exchange Agent. Exchange of any Book-
Entry Shares shall be effected in accordance with Parent's customary
procedures with respect to securities represented by book entry.

  

(b) Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock that have been converted
into a right to receive the Merger Consideration, upon surrender to the
Exchange Agent of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share, together with a properly
completed letter of transmittal, will be entitled to receive (A) one or more
shares of Parent Common Stock (which shall be in non-certificated book-entry
form unless a physical certificate is requested) representing, in the
aggregate, the whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock, if any, that
such holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section 1.4_ and (B) a check
in the amount equal to the cash portion of the Merger Consideration that such
holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section 1.4_ and this _Article
__II_ , including cash payable in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to
_Section 2.2_ and dividends and other distributions pursuant to _Section
2.1(f)_. No interest shall be paid or accrued on any Merger Consideration,
cash in lieu of fractional shares or unpaid dividends and distributions
payable to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. Until so surrendered,
each such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall, after the Effective Time,
represent for all purposes only the right to receive such Merger
Consideration.

  

(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be registered in the name
of a Person other than the Person in whose name the applicable surrendered
Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition to the registration thereof
that the surrendered Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in
proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such delivery of the
Merger Consideration shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other
similar Taxes required as a result of such registration in the name of a
Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to
the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not
payable. Delivery of the aggregate Merger Consideration, as applicable, with
respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose name
such Book-Entry Shares are registered. For purposes of this Agreement, "
_Person_ " means an individual, a corporation, a limited liability company, a
partnership, an association, a trust or any

  

 

8  

  


 

  


 

  

other entity or organization, including a government or political subdivision
or any agency or instrumentality thereof.

  

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers of shares of Company Common Stock. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Exchange Agent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Parent, they shall be canceled and exchanged for
the consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set
forth, in this _Article __II_.

  

(e) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange
Agent pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_ that remains unclaimed by the holders of
shares of Company Common Stock one year after the Effective Time shall be
returned to Parent, upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged his
shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger Consideration in accordance with
this _Section 2.1_ prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent for
delivery of the Merger Consideration in respect of such holder's shares.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not be liable to any holder of
shares for any Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property laws. Any Merger Consideration remaining
unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Common Stock three years after the
Effective Time (or such earlier date immediately prior to such time as such
amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any governmental
body, agency, authority or entity) shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, become the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

  

(f) No dividends or other distributions with respect to shares of Parent
Common Stock issued in the Merger shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificates or Book-Entry Shares until such Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares are surrendered as provided in this _Section 2.1_. Following
such surrender, there shall be paid, without interest, to the record holder of
the shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor (i) at the time
of such surrender, all dividends and other distributions payable in respect of
such shares of Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time
and a payment date on or prior to the date of such surrender and not
previously paid and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the dividends or
other distributions payable with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock
with a record date after the Effective Time but with a payment date subsequent
to such surrender. For purposes of dividends or other distributions in respect
of shares of Parent Common Stock, all shares of Parent Common Stock to be
issued pursuant to the Merger shall be entitled to dividends pursuant to the
immediately preceding sentence as if issued and outstanding as of the
Effective Time.

  

(g) The Exchange Agent shall invest the aggregate cash portion of the Merger
Consideration delivered by Parent pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_ as directed by
Parent; _provided_ that no losses on such investments shall affect the cash
payable to former holders of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to this
_Article II_. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments
shall be paid promptly to Parent. Any portion of the Merger Consideration
deposited with the Exchange Agent pursuant to _Section 2.1_ to pay for shares
for which appraisal rights shall have been perfected shall be returned to
Parent, upon demand.

  

 

9  

  


 

  

Section 2.2 _Fractional Shares_.

  

(a) No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in the Merger,
but in lieu thereof each holder of shares of Company Common Stock otherwise
entitled to a fractional share of Parent Common Stock will be entitled to
receive, from the Exchange Agent in accordance with the provisions of this
_Section 2.2_ and subject to the provisions of _Section 2.1_, a cash payment
(without interest and rounded to the nearest cent) in lieu of such fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock representing such holder's proportionate
interest, if any, in the proceeds from the sale by the Exchange Agent in one
or more transactions of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the excess of
(x) the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be delivered to
the Exchange Agent by Parent pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_ over (y) the
aggregate number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock to be distributed to
the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to _Section 2.1(b)_
(such excess being herein called the " _Excess Shares_ "). The parties
acknowledge that payment of the cash consideration in lieu of issuing
fractional shares was not separately bargained-for consideration but merely
represents a mechanical rounding off for purposes of avoiding the expense and
inconvenience to Parent that would otherwise be caused by the issuance of
fractional shares. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the
Exchange Agent, as agent for the holders of the Certificates and Book-Entry
Shares representing shares of Company Common Stock, shall sell the Excess
Shares at then prevailing prices on the New York Stock Exchange (" _NYSE_ ")
in the manner provided in the following paragraph.

  

(b) The sale of the Excess Shares by the Exchange Agent, as agent for the
holders that would otherwise receive fractional shares, shall be executed on
the NYSE through one or more member firms of the NYSE and shall be executed in
round lots to the extent practicable. Until the proceeds of such sale or sales
have been distributed to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, the
Exchange Agent shall hold such proceeds in trust for the holders of shares of
Company Common Stock (the " _Common Shares Trust_ "). The Exchange Agent shall
determine the portion of the Common Shares Trust to which each holder of
shares of Company Common Stock shall be entitled, if any, by multiplying the
amount of the aggregate proceeds comprising the Common Shares Trust by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of the fractional share
interest to which such holder of shares of Company Common Stock would
otherwise be entitled and the denominator of which is the aggregate amount of
fractional share interests to which all holders of shares of Company Common
Stock would otherwise be entitled.

  

(c) As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if
any, to be paid to holders of shares of Company Common Stock in lieu of any
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, the Exchange Agent shall make
available such amounts to such holders of shares of Company Common Stock
without interest, subject to and in accordance with _Section 2.1_.

  

Section 2.3 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of
a bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the

  

 

10  

  


 

  

Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of
Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate as contemplated by this
_Article __II_.

  

Section 2.4 _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Surviving Corporation, Parent
and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to _Articles_ _I_ and
_II_ such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under any provision of federal, state, local or foreign
tax law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld by the
Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, and
paid over to the applicable governmental body, agency, authority or entity,
such deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common
Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the
Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be.

  

ARTICLE III 
  
 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

  

The Company represents and warrants to Parent that, except as disclosed (i) in
the Company SEC Documents or the MLP SEC Documents (as hereinafter defined)
filed or furnished prior to the date hereof (excluding any disclosures in such
Company SEC Documents or MLP SEC Documents in any risk factors section, in any
section related to forward looking statements and other disclosures that are
predictive or forward-looking in nature) or (ii) in the correspondingly
numbered section of the disclosure schedules delivered by the Company to
Parent simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement (the " _Company
Disclosure Schedules_ ") (it being agreed that disclosure of any item in any
section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Schedules shall be deemed
disclosure with respect to any other section or subsection of this Agreement
to which the relevance of such item is reasonably apparent, notwithstanding
the omission of a cross-reference to such other section or subsection):

  

Section 3.1 _Corporate Existence and Power_. The Company is a corporation duly
incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
State of Delaware and has all corporate powers and all governmental
franchises, licenses, permits, authorizations, consents and approvals required
to enable it to own, lease or otherwise hold its properties and assets and to
carry on its business as now conducted, except for those the absence of which
would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably likely to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined below). The Company is duly
qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing in
each jurisdiction in which the character of the property owned or leased by it
or the nature of its activities or the ownership or leasing of its properties
make such qualification necessary, except for those jurisdictions where the
failure to be so qualified would not, individually or in the aggregate, be
reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. For purposes of
this Agreement, the term " _Company Material Adverse Effect_ " means any state
of facts, change, development, event, effect, condition or occurrence (each,
an " _Effect_ ") that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be
expected to result in a material adverse effect on the financial condition,
business, assets or continuing results of operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no

  

 

11  

  

event shall any of the following Effects, alone or in combination, be deemed
to constitute, or be taken into account, in determining whether there has
been, or would be, a Company Material Adverse Effect: (A) any changes in
general United States or global economic conditions or securities, credit,
financial or other capital markets conditions, (B) any changes or conditions
affecting the oil and gas industry in general (including changes to commodity
prices, general market prices and regulatory changes affecting the industry),
(C) any weather-related or other force majeure event (including earthquakes,
hurricanes, tsunamis, tornadoes, floods, mudslides, wild fires or other
natural disasters), (D) acts of war (whether or not declared), armed hostility
(by recognized governmental forces or otherwise), sabotage, terrorism or
cyber-attack, and any escalation or general worsening of any of the foregoing,
(E) the negotiation, execution, announcement, pendency, compliance with or
performance of this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or the
terms hereof or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the impact thereof on the relationships of the Company and its
Subsidiaries with customers, suppliers, partners, employees or governmental
bodies, agencies, officials or authorities; _provided_ that this _clause (E)_
shall not apply to any representation or warranty set forth in _Section 3.4_
or _Section 3.15(g)_ (or any condition to any party's obligation to consummate
the Combination relating to such representation and warranty) to the extent
the purpose of such representation and warranty is to address the consequences
resulting from the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the
consummation of the Combination, (F) any action taken or failure to take
action which Parent has requested in writing, (G) changes in applicable law or
regulation or in GAAP or in accounting standards, or any changes in the
interpretation or enforcement of any of the foregoing, or any changes in
general legal, regulatory or political conditions, (H) any decline in the
market price, or change in trading volume, of the Company's capital stock or
(I) any failure to meet any internal or public projections, forecasts,
guidance, estimates, milestones, or budgets or internal or published financial
or operating predictions of revenue, earnings, cash flow or cash position (it
being understood that the exceptions in _clauses (H)_ and _(I)_ shall not
prevent or otherwise affect a determination that the underlying cause of any
such change, decline or failure referred to therein (if not otherwise falling
within any of the exceptions provided hereof) is a Company Material Adverse
Effect); _provided_ that, in the case of _clauses (A)_ , _(B)_ , _(C)_ and
_(D)_ , to the extent the impact on the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole, is disproportionate to the impact on other similarly situated
entities, the incrementally disproportionate impact or impacts shall be taken
into account in determining whether there has been, or would reasonably be
expected to be, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has heretofore
made available to Parent true and complete copies of the Certificate of
Incorporation of the Company, as amended to the date of this Agreement (as so
amended, the " _Company Charter_ "), and the By-Laws of the Company, as
amended to the date of this Agreement (subject to the amendment contemplated
by Section 3.2(b)(v)) (as so amended, the " _Company By-Laws_ ").

  

Section 3.2 _Corporate Authorization_.

  

(a) The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement
and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby
are within the Company's corporate powers and, except for any required
approval by the Company's stockholders (the " _Company Stockholder Approval_
") in connection with the consummation of the Combination, have been duly
authorized by all necessary corporate action. The affirmative vote of holders
of a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock in favor of

  

 

12  

  

the adoption of this Agreement is the only vote of the holders of any of the
Company's capital stock or the capital stock of any of its Subsidiaries
necessary in connection with consummation of the Combination. Assuming due
authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent, Merger
Subsidiary 1 and Merger Subsidiary 2, this Agreement constitutes a valid and
binding agreement of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance
with its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer,
reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general applicability relating
to or affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles (whether
considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) (collectively, " _Creditors '
Rights_").

  

(b) The Board of Directors of the Company, at a meeting duly called and held
on or prior to the date hereof, has (i) determined that this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby (including the Combination) are fair to and
in the best interests of the Company's stockholders, (ii) approved this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including the
Combination), (iii) directed that the adoption of this Agreement be submitted
to a vote of the holders of Company Common Stock, (iv) resolved (subject to
_Section 5.2_) to recommend the adoption of this Agreement by the holders of
Company Common Stock and (v) adopted resolutions amending and restating the
Company By-Laws in the manner previously disclosed to Parent.

  

Section 3.3 _Governmental Authorization_. The execution, delivery and
performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the
Company of the transactions contemplated hereby require no action by or in
respect of, or filing with, any governmental body, agency, official or
authority other than (a) the filing of a certificate of merger in accordance
with the DGCL, (b) compliance with any applicable requirements of the Hart-
Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the " _HSR Act_
"), (c) compliance with any applicable requirements of laws, rules and
regulations in foreign jurisdictions governing antitrust or merger control
matters, (d) compliance with any applicable requirements of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder (the " _Exchange Act_ "), (e) compliance with any applicable
requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Securities Act_ "), (f) the
appropriate filings and approvals under the rules of the NYSE and (g) other
actions or filings the absence or omission of which would not, individually or
in the aggregate, be reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

  

Section 3.4 _Non-Contravention_. The execution, delivery and performance by
the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the Company of the
transactions contemplated hereby do not and will not, assuming compliance with
the matters referred to in _Sections __3.2_ and _3.3_ , (a) contravene or
conflict with the Company Charter or the Company By-Laws or the organizational
documents of any Company Subsidiary, (b) contravene or conflict with or
constitute a violation of any provision of any law, regulation, judgment,
injunction, order or decree binding upon or applicable to the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, (c) constitute a default (or an event which with notice
or the passage of time would become a default) under, or give rise to any
right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any right or obligation
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or to a loss of any benefit to which
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is entitled under any provision of, any
agreement, contract or other instrument binding upon the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any license, franchise, permit or other

  

 

13  

  

similar authorization held by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (d)
result in the creation or imposition of any Lien on any asset of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, except for such contraventions, conflicts or
violations referred to in _clause (b)_ or defaults, rights of termination,
cancellation or acceleration, losses or Liens referred to in _clause (c)_ or
_(d)_ that would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably likely
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. For purposes of this Agreement, "
_Lien_ " means, with respect to any asset, any mortgage, lien, pledge, charge,
security interest or encumbrance of any kind in respect of such asset other
than any such mortgage, lien, pledge, charge, security interest or encumbrance
(i) for Taxes (as defined in _Section 3.14_) not yet due or being contested in
good faith (and for which adequate accruals or reserves have been established
on the Parent Balance Sheet or the Company Balance Sheet, as the case may be)
or (ii) which is a carriers', warehousemen's, mechanics', materialmen's,
repairmen's or other like lien arising in the ordinary course of business. To
the Company's knowledge as of the date of this Agreement, there is no Effect
that would reasonably be expected to prevent, materially impede or materially
interfere with the consummation by the Company of the Combination and the
Transactions.

  

Section 3.5 _Capitalization_. The authorized capital stock of the Company
consists of 1,000,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock and 2,000,000 shares
of preferred stock, par value $1.00 per share (" _Company Preferred Stock_ ",
and together with the Company Common Stock, the " _Company Capital Stock_ ").
As of April 10, 2019 (the " _Measurement Date_ "), there were outstanding (i)
501,957,778 shares of Company Common Stock (including 5,138,826 shares covered
by Company RS Awards), (ii) no shares of Company Preferred Stock and (iii) no
other shares of capital stock or other voting securities of the Company. All
outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock have been duly authorized and

shares of Company Common Stock, (B) Company RSU Awards with respect to
1,242,041 shares of Company Common Stock, (C) Company PU Awards with respect
to 1,359,839 shares of Company Common Stock (assuming such Company PU Awards
were earned at target level of performance) and (D) Company Deferred Stock
Awards with respect to 310,374 shares of Company Common Stock. Except as set
forth in this _Section 3.5_ and except for changes since the close of business
on the Measurement Date resulting from the exercise of employee stock options
outstanding on such date, or the payment or redemption of other stock-based
awards outstanding on such date or other securities issued as permitted by
_Section 5.1_, there are outstanding (a) no shares of capital stock or other
voting securities of the Company and (b) (1) no options, warrants or other
rights to acquire from the Company any capital stock or voting securities of
the Company or securities convertible into or exchangeable for capital stock
or voting securities of the Company, (2) no bonds, debentures, notes or other
indebtedness of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case, that are
linked to, or the value of which is in any way based upon or derived from, the
value of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any part thereof, or any
dividends or other distributions declared or paid on any shares of capital
stock of, or other equity or voting interests in, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or which have or which by their terms may have at any time
(whether actual or contingent) the right to vote (or which are convertible
into, or exchangeable for, securities having the right to vote) on any matters
on which stockholders of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries may vote and
(3) no preemptive or similar rights, subscription or other rights, convertible
securities, or other agreements, arrangements or commitments of any character
relating to the capital stock of the Company, obligating the

  

 

14  

  

Company to issue, transfer or sell any capital stock or voting securities of
the Company or securities convertible into or exchangeable for capital stock
or voting securities of the Company or obligating the Company to grant, extend
or enter into any such option, warrant, subscription or other right,
convertible security, agreement, arrangement or commitment (the items in the
foregoing _subclauses (a)_ and _(b)_ being referred to collectively as "
_Company Securities_ "). Except as permitted by _Section 5.1(e)_ with respect
to any Company Stock Options, Company RSU Awards, Company RS Awards, Company
PU Awards and Company Deferred Stock Awards, there are no outstanding
obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or
otherwise acquire any Company Securities.

  

Section 3.6 _Subsidiaries_.

  

(a) Each Subsidiary of the Company is duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization, and has all
powers and all governmental licenses, authorizations, consents and approvals
required to carry on its business as now conducted, except for those the
absence of which would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably
likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. For purposes of this
Agreement, the term " _Subsidiary_ ," when used with respect to any Person,
means any other Person, whether incorporated or unincorporated, of which (i)
more than fifty percent of the voting securities or other ownership interests
is owned by such Person or one or more of its Subsidiaries, (ii) such Person
or one or more of its Subsidiaries is a general partner or holds a majority of
the voting interests of a partnership or (iii) securities or other interests
having by their terms ordinary voting power to elect more than fifty percent
of the board of directors or others performing similar functions with respect
to such corporation or other organization, are directly owned or controlled by
such Person or by any one or more of its Subsidiaries. For the avoidance of
doubt, for all purposes of this Agreement, the MLP and its Subsidiaries shall
be deemed to be Subsidiaries of the Company. The MLP consummated the
transactions contemplated by that certain Contribution Agreement and Agreement
and Plan of Merger, dated as of November 7, 2018, by and among Western
Midstream Partners, LP (formerly known as Western Gas Equity Partners, LP)
(the " _MLP_ "), Western Midstream Holdings, LLC (formerly known as Western
Gas Equity Holdings, LLC) (" _WES GP_ "), Western Midstream Operating, LP
(formerly known as Western Gas Partners, LP) (the " _Operating Partnership_
"), the Company, WGR Asset Holding Company LLC and certain of their affiliates
on February 28, 2019 in accordance with the terms thereof as disclosed in the
Company SEC Documents and the MLP SEC Documents. Each Subsidiary of the
Company is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which the character of the property owned or leased by it or
the nature of its activities makes such qualification necessary, except for
those jurisdictions where failure to be so qualified would not, individually
or in the aggregate, be reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. All "significant subsidiaries" (as such term is defined in Section
1-02 of Regulation S-X under the Exchange Act) of the Company and all entities
listed on Exhibit 21 to the Company 10-K (collectively, and including, for the
avoidance of doubt, the MLP, " _Significant Subsidiaries_ ") and their
respective jurisdictions of organization are identified in _Section 3.6(a)_ of
the Company Disclosure Schedules.

  

(b) Except for directors' qualifying shares, all of the outstanding capital
stock of, or other ownership interests in, each Significant Subsidiary of the
Company (other than the MLP and its Subsidiaries) is wholly-owned by the
Company, directly or

  

 

15  

  

indirectly, free and clear of any material Lien and free of any other material
limitation or restriction (including any restriction on the right to vote,
sell or otherwise dispose of such capital stock or other ownership interests).
There are no outstanding (i) securities of the Company or any of its
Significant Subsidiaries convertible into or exchangeable for shares of
capital stock or other voting securities or ownership interests in any
Significant Subsidiary of the Company or (ii) (A) options, warrants or other
rights to acquire from the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries any
capital stock, voting securities or other ownership interests in, or any
securities convertible into or exchangeable for any capital stock, voting
securities or ownership interests in, any Significant Subsidiary of the
Company, (B) bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness of any Significant
Subsidiary of the Company that are linked to, or the value of which is in any
way based upon or derived from, the value of the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any part thereof, or any dividends or other distributions
declared or paid on any shares of capital stock of, or other equity or voting
interests in, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or which have or which
by their terms may have at any time (whether actual or contingent) the right
to vote (or which are convertible into, or exchangeable for, securities having
the right to vote) on any matters on which stockholders of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries may vote or (C) preemptive or similar rights, subscription
or other rights, convertible securities, or other agreements, arrangements or
commitments of any character relating to the capital stock of any Significant
Subsidiary of the Company, obligating the Company or any of its Significant
Subsidiaries to issue, transfer or sell any capital stock, voting securities
or other ownership interests in, or any securities convertible into or
exchangeable for any capital stock, voting securities or ownership interests
in, any Significant Subsidiary of the Company or obligating the Company or any
Significant Subsidiary of the Company to grant, extend or enter into any such
option, warrant, subscription or other right, convertible security, agreement,
arrangement or commitment (the items in the foregoing _subclauses (i)_ and
_(ii)_ being referred to collectively as " _Company Subsidiary Securities_ ").
There are no outstanding obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any outstanding Company Subsidiary
Securities. Other than the MLP and the Operating Partnership, no Subsidiary of
the Company is, or since January 1, 2016 has been, subject to any requirement
to file periodic reports under the Exchange Act. No Subsidiary of the Company
owns any shares of Company Common Stock.

  

(c) As of the Measurement Date, the issued and outstanding limited partner
interests and general partner interests of the MLP consisted of (i)
452,990,862 "Common Units" (as defined in the First Amended and Restated
Agreement of Limited Partnership of the MLP, dated as of December 12, 2012, as
amended or supplemented from time to time (the " _MLP Partnership Agreement_
")) (the " _MLP Common Units_ "), (ii) 19,360 unvested awards of phantom units
that are outstanding under any employee or director equity plans or
arrangements of MLP and (iii) a 0.0% non-economic general partner interest
held by WES GP (the " _WES GP Interest_ "). All of the issued and outstanding
MLP Common Units have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully
paid (to the extent required by the MLP Partnership Agreement) and
nonassessable (except as such non-assessability may be affected by Sections
17-303, 17-607 and 17-804 of the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership
Act) and, except as set forth in the MLP Partnership Agreement, free of
preemptive rights. WES GP is a wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company and is
the sole general partner of the MLP. WES GP is the sole record and beneficial
owner of the WES GP Interest, and such WES GP Interest has been duly
authorized and validly issued in accordance with applicable law and the MLP
Partnership Agreement. WES

  

 

16  

  

GP owns the WES GP Interest free and clear of any Liens. Except (x) as set
forth above in this _Section 3.6(c)_ or (y) as otherwise expressly permitted
by this Agreement, as of the date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding,
and as of the Effective Time there will not be outstanding, (A) any
"Partnership Interests" (as defined in the MLP Partnership Agreement) (the "
_MLP Partnership Interests_ ") or other equity or voting securities of the
MLP, (B) (1) options, warrants or other rights to acquire from the MLP any
Partnership Interests, voting securities or other ownership interests in, or
any securities convertible into or exchangeable for MLP Partnership Interests,
voting securities or ownership interests in, the MLP or (2) preemptive or
similar rights, subscription or other rights, convertible securities, or other
agreements, arrangements or commitments of any character relating to MLP
Partnership Interests or other equity or voting securities of the MLP,
obligating the MLP to issue, transfer or sell any MLP Partnership Interests or
other equity or voting securities of the MLP, or any securities convertible
into or exchangeable for MLP Partnership Interests or other equity or voting
securities of the MLP, or obligating the MLP to grant, extend or enter into
any such option, warrant, subscription or other right, convertible security,
or other agreement, arrangement or commitment or (C) bonds, debentures, notes
or other debt of the MLP that are linked to, or the value of which is in any

Agreement or as required by applicable law, or (ii) accelerate the time of

ARTICLE IV 
  
  
 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT, MERGER SUBSIDIARY 1 AND MERGER
SUBSIDIARY 2

  

Parent, Merger Subsidiary 1 and Merger Subsidiary 2 represent and warrant to
the Company that, except as disclosed (i) in the Parent SEC Documents (as
hereinafter defined) filed or furnished prior to the date hereof (excluding
any disclosures in such Parent SEC Documents in any risk factors section, in
any section related to forward looking statements and other disclosures that
are predictive or forward-looking in nature) or (ii) in the correspondingly
numbered section of the disclosure schedules delivered by Parent to the
Company simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement (the " _Parent
Disclosure Schedules_ ") (it being agreed that disclosure of any item in any
section or subsection of the Parent Disclosure Schedules shall be deemed
disclosure with respect to any other section or subsection of this Agreement
to which the relevance of such item is reasonably apparent, notwithstanding
the omission of a cross-reference to such other section or subsection):

  

Section 4.1 _Corporate Existence and Power_. Each of Parent, Merger Subsidiary
1 and Merger Subsidiary 2 is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing
and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has all
corporate powers and all governmental franchises, licenses, permits,
authorizations, consents and approvals required to enable it to own, lease or
otherwise hold its properties and assets and to carry on its business as now
conducted, except for those the absence of which would not, individually or in
the aggregate, be reasonably likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect
(as defined below). Parent is duly qualified to do business as a foreign
corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the
character of the property owned or leased by it or the nature of its
activities or the ownership or leasing of its properties make such
qualification necessary, except for those jurisdictions where the failure to
be so qualified would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably
likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. For purposes of this
Agreement, the term " _Parent Material Adverse Effect_ " means any Effect
that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to result
in a material adverse effect on the financial condition, business, assets or
continuing results of operations of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall any of the following
Effects, alone or in combination, be deemed to constitute, or be taken into
account, in determining whether there has been, or would be, a Parent Material
Adverse Effect: (A) any changes in general United States or global economic
conditions or securities, credit, financial or other capital markets
conditions, (B) any changes or conditions affecting the oil and gas industry
in general (including changes to commodity prices, general market prices and
regulatory changes affecting the

  

 

33  

  

industry), (C) any weather-related or other force majeure event (including
earthquakes, hurricanes, tsunamis, tornadoes, floods, mudslides, wild fires or
other natural disasters), (D) acts of war (whether or not declared), armed
hostility (by recognized governmental forces or otherwise), sabotage,
terrorism or cyber-attack, and any escalation or general worsening of any of
the foregoing, (E) the negotiation, execution, announcement, pendency,
compliance with or performance of this Agreement, the transactions
contemplated hereby or the terms hereof or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the impact thereof on the
relationships of Parent and its Subsidiaries with customers, suppliers,
partners, employees or governmental bodies, agencies, officials or
authorities; _provided_ that this _clause (E)_ shall not apply to any
representation or warranty set forth in _Section 4.4_ (or any condition to any
party's obligation to consummate the Combination relating to such
representation and warranty) to the extent the purpose of such representation
and warranty is to address the consequences resulting from the execution and
delivery of this Agreement or the consummation of the Combination, (F) any
action taken or failure to take action which the Company has requested in
writing, (G) changes in applicable law or regulation or in GAAP or in
accounting standards, or any changes in the interpretation or enforcement of
any of the foregoing, or any changes in general legal, regulatory or political
conditions, (H) any decline in the market price, or change in trading volume,
of Parent's capital stock or (I) any failure to meet any internal or public
projections, forecasts, guidance, estimates, milestones, or budgets or
internal or published financial or operating predictions of revenue, earnings,
cash flow or cash position (it being understood that the exceptions in
_clauses (H)_ and _(I)_ shall not prevent or otherwise affect a determination
that the underlying cause of any such change, decline or failure referred to
therein (if not otherwise falling within any of the exceptions provided
hereof) is a Parent Material Adverse Effect); _provided_ that, in the case of
_clauses (A)_ , _(B)_ , _(C)_ and _(D)_ , to the extent the impact on Parent
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, is disproportionate to the impact on
other similarly situated entities, the incrementally disproportionate impact
or impacts shall be taken into account in determining whether there has been,
or would reasonably be expected to be, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Since
the date of its incorporation, neither of Merger Subsidiary 1 nor Merger
Subsidiary 2 has engaged in any activities other than in connection with or as
contemplated by this Agreement. Parent has heretofore delivered to the Company
true and complete copies of Parent's, Merger Subsidiary 1's and Merger
Subsidiary 2's certificate of incorporation and by-laws as currently in
effect.

  

Section 4.2 _Corporate Authorization_.

  

(a) The execution, delivery and performance by Parent, Merger Subsidiary 1 and

Subsidiary 1 and Merger Subsidiary 2 of the transactions contemplated hereby

Subsidiary 2 and have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action.

Company, this Agreement constitutes a valid and binding agreement of each of

compliance with any applicable requirements of the Securities Act, (f) the
appropriate filings and approvals under the rules of the NYSE and (g) other

in the aggregate, be reasonably likely to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect.

  

Section 4.4 _Non-Contravention_. The execution, delivery and performance by
Parent, Merger Subsidiary 1 and Merger Subsidiary 2 of this Agreement and the
consummation by Parent, Merger Subsidiary 1 and Merger Subsidiary 2 of the
transactions contemplated hereby do not and will not, assuming compliance with

termination, cancellation or acceleration of any right or obligation of Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries or to a loss of any benefit to which Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries is entitled under any provision of, any agreement,
contract or other instrument binding upon Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or
any license, franchise, permit or other similar authorization held by Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries or (d) result in the creation or imposition of any

Section 5.2 _Company Stockholder Meeting; Proxy Material_.

  

(a) Except as permitted by _Section 5.2(b)_ below, the Board of Directors of
the Company shall recommend adoption of this Agreement by the Company's
stockholders, and unless permitted by _Section 5.2(b)_, neither the Board of
Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw, modify
or qualify, or propose publicly to withdraw, modify or qualify, in any manner
adverse to Parent, the approval of this Agreement, the Combination or the
Company Recommendation (as defined in _Section 5.2(f)_ below) (any of the
foregoing, a " _Change in the Company Recommendation_ "), or (ii) approve or
recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any Acquisition
Proposal. For purposes of this Agreement, a Change in the Company
Recommendation shall include (x) any approval or recommendation (or public
proposal to approve or recommend) of an Acquisition Proposal by the Board of
Directors of the Company or any committee thereof, or (y) any failure by the
Company to include the Company Recommendation in the Company Proxy Statement.

  

(b)

  

(i) The Board of Directors of the Company shall be permitted, in response to a
Superior Proposal received after the date of this Agreement and not resulting
from a breach of this _Section 5.2_ or _Section 7.8_, to not make the Company
Recommendation, or to withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent the
Company Recommendation, or to cause the Company to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 9.1(f)_ , in each case, only if and to the extent that
all of the following conditions are met: (A) the Company Stockholder Approval
has not been obtained; (B) the Board of Directors of the Company determines in
good faith, after consulting with outside legal counsel, that making the
Company Recommendation or failing to take such action would be reasonably
likely to be inconsistent with the directors' exercise of their fiduciary
duties under applicable law; (C) before taking any such action, the Company
promptly gives Parent written notice advising Parent of the decision of the
Board of Directors of the Company to take such action (a " _Superior Proposal
Notice_ "), including the reasons therefor and specifying the material terms
and conditions of the applicable Acquisition Proposal and the identity of the
Person making such Acquisition Proposal (and the Company will also promptly
give Parent such a notice with respect to any subsequent change in such
proposal) and the Company has given Parent at least four (4) Business Days (as
modified, extended or continued by this _Section 5.2(b)(i)_, the " _Superior
Proposal Match Period_ ") after delivery of such notice to propose revisions
to the terms of this Agreement (or to make another proposal) in response to
such Acquisition Proposal and during such period has made its representatives
reasonably available to negotiate with Parent (to the extent Parent wishes to
negotiate) with respect to such proposed revisions or other proposal, if any
(it being understood and agreed that any amendment or modification (other than
immaterial amendments or modifications) of such Acquisition Proposal shall
require a new notice period with a new Superior Proposal Match Period of three
(3) Business Days); and (D) the Board of Directors of the Company determines
in good faith that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal
(as defined in _Section 7.8(b)_) at the

  

 

48  

  

end of such Superior Proposal Match Period after consultation with, and taking
into account the advice of, a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation and outside legal counsel, as well as any revisions to the terms of
the Combination or this Agreement proposed by Parent after being notified
pursuant to this _Section 5.2(b)(i)_.

  

(ii) The Board of Directors of the Company shall be permitted, in response to
an Intervening Event occurring after the date of this Agreement and not
relating to an Acquisition Proposal, to not make the Company Recommendation or
to withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent the Company
Recommendation, only if and to the extent that all of the following conditions
are met: (A) the Company Stockholder Approval has not been obtained; (B) the
Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, as a result of the
Intervening Event, after consulting with outside legal counsel, that making
the Company Recommendation or failing to so withdraw or modify the Company
Recommendation would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the
directors' exercise of their fiduciary duties to stockholders under applicable
law; (C) before taking any such action, the Company promptly gives Parent
written notice advising Parent of the decision of the Board of Directors of
the Company to take such action (an " _Intervening Event Notice_ "), which
notice will describe the Intervening Event in reasonable detail, and the
Company has given Parent at least five (5) Business Days (as modified,
extended or continued by this _Section 5.2(b)(ii)_, the " _Intervening Event
Match Period_ ") after delivery of such notice to propose revisions to the
terms of this Agreement (or to make another proposal) in response to such
Intervening Event and during such period has made its representatives
reasonably available to negotiate with Parent (to the extent Parent wishes to
negotiate) with respect to such proposed revisions or other proposal, if any
(it being understood and agreed that any change in fact (other than an
immaterial change) relating to such Intervening Event shall require a new
notice period with a new Intervening Event Match Period of three (3) Business
Days); and (D) Parent does not make, within the Intervening Event Match
Period, a proposal that the Board of Directors of the Company determines in
good faith after consultation with, and taking into account the advice of, a
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and outside legal
counsel, would obviate the need to not make or withdraw or modify the Company
Recommendation. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Intervening Event_ " means
any event, development or change in circumstances that was not known to the
Company's Board of Directors, or the consequences of which were not reasonably
foreseeable as of the date of this Agreement, which event, change or
development becomes known to the Company's Board of Directors prior to
obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval; _provided_ that in no event shall
the following events, changes or developments constitute an Intervening Event:
(A) the receipt, existence or terms of an Acquisition Proposal or any matter
relating thereto or consequence thereof or (B) any change in the price or
trading volume of the Company Common Stock, the Parent Common Stock or any
other securities of the Company, Parent or any of their respective
Subsidiaries ( _provided_ that the underlying causes of such changes may
constitute, or be taken into account in determining whether there has been, an
Intervening Event).

  

(iii) For the avoidance of doubt, without limiting the Company's right to
terminate this Agreement in the circumstances set forth in _Section 9.1_ , a
Change in the Company Recommendation shall not limit the Company's obligation
to submit this Agreement to the stockholders of the Company for the purpose of
obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval at the Company Stockholder Meeting.

  

 

49  

  

(c) As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, Parent
and the Company shall prepare, and Parent shall file with the SEC, the Form
S-4, in which the Company Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus.
Each of Parent and the Company shall use all reasonable efforts to have the
Form S‑4 declared effective under the Securities Act, and for the Company
Proxy Statement to be cleared by the SEC and its staff under the Exchange Act,
in each case, as promptly as practicable after such filing. Without limiting
any other provision herein, the Form S-4 and the Company Proxy Statement will
contain such information and disclosure reasonably requested by either Parent
or the Company so that the Form S-4 conforms in form and substance to the
requirements of the Securities Act and the Company Proxy Statement conforms in
form and substance to the requirements of the Exchange Act. The Company shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Company Proxy Statement to be
mailed to holders of Company Common Stock as promptly as practicable after the
Form S‑4 is declared effective.

  

(d) If at any time prior to the Effective Time there shall occur (i) any event
with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or with respect to
information supplied by Company for inclusion in the Form S‑4 or the Company
Proxy Statement, or (ii) any event with respect to Parent, or with respect to
information supplied by Parent for inclusion in the Form S‑4 or the Company
Proxy Statement, in either case, which event is required to be described in an
amendment of or a supplement to the Form S‑4 or the Company Proxy Statement,
such event shall be so described, and such amendment or supplement shall be
promptly filed with the SEC and, as required by law, disseminated to the
stockholders of the Company.

  

(e) Each of the Company and Parent shall (i) promptly notify the other of the
receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff or any other applicable
government official and of any requests by the SEC or its staff or any other
applicable government official for amendments or supplements to any of the
filings with the SEC in connection with the Combination and other transactions
contemplated hereby or for additional information and (ii) promptly supply the
other with copies of all correspondence between the Company or any of its
representatives, or Parent or any of its representatives, as the case may be,
on the one hand, and the SEC or its staff or any other applicable government
official, on the other hand, with respect thereto. The Company and Parent
shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to respond to any comments
of the SEC or its staff with respect to the Form S‑4 and the Company Proxy
Statement as promptly as practicable. The Company and Parent shall cooperate
with each other and provide to each other all information necessary in order
to prepare the Form S‑4 and the Company Proxy Statement as expeditiously as
practicable, and each of them shall provide promptly to the other party any
information that such party may obtain that could necessitate an amendment or
supplement to any such document.

  

(f) The Company shall, as promptly as practicable after the Form S‑4 is
declared effective under the Securities Act, duly call, give notice of,
convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the " _Company Stockholder
Meeting_ ") for the purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, and
the Board of Directors of the Company shall recommend to the Company's
stockholders the adoption of this Agreement (the " _Company Recommendation_ ")
and shall include such recommendation in the Company Proxy Statement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Board of Directors of the Company may fail
to make such Company

  

 

50  

  

Recommendation or make a Change in the Company Recommendation if permitted by,
and in accordance with, _Section 5.2(b)_. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, but subject to _Section 5.2(b)_ and the Company's rights to
terminate this Agreement under the circumstances set forth in _Section 9.1_ ,
the Company agrees that its obligations pursuant to the first sentence of this
_Section 5.2(f)_ or its other obligations under this _Section 5.2_ shall not
be affected by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or
communication to the Company or its stockholders or representatives of any
Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
hold the Company Stockholder Meeting as soon as practicable after the Form S‑4
becomes effective and (subject to any Change in the Company Recommendation
permitted by, and in accordance with, _Section 5.2(b)_) to obtain the Company
Stockholder Approval. The Company shall not, without the prior written consent
of Parent, adjourn, postpone or otherwise delay the Company Stockholder
Meeting; _provided_ that the Company may, notwithstanding the foregoing,
without the prior written consent of Parent, adjourn or postpone the Company
Stockholder Meeting (A) if, after consultation with Parent, the Company
believes in good faith that such adjournment or postponement is reasonably
necessary to allow reasonable additional time to (1) solicit additional
proxies necessary to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval, or (2)
distribute any supplement or amendment to the Company Proxy Statement the
distribution of which the Board of Directors of the Company has determined in
good faith to be necessary under applicable law after consultation with, and
taking into account the advice of, outside legal counsel or (B) for an absence
of a quorum. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may not, without the
prior written consent of Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), postpone the Company Stockholder Meeting more than a
total of three (3) times pursuant to _clause (A)(1)_ or _(B)_ of the
immediately preceding sentence, and no such postponement or adjournment
pursuant to _clause (A)(1)_ or _(B)_ of the immediately preceding sentence
shall be, without the prior written consent of Parent (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), for a period exceeding ten
(10) Business Days and in no event may the Company postpone the Company
Stockholder Meeting without the written consent of Parent if doing so would
require the setting of a new record date. Without the prior written consent of
Parent, the matters contemplated by the Company Stockholder Approval shall be
the only matters (other than (x) matters of procedure and matters required by
applicable law to be voted on by the Company's stockholders in connection
therewith or (y) with Parent's prior written consent (not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), matters contemplated to otherwise have been
submitted to the stockholders of the Company at the Company's 2019 annual
stockholder meeting) that the Company shall propose to be voted on by the
stockholders of the Company at the Company Stockholder Meeting. The Company
shall otherwise coordinate and cooperate with Parent with respect to the
timing of the Company Stockholder Meeting and will otherwise comply with all
legal requirements applicable to the Company Stockholder Meeting.

  

Section 5.3 _Resignation of Company Directors_. In order to fulfill the
requirements of _Section 1.3_, the Company shall (a) cause each director of
the Company to deliver a written resignation to the Company effective at the
Effective Time and (b) cause the vacancies resulting from such resignations to
be filled by Persons who are directors of Merger Subsidiary 1 immediately
prior to the Effective Time.

  

 

51  

  

Section 5.4 _Other Actions_. Subject to and in accordance with the provisions
of _Article __VII_ , the Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other to
lift any injunctions or remove any other impediment to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated herein.

Section 6.3 _Director and Officer Liability_.

  

(a) Without limiting any other rights that any Indemnified Person may have
pursuant to any employment agreement or indemnification agreement, from the
Effective Time and until the six (6) year anniversary of the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and each of its Subsidiaries,
other than the MLP and its Subsidiaries, to indemnify, defend and hold
harmless each Person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of
this Agreement or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director, officer
or employee of the Company or of such Subsidiary, as applicable, or who acts
as a fiduciary under any Company Benefit Plan or is or was serving at the
request of the Company or of such Subsidiary as a director, officer, employee
or agent of another corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint
venture, employee benefit plan, trust or other enterprise (the " _Indemnified
Persons_ ") against all losses, claims, damages, costs, fines, penalties,
expenses (including attorneys' and other professionals' fees and expenses),
liabilities or judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement, of or
incurred in connection with any threatened or actual claim (including a claim
of a violation of applicable law), action, audit, demand, suit, proceeding,
investigation or other proceeding at law or in equity or order or ruling, in
each case whether civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or otherwise
and whether or not such claim, action, audit, demand, suit, proceeding,
investigation or other proceeding or order or ruling results in a formal civil
or criminal litigation or regulatory action (" _Proceeding_ ") to which such
Indemnified Person is a party or is otherwise involved (including as a
witness) based, in whole or in part, on or arising, in whole or in part, out
of the fact that such Person is or was a director, officer or employee of the
Company or of such Subsidiary, a fiduciary under any Company Benefit Plan or
is or was serving at the request of the Company or of such Subsidiary as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership,
limited liability company, joint venture, employee benefit plan, trust or
other enterprise or by reason of anything done or not done by such Person in
any such capacity, whether pertaining to any act or omission occurring or
existing prior to, at or after the Effective Time and whether asserted or
claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time (" _Indemnified Liabilities_
"), including all Indemnified Liabilities based in whole or in part on, or
arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to, this Agreement or the
Transactions, in each case to the fullest extent permitted under applicable
law (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation or such Subsidiary to
pay expenses incurred in advance of the final disposition of any such
Proceeding to each Indemnified Person to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable law). Any Indemnified Person wishing to claim indemnification or
advancement of expenses under this _Section 6.3(a)_ , upon learning of any
such Proceeding, shall notify the Surviving Corporation (but the failure so to
notify shall not relieve a party from any obligations that it may have under
this _Section 6.3(a)_ except to the extent such failure materially prejudices
such party's position with respect to such claims). Parent will have the
right, upon written notice to any applicable Indemnified Person, to assume the
defense of any Proceeding in respect of which indemnification is or would be
sought hereunder employing counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified
Person. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 6.3_, an
Indemnified Person shall only be entitled to the rights provided in this
_Section 6.3_ after providing a written undertaking by or on behalf of such
Indemnified Person to repay such amounts if it is ultimately determined under
applicable law that such Indemnified Person is not entitled to be indemnified.

  

 

53  

  

(b) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not amend, repeal or otherwise
modify any provision in the organizational documents of the Surviving
Corporation or its Subsidiaries other than the MLP and its Subsidiaries (and
Parent shall not authorize or consent to any such amendment, repeal or other
modification of the organizational documents of the MLP or any of its
Subsidiaries) in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder
of any Indemnified Person to indemnification, exculpation or expense
advancement, except to the extent required by applicable law. Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries other than the MLP and
its Subsidiaries to fulfill and honor any indemnification, expense advancement
or exculpation agreements between the Company or any of such Subsidiaries and
any of its or their directors, officers or employees existing immediately
prior to the Effective Time.

  

(c) To the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation and each of its Subsidiaries (other than the MLP and
its Subsidiaries) to indemnify any Indemnified Person against all reasonable
costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses), such
amounts to be payable in advance upon request as provided in this _Section
6.3_ , relating to the enforcement of such Indemnified Person's rights under
this _Section 6.3_ ; _provided_ , that, any such Indemnified Person shall only
be entitled to the rights provided in this _Section 6.3(c)_ after providing a
written undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnified Person to repay such
amounts if it is ultimately determined under applicable law that such
Indemnified Person is not entitled to be indemnified.

  

(d) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to put in place, and Parent
shall fully prepay no later than immediately prior to the Closing, "tail"
insurance policies with a claims reporting or discovery period of at least six
(6) years from the Effective Time placed with insurance companies having the
same or better AM Best Financial rating as the Company's current directors'
and officers' liability insurance companies with terms and conditions
providing retentions, limits and other material terms no less favorable than
the current directors' and officers' liability insurance policies maintained
by the Company with respect to matters, acts or omissions existing or
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Parent may elect in its sole discretion, but shall not be required, to spend
more than 300% (the " _Cap Amount_ ") of the last annual premium paid by the
Company prior to the date hereof for the six (6) years of coverage under such
"tail" policy; _provided_ , _further_ , that if the cost of such insurance
exceeds the Cap Amount, and Parent elects not to spend more than the Cap
Amount for such purpose, then Parent shall purchase as much coverage as is
reasonably available for the Cap Amount.

  

(e) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person,
then, in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall
assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.3_. Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall not sell, transfer, distribute or otherwise
dispose of any of their assets or the assets of any Subsidiary in a manner
that would reasonably be expected to render Parent or Surviving Corporation
unable to satisfy their obligations under this _Section 6.3_. The provisions
of this _Section 6.3_ are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, the parties and any and all Persons entitled to

  

 

54  

  

indemnification or insurance coverage or expense advancement pursuant to this
_Section 6.3_ , and their heirs and representatives.

  

Section 6.4 _Form S‑4_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC under the Securities Act the Form
S‑4, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Form S‑4 to be
declared effective by the SEC a sufficient time prior to the Company
Stockholder Meeting to allow the Company to mail the Company Proxy Statement
to the Company stockholders, as required by the rules and regulations of the
SEC, prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting. Parent shall take any action
required to be taken under foreign or state securities or Blue Sky laws in
connection with the issuance of Parent Common Stock in connection with the
Combination.

  

Section 6.5 _Stock Exchange Listing_. Parent shall take all necessary action
to cause the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in connection with the
Combination to be listed on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance.

  

Section 6.6 _Employee Benefits_.

  

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to honor in accordance with their terms all benefits and
obligations, subject to _Section 6.6(b)_ hereof, under the Company Benefit
Plans, each as in effect on the date hereof (or as amended to the extent
permitted by _Section 5.1_), to the extent that entitlements or rights, actual
or contingent (whether such entitlements or rights are vested as of the
Effective Time or become vested or payable only upon the occurrence of a
further event) exist in respect thereof as of the Effective Time. Parent and
the Company hereby agree that the consummation of the Combination shall
constitute a " _Change in Control_ " for purpose of any employee arrangement
and all other Company Benefit Plans, pursuant to the terms of such plans in
effect on the date hereof. No provision of this _Section 6.6(a)_ shall be
construed as a limitation on the right of Parent to amend or terminate any
Company Benefit Plans which the Company would otherwise have under the terms
of such Company Benefit Plan, and no provision of this _Section 6.6(a)_ shall
be construed to create a right in any employee or beneficiary of such employee
under a Company Benefit Plan that such employee or beneficiary would not
otherwise have under the terms of such plan.

  

(b) For a period of one (1) year following the Effective Time, Parent shall
continue to provide to each individual who is employed by the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time who remains employed with Parent
or any Subsidiary of Parent ("Affected Employees"), for so long as such
Affected Employee remains employed by Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent (i)
base compensation that is no less favorable than was provided to the Affected
Employee immediately before the Effective Time, (ii) short- and long-term
incentive compensation opportunities that are no less favorable in the
aggregate than were provided to the Affected Employee immediately before the
Effective Time and (iii) all other compensation and employee benefits
(excluding severance) that are no less favorable in the aggregate than were
provided to the Affected Employee immediately before the Effective Time;
provided, that for purposes of determining whether such compensation and
employee benefits are no less favorable in the aggregate, (x) retention, sale,
stay or change in control payments or awards or any similar compensation or
benefit, shall not be taken into account, (y) in lieu of

  

 

55  

  

equity awards, Parent may substitute other forms of cash-based compensation
having substantially equivalent value and equivalent vesting terms and (z)
Parent may determine the value of defined benefit pension plan benefits
provided immediately prior to the Effective Time in its good faith discretion;
provided, however, that defined benefit pension plan benefits shall not be
taken into account for purposes of determining under clause (iii) whether
compensation and employee benefits are no less favorable in the aggregate for
any particular Affected Employee, if Parent provides such Affected Employee
with retirement benefits (excluding retiree welfare benefits) that are no less
favorable than those provided to similarly situated employees of Parent and
its Subsidiaries (it being understood that an employee of Parent and its
Subsidiaries who participates in a frozen defined benefit pension plan shall
not be deemed to be similarly situated to an Affected Employee).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the terms and conditions of employment for any
Affected Employees who are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, works
council agreement, or other contract or agreement with any labor union, works
council or other employee representative organization shall be governed by
such contract or agreement and the foregoing provisions of this _Section
6.6(b)_ or the provisions of _Section 6.6(a)_, _Section 6.6(c)_ or _Section
6.6(d)_ shall be inapplicable thereto.

  

(c) Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation to, give Affected
Employees full credit for purposes of eligibility, vesting and benefit accrual
(other than benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension or post-
employment or retiree health or welfare plan that, in each case, is not a
Company Benefit Plan) under any employee benefit plans or arrangements
maintained by Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent for such Affected Employees'
service with the Company or any Subsidiary to the same extent recognized by
the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time, except to the extent that
such credit would result in a duplication of benefits or compensation for the
same period of service.

  

(d) Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation to, (i) waive all
limitations as to preexisting conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with
respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to the Affected
Employees under any welfare benefit plans that such employees may be eligible
to participate in after the Effective Time, other than limitations or waiting
periods that are already in effect with respect to such employees and that
have not been satisfied as of the Effective Time under any welfare plan
maintained for the Affected Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time,
and (ii) for the year in which the Effective Time occurs, provide each
Affected Employee with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior
to the Effective Time in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket
requirements under any welfare plans that such employees are eligible to
participate in after the Effective Time.

  

(e) Parent and the Company agree to the additional items set forth on Section
6.6(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedules.

  

(f) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.6_, express or implied, shall (i) be
construed to establish, amend, or modify any benefit or compensation plan,
program, agreement, contract, policy or arrangement, (ii) limit the ability of
Parent or the Company or any of their Subsidiaries or affiliates to amend,
modify or terminate any benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement,
contract, policy or arrangement at any time assumed, established, sponsored or
maintained by any of them, except as permitted by the terms of such plan,
program,

  

 

56  

  

agreement, contract, policy or arrangement, (iii) create any third-party
beneficiary rights or obligations in any person (including any employee) or
any right to employment or services or continued employment or service or to a
particular term or condition of employment or service with Parent or the
Company or any of their Subsidiaries, or any of their respective affiliates or
(iv) limit the right of Parent or the Company (or any of their Subsidiaries or
their respective affiliates) to terminate the employment or service of any
employee or other service provider following the Closing at any time and for
any or no reason.

  

(g) As soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement, the Company shall
have reasonably cooperated with Parent to provide to Parent such information
reasonably requested by Parent to enable Parent to calculate the impact of
Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code with respect to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, either alone or in combination
with another event.

  

ARTICLE VII 
  
 COVENANTS OF PARENT AND THE COMPANY

  

The parties hereto agree that:

  

Section 7.1 _Best Efforts_.

  

(a) Subject to _Sections __5.2_ , _7.1(b)_ and _7.1(c)_ , the Company and
Parent shall each cooperate with the other and use (and shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries to use) their respective best efforts to promptly (i)
take or cause to be taken all actions, and do or cause to be done all things,
necessary, proper or advisable under this Agreement and applicable laws to
consummate and make effective the Combination and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as soon as practicable, including, without
limitation, preparing and filing promptly and fully all documentation to
effect all necessary filings, notices, petitions, statements, registrations,
submissions of information, applications and other documents and (ii) obtain
as soon as practicable all approvals, consents, registrations, permits,
authorizations and other confirmations required to be obtained from any third
party or governmental body, agency, authority or official which are necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate the Combination and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The Company and Parent shall submit the
notifications required under the HSR Act relating to the Combination within
ten (10) Business Days of the date of this Agreement. Prior to Closing, and
subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, the
Company and Parent shall each keep the other apprised of the status of matters
relating to the completion of the Combination and work cooperatively in
connection with obtaining all required approvals or consents of any
governmental agency, body, authority or entity in connection with the
Combination. The Company and Parent shall have the right to review in advance,
and each will consult the other to provide any necessary information with
respect to all filings made with, or written materials submitted to, any third
party and/or any governmental agency, body, authority or entity in connection
with the Combination and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The Company and Parent shall each promptly inform the other party,
and if in writing, furnish the other party with copies of (or, in the case of
oral communications, advise the other party orally of) any communication from
any governmental agency, body, authority or entity regarding

  

 

57  

  

the Combination, and provide the other party with the opportunity to
participate in any meeting with any governmental agency, body, authority or
entity in respect of any filing, investigation or other inquiry in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ that Parent will lead
all such processes; but _provided_ , _further_ , that the foregoing shall not
limit in any respect any party's obligations under this Agreement. If either
party receives a request for additional information or documentary material
from any governmental agency, body, authority or entity with respect to the
Combination, then such party will use its reasonable best efforts to make, or
cause to be made, promptly and after consultation with the other party, an
appropriate response in compliance with such request. Subject to applicable
laws or any request made by any applicable governmental agency, body,
authority or entity (including the staff thereof), the Company and Parent
shall each furnish to each other copies of all correspondence, filings and
written communications between it and any such governmental agency, body,
authority or entity with respect to this Agreement and the Combination, and
furnish the other party with such necessary information and reasonable
assistance as the other party may reasonably request in connection with its
preparation of filings or submissions of information to any such governmental
agency, body, authority or entity; _provided_ that materials provided pursuant
to this _Section 7.1(a)_ may be redacted (i) to remove references concerning
the valuation of the Company, (ii) as necessary to comply with contractual
obligations, and (iii) as necessary to address reasonable privilege concerns.

  

(b) Without limiting _Section 7.1(a)_, Parent and the Company shall, subject
to _Section 7.1(c)_, as applicable:

  

(i) each use its best efforts to avoid the entry of, or to have vacated or
terminated, any decree, order, or judgment that would restrain, prevent or
delay the Closing, on or before the End Date (as defined in _Section
9.1(b)(i)_), including without limitation defending through litigation on the
merits any claim asserted in any court by any Person; and

  

(ii) each use its best efforts to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment
under any antitrust, competition or trade regulation law that may be asserted
by any governmental agency, body, authority or entity with respect to the
Combination (collectively, " _Antitrust Laws_ ") so as to enable the Closing
to occur as soon as reasonably possible (and in any event no later than the
End Date), including, without limitation, (x) proposing, negotiating,
committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order, or
otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of such businesses, product
lines or assets of Parent, the Company and their respective Subsidiaries and
(y) otherwise taking or committing to take actions that after the Closing Date
would limit Parent or its Subsidiaries' freedom of action with respect to, or
its or their ability to retain, one or more of the businesses, product lines
or assets of Parent, the Company and their respective Subsidiaries, in each
case as may be required in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the
dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order, or other order in
any suit or proceeding, which would otherwise have the effect of preventing or
materially delaying the Closing. Parent and, if requested by Parent, the
Company shall agree to divest, sell, dispose of, hold separate, or otherwise
take or commit to take any action that limits its freedom of action with
respect to, or Parent or Parent's Subsidiaries' ability to retain, any of the
businesses, product lines or assets of Parent, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries; _provided_ that any such action is conditioned upon
the consummation of the Combination. The Company agrees and acknowledges that,
notwithstanding anything to the

  

 

58  

  

contrary in this _Section 7.1_, in connection with any filing or submission
required, action to be taken or commitment to be made by Parent, the Company
or any of their respective Subsidiaries to consummate the Combination or other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, neither the Company nor any of
the Company's Subsidiaries shall, without Parent's prior written consent,
sell, divest, or dispose of any assets, license of any Company Intellectual
Property, commit to any sale, divestiture or disposal of businesses, product
lines or assets of the Company and the Company's Subsidiaries or any license
of Company Intellectual Property or take any other action or commit to take
any action that would limit the Company's, Parent's or any of their respective
Subsidiaries' freedom of action with respect to, or their ability to retain
any of, their businesses, product lines or assets or Company Intellectual
Property; _provided_ that the foregoing shall not relieve any party of its
obligations under this Agreement.

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything else contained herein, neither the provisions of
this _Section 7.1_ nor any other provision of this Agreement shall be
construed to require Parent or any of Parent's Subsidiaries to undertake (or
to request or authorize the Company or any of the Company's Subsidiaries to
undertake) any efforts or to take any action if such efforts or action would,
or would reasonably be expected to, result in a Substantial Detriment. "
_Substantial Detriment_ " shall mean changes or effects which would,
individually or in the aggregate (and after giving effect to any reasonably
expected proceeds of any divestiture or sale of assets), result in, or be
reasonably likely to result in, a Company Material Adverse Effect, at or after
the Effective Time; _provided_ that any requirement to divest or hold
separate, or limit the operation of, any division, Subsidiary, interest,
business, product line, asset or property relating to the operations conducted
by Parent and its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time shall be deemed to
result in a Substantial Detriment if such action with respect to a comparable
amount of assets or businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken
together with all other actions taken pursuant to this _Section 7.1_, would be
reasonably likely, in the aggregate, to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect, at or after the Effective Time.

  

Section 7.2 _Certain Filings_. The Company and Parent shall cooperate with one
another (a) in determining whether any action by or in respect of, or filing
with, any governmental body, agency, authority or official is required, or any
actions, consents, approvals or waivers are required to be obtained from
parties to any material contracts, in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (b) in seeking any such
actions, consents, approvals or waivers or making any such filings, furnishing
information required in connection therewith or with the Company Proxy
Statement or the Form S‑4 and seeking timely to obtain any such actions,
consents, approvals or waivers.

  

Section 7.3 _Access to Information_. From the date of this Agreement until the
Effective Time, to the extent permitted by applicable law, the Company and
Parent will, during normal business hours and upon reasonable request, (a)
give the other party and its counsel, financial advisors, auditors and other
authorized representatives access to the offices, properties, books and
records of such party and its Subsidiaries, (b) furnish to the other party and
its counsel, financial advisors, auditors and other authorized representatives
such financial and operating data and other information as such Persons may
reasonably request and (c) instruct its employees, counsel and financial
advisors to cooperate with the other party in its investigation of the
business of the Company or Parent, as the case may be; _provided_ that such
investigation shall not disrupt the Company's or Parent's operations; and
_provided_ , _further_ , that no such

  

 

59  

  

investigation shall affect any representation or warranty given by either
party hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Company, on the
one hand, nor Parent, on the other hand, shall be required to provide any
information which it reasonably believes it may not provide to the other by
reason of any applicable law, which constitutes information protected by
attorney/client privilege, or which it is required to keep confidential by
reason of contract or agreement with any third Person. Each party shall use
reasonable efforts to make reasonable and appropriate substitute disclosure
arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding
sentence apply. All information obtained by Parent or the Company pursuant to
this _Section 7.3_ shall be kept confidential in accordance with, and shall
otherwise be subject to the terms of, the Confidentiality Agreement dated as
of February 20, 2019 between Parent and the Company (the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ "). Without limiting the foregoing, from the date of the Agreement
to the Effective Time, the Company shall, subject to the terms and limitations
of this _Section 7.3_, cooperate in good faith to provide Parent as promptly
as practicable with the information described in Section 7.3 of the Company
Disclosure Schedules.

  

Section 7.4 _Tax Treatment_. Neither Parent nor the Company shall, nor shall
they permit their Subsidiaries to, take any action that would prevent or
impede, or could reasonably be expected to prevent or impede, the Combination
from qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Code, and, Parent and the Company intend to report the Combination for
U.S. federal tax purposes as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code; _provided_ that none of Parent, the Company or any
Subsidiary of either thereof shall have any liability or obligation to any
holder of Company Common Stock should the Combination (or the First Merger
taken separately) fail to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code.

  

Section 7.5 _Public Announcements_. Parent and the Company will consult with
each other before issuing any press release or making any public statement
with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and
shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement
without the prior consent of the other party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) any press release or
public statement as may be required by applicable law or any listing agreement
with any national securities exchange may be issued prior to such
consultation, if the party making the release or statement has used its
reasonable best efforts to consult with the other party, and (b) a party may,
without such consultation, issue a press release or make a public statement
that is consistent with prior press releases issued or public statements made
in compliance with this _Section 7.5_ or any communication plan or strategy
previously agreed to by Parent and the Company. For the avoidance of doubt,
nothing in this _Section 7.5_ shall prevent Parent or the Company from issuing
any press release or making any public statement in the ordinary course that
does not relate specifically to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby.

  

Section 7.6 _Further Assurances_. At and after the Effective Time, the
officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation will be authorized to
execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company, Merger
Subsidiary 1 or Merger Subsidiary 2, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or
assurances and to take any other actions and do any other things, in the name
and on behalf of the Company, Merger Subsidiary 1 or Merger Subsidiary 2,
reasonably necessary to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the
Surviving Corporation any and all right, title and interest in, to and under
any of the rights, properties or assets of the Company

  

 

60  

  

acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in
connection with, the Combination.

  

Section 7.7 _Notices of Certain Events_.

  

(a) Each of the Company and Parent shall promptly notify the other party of:

  

(i) any written notice or other written communication from any Person alleging
that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

  

(ii) any notice or other written communication from any governmental agency,
body, authority or entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; and

  

(iii) any actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings (A) commenced
or (B) to the best of its knowledge, threatened against, relating to or
involving or otherwise affecting such party or any of its Subsidiaries which
relate to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

  

 _provided_ , _however_ , that no such notification (and no other notification
required to be given under any other Section of this Agreement) shall affect
the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties or the
conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement.

  

Section 7.8 _No Solicitation_.

  

(a) The Company and its Subsidiaries will not, and the Company will direct and
use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries' respective
officers, directors, employees, investment bankers, consultants, attorneys,
accountants, agents and other representatives not to, directly or indirectly,
take any action to solicit, initiate, or knowingly encourage or facilitate the
making of any Acquisition Proposal (including without limitation by amending,
or granting any waiver under, Article NINTH of the Company Charter or Section
203 of the DGCL) or any inquiry with respect thereto or engage in discussions
or negotiations with any Person with respect thereto (except to notify such
Person of the existence of the provisions of this _Section 7.8_), or disclose
any nonpublic information or afford access to properties, books or records to
any Person that has made, or to the Company's knowledge is considering making,
any Acquisition Proposal, or approve or recommend, or propose to approve or
recommend, or execute or enter into any letter of intent, agreement in
principle, merger agreement, option agreement, acquisition agreement or other
similar agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal, or propose publicly or
agree to do any of the foregoing relating to an Acquisition Proposal. Nothing
contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Board of Directors of the
Company from (i) complying with Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act with regard
to an Acquisition Proposal or (ii) making any disclosure if, in the case of
this clause (ii), in the good faith judgment of the Company's Board of
Directors, after consultation with outside counsel, the failure to make such
disclosure would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the directors'
exercise of their fiduciary duties to the Company's stockholders under
applicable law; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such disclosure that relates
to an Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be a Change in the

  

 

61  

  

Company Recommendation unless the Company's Board of Directors reaffirms the
Company Recommendation in such disclosure. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement but subject to the first sentence of _Section
7.8(b)_, prior to (but not after) the date of the Company Stockholder
Approval, the Company may, directly or indirectly through its advisors, agents
or other intermediaries, (A) furnish information and access, but only in
response to a request for information or access, to any Person making a bona
fide, written Acquisition Proposal to the Board of Directors of the Company
after the date hereof which was not obtained in breach of _Section 5.2_ or
this _Section 7.8_ and (B) participate in discussions and negotiate with such
Person or its representatives concerning any such unsolicited Acquisition
Proposal, if and only if, in any such case set forth in _clause (A)_ or _(B)_
of this sentence, (1) the Board of Directors of the Company concludes in good
faith, after (x) receipt of the advice of a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation and outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior
Proposal and (y) taking into account any revisions to the terms of the
Combination or this Agreement proposed by Parent after being notified pursuant
to _Section 5.2(b)_, that failure to do so would be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Company's stockholders under
applicable law and (2) (x) the Company receives from the Person making such an
Acquisition Proposal, prior to engaging in any of the activities described in
_clause (A)_ or _(B)_ of this sentence, an executed confidentiality agreement
the material terms of which, as they relate to confidentiality, are (without
regard to the terms of such Acquisition Proposal) in all material respects (i)
no less favorable to the Company and (ii) no less restrictive to the Person
making such Acquisition Proposal than those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement and (y) any information provided to such Person has previously been
provided to Parent or is provided to Parent prior to or substantially
concurrently with the time it is provided to such Person. The Board of
Directors of the Company shall not take any of the actions referred to in the
foregoing _clauses (A)_ and _(B)_ unless the Company shall have first
delivered to Parent written notice advising Parent that the Company intends to
take such action.

  

(b) In the event that on or after the date of this Agreement the Company
receives an Acquisition Proposal, or any request for nonpublic information
relating to the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company or for access to the
properties, books or records of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company
by any Person that has made, or to the Company's knowledge may be considering
making, an Acquisition Proposal, the Company will (A) promptly (and in no
event later than twenty-four (24) hours after receipt thereof) notify (which
notice shall be provided orally and in writing and shall identify the Person
making such Acquisition Proposal or request and set forth the material terms
thereof) Parent thereof, (B) keep Parent reasonably and promptly informed of
the status and material terms of (including with respect to changes to the
status or material terms of) any such Acquisition Proposal or request and (C)
as promptly as practicable (but in no event later than twenty-four (24) hours
after receipt) provide to Parent unredacted copies of all material
correspondence and written materials (whether or not electronic) sent or
provided to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that describes any terms or
conditions thereof, including any proposed transaction agreements (along with
all schedules and exhibits thereto and any financing commitments related
thereto), as well as written summaries of any material oral communications
relating to the terms and conditions thereof. The Company (x) shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated and
shall use reasonable best efforts to cause its and their officers, directors,
employees, investment bankers, consultants, attorneys, accountants, agents and
other

  

 

62  

  

representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated, all
discussions and negotiations, if any, that have taken place prior to the date
hereof with any Persons with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or the
possibility thereof, (y) shall promptly request each Person, if any, that has
executed a confidentiality agreement within the nine (9) months prior to the
date hereof in connection with its consideration of any Acquisition Proposal
to return or destroy all confidential information heretofore furnished to such
Person by or on behalf of it or any of its Subsidiaries and (z) immediately
terminate all physical and electronic data room access for such Person and
their representatives to diligence or other information regarding the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries. The Company shall not modify, amend or terminate,
or waive, release or assign, any provisions of any confidentiality or
standstill agreement (or any similar agreement) to which the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries is a party relating to any such Acquisition Proposal and
shall enforce the provisions of any such agreement; _provided_ that the
Company shall be permitted on a confidential basis, upon written request by a
relevant party thereto or without prior notice to Parent disclosing the party
and the circumstances, release or waive any standstill obligations solely to
the extent necessary to permit the party referred therein to submit an
Acquisition Proposal to the Board of Directors of the Company on a
confidential basis. The Company shall provide written notice to Parent of
waiver or release of any standstill by the Company, including disclosure of
the identities of the parties thereto and circumstances relating thereto.

  

For purposes of this Agreement, " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any bona fide
written offer or proposal for, or any bona fide written indication of interest
in, any (i) direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of any business or
assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that, individually or in the
aggregate, constitutes 20% or more of the net revenues, net income, EBITDA or
assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (ii) direct or
indirect acquisition or purchase of 20% or more of any class of equity
securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries whose business
constitutes 20% or more of the net revenues, net income, EBITDA or assets of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (iii) tender offer or
exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in any Person beneficially
owning 20% or more of any class of equity securities of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries whose business constitutes 20% or more the net revenues, net
income, EBITDA or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, or (iv) merger, consolidation, business combination, joint venture,
partnership, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction
involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries whose business constitutes
20% or more of the net revenue, net income, EBITDA or assets of the Company
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, other than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Superior
Proposal_ " means any bona fide written Acquisition Proposal for or in respect
of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or
the Company's and its Subsidiaries' assets on terms that the Board of
Directors of the Company determines in its good faith judgment (after
consultation with, and taking into account the advice of, a financial advisor
of nationally recognized reputation and outside legal counsel, taking into
account all the terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, including
any break-up fees, expense reimbursement provisions and conditions to
consummation, as well as any revisions to the terms of the Combination or this
Agreement proposed by Parent after being notified pursuant to _Section
5.2(b)_) (i) is more favorable to the Company's stockholders than the
Combination and the Transactions and (ii) constitutes a transaction that is
reasonably likely to be consummated on

  

 

63  

  

the terms so proposed, taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory
and other aspects of such proposal.

  

(c) The Company agrees that it will take the necessary steps promptly to
inform its Subsidiaries and its officers, directors, investment bankers,
consultants, attorneys, accountants, agents and other representatives of the
obligations undertaken in this _Section 7.8_.

  

Section 7.9 _Takeover Statutes_. If (a) the restrictions on business
combinations set forth in Article NINTH of the Company Charter or (b) any
anti-takeover or similar statute or regulation is or may become applicable to
the transactions contemplated hereby, each of the parties and its Board of

of this type that are reasonably requested by Parent to be taken by the
Company or its Subsidiaries under the Company Credit Agreement or any of the
Company's outstanding debt securities in connection with the Combination;
_provided_ that (i) none of the Company, its Subsidiaries or their

(a) by mutual written consent of the Company and Parent;

  

(b) by either the Company or Parent:

  

(i) if the Combination has not been consummated by January 11, 2020 (the "
_End Date_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that if (x) the Effective Time has not
occurred by such date by reason of nonsatisfaction of the condition set forth
in _Section __8.1(b)_ and (y) all other conditions in _Article __VIII_ have
theretofore been satisfied or (to the extent permitted by law) waived or are
then capable of being satisfied, the End Date will be April 11, 2020;
_provided_ , _further_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this
_Section 9.1(b)(i)_ shall not be available to any party whose failure to
fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has principally caused or resulted
in the failure of the Effective Time to occur on or before the End Date; or

  

(ii) if the Company Stockholder Approval shall not have been obtained by
reason of the failure to obtain the required vote at a duly held meeting of
stockholders or any adjournment thereof;

  

(c) by either the Company or Parent, if there shall be any law or regulation
that makes consummation of the Combination illegal or otherwise prohibited or
if any judgment, injunction, order or decree enjoining Parent or the Company
from consummating the Combination is entered and such judgment, injunction,
order or decree shall become final and nonappealable; _provided_ that the
right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section 9.1(c)_ shall not be
available to any party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under _Section

restraint or the failure of such legal restraint to be resisted, resolved or
lifted;

  

(d) by Parent, prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, if there
shall have been a Change in the Company Recommendation, whether or not

Recommendation);

  

(e) by either Parent or the Company, if there shall have been a breach by the

contained in this Agreement, which breach would result in the failure to
satisfy one or more of the conditions set forth in _Section 8.2(a)_ (in the
case of a breach by the Company) or _Section 8.3(a)_ (in the case of a breach
by Parent), and in any such case such breach shall be incapable of being cured

68  

  

capable of being cured, shall not have been cured within 30 days after written
notice thereof shall have been received by the party alleged to be in breach;
or

  

(f) by the Company, in accordance with _Section 5.2(b)(i)_, in order to enter

hereof and in the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive the termination
hereof and (b) no such termination shall relieve any party of any liability or

hereto) may be amended or waived prior to the Effective Time if, and only if,
such amendment or waiver is in writing and signed, in the case of an
amendment, by the Company, Parent, Merger Subsidiary 1 and Merger Subsidiary
2, or in the case of a waiver, by the party against whom the waiver is to be
effective; _provided_ that after the adoption of this Agreement by the
stockholders of the Company, no such amendment or waiver shall, without the
further approval of such stockholders, alter or change (i) the amount or kind
of consideration to be received in exchange for any shares of capital stock of
the Company or (ii) any term of the certificate of incorporation of Parent.

  

(b) No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or

  

 

70  

  

privilege. The rights and remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and not
exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law.

  

Section 10.4 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise specified in _Section 10.5_ or as
otherwise agreed to in writing by the parties, all costs and expenses incurred
in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such cost or expense, except
that those expenses incurred in connection with printing, mailing and filing
the Registration Statement, all fees paid in respect of HSR in connection with
the Combination, and all reasonable and documented fees, costs and expenses
incurred in connection with any cooperation provided or action taken pursuant
to _Section 7.13_ or in connection with any financing to be obtained by Parent
relating to the Combination shall in each case be borne by Parent.

  

Section 10.5 _Company Termination Fee_. If:

  

(i) Parent shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(d)_;

  

(ii) (A) this Agreement is terminated by the Company or Parent pursuant to
_Section 9.1(b)(ii)_, (B) this Agreement is terminated by the Company or
Parent pursuant to _Section 9.1(b)(i)_ and the Company Stockholder Approval
shall not theretofore have been obtained or (C) this Agreement is terminated
by Parent pursuant to _Section 9.1(e)_ and the Company Stockholder Approval
shall not theretofore have been obtained, and after the date hereof but on or
before the date of any such termination an Acquisition Proposal shall have
been made and become publicly known, whether or not withdrawn, (x) prior to
the Company Stockholder Meeting (in the case of a termination contemplated by
_clause (ii)(A)_ ) or (y) prior to the date of such termination (in the case
of a termination contemplated by _clause (ii)(B)_ or _(ii)(C)_ ); or

  

(iii) the Company shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(f)_.

  


 

  

then in any case as described in _clause (i)_ , _(ii)_ or _(iii)_ the Company
shall pay (or cause to be paid) to Parent (by wire transfer of immediately
available funds), (x) in the case described in _clause (i)_ or _(iii)_ ,
$1,000,000,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ ") not later than the date of
termination of this Agreement and (y) in the case described in _clause (ii)_ ,
the Company shall pay (or cause to be paid) an amount equal to the Termination
Fee not later than the date an Acquisition Proposal is consummated or a
definitive agreement is entered into by the Company providing for any
Acquisition Proposal, as long as such Acquisition Proposal is consummated or
such definitive agreement is executed within 12 months after the date of
termination of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that for the purpose
of this _clause (y)_ , all references in the definition of Acquisition
Proposal to 20% shall instead refer to 50%. The Company acknowledges that the
agreements contained in this _Section 10.5_ are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these
agreements, Parent would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the
Company fails to pay timely any amount due pursuant to this _Section 10.5_
and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit which results in
a judgment

  

 

71  

  

against the Company for the amount payable to Parent pursuant to this _Section
10.5_, the Company shall pay to Parent its reasonable costs and expenses
(including attorneys' fees and expenses) in connection with such suit,
together with interest on the amount so payable at the rate on six (6)-month
United States Treasury obligations (as of the date such payment was required
to be made pursuant to this Agreement) plus three percent (3%).

  

Section 10.6 _Successors and Assigns_. The provisions of this Agreement shall
be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and assigns; _provided_ that no party may assign,
delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations under this
Agreement without the consent of the other parties hereto except that Merger
Subsidiary 1 and Merger Subsidiary 2 may transfer or assign, in whole or from
time to time in part, to one or more of its affiliates, its rights under this
Agreement, but any such transfer or assignment will not relieve Merger
Subsidiary 1 and Merger Subsidiary 2 of its obligations hereunder.

  

Section 10.7 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be construed in accordance
with and governed by the law of the State of Delaware, without regard to
principles of conflicts of law.

  

Section 10.8 _Enforcement; Jurisdiction_. The parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached, for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy, and
accordingly, each party agrees that the other party shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which the parties are entitled at law or in equity. Any suit,
action or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any
matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby may only be brought in the Court
of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, only if such court declines to
accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, then in the United States
District Court for the District of Delaware or, if jurisdiction is not then
available in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware
(but only in such event), then in any court sitting of the State of Delaware
in New Castle County) and any appellate court from any of such courts (in any
case, the " _Delaware Court_ "), and each of the parties hereby irrevocably
consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware Courts in any such
suit, action or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the
laying of the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding in any such court
or that any such suit, action or proceeding which is brought in any such court
has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Process in any such suit, action or
proceeding may be served on any party anywhere in the world, whether within or
without the jurisdiction of any of the Delaware Courts. Without limiting the
foregoing, each party agrees that service of process on such party as provided
in _Section 10.1_ shall be deemed effective service of process on such party
when deemed given pursuant to _Section 10.1_; _provided_ that nothing herein
shall affect the right of any party to serve process in any other manner
permitted by applicable law.

  

Section 10.9 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY

  

 

72  

  

LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

  

Section 10.10 _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be signed in
any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same
effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.
This Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto shall have
received counterparts hereof signed by all of the other parties hereto.

  

Section 10.11 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Exhibits and
Schedules hereto), constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes all prior
agreements and understandings, both oral and written, between the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof. Except for the provisions of
(a) Articles II and III (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the rights of
the former holders of Company Common Stock to receive the Merger
Consideration), and (b) _Section 6.3_ (which from and after the Effective Time
are intended for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the Persons
referred to therein and by their respective heirs and representatives), no
provision of this Agreement or any other agreement contemplated hereby is
intended to confer on any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or
remedies.

  

Section 10.12 _Captions_. The captions herein are included for convenience of
reference only and shall be ignored in the construction or interpretation
hereof.

  

Section 10.13 _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms,
provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated so
long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated
hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon
such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as
possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated
hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent
possible.

  

Section 10.14 _Interpretation_. Unless the context otherwise requires, words
describing the singular number shall include the plural and vice versa, words
denoting any gender shall include all genders, and words denoting natural
persons shall include corporations, limited liability companies and
partnerships and vice versa. When a reference is made in this Agreement to
Articles, Sections, Exhibits or Schedules, such reference shall be to an
Article, Section, Exhibit or Schedule, as applicable, of this Agreement unless
otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including"
are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation." The words "hereof," "hereto," "hereby," "herein" and
"hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall
refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this
Agreement. The words "the date hereof", "the date of this Agreement" and words
of similar import mean the day and year first set forth above in the preamble
to this Agreement. Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms "neither,"
"nor," "any," "either" and "or" are not exclusive. The word "extent" in the
phrase "to the extent" means the degree to which a subject or other thing

  

 

73  

  

extends, and such phrase does not mean simply "if." References to "days" shall
mean "calendar days" unless expressly stated otherwise. When used in this
Agreement, "Business Day" means any day other than (i) a Saturday or a Sunday,
(ii) a day on which commercial banks in New York City or the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware is authorized or required by law to be closed
or (iii) any day on which the SEC's Electronic Data Gathering and Retrieval
system is not open to accept filings. References to "from" or "through" any
date mean, unless otherwise specified, from and including or through and
including such date, respectively. Any reference in this Agreement to a date
or time shall be deemed to be such date or time in the City of New York, New
York, U.S.A., unless otherwise specified. Except with respect to any
disclosure in the Company Disclosure Schedules or Parent Disclosure Schedules,
any contract referred to herein means such contract, instrument or law as from
time to time amended, modified or supplemented. References to any statute
shall be deemed to refer to such statute and any rules or regulations
promulgated thereunder. References to a person are also to its permitted
successors and assigns. The words "provided to", "delivered" or "made
available" and words of similar import refer to documents which were delivered
in person or electronically to the other party or its representatives prior to
the execution of this Agreement or, prior to the calendar day immediately
preceding the date hereof, posted to the data site maintained by the
disclosing party or its representatives in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby ( _provided_ that, in the case of delivery via such data
site, the other party had access to such documents in such data site and such
documents were not removed from such data site prior to the execution hereof)
and, for the avoidance of doubt, includes any documents filed or furnished by
the disclosing party or its Subsidiaries with the SEC and publicly available
on the SEC's Electronic Data Gathering and Retrieval system as an exhibit
after December 31, 2016 and prior to the date that was the calendar day prior
to the execution of this Agreement. Each of the parties has participated in
the drafting and negotiation of this Agreement. If an ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement must be construed as if it is
drafted by all the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise
favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of authorship of any of the
provisions of this Agreement.
