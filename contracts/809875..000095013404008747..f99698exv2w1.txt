iii        AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of June 14, 2004
(this "Agreement"), by and among QLT Inc., a company incorporated under the
laws of the Province of British Columbia ("Parent"), Aspen Acquisition Corp.,
a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger
Sub"), and Atrix Laboratories, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the
"Company").   WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger
Sub and the Company have approved the merger of Merger Sub with and into the
Company (the "First Step Merger" or the "Merger") upon the terms and subject
to the conditions of this Agreement and in accordance with the Delaware
General Corporation Law (the "DGCL");   WHEREAS, the respective Boards of
Directors of Parent and the Company have determined that the Merger is
advisable, the Board of Directors of Parent has determined that the Merger is
in the best interest of its shareholders, the Board of Directors of the
Company has determined that the Merger is in the best interests of its
stockholders, and Parent has approved this Agreement and the Merger as the
sole stockholder of Merger Sub;   WHEREAS, for federal income tax purposes,
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company intend that the First Step Merger and the
Second Step Merger shall be treated as a single integrated transaction
(together, the "Transaction") and shall qualify as a "reorganization" under
Sections 367 and 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
"Code") and the regulations promulgated thereunder.   NOW, THEREFORE, in
consideration of the foregoing and the respective representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement and
intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree
as follows:   ARTICLE 1.  THE MERGER   Section 1.1 The Merger. Upon the
terms and subject to satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time,
Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company. As a result of the
Merger, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the
Company shall continue as the surviving corporation following the Merger (the
"Surviving Corporation").   Section 1.2 Closing. The closing of the Merger
(the "Closing") shall take place on the first Business Day after the
satisfaction or waiver (subject to applicable Law) of the conditions
(excluding conditions that, by their nature, cannot be satisfied until the
Closing Date) set forth in Article 7, unless this Agreement has been
theretofore terminated pursuant to its terms or unless another time or date
is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto (the actual date of the Closing
being referred to herein as the "Closing Date"). The Closing shall be held at
the offices of Latham and Watkins LLP, 135 Commonwealth Drive, Menlo Park,
California 94025, unless another place is agreed to in writing by the parties
hereto. As soon as practicable after the Closing, the parties hereto shall
cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a certificate of merger relating
to the Merger (the "Certificate of Merger") with the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware, in such form as required by, and executed
in accordance with the relevant      provisions of, the DGCL (the date
and time of such filing, or if another date and time is specified in such
filing, such specified date and time, being the "Effective Time").  
Section 1.3 Effect of the Merger. At the Effective Time, the effect of
the Merger shall be as provided in the applicable provisions of the DGCL.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, at the Effective Time,
except as otherwise provided herein, all the property, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the
Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company
and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the
Surviving Corporation.   Section 1.4 Certificate of Incorporation;
Bylaws.   (a) Certificate of Incorporation. At the Effective Time, the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended in
its entirety to read as the Certificate of Incorporation of Merger Sub, until
thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law,
except that Article 1 thereof shall be amended to read as follows: "The name
of the Corporation is Atrix Laboratories, Inc."   (b) Bylaws. At the
Effective Time, the Bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time, shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, until
thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.  
Section 1.5 Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation.
The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office
in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation. The President and Chief Executive Officer of Parent
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial President and
Chief Executive Officer of the Surviving Corporation, and the officers of the
Company other than the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer
shall be the other initial officers of the Surviving Corporation, each to
hold office in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of
the Surviving Corporation.   Section 1.6 Second Step Merger. Immediately
following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
merge into a Delaware corporation (the "Second Merger Sub") that is a wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent (the "Second Step Merger"). There shall be no
conditions to the completion of the Second Step Merger other than the
completion of the Merger.   ARTICLE 2.  CONVERSION OF SECURITIES; EXCHANGE
OF CERTIFICATES   Section 2.1 Conversion of Securities. At the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
Company or the holders of any of the following securities:   (a) Conversion
Generally.     2     (i) Each share of common stock, par value $0.001
per share, of the Company ("Company Common Stock") issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, including shares of Company Common
Stock resulting from the conversion of any Series A Convertible Exchangeable
Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company ("Series A
Convertible Preferred Stock") immediately prior to consummation of the Merger
(other than any shares of Company Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to
Section 2.1(b) and Appraisal Shares referred to in Section 2.1(e) ("Excluded
Common Shares")), shall be converted, subject to Section 2.2(e), into the
right to receive: (A) 1.0000 (the "Exchange Ratio") common share, no par
value per share ("Parent Common Shares"), of Parent (the "Common Share
Consideration") and (B) $14.61 in cash (the "Common Cash Consideration," and
together with the Common Share Consideration, the "Common Merger
Consideration").   (ii) Each share of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
any shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock to be canceled pursuant to
Section 2.1(b) and Appraisal Shares referred to in Section 2.1(e) ("Excluded
Preferred Shares" and, together with the Excluded Common Shares, "Excluded
Shares")), excluding shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock converted
prior to consummation of the Merger, shall be converted, subject to Section
2.2(e), into the right to receive: (A) a number of Parent Common Shares (the
"Preferred Share Consideration"), determined to seven decimal places, equal
to the product of the number of shares of Company Common Stock into which
such share of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock is convertible immediately
prior to the Effective Time (the "Conversion Number") and the Exchange Ratio
(the "Preferred Exchange Ratio") and (B) an amount of cash, determined to
seven decimal places (the "Preferred Cash Consideration" and, together with
the Preferred Share Consideration, the "Preferred Merger Consideration"),
equal to the product of the Conversion Number and the Common Cash
Consideration.   (iii) All such shares of Company Common Stock and Series
A Convertible Preferred Stock shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and
each certificate (a "Certificate") previously representing any such shares
shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Common Merger
Consideration or the Preferred Merger Consideration (collectively, the
"Merger Consideration"), as the case may be, payable in respect of such
shares of Company Common Stock or Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, as
the case may be, and the right, if any, to receive cash in lieu of fractional
Parent Common Shares pursuant to Section 2.2(e) and any distributions or
dividends pursuant to Section 2.2(c).   (b) Cancellation of Shares. Each
share of Company Common Stock or Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, if
any, either (i) owned by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) held in the
Company treasury or (iii) owned by any wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and retired and
shall cease to exist and no Merger Consideration or other consideration shall
be delivered in exchange therefor.   (c) Merger Sub. Each share of common
stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be converted into and be exchanged for one newly and validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation.    3    (d) Change in Shares. If, between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding Parent Common Shares,
shares of Company Common Stock or shares of Series A Convertible Preferred
Stock shall have been changed into, or exchanged for, a different number of
shares or a different class, by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision,
reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of shares,
the Exchange Ratio, the Preferred Exchange Ratio and the Option Exchange
Ratio shall be correspondingly adjusted to provide the holders of Company
Common Stock, Series A Convertible Preferred Stock and Company Options the
same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such
event.   (e) Appraisal Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock and Series A Convertible
Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held
by a Company stockholder who has not voted in favor of the Merger or
consented thereto in writing and who has properly demanded appraisal for such
shares in accordance with the DGCL (the "Appraisal Shares"), shall not be
converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in
Section 2.1(a), until such time as such stockholder fails to perfect or
withdraws or otherwise loses such stockholder\'s right to appraisal. If after
the Effective Time such stockholder fails to perfect or withdraws or loses
such stockholder\'s right to appraisal, such shares of Company Common Stock
or Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, as the case may be, shall be treated
as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.1(a). The Company
shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands received by the Company
pursuant to the DGCL for appraisal of shares of Company Common Stock or
Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, and Parent shall have the right to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands.
The Company shall not settle, make any payments with respect to, or offer to
settle, any claim with respect to Appraisal Shares without the
written consent of Parent.   (f) Adjustments to Preserve Tax Treatment.  
(i) If the amount obtained by dividing (x) the Aggregate Parent Share Value
by (y) the Closing Transaction Value is less than 0.4500, the following shall
occur:   (A) The Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted to a number, rounded
to the nearest fourth decimal place, equal to (x) the product of 0.4500 and
the Closing Transaction Value, divided by (y) the product of the Aggregate
Company Share Number and the Closing Parent Share Price.   (B) The Common
Cash Consideration shall be adjusted to an amount, rounded to the nearest
cent, equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the amount obtained by
subtracting the Aggregate Appraisal Value from the product of 0.5500 and the
Closing Transaction Value, by (y) the Aggregate Company Share Number.  
(ii) In the event that the Exchange Ratio and the Common Cash Consideration
are adjusted as provided for in this Section 2.1(f), all references in this
Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, references in Section
2.1(a)(ii)) to the "Exchange Ratio" and the "Common Cash Consideration" shall
refer to the Exchange Ratio and the Common Cash Consideration as adjusted in
this Section 2.1(f) except as may be otherwise specified herein.    
4    (iii) For purposes of this Section 2.1(f), the following terms
shall have the following meanings:   (A) "Aggregate Appraisal Value" means
the product of (x) the aggregate number of Appraisal Shares determined at
Closing, and (y) the sum of (1) the Common Cash Consideration (before any
adjustment pursuant to Section 2.1(f)) and (2) the product of the Exchange
Ratio (before any adjustment pursuant to Section 2.1(f)) and the Closing
Parent Share Price.   (B) "Aggregate Cash Amount" means the product of (x)
the Common Cash Consideration (before any adjustment pursuant to Section
2.1(f)) and (y) the Aggregate Company Share Number.   (C) "Aggregate
Company Share Number" means the number obtained by subtracting (x) the
aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock to be cancelled in the
Merger pursuant to Section 2.1(b) and (y) the aggregate number of Appraisal
Shares determined at Closing, from (z) the aggregate number of shares of
Company Common Stock outstanding on the Closing Date (assuming exercise of
the Warrant, if it is exercised prior to the Effective Time, and exercise of
any stock options, if such options are exercised prior to the Effective
Time).   (D) "Aggregate Parent Share Number" means the product of (x) the
Exchange Ratio (before any adjustment pursuant to Section 2.1(f)) and (y) the
Aggregate Company Share Number.   (E) "Aggregate Parent Share Value" means
the product of (x) the Aggregate Parent Share Number (before any adjustment
pursuant to Section 2.1(f)) and (y) the Closing Parent Share Price.   (F)
"Closing Parent Share Price" means the mean between the high and low selling
prices, regular way, of a Parent Common Share on The Nasdaq Stock Market on
the date of the Effective Time, as reported by Bloomberg LP (or if not so
reported, as reported by such other reporting service as is reasonably agreed
to by the parties).   (G) "Closing Transaction Value" means the sum of (x)
the Aggregate Cash Amount, (y) the Aggregate Parent Share Value and (z)
the Aggregate Appraisal Value.   (iv) For purposes of this Section 2.1(f),
all shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock that are outstanding at
Closing shall be deemed to have been converted into Company Common Stock
immediately prior to Closing in accordance with their terms.   (g)
Associated Rights. References in this Agreement to Parent Common Shares shall
include, unless the context requires otherwise, the associated rights
("Parent Rights") issued pursuant to the Amended and Restated
Shareholder Rights Plan Agreement, as amended and restated, dated as of April
8, 2002, between Parent and Computershare Trust Company of Canada, as Rights
Agent (the "Parent Rights Plan"). References in this Agreement   
5    to Company Common Stock shall include, unless the context requires
otherwise, the Company Rights (defined in Section 3.3(a) below).   Section
2.2 Exchange of Certificates.   (a) Exchange Agent. As of the Effective
Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with
Computershare Trust Company of Canada or another bank or trust company
designated by Parent and satisfactory to the Company (the "Exchange Agent"),
for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock and Series A
Convertible Preferred Stock, for exchange, in accordance with this Article 2,
through the Exchange Agent, sufficient cash and certificates representing
Parent Common Shares to make all deliveries pursuant to this Article 2.
Parent agrees to make available to the Exchange Agent, from time to time as
needed, cash sufficient to pay any dividends and other distributions pursuant
to Section 2.2(c). The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable
instructions delivered by Parent to the Exchange Agent on or prior to the
Effective Time, deliver to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock and
Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (other than holders of Excluded
Shares) the Merger Consideration contemplated to be paid for shares of
Company Common Stock and Series A Convertible Preferred Stock pursuant to
this Agreement out of the Exchange Fund. Except as contemplated by Sections
2.2(c) and 2.2(e) hereof, the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other
purpose. Any cash and certificates representing Parent Common Shares
deposited with the Exchange Agent shall be referred to as the "Exchange
Fund."   (b) Exchange Procedures. Promptly (and in any event, within five
(5) Business Days) after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange
Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or Certificates
which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares
of Company Common Stock or Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (other than
holders of Excluded Shares) (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the
Exchange Agent and shall be in customary form) and (ii) customary
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares
represented by such Certificates, any cash in lieu of fractional Parent
Common Shares pursuant to Section 2.2(e) and any distributions or dividends
pursuant to Section 2.2(c). Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation
to the Exchange Agent together with such letter of transmittal, properly
completed and duly executed, and such other documents as may be required
pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration payable in
respect of the shares represented by such Certificate, any cash in lieu of
fractional Parent Common Shares to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
Section 2.2(e) and any dividends or other distributions to which such holder
is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(c), and the Certificate so surrendered
shall forthwith be canceled. No interest shall be paid or accrued on any Cash
Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares or any unpaid dividends and
distributions payable to holders of Certificates. In the event of a transfer
of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock or Series A Convertible
Preferred Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of the
Company, the Merger Consideration payable in respect of such shares
of Company Common Stock or Series A Convertible Preferred Stock together with
any cash to be paid upon due surrender of the Certificate and any other
dividends or distributions in respect thereof may be paid to a transferee if
the Certificate representing such shares of Company Common Stock or   
6    Series A Convertible Preferred Stock is presented to the Exchange
Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such
transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been
paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each Certificate
shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration payable in
respect of the shares of Company Common Stock or Series A Convertible
Preferred Stock represented by such Certificate, cash in lieu of any
fractional Parent Common Shares to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
Section 2.2(e) and any dividends or other distributions to which such holder
is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(c).   (c) Distributions with Respect to
Unexchanged Parent Common Shares. No dividends or other distributions
declared or made with respect to Parent Common Shares, with a record date
after the Effective Time, shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional Parent Common Shares
shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 2.2(e), unless and until
the holder of such Certificate shall surrender such Certificate. Subject to
the effect of escheat, Tax or other applicable Laws, following surrender of
any such Certificate, there shall be paid to such holder of the certificates
representing whole Parent Common Shares issuable in exchange therefor,
without interest, (i) the amount of any cash due pursuant to Section 2.1 and
cash payable in lieu of fractional Parent Common Shares to which such holder
is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(e) and the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date at or after the Effective Time theretofore
paid with respect to such whole Parent Common Shares and (ii) at
the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions,
with a record date at or after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender
and a payment date subsequent to such surrender, payable with respect to such
whole Parent Common Shares.   (d) Further Rights in Company Common Stock.
The Merger Consideration issued upon conversion of a share of Company Common
Stock or Series A Convertible Preferred Stock in accordance with the terms
hereof (including any dividends or distributions pursuant to Section 2.2(c)
or cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.2(e)) shall be
deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
such share of Company Common Stock or Series A Convertible Preferred Stock,
as the case may be.   (e) Fractional Shares. No fraction of a Parent Common
Share will be issued in connection with the Merger, and no certificates or
scrip for any such fractional shares shall be issued. In lieu thereof, each
holder of shares of Company Common Stock or Series A Convertible Preferred
Stock who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a Parent
Common Share (after aggregating all fractional Parent Common Shares to be
received by such holder) shall, upon surrender of such holder\'s
Certificate(s), receive from Parent an amount of cash (rounded to the nearest
whole cent), without interest, equal to the product of (i) such fraction,
multiplied by (ii) the volume weighted average price, regular way, on The
Nasdaq Stock Market, as reported by Bloomberg LP (or if not so reported, as
reported by such other reporting service as is reasonably agreed to by the
parties) of the Parent Common Shares for the five (5) most recent
trading days ending on the full trading day immediately prior to the
Effective Time (the "Parent Closing Price").      7    (f)
Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains
undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock and Series A Convertible
Preferred Stock for six (6) months after the Effective Time shall
be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and, from and after such delivery to
Parent, any holders of Company Common Stock or Series A Convertible Preferred
Stock who have not theretofore complied with this Article 2 shall thereafter
look only to Parent for the Merger Consideration payable in respect of such
shares of Company Common Stock or Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, as
the case may be, any cash in lieu of fractional Parent Common Shares to which
they are entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(e) and any dividends or other
distributions with respect to Parent Common Shares to which they are entitled
pursuant to Section 2.2(c), in each case, without any interest thereon.  
(g) No Liability. None of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Company shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock or
Series A Convertible Preferred Stock for any such Parent Common Shares (or
dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash from the Exchange
Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law.   (h) Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed
and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such
reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent
shall pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock
or Series A Convertible Preferred Stock represented by such Certificate, any
cash in lieu of fractional Parent Common Shares to which the holders thereof
are entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(e) and any dividends or other
distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section
2.2(c), in each case, without any interest thereon.   (i) Withholding.
Parent or the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder
of Company Common Stock or Series A Convertible Preferred Stock such amounts
as Parent or the Exchange Agent are required to deduct and withhold under the
Code, or any Tax Law, with respect to the making of such payment. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent or the Exchange Agent,
Parent shall, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to, provide the applicable
holder of Company Common Stock or Series A Convertible Preferred Stock with
notice of the reason for withholding such amounts and such withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to
the holder of Company Common Stock Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, as
the case may be, in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made
by Parent or the Exchange Agent.   (j) Investment of Exchange Fund. The
Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund, as
directed by Parent, on a daily basis. Any interest and other income resulting
from such investments shall be paid to Parent upon termination of the
Exchange Fund pursuant to Section 2.2(f). In the event the cash in the
Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to fully satisfy all of the payment
obligations to be made by the Exchange Agent hereunder, Parent shall promptly
deposit cash into the Exchange Fund in an amount which is equal to the
deficiency in the amount of cash required to fully satisfy such
payment obligations.     8    Section 2.3 Stock Transfer Books. At the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and
thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of
Company Common Stock or Series A Convertible Preferred Stock theretofore
outstanding on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time,
the holders of Certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock or
Series A Convertible Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of
Company Common Stock or Series A Convertible Preferred Stock except as
otherwise provided herein or by Law. On or after the Effective Time, any
Certificates presented for any reason to the Exchange Agent or Parent shall
be converted into the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares
of Company Common Stock or Series A Convertible Preferred Stock represented
by such Certificates, any cash in lieu of fractional Parent Common Shares to
which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(e) and any
dividends or other distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled
pursuant to Section 2.2(c), without any interest thereon.   Section 2.4
Stock Options.   (a) The Company shall take all actions necessary to provide
that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Company Option then
outstanding under any Company Stock Option Plan shall become vested and
exercisable with respect to one hundred percent (100%) of the shares of
Company Common Stock subject to each such Company Option; provided that the
holder of such Company Option renders continuous service to the Company as an
employee, consultant or member of the Board of Directors of the Company from
the date hereof until at least immediately prior to the Effective Time. At
the Effective Time, each Company Option then outstanding under any Company
Stock Option Plan, whether or not then exercisable, shall be assumed and
become an option to purchase Parent Common Shares in accordance with this
Section 2.4. Each Company Option so assumed shall continue to have, and be
subject to, the same terms and conditions (including vesting schedule, as
adjusted pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 2.4(a)) as set forth
in the applicable Company Stock Option Plan and any agreements thereunder
immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that, as of the Effective
Time, (i) each Company Option shall be exercisable (or shall become
exercisable in accordance with its terms) for that number of whole
Parent Common Shares equal to the product of the number of shares that were
issuable upon exercise of such Company Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time multiplied by the sum of (A) the Exchange Ratio and (B) the
quotient obtained by dividing the Common Cash Consideration by the Parent
Closing Price (such sum, the "Option Exchange Ratio"), rounded down to the
nearest whole number of Parent Common Shares, and (ii) the per share exercise
price for the Parent Common Shares issuable upon exercise of such Company
Option so converted shall be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the
exercise price per share of Company Common Stock at which such Company Option
was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Option
Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the conversion of any Company Options which are "incentive stock
options," within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code, into options to
purchase Parent Common Shares shall be made so as not to constitute a
"modification" of such Company Options within the meaning of Section 424 of
the Code. Following the assumption of the Company Options, all references to
the Company in the Company Options and the Company Stock Option Plans shall
be deemed to refer to Parent.     9    (b) As soon as practicable after
the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to each holder of an outstanding
Company Option an appropriate notice setting forth such holder\'s rights
pursuant thereto and that such Company Option shall continue in effect on the
same terms and conditions (subject to the adjustments, amendments and other
terms required by this Section 2.4 and Section 6.16(e), as applicable, after
giving effect to the Merger).   Section 2.5 Warrant. If outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, at the Effective Time the Warrant
shall cease to represent a right to acquire shares of Company Common Stock
and automatically shall be converted into a warrant to purchase Parent Common
Shares in accordance with its terms.   ARTICLE 3.  REPRESENTATIONS AND

since December 31, 2003, (ii) liabilities and obligations incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the Company\'s performance of its

other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; or   (G) is a "material
contract" (as such term is defined in Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K of
the SEC).   Each Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
a party or by which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is bound of the
type described in clauses (i) and (ii) above is referred to herein as a
"Company Material Contract." The Company has made     17    available
to Parent true and complete copies of all Company Material Contracts as of
the date hereof.   (b) Each Company Material Contract is valid and binding
on the Company and each of its Subsidiaries party thereto and, to the
Company\'s Knowledge, each other party thereto, and is in full force and
effect, except, insofar as this representation is made as of the Closing

the Company. The Company has not received any written notice from any other
party to any Company Material Contract, and otherwise has no Knowledge, that
such third party intends to terminate, not renew, or challenge the validity
or enforceability of any Company Material Contract, except for such
terminations, non-renewals or challenges as would not be reasonably likely to
have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries, and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no other party
thereto, is in violation of or in default under (nor does there exist any
condition which upon the passage of time or the giving of notice or both
would cause such a violation of or default under) any Company
Material Contract to which it is a party or by which it or any of its
properties or assets is bound, except for violations or defaults that
individually or in the aggregate are not reasonably likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company.   Section 3.9 Compliance with Laws; Permits.
Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is in compliance with all Laws and
rules and regulations of any stock exchange or regulatory organization
applicable to it, its properties or other assets or its business or operation

have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has in full
force and effect all approvals, authorizations, certificates, filings,
consents, clearances, franchises, licenses, notices and permits of or with
all Governmental Entities (collectively, "Permits"), including all Permits
under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act of 1938, as amended (the
"FDCA"), and the regulations of the Federal Food and Drug Administration (the
"FDA") promulgated thereunder, necessary for it to own, lease or operate its
properties and other assets and to carry on its business and operations as
presently conducted, except where the failure to have such Permits
individually or in the aggregate has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. There has occurred
no default under, or violation of, any such Permit, except for any such
default or violation that individually or in the aggregate has not had and
would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company. The consummation of the Merger, in and of itself, will not cause the
revocation, limitation, suspension or cancellation of any such Permit that
individually or in the aggregate would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company.   Section 3.10 Employee Benefit
Plans.   (a) Section 3.10(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a
true and complete list of each "employee benefit plan" as defined in Section
3(3) of ERISA and any other plan, policy, program, practice, agreement,
understanding or arrangement (whether written or oral) providing compensation
or other benefits to any current or former director, officer, employee or
consultant (or to any dependent or beneficiary thereof) of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, which are as of the date hereof, or with respect to any
plan intended to be qualified     18    under Section 401(a) of the
Code, were within the past 6 years, maintained, sponsored or contributed to
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or under which the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries has any obligation or liability, whether actual or
contingent, including all incentive, bonus, deferred compensation, vacation,
holiday, cafeteria, medical, disability, stock purchase, stock option, stock
appreciation, phantom stock, restricted stock or other stock-based
compensation plans, policies, programs, practices or arrangements (each a
"Company Benefit Plan"). Neither the Company nor, to the Knowledge of the
Company, any other Person or entity has any express commitment,
whether legally enforceable or not, to modify, change or terminate any
Company Benefit Plan, other than with respect to a modification, change or
termination required by ERISA or the Code or as otherwise contemplated by
this Agreement. With respect to each Company Benefit Plan, the Company has
delivered to Parent true and complete copies of (i) each Company Benefit Plan
(or, if not written, a written summary of its material terms), including all

terms of any of the Company Benefit Plans as of the date of this Agreement
have been timely made or, if not yet due, have been properly reflected on the
most recent consolidated balance sheet filed or incorporated by reference in
the Company\'s SEC filings prior to the date of this Agreement. With respect

Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1) under any Company Benefit Plan could be
characterized as an "excess parachute payment" (as defined in Section
280G(b)(1) of the Code).   (f) Except as required by applicable Law, no
Company Benefit Plan provides any of the following retiree or post-employment

Subsidiaries by reason of such Foreign Plans.   (h) There are no pending or,
to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened claims (other than claims for

asserted or instituted against any Company Benefit Plan, any fiduciaries
thereof with respect to their duties to the Company Benefit Plans or the
assets of any of the trusts under any of the Company Benefit Plans which
could reasonably be expected to result in any material liability of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation, the Department of Treasury or the DOL.   Section 3.11 Labor and
Other Employment Matters.   (a) To the Knowledge of the Company, each of the
Company and each of its Subsidiaries is in compliance with all applicable

is liable for any payment to any trust or other fund or to any Governmental
Entity, with respect to unemployment compensation benefits, social security
or other benefits or obligations for employees (other than routine payments
to be made in the ordinary course of business and consistent with past
practice). None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any
collective bargaining or other labor union contract applicable to Persons
employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and, as of the date
hereof, no collective bargaining agreement or other labor union contract is
being negotiated by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. As of the date
hereof, there is no labor dispute, strike, slowdown or work stoppage against
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pending or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, threatened which may interfere in any respect that would have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company. No labor union or
similar organization has otherwise been certified to represent any Persons
employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or, as of the date hereof,

against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by the National Labor
Relations Board or any comparable state or foreign agency pending or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, threatened, except where such unfair labor
practice, charge or complaint would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.
There are no material controversies pending or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, threatened, between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any
of their current or former employees, which controversies have or could
reasonably be expected to result in an action, suit, proceeding, claim,
arbitration or investigation before any Governmental Entity. To the Knowledge
of the    21    Company, no employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is in any material respect in violation of any term of any
employment contract, non-disclosure agreement, non-competition agreement, or
any restrictive covenant to a former employer relating to the right of any
such employee to be employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
because of the nature of the business conducted or presently proposed to be
conducted by it or to the use of trade secrets or proprietary information of
others. As of the date hereof, no employee at the level of director or above
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has given written notice
terminating his or her employment with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.   (b) The Company has identified in Section 3.11(b) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule and has made available to Parent true and
complete copies of:   (i) (A) all severance and employment agreements with
directors, officers or employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in

its Subsidiaries with or relating to its directors, officers, employees or
consultants which contain change in control provisions in effect as of the
date hereof (all agreements and arrangements in clauses (i) through (iii),
the "Company Benefit Agreements").  None of the execution and delivery of
this Agreement or any other related agreement or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby will (either alone or in
conjunction with any other event, such as termination of employment) (i)
result in any payment (including severance, unemployment compensation,
parachute or otherwise) becoming due to any director or any employee of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates from the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or Affiliates under any Company Benefit Plan or otherwise,
(ii) significantly increase any benefits otherwise payable under any Company
Benefit Plan or (iii) result in any acceleration of the time of payment or

a party to an employment agreement listed in Section 3.11(b) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule or any agreement incorporating change in control
provisions with the Company has terminated employment or been terminated, nor
to the Knowledge of the Company has any event occurred that could give rise
to a termination event, in either case under circumstances that has given, or
could give, rise to a severance obligation on the part of the Company under
such agreement.   (c) The Company has provided Parent a list identifying as

or other Governmental Entities all Tax Returns that it was required to file.

Taxes due and owing by any of the Company and its Subsidiaries (whether or
not shown on any Tax Returns) have been paid. Neither the Company nor any of
the Company\'s Subsidiaries currently is the beneficiary of any extension of
time within which to file any material Tax Return. No written claim has ever
been made by a Tax authority in a jurisdiction where any of the Company and
its Subsidiaries does not file Tax Returns that it is or may be subject to
taxation by that jurisdiction.   (b) The unpaid Taxes of the Company and its
Subsidiaries did not, as of the date of the financial statements contained in
the most recent Company SEC Filings, exceed the reserve for Tax liability
(excluding any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing
differences between book and Tax income) set forth on the face of the balance
sheets (rather than in any notes thereto) contained in such financial
statements. Since the date of the financial statements in the most recent
Company SEC Filings, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
incurred any liability for Taxes outside the ordinary course of business or
otherwise inconsistent with past custom and practice.   (c) No deficiencies
for Taxes with respect to any of the Company and its Subsidiaries have been
claimed in writing, proposed or assessed by a Tax authority. There are no
pending or, based on written notice, threatened audits, assessments,
administrative proceedings, court proceedings or other actions for or
relating to any liability in respect of material Taxes of any of the
Company or its Subsidiaries. There are no matters under discussion with any
Tax Authority with respect to Taxes that are likely to result in an
additional liability for Taxes with respect to any of the Company or its
Subsidiaries. No issues relating to Taxes of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries were raised by the relevant Tax authority in any completed audit
or examination that would reasonably be expected to recur with a Material
Adverse Effect on Taxes in a later taxable period. The Company has delivered
or made available to Parent true and complete copies of federal, state and
local income Tax Returns of each of the Company and its Subsidiaries and

against or agreed to by any of the Company and its Subsidiaries or any
predecessors since December 31, 1999, with respect to Taxes of any type.

waived any statute of limitations in respect of Taxes or agreed to any
extension of time with respect to a Tax assessment or deficiency, nor has any
request been made in writing for any such extension or waiver.   (d) There

(whether domestic or foreign).   (f) Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any liability for the Taxes of any other Person (other than
the Company and any of its Subsidiaries) under Treasury Regulation Section
1.1502 - 6 (or any similar provision of state, local, or foreign Law), as a
transferee, by contract, or otherwise. None of the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has been a member of an affiliated group filing a consolidated
federal income Tax Return (other than a group the common parent of which is

is bound by or has any obligation under any Tax sharing, Tax allocation or
Tax indemnity agreement or similar Contract or arrangement.   (g) Neither

appropriate owners under such agreement with the Company or such Subsidiary
or such appropriate owners, as the case may be.   (e) Section 3.15(e) of the

Parent SEC Filing has been revised, amended, supplemented or superseded by a
later filed Parent SEC Filing with the SEC, to the Knowledge of Parent, none
of the Parent SEC Filings contains any untrue statement of a material fact or
omits to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading.   (b) The financial statements
(including the related notes) of Parent included in the Parent SEC Filings
complied at the time they were filed, or if amended, the date of such
amendment, as to form in all material respects with applicable accounting
requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect
thereto, were prepared in accordance with GAAP (except, in the case of
unaudited statements, as permitted by the rules and regulations of the SEC)
applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be
indicated in the notes thereto) and each fairly presented in all
material respects the consolidated financial position of Parent and its
consolidated Subsidiaries as of the respective dates thereof and the
consolidated results of their operations and cash flows for the respective
periods then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal
year-end audit adjustments).   (c) Except as and to the extent set forth on
the consolidated balance sheet of Parent and its Subsidiaries as of December
31, 2003 included in Parent\'s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2003, including the notes thereto (the "Parent Form 10-K"), or in the
financial statements included in any Parent SEC Filing filed prior to the
date hereof with the SEC after filing the Parent Form 10-K, neither Parent
nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations of any nature
(whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise), except for (i)
liabilities or obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice since December 31, 2003, (ii) liabilities and
obligations incurred in connection with this Agreement and Parent\'s
performance of its obligations hereunder, and (iii) liabilities
and obligations that would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Parent.    38   None of the Subsidiaries of Parent
are, or have at any time since January 1, 2002 been, subject to the reporting
requirements of Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Exchange Act.   (d) No
"material contract" (as such term is defined in Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation
S-K of the SEC) filed as an exhibit to the Parent Form 10-K has been amended
or modified, except for such amendments or modifications that have been filed
with the SEC as an exhibit to a subsequently dated Parent SEC Filing or would
not currently be required to be filed with the SEC if Parent were a reporting
Person under the Exchange Act.   Section 4.6 Absence of Certain Changes or
Events. Except for liabilities incurred in connection with this Agreement or
as permitted pursuant to Section 5.2, since December 31, 2003, except as
disclosed in the Filed Parent SEC Filings, Parent and each of its
Subsidiaries have conducted their businesses in the ordinary course
consistent with past practice and there has not been any Material Adverse
Effect on Parent, and from such date to the date hereof there has not
been:   (a) any material change by Parent or by any of its Subsidiaries in
its accounting methods not required pursuant to GAAP;   (b) any
declaration, setting aside or payment of any dividend or other distribution
with respect to Parent\'s or any of its Subsidiaries\' capital stock;   (c)
any split, combination or reclassification of Parent\'s or any of
its Subsidiaries\' capital stock or any issuance of or the authorization of
any issuance of any other securities in respect of, in lieu of or in
substitution for, shares of its capital stock;   (d) any revaluation by
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries of any of their assets having a Material
Adverse Effect on Parent; or   (e) any event or development that would,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to prevent or
materially delay the performance of this Agreement by Parent.   Section 4.7
Litigation. Except as and to the extent disclosed in the Filed Parent SEC
Filings there is no suit, claim, action or proceeding pending or, to the
Knowledge of Parent, threatened against or affecting Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries or any of their respective assets that individually or in
the aggregate has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Parent, nor is there any judgment, decree, injunction, rule
or order of any Governmental Entity or arbitrator outstanding against, or, to
the Knowledge of Parent, any demand, requirement, investigation, audit,
inquiry, hearing, review or other similar action brought by any Governmental
Entity involving, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective assets that individually or in the aggregate has had or would
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. There is
no suit, claim, action, proceeding, enforcement action or investigation
pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened against Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries that, as of the date hereof, challenges the validity or
propriety of, or seeks to prevent consummation of, the Merger or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement.      39     Section 4.8
Contracts.   (a) Except as filed as exhibits to the Filed Parent SEC Filings
or as disclosed in Section 4.8 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, none of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by any Contract
which, as of the date hereof (i) would prohibit or materially delay the
consummation of the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; (ii) is a "material contract" (as such term is defined in
Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K of the SEC); (iii) any of the benefits to
any party of which will be increased, or the vesting of the benefits to any
party of which will be accelerated, by the occurrence of any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the value of any of the
benefits to any party of which will be calculated on the basis of any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; or (iv) relates to the
registration of securities. Each Contract to which Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or by which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is
bound of the type described in this Section 4.8, whether or not set forth in
Section 4.8 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, is referred to herein as a
"Parent Material Contract." As of the date hereof, Parent has made available
to the Company true and complete copies of all Parent Material Contracts.  
(b) Each Parent Material Contract is valid and binding on Parent and each of
its Subsidiaries party thereto and, to Parent\'s Knowledge, each other
party thereto, and is in full force and effect, except, insofar as this
representation is made as of the Closing Date, as would not be reasonably
likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Parent has not received
any written notice from any other party to any Parent Material Contract, and
otherwise has no Knowledge, that such third party intends to terminate, not
renew, or challenge the validity or enforceability of any Parent Material
Contract, except for such terminations, non-renewals or challenges as would
not be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Neither
Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries, and, to the Knowledge of Parent, no other
party thereto, is in violation of or in default under (nor does there exist
any condition which upon the passage of time or the giving of notice or both
would cause such a violation of or default under) any Parent Material
Contract to which it is a party or by which it or any of its properties or
assets is bound, except for violations or defaults that individually or in
the aggregate are not reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Parent.   Section 4.9 Compliance with Laws; Permits. Each of Parent and
its Subsidiaries is in compliance with all Laws and rules and regulations of
any stock exchange or regulatory organization applicable to it, its
properties or other assets or its business or operation, except for failures
to be in compliance that individually or in the aggregate have not had and
would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.
Each of Parent and its Subsidiaries has in effect all Permits, including all
Permits under the FDCA, and the regulations of the FDA promulgated
thereunder, necessary for it to own, lease or operate its properties and
other assets and to carry on its business and operations as presently
conducted, except where the failure to have such Permits individually or in
the aggregate has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Parent. There has occurred no default under, or
violation of, any such Permit, except for any such default or violation that
individually or in the aggregate has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. The consummation of the
Merger, in and of itself, will not cause the revocation or cancellation of
any such Permit that individually or in the aggregate would reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.      40    
Section 4.10 Intellectual Property.   (a) Parent and/or its Subsidiaries
owns or licenses all Intellectual Property necessary for the conduct of
Parent\'s business, as presently conducted, free and clear of all Liens other
than Permitted Liens, subject to any rights granted by Parent or its
Subsidiaries to any third party under any licenses set out in the Parent
Disclosure Schedule or under a license to use such information for evaluation
purposes provided pursuant to nondisclosure agreements or material transfer
agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business. To the Knowledge
of Parent, there has been and is no infringement, misappropriation or
violation by third parties of any of Parent\'s Intellectual Property,
except as such infringement, misappropriation or violation, individually or
in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Parent. There is no action, suit, proceeding or
claim pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened in writing or in a
manner that would reasonably be expected to result in any action, suit,
proceeding or claim by others challenging Parent\'s or a Subsidiary\'s rights
in or to any such Intellectual Property. The Intellectual Property owned by
Parent has not been adjudged invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part,
by any Governmental Entity, and there is no pending or to the Knowledge of
Parent, threatened action, suit, proceeding or claim by others challenging
the validity or scope of any such Intellectual Property.   (b) There is no
action, suit, proceeding or claim pending, or to the Knowledge of Parent,
threatened in writing or in a manner that would reasonably be expected to
result in any action, suit, proceeding or claim, by others that Parent or a
Subsidiary has infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated,
or infringes, misappropriates or otherwise violates, any Intellectual
Property or other proprietary rights of others, and Parent has not received
any written notice of such claim. To the Knowledge of Parent, there is no
intellectual property right or other legal right (except as may be contained
in any Material Contract of Parent) that could be asserted by a Person to
exclude or prevent Parent or any of its Subsidiaries from developing,
manufacturing, or selling any current product of Parent or its Subsidiaries
that is material to the conduct of the business of Parent and its
Subsidiaries. To the Knowledge of Parent, no employee of Parent or a
Subsidiary is in or has ever been in violation of any material term of any
employment contract, patent disclosure agreement, invention assignment
agreement, non-competition agreement, non-solicitation
agreement, nondisclosure agreement or any restrictive covenant to or with a
former employer where the basis of such violation relates to such employee\'s
employment with Parent or actions undertaken by the employee while employed
with Parent, except as such violation would not have a Material Adverse
Effect on Parent.   Section 4.11 Taxes.   (a) Parent and each of its
Subsidiaries has duly and timely filed with the appropriate Tax authorities
or other Governmental Entities all Tax Returns that it was required to file.
All such Tax Returns are true and complete in all material respects. All
Taxes due and owing by any of Parent and its Subsidiaries (whether or not
shown on any Tax Returns) have been paid. Neither Parent nor any of Parent\'s
Subsidiaries currently is the beneficiary of any extension of time within
which to file any material Tax Return. No written claim has ever been made by
a Tax authority in a jurisdiction where any of Parent and its Subsidiaries
does not file Tax Returns that it is or may be subject to taxation by that
jurisdiction.      41     (b) The unpaid Taxes of Parent and its
Subsidiaries did not, as of the date of the financial statements contained in
the most recent Parent SEC Filings, exceed the reserve for Tax liability
(excluding any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing
differences between book and Tax income) set forth on the face of the balance
sheets (rather than in any notes thereto) contained in such financial
statements. Since the date of the financial statements in the most recent
Parent SEC Filings, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred
any liability for Taxes outside the ordinary course of business or otherwise
inconsistent with past custom and practice.   (c) No deficiencies for Taxes
with respect to any of Parent and its Subsidiaries have been claimed in
writing, proposed or assessed by a Tax authority. There are no pending or,
based on written notice, threatened audits, assessments, administrative
proceedings, court proceedings or other actions for or relating to any
liability in respect of material Taxes of any of Parent or its
Subsidiaries.   Section 4.12 Regulatory Compliance.   (a) Parent and its
Subsidiaries are, to the Knowledge of Parent, in compliance with the Health
Care Laws material to the operation of their businesses as now being
conducted except for failures to be in compliance that individually or in the
aggregate have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries
has received any written notice that the FDA or any other Governmental Entity
has (i) commenced, or threatened to initiate, any action to withdraw its
approval or request the recall of any of its products, (ii) commenced, or
threatened to initiate, any action to enjoin production of any of its
products or (iii) to Parent\'s Knowledge, commenced, or threatened
to initiate, any action to enjoin the production of any of its products
produced at any facility where any such product is manufactured, tested or
packaged, except for any such action that individually or in the aggregate
has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on Parent.   (b) All clinical trials and, to the Knowledge of Parent,
all studies, tests and preclinical studies conducted by or on behalf of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries were and, if still pending, are being
conducted in all material respects in accordance with experimental protocols,
procedures and controls pursuant to accepted professional scientific
standards and all applicable Laws and Permits. The descriptions of the
results of such studies, tests and trials submitted to FDA and other
Governmental Entities are true and correct in all material respects and
fairly present the data derived from such studies, tests and trials, and
neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has Knowledge of any such studies,
tests or trials the results of which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
believes reasonably call into question its studies, tests, or trial results.
Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any notices
or correspondence from any Governmental Entity requiring the termination
of, suspension of, or modification which materially affects the design, end
points or intended purpose of, any studies, tests or preclinical or clinical
trials conducted by or on behalf of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.  
(c) All reports, documents, claims, notices, or approvals required to
be filed, obtained, maintained, or furnished to any Governmental Entity for
each material medical device, biologic or drug developed, marketed,
manufactured or sold by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries   
42    (each a "Parent Product") have been so filed, obtained, maintained
or furnished, and all such reports, documents, claims and notices were true
and correct in all material respects on the date filed (or were corrected in
or supplemented by a subsequent filing). As to each such Parent Product,
Parent and any relevant Subsidiary, and the officers, employees or agents of
Parent or such Subsidiary, have included in the application for such Parent
Product, where required, the certification described in 21 U.S.C. Section
335a(k)(1) or any similar Law and the list described in 21 U.S.C. Section
335a(k)(2) or any similar Law, and each such certification and list was true
and complete in all material respects when made. In addition, Parent and its
Subsidiaries are in substantial compliance with all applicable registration
and listing requirements set forth in 21 U.S.C. Section 360 and 21 C.F.R.
Part 207 and all similar Laws.   (d) Neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries, nor, to the Knowledge of Parent, any officer, Affiliate,
employee or agent of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, has made an untrue
statement of a material fact or fraudulent statement to the FDA or any other
Governmental Entity, failed to disclose a material fact required to be
disclosed to the FDA or any other Governmental Entity, or committed an act,
made a statement, or failed to make a statement that, at the time such
disclosure was made, would reasonably be expected to provide a basis for the
FDA or any other Governmental Entity to invoke its policy respecting "Fraud,
Untrue Statements of Material Facts, Bribery, and Illegal Gratuities", set
forth in 56 Fed. Reg. 46191 (September 10, 1991) or any similar policy.
Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor, to the Knowledge of Parent,
any officer, employee or agent of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, has been
convicted of any crime or engaged in any conduct for which debarment is
mandated by 21 U.S.C. Section 335a(a), or any similar Law or authorized by 21
U.S.C. Section 335a(b), or any similar Law.   (e) Neither Parent nor any of
its Subsidiaries has received any written notice that the FDA or any other
Governmental Entity has (i) commenced, or threatened to initiate, any action
to withdraw its approval or request the recall of any Parent Product, (ii)
commenced, or threatened to initiate, any action to enjoin production of any
Parent Product or (iii) to Parent\'s Knowledge, commenced, or threatened to
initiate, any action to enjoin the production of any Parent Product produced
at any facility where any Parent Product is manufactured, tested or packaged,
except for any such action that individually or in the aggregate has not had
and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Parent.   (f) To the Knowledge of Parent, there are no facts, circumstances
or conditions that would reasonably be expected to form the basis for any
material investigation, suit, claim, audit, action (legal or regulatory) or
proceeding (legal or regulatory) by a Governmental Entity against or
affecting Parent or any of its Subsidiaries relating to or arising under (i)
the FDCA or the regulations of the FDA promulgated thereunder or (ii) the
Health Care Laws.   Section 4.13 Corporate Governance Matters.   (a)

all material respects with (i) the applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act, (ii) the applicable qualification requirements and

Parent\'s Knowledge no registered public accounting firm or any associate

including Sections 13(k)(2) and (3), since the enactment of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has, directly or
indirectly, made, entered into, arranged, renewed, modified (in any
material way) or forgiven any personal loans to any executive officer or
director of Parent.   (b) The management of Parent has (i) in accordance
with Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, designed disclosure controls and

as Exhibits 7.2(c)(i) and 7.2(c)(ii), respectively.   Section 5.4 Control of
Other Party\'s Business. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give
Parent or Merger Sub, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct

shareholders; provided, however, that the parties shall consult and cooperate
with each other in determining the appropriate time for mailing the Joint

applicable Law, an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such event
or circumstance shall be promptly filed with the SEC and disseminated to
stockholders of the Company and shareholders of Parent, as applicable. All

this Agreement to the Effective Time, the Company and Parent shall, and shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries and each of their respective directors,
officers, employees, accountants, consultants, legal counsel, investment
bankers, advisors, and agents and other representatives (collectively,

Representatives access at reasonable times upon prior notice to the officers,

applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, furnish promptly
such information concerning the business, properties, Contracts, assets,

the parties shall comply with, and shall cause their
respective Representatives to comply with, all of their respective
obligations under the confidentiality agreement, dated March 23, 2004,
previously executed by the Company and Parent (the "Confidentiality
Agreement"); provided,    55    however, the restrictions on Parent,
its Subsidiaries and Affiliates, and their respective Representatives set
forth in paragraphs 3 and 4.3 of the Confidentiality Agreement shall be
inapplicable with respect to any of the transactions set forth in this

or indirectly:   (i) solicit, initiate, encourage, knowingly facilitate or
induce any inquiry with respect to, or the making, submission or announcement
of, any Acquisition Proposal;   (ii) participate or engage in any
discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any nonpublic

as to the existence of these provisions (except to the extent permitted
pursuant to this Section 6.4);   (iii) approve, endorse or recommend any
Acquisition Proposal with respect to the Company (except to the extent
permitted by this Section 6.4); or   (iv) enter into any letter of intent or
similar document or any agreement, commitment or understanding contemplating
or otherwise relating to any Acquisition Proposal or a transaction
contemplated thereby (except for confidentiality agreements permitted
pursuant to Section 6.4(c)).   (v) The Company shall immediately terminate,
and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to immediately terminate, and shall
instruct the Representatives of it and its Subsidiaries to immediately
terminate, all discussions or negotiations, if any, with any third party with
respect to, or any that could reasonably be expected to lead to or
contemplate the possibility of, an Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall as
soon as practicable demand that each Person which has executed within the
twelve-month period prior to the date of this Agreement a confidentiality
agreement with the Company or any of its Affiliates or Subsidiaries or any of
its or their Representatives with respect to such Person\'s consideration of
a possible Acquisition Proposal to immediately return or destroy (which
destruction shall be certified in writing by such Person to the Company) all
confidential information heretofore furnished by the Company or any of its
Affiliates or Subsidiaries or any of its or their Representatives to such
Person or any of its Affiliates or Subsidiaries or any of its or their
Representatives.   (b) Promptly (but in any event within 36 hours) after
receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any request for nonpublic information
or inquiry which it reasonably believes could lead to an Acquisition
Proposal, the Company shall provide Parent with written notice of the
material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, request or
inquiry, and the identity of the Person or group making any such Acquisition
Proposal, request or inquiry, and    56    a copy of all written
materials provided in connection with such Acquisition Proposal, request or
inquiry. After receipt of the Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry, the
Company shall promptly keep Parent informed in all material respects of the
status and details (including material amendments or proposed material
amendments) of any such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry and shall
promptly provide to Parent a copy of all written materials
subsequently provided in connection with such Acquisition Proposal, request
or inquiry.   (c) If the Company receives an Acquisition Proposal which (i)
constitutes a Superior Proposal or (ii) which the Board of Directors of the
Company in good faith concludes could reasonably be expected to result in a
Superior Proposal, the Company shall promptly provide to Parent written
notice that shall state expressly (A) that it has received an Acquisition
Proposal which constitutes a Superior Proposal or which could reasonably be
expected to result in a Superior Proposal, and (B) the identity of the party
making such Acquisition Proposal and the material terms and conditions of the
Acquisition Proposal (the "Superior Proposal Notice") and may then take the
following actions (either directly or through its Subsidiaries or any of
their respective directors, officers, employees or Representatives):   (i)
furnish nonpublic information to the third party making such Acquisition
Proposal, provided, that (A) prior to so furnishing, the Company receives
from the third party an executed confidentiality agreement
containing customary standstill provisions and other terms and conditions
that are no less restrictive to such third party than the terms and
conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement, and (B) contemporaneously with
furnishing any such nonpublic information to such third party, the Company
furnishes a copy of such nonpublic information to Parent (to the extent such
nonpublic information has not been previously so furnished); and   (ii)
participate or engage in any discussions or negotiations with the third party
with respect to the Acquisition Proposal.   (d) For a period of not less
than five Business Days after Parent\'s receipt from the Company of each
Superior Proposal Notice, the Company shall, if requested by Parent,
negotiate in good faith with Parent to revise this Agreement so that the
Acquisition Proposal that constituted a Superior Proposal no longer
constitutes a Superior Proposal.   (e) Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, in response to the receipt of a Superior Proposal
that has not been withdrawn and continues to constitute a Superior Proposal
after the Company\'s compliance with Section 6.4(d), the Board of Directors
of the Company may withhold, withdraw or modify the Company Recommendation
and, in the case of a Superior Proposal that is a tender or exchange offer
made directly to its stockholders, may recommend that its stockholders accept
the tender or exchange offer (any of the foregoing actions, whether by the
Board of Directors or a committee thereof, a "Change of Recommendation"), if
both of the following conditions in Sections 6.4(e)(i) and 6.4(e)(ii) are
met:   (i) the Company Stockholder Approval has not been obtained;
and     57     (ii) the Board of Directors of the Company has
concluded in good faith, following the receipt of advice of its outside legal
counsel, that, in light of such Superior Proposal, the failure of the Board
of Directors to effect a Change of Recommendation would result in a breach of
its fiduciary obligations to its stockholders under applicable Law.   (f)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, (i) the
obligation of the Company to call, give notice of, convene and hold
the Company Stockholders\' Meeting and to hold a vote of the Company\'s
stockholders on this Agreement and the Merger at the Company Stockholders\'
Meeting shall not be limited or otherwise affected by the commencement,
disclosure, announcement or submission to it of any Acquisition Proposal
(whether or not a Superior Proposal), or by any Change of Recommendation and
(ii) in any case in which the Company withholds or withdraws the Company
Recommendation pursuant to Section 6.4(e), the Company shall nonetheless
submit this Agreement to a vote of its stockholders. The Company agrees that
it shall not submit to the vote of its stockholders any Acquisition Proposal
(whether or not a Superior Proposal) or propose to do so.   (g) Nothing
contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to restrict the Company from
complying with Rules 14d-9 or 14e-2 under the Exchange Act or be deemed to
restrict the Company or Parent from making such other disclosures as may be
required by federal securities Laws or applicable fiduciary duties Laws.  
(h) Nothing contained in Section 5.1 of this Agreement shall be deemed
to limit or restrict in any manner the rights of the Company pursuant to
this Section 6.4.   Section 6.5 Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings.  
(a) The Company and Parent shall use their reasonable best efforts to:   (i)
take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, and do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law or
otherwise to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement as promptly as practicable;   (ii) obtain from any
Governmental Entities any consents, licenses, permits, waivers, approvals,

Adverse Effect on the Company or Parent, respectively, from occurring prior
to or after the Effective Time;   (iii) make all necessary filings, and

respectively, and use, and cause their respective Subsidiaries to
use, reasonable best efforts to obtain any non-governmental third party

Agreement, (B) required to be disclosed in the Company Disclosure Schedule or
the Parent Disclosure Schedule, as applicable, or (C) required to prevent a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company or Parent, respectively, from

Section 6.5(a), Parent and the Company shall duly file with the U.S. Federal
Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, and
in any applicable Canadian or foreign jurisdiction with the appropriate
Governmental Entity, the notification and report form required under the HSR
Act or the antitrust or competition laws of such Canadian or foreign
jurisdiction with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
as promptly as practicable, and in any event within ten (10) days after the
date hereof. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to require Parent or
the Company to agree to, or proffer to, divest or hold separate any assets or
other portion of any business of Parent, the Company or any of
their respective Subsidiaries.   (c) Parent and the Company shall cooperate
with each other in connection with the making of all filings, the giving of
all notices and the obtaining of all consents referenced in Section 6.5(a),
including, with respect to filings, providing copies of all such filings
(other than information with respect to third parties) to the non-filing
party and its advisors prior to filing and, if requested, to consider all
reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested in connection therewith,
subject to applicable Law. Subject to applicable Law, each of Parent and the
Company shall keep the other apprised of the status of matters relating to
the completion of the transactions contemplated hereby, including promptly
furnishing the other with copies of written notices or other communications
received by Parent or the Company, as the case may be, or any of their
respective Affiliates from any third party or Governmental Entity
with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby. Parent and the Company
shall have the right to review in advance, and to the extent practicable each
shall consult the other on, all the information relating to the Company and
its Subsidiaries or Parent and its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, that
appears in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third
party and/or any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In the event that either
party shall fail to obtain any third party consent described in Section
6.5(a), such party shall use reasonable best efforts, and shall take any such
actions reasonably requested by the other party hereto (it being understood
that such action may become effective at or after the Effective Time), to
minimize any adverse effect upon the Company and Parent, their respective
Subsidiaries, and their respective businesses resulting, or which could
reasonably be expected to result after the Effective Time, from the failure
to obtain such consent.   (d) Subject to, but without limiting the foregoing
Sections 6.5(a) and (b), Parent and the Company shall each use reasonable
best efforts to avoid the entry of, or to have    59    vacated or
terminated, any decree, order, or judgment that would restrain, prevent or
delay the Closing, on or before the Outside Date, including defending through
litigation on the merits any claim asserted in any court by any Person, and
to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any
antitrust, competition or trade regulation Law that may be asserted by any
Government Entity with respect to the Merger so as to enable the Closing to
occur as soon as reasonably possible (and in any event no later than the
Outside Date).   (e) From the date of this Agreement until the Effective
Time, each party shall promptly notify the other party in writing of any
pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company or Parent, as appropriate,
threatened action, suit, arbitration or other proceeding or investigation by
any Governmental Entity or any other Person (i) challenging or seeking
damages in connection with the Merger or the conversion of Company Common
Stock into Parent Common Shares pursuant to the Merger or (ii) seeking to
restrain or prohibit the consummation of the Merger or otherwise limit the
right of Parent or its Subsidiaries to own or operate all or any portion of
the businesses or assets of the Company or its Subsidiaries.   (f) The
Company and Parent shall cooperate and use reasonable best efforts to obtain
the agreement of the holder of the Warrant to exercise the Warrant prior to
Closing. At Parent\'s direction, the Company shall exercise its option to
cause all outstanding shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock to
be converted into Company Common Stock prior to Closing.   (g) Subject to
applicable Law, between the date hereof and the Effective Time, the Company
and Parent will consult and cooperate on matters relating to the integration
of Parent\'s and the Company\'s respective businesses and personnel following
the Effective Time and will periodically meet to discuss and review such
matters.   Section 6.6 Certain Notices. From and after the date of this
Agreement until the Effective Time, each party hereto shall promptly notify
the other party hereto of (a) the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any event
that would be likely to cause any condition to the obligations of any party
to effect the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement not to be satisfied or (b) the failure of the Company or Parent, as
the case may be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement
which would reasonably be expected to result in any condition to the
obligations of any party to effect the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement not to be satisfied; provided, however, that
the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.6 shall not cure any
breach of any representation or warranty, the failure to comply with any
covenant, the failure to meet any condition or otherwise limit or affect the
remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice. Subject to
applicable Law, promptly after the date hereof, Parent and the Company shall
establish a process for an ongoing dialogue and shall communicate on a
regular basis from and after the date of this Agreement until the
Effective Time with respect to significant business developments of the
parties, including any transaction of a type required to be disclosed on a
Current Report filed on Form 8-K pursuant to the Exchange Act (or that would
be required to be disclosed by a reporting person under the Exchange
Act).      60     Section 6.7 Public Announcements. Parent and the
Company will consult with each other before issuing, and provide each other
the opportunity to review and make reasonable comment upon, any press release
or making any public statement with respect to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby and, except as may be required by applicable
Law or any listing agreement with Nasdaq or the Toronto Stock Exchange, will
not issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to
such consultation; provided, however, each of Parent and the Company may make
any public statement in response to specific questions by the press,
analysts, investors or those attending industry conferences or financial
analyst conference calls, so long as any such statements are not inconsistent
with previous press releases, public disclosures or public statements made
jointly by Parent and the Company and do not reveal non-public information
regarding the other party.   Section 6.8 Nasdaq and Toronto Stock Exchange
Listings. Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to cause (a) the Parent
Common Shares to be issued in the Merger to be approved, subject to customary
conditions, for listing upon the Effective Time on Nasdaq and on the Toronto
Stock Exchange, or on such other national securities exchange or Designated
Offshore Securities Market as the Parent Common Shares are then listed and
(b) the Parent Common Shares issued upon the exercise of converted Company
Options or upon the exercise of the Company Warrant as converted pursuant to
Section 2.5 hereof, if applicable, to be approved, subject to customary
conditions, for listing on Nasdaq and the Toronto Stock Exchange or on such
other national securities exchange or Designated Offshore Securities Market
as the Parent Common Shares are then listed. Parent shall use reasonable best
efforts to insure that there are no legal or regulatory restrictions or
limitation on the ability to transfer or resell such Parent Common Shares in
Canada or the United States, except for restrictions generally arising under
applicable United States and Canadian Law.   Section 6.9 Indemnification of
Directors and Officers.   (a) For six (6) years after the Effective Time,
Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and
hold harmless, and provide advancement of expenses to, all past and present
directors and officers of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and their
respective estates, heirs and personal representatives (the "Indemnified
Parties") to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL and other applicable
Law against any costs or expenses (including reasonable expenses of counsel)
as incurred (provided such Indemnified Party provides an undertaking to the
extent required by the DGCL to repay such expenses if it is ultimately
determined that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities, and amounts paid in
settlement in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of or pertaining to acts or omissions occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time (including acts or omissions occurring in connection with
the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby) in the performance of their duties on behalf of the
Company or any such Subsidiary, as applicable or otherwise arising out of or
pertaining to in whole or in part the fact that such person is or was a
director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.   (b) For
six (6) years from the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, cause to be maintained in effect for the benefit of
the Company\'s     61    current directors and officers an insurance
and indemnification policy that provides coverage for acts or omissions
occurring prior to the Effective Time (the "DandO; Insurance") covering each
such Person currently covered by the officers\' and directors\' liability
insurance policies of the Company on terms with respect to coverage and in
amounts no less favorable in the aggregate than those of the Company\'s
policies in effect on the date hereof; provided, however, that the Surviving
Corporation shall not be required to pay an annual premium for the DandO;
Insurance in excess of the amount set forth on Schedule 6.9(b); provided,
further, Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to select a DandO; insurance
carrier which lists as an approved counsel the law firm (the "Designated Law
Firm") with which the person identified on Schedule 6.9(b) (the "Designated
Person") is then associated. In lieu of the foregoing, Parent may obtain, or
request that the Company obtain, from such insurance carrier
extended reporting period coverage under the Company\'s existing officers\'
and directors\' insurance policies; provided, however, Parent shall not be
required to pay more than the amount set forth on Schedule 6.9(b) in the
aggregate for such extended reporting period coverage and provided, further,
that such extended reporting period coverage is no less favorable to the
Company\'s officers and directors than the foregoing coverage. If such
coverage cannot be obtained for such amounts, Parent shall provide, in
consultation with the Persons currently covered by the Company\'s directors\'
and officers\' insurance, the maximum amount of coverage as may be obtained
for such amounts.   (c) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, cause to be maintained in effect in the Surviving
Corporation\'s Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws provisions with
respect to indemnification and advancement of expenses that are at least as
favorable to the intended beneficiaries as those contained in the Company
Certificate of Incorporation and the Company Bylaws as in effect on the date
hereof.   (d) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under
paragraph (a) of this Section 6.9, upon learning of any such claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify Parent thereof, but
the failure to so notify shall not relieve Parent of any liability it may
have to such Indemnified Party unless, and only to the extent that, Parent is
materially prejudiced thereby. In the event of any such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, (i) the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel
reasonably satisfactory to Parent (it being understood that such counsel must
be included on the list of approved counsel maintained by Parent\'s or the
Surviving Corporation\'s (or its successors\') insurance carrier under the
applicable DandO; Insurance, that the Designated Law Firm and the Designated
Person are each satisfactory to Parent and that if the Designated Law Firm is
not on such list and the Designated Person is selected by the Indemnified
Parties to represent them as co-counsel in accordance herewith, Parent shall
pay the reasonable fees and expenses of the Designated Person and the
Designated Law Firm incurred with respect to such representation in addition
to fees and expenses of approved counsel), and Parent shall pay all
reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties
promptly as statements therefor are received; provided, however, except to
the extent the Indemnified Parties are entitled to retain the Designated Law
Firm and the Designated Person as co-counsel, Parent shall be obligated
pursuant to this paragraph (d) to pay for only one firm of counsel for all
Indemnified Parties unless the use of one counsel for such Indemnified
Parties would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) Parent,
the Surviving Corporation and the Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the
defense of any such matter, and (iii) Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall not be liable for any settlement effected without the prior
written consent of Parent, provided that Parent shall    
62    consent to any Covered Settlement. For purposes of this Section
6.9(d), a "Covered Settlement" shall mean a settlement for monetary damages
only which (i) is covered under the DandO; Insurance and does not exceed the
limits of the applicable DandO; Insurance covering such claim, (ii) does not
contain an admission of liability on behalf of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or their Affiliates or any other non-monetary conditions binding
on Parent, the Surviving Corporation or their Affiliates, and (iii) has been
consented to by the insurance carrier under such DandO; Insurance (if such
consent is required under the terms of such DandO; Insurance).   (e)
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the
provisions of this Section 6.9 are intended to be for the benefit of
each Indemnified Party. The obligations of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation under this Section 6.9 shall not be terminated or modified in
such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Party to whom this
Section 6.9 applies without the express written consent of such affected
Indemnified Party.   Section 6.10 Plan of Reorganization. This Agreement is
intended to constitute a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of
Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-2(g).   Section 6.11 Affiliate Letters.
The Company shall, promptly after the date hereof and prior to the mailing of
the Joint Proxy/Prospectus, deliver to Parent a list setting forth the names
of all persons the Company expects to be, at the time of the Company
Stockholders\' Meeting, "affiliates" of the Company for purposes of Rule 145
under the Securities Act. The Company shall furnish such information and
documents as Parent may reasonably request for the purpose of reviewing the
list. The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause each Person who
is identified as an affiliate in the list furnished or supplemented pursuant
to this Section 6.11 to execute a written agreement, promptly following the
date hereof, in substantially the form of Exhibit 6.11 hereto.   Section
6.12 Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time the Board of Directors
of the Company or an appropriate committee of non-employee directors thereof,
shall adopt a resolution consistent with the interpretive guidance of the SEC
so that the disposition by any officer or director of the Company who is a
covered Person of the Company for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange
Act of shares of Company Common Stock or Company Options pursuant to this
Agreement and the Merger shall be an exempt transaction for purposes of
Section 16 of the Exchange Act.   Section 6.13 Stock Award Matters.   (a)
The Company shall, and shall cause the administrator(s) of each of
the Company Stock Option Plans to, take any and all actions necessary (under
the applicable Company Stock Option Plan and otherwise) to cause the Company
Options to be treated in accordance with Section 2.4 hereof, including if
necessary amending the Company Stock Option Plans and, if necessary,
obtaining the consent of the optionholders to such treatment.   (b) Parent
shall file one or more registration statements on Form S-8 (or any other
successor or other appropriate form) within five (5) Business Days after the
Closing Date, and, if required, one or more registration statements on Form
S-3 (or any other successor or other appropriate form) within twenty
(20) days after the Closing Date, in each case with respect to the Parent
Common Shares subject to options issued pursuant to Section 2.4 and shall
maintain the     63    effectiveness of such registration statement or
registration statements (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or
prospectuses contained therein) for so long as such options remain
outstanding.   Section 6.14 Company ESPP. The Company shall take all actions
necessary to provide that, following the date hereof, no additional shares of
Company Common Stock shall be issued under the Company\'s 1997 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan (the "Company ESPP") and all accumulated payroll deferrals
shall be distributed to participants under the Company ESPP as soon as
practicable following the date hereof.   Section 6.15 Board of Directors of
Parent; Vice Chairman. Effective as of the Effective Time, the size of the

members by the appointment of two additional directors of Parent in
accordance with this Section 6.15. David R. Bethune shall be appointed as an
additional director of Parent effective at the Effective Time. An individual
selected by the Board of Directors of the Company from among its members, who
shall be reasonably acceptable to the Board of Directors of Parent,
consistent with the policies of its Corporate Governance and Nominating
Committee, shall be appointed as an additional director of Parent effective

Directors of Parent within four months following the Effective Time, the

who shall be reasonably acceptable to the Board of Directors of Parent
consistent with the policies of its Corporate Governance and Nominating
Committee as notified by Parent to the Company prior to the Effective Time.
David R. Bethune shall be appointed Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors
of Parent for a term of three months commencing at the Effective Time.
Parent\'s chief executive officer, in consultation with such Vice Chairman of
the Board of Directors of Parent, shall be directly responsible for the
oversight and direction of the integration of the businesses of the Company
and Parent including with respect to the orderly transition of the
Company.   Section 6.16 Benefit Matters.   (a) For a period of not less

Company who remain in the employment of the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries (the "Continuing Employees") shall receive health insurance

benefits generally that, in each case, are in the aggregate substantially
comparable to the employee benefits provided under the Company\'s employee
benefit plans to such employees immediately prior to the Effective Time;
provided, that neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation nor any of their
Subsidiaries shall have any obligation to issue, or adopt any plans or
arrangements providing for the issuance of shares of capital stock,
warrants, options or other rights in respect of any shares of capital stock
of any entity or any securities convertible or exchangeable into such shares
pursuant to any such plans or arrangement; provided, further, that no plans
or arrangements of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries providing for such
issuance shall be taken into account in determining whether employee benefits
are substantially comparable in the aggregate. Nothing contained herein shall
be construed as requiring, and the Company shall take no action that would
have the effect of requiring, Parent or the Surviving Corporation to continue
any specific    64    plans or to continue the employment of any
specific Person or, from modifying the terms or carriers of any specific
plans.   (b) With respect to any employee benefit plan maintained by Parent

cause the Surviving Corporation to (i) waive all limitations as to
preexisting conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to
participation and coverage requirements otherwise applicable to Continuing
Employees, and (ii) provide each Continuing Employee with credit for any co-

benefit accrual under any "employee pension benefit plan" as defined in
Section 3(2) of ERISA.   (d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
take all actions necessary to amend the Company 401(k) Savings and Retirement
Plan (the "401(k) Plan") to provide that, on and after the Effective Time, no
additional investments shall be permitted under the Company stock fund under
the 401(k) Plan (other than amounts invested in such fund as of the Effective
Time).   (e) (i) Unless and to the extent otherwise instructed by the
Company prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall take all actions necessary
to, immediately following the Effective Time, offer each holder of an
Eligible Assumed Option (as defined below) an amendment at such holder\'s
election to provide that each Eligible Assumed Option shall be exercisable
until the earlier of (A) the expiration of its term or (B) in the case of an
Eligible Assumed Option held by a non-employee director of the Company,
twelve (12) months following the date of the termination of such holder\'s
directorship at Parent, the Company or any of Parent\'s Affiliates, and in
the case any other Eligible Assumed Option, twelve (12) months following the

misfeasance, gross negligence or nonfeasance of duty by such employee or

officers, directors or employees; (C) any arrest, indictment   
65    (defined as any proceeding in which "probable cause" is found),
conviction (or the civil equivalent) of such employee or consultant or a plea
of guilty or nolo contendere by such employee or consultant to a charge based

the crime is classified under the applicable law as a "misdemeanor"),
including, but not limited to (x) crimes or civil offenses involving theft,
embezzlement, fraud, dishonesty or moral turpitude; (y) crimes or civil
offenses based on banking or securities laws (including the Sarbanes-Oxley

rules of Nasdaq or the Toronto Stock Exchange, requires further approval by
such stockholders. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument
in writing signed by the parties hereto.   Section 8.4 Waiver. At any time
prior to the Effective Time, any party hereto may (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other party
hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of
the other party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant

rules of Nasdaq or the Toronto Stock Exchange, requires further approval by
such stockholders. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party or parties to be bound
thereby, but such extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict
compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not
operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other
failure.   Section 8.5 Fees and Expenses. Subject to Sections 6.1(d), 8.2(a)
and 8.2(b), all Expenses incurred by the parties hereto shall be borne solely

shall mean U.S. dollars.   Section 9.6 Severability. If any term or other
provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced by any rule of Law or public policy, all other conditions and
provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and
effect. Upon such determination that any term other provision is invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in
good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of
the parties as closely as possible to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions
contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.   Section 9.7
Entire Agreement. This Agreement (together with the Exhibits, Parent and

void.   Section 9.9 Parties in Interest. This Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto and their
respective successors and assigns, and nothing in this Agreement, express or
implied, other than pursuant to Section 6.9, is intended to or shall confer
upon any other Person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever

materiality hereunder.   Section 9.14 Counterparts. This Agreement may be
executed in one or more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in
