iv AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER



This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of December 20, 2005 (as amended,
supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, this " _Agreement_ "),
is entered into by and among Seagate Technology, an exempted company
incorporated with limited liability under the laws of the Cayman Islands ("
_Seagate_ "), MD Merger Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a direct
wholly owned subsidiary of Seagate (" _Merger Sub_ "), and Maxtor Corporation,
a Delaware corporation (" _Maxtor_ ").



The respective Boards of Directors of each of Seagate and Maxtor have
determined that it is in the best interests of their respective companies and
stockholders for Seagate to acquire Maxtor upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein.



The Boards of Directors of Seagate, Merger Sub and Maxtor have each approved
the merger of Merger Sub with and into Maxtor (the " _Merger_ ") in
accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "
_DGCL_ ") and subject to the conditions set forth herein, which Merger will
result in, among other things, Maxtor becoming a wholly owned subsidiary
of Seagate.



As a condition to Maxtor entering into this Agreement and incurring the
obligations set forth herein, concurrently with the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, Maxtor is entering into a Voting Agreement with certain
significant stockholders of Seagate (the " _Voting Agreement_ ") pursuant to
which, among other things, such stockholders have agreed, subject to the terms
and conditions thereof, to vote all shares of Seagate Common Stock owned by
them in accordance with the terms of the Voting Agreement.



It is the intention of the parties to this Agreement that the Merger
be treated as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, and that this Agreement shall constitute
a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section
1.368-2(g).



Therefore, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations,
warranties and agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally
bound hereby, the parties agree as follows:



   1. | THE MERGER 
---|--- 



1.1 _The Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in
accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time (as hereinafter defined)
Merger Sub shall merge with and into Maxtor. Maxtor shall be the surviving
corporation (hereinafter sometimes called the " _Surviving Company_ ") in the
Merger, and shall continue its corporate existence under the laws of the State
of Delaware as a wholly owned Subsidiary of Seagate.

 



1.2 _Effective Time_. The Merger shall become effective as set forth in the
certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") which shall be filed
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the " _Delaware
Secretary_ "), on the Closing Date (as hereinafter defined). The term "
_Effective Time_ " shall mean the time on the Closing Date when the Merger
becomes effective, as set forth in the Certificate of Merger.



1.3 _Effects of the Merger_. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall
have the effects set forth in the DGCL.



1.4 _Closing of the Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, the closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will take place
at 9:00 a.m. Eastern time on the date that is the second Business Day after
the satisfaction or waiver (subject to applicable law) of the conditions set
forth in Section 8 hereof, other than conditions which by their terms are to
be satisfied at Closing, or such other date or time as the parties may
mutually agree (the " _Closing Date_ "). For purposes of this Agreement, a "
_Business Day_ " shall mean any day that is not a Saturday, a Sunday or other
day on which the office of the Delaware Secretary is closed.



 

1 1.5 _Certificate of Incorporation_. At the Effective Time, the Restated
Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended to
read in its entirety as the Certificate of Incorporation of Merger Sub read
immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that (i) the name of the
Surviving Company shall be Maxtor and (ii) the provision in the Certificate
of Incorporation of Merger Sub naming its incorporator shall be omitted.



1.6 _Bylaws_. At the Effective Time, the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
shall be amended so as to read in their entirety as the Bylaws of Merger Sub
as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, until thereafter amended
in accordance with applicable law, except the references to Merger Subs name
shall be replaced by references to Maxtors name.



1.7 _Board of Directors_. The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Company, each to
hold office in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of
the Surviving Company, until their respective successors are duly elected or
appointed (as the case may be) and qualified.



1.8 _Officers_. The officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Company, each to hold office until
the earlier of such officers resignation or removal.



   2. | EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE CONSTITUENT
CORPORATIONS 
---|--- 



2.1 _Conversion of Maxtor Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, without any
action on the part of Seagate, Merger Sub, Maxtor or the holder of any of the
shares of common stock of Maxtor, the Merger shall be effected in accordance
with the following terms:



(a) All shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Maxtor (the "
_Maxtor Common Stock_ ") owned directly by Maxtor (including treasury shares)
or Seagate (other than shares in trust accounts, managed accounts and the like
or shares held in satisfaction of a debt previously contracted) shall be
cancelled and retired (the " _Cancelled Shares_ ") and shall not represent
capital stock of the Surviving Company and shall not be exchanged for common
shares, par value $0.00001 per share, of Seagate (" _Seagate Common Stock_ "),
cash or other consideration.



(b) Each outstanding share of Maxtor Common Stock (other than the
Cancelled Shares) shall, subject to Section 2.2, be converted into and become
the right to receive 0.37 validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares
of Seagate Common Stock (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ").



(c) The Exchange Ratio set forth above shall be subject to
appropriate adjustments in the event that, subsequent to the date of this
Agreement but prior to the Effective Time, the outstanding Seagate Common
Stock shall have been increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a
different number or kind of shares or securities through reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, share dividend (including any dividend or
distribution of securities convertible into Seagate Common Stock), share
split, reverse share split, or other like changes in Seagates
capitalization, or a record date that is subsequent to the date of this
Agreement but prior to the Effective Time has been established by Seagate in
regard to any of the foregoing.



2.2 _No Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, neither certificates nor scrip for fractional shares of
Seagate Common Stock shall be issued in the Merger. Each holder of Maxtor
Common Stock who otherwise would have been entitled to a fraction of a share
of Seagate Common Stock shall receive in lieu thereof cash (without interest)
in an amount determined by multiplying the fractional share interest to which
such holder would otherwise be entitled (after taking into account all shares
of Maxtor Common Stock owned by such holder immediately prior to the
Effective Time) by the Seagate Share Price. The " _Seagate Share Price_ "
shall mean the average of the closing sale prices of one share of Seagate
Common Stock for the twenty trading days immediately preceding the Closing
Date on the New York Stock Exchange (the " _NYSE_ ") as reported by _The Wall
Street Journal_. No such holder shall be entitled to dividends, voting rights
or any other rights in respect of any fractional share. 



 

2 2.3 _Conversion of Merger Sub Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, each
share of Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub (the "
_Merger Sub Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be automatically converted into one validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Company and
shall thereafter constitute all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of
the Surviving Company. Each stock certificate of Merger Sub evidencing
ownership of any shares of Merger Sub Common Stock shall continue to evidence
ownership of shares of capital stock of the Surviving Company.



2.4 _Treatment of Options and Other Stock-Based Awards_.



(a) At the Effective Time, each option granted (or previously assumed) by
Maxtor to purchase shares of Maxtor Common Stock (each a " _Maxtor Option_ "),
which is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall cease to represent a right to acquire shares of Maxtor Common Stock and
shall be assumed by Seagate and converted automatically, and in accordance
with the terms of the plan documents and agreements, notices or letters
governing such options, into an option to purchase shares of Seagate Common
Stock (a " _Converted Option_ ") in an amount and at an exercise price
determined as provided below (and each Converted Option otherwise shall
remain subject to the terms of the Maxtor Amended and Restated 1996 Stock
Option Plan, the Maxtor 2005 Performance Incentive Plan, or other governing
share-based plan document, including plan documents governing options that
have previously been assumed by Maxtor as a result of corporate acquisition
transactions by Maxtor, as applicable (collectively, and in each case as the
same may be amended to the date hereof, the " _Maxtor Stock Plans_ ") and the
agreements, notices or letters evidencing grants thereunder):



(i) the number of shares of Seagate Common Stock to be subject to the
Converted Option shall be equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of
Maxtor Common Stock subject to the Maxtor Option and (y) the Exchange Ratio,
_provided_ that any fractional shares of Seagate Common Stock resulting from
such multiplication shall be rounded down to the nearest whole share; and



(ii) the exercise price per share of Seagate Common Stock under the Converted
Option shall be equal to the exercise price per share of Maxtor Common Stock
under the Maxtor Option divided by the Exchange Ratio, _provided_ that such
exercise price shall be rounded up to the nearest cent.



In the case of any Maxtor Option which is, immediately prior to the Effective
Time, an "incentive stock option" (as defined in Section 422 of the Code),
the exercise price, the number of shares purchasable pursuant to the
corresponding Converted Option and the terms and conditions of exercise of
such Converted Option shall be determined in order to comply with Section
424(a) of the Code and to avoid a "modification" of any such option under
Code Section 424(h). In all events, Maxtor Options shall be converted into
Converted Options in such a manner as to be compliant with Section 409A of the
Code (or an available exemption therefrom) and any guidance issued thereupon
by the U.S. Department of Treasury. Except as otherwise provided in this
Section 2.4, the duration and other terms of each Converted Option shall be
the same as the applicable Maxtor Option, except that all references to
Maxtor shall be deemed to be references to Seagate. Prior to the Effective
Time, Maxtor shall take all action necessary to be taken by Maxtor in order to
effect the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.4(a).



(b) The foregoing provisions of Section 2.4(a) shall not apply to the Maxtor
1998 Employee Stock Purchase Plan or any other plan, program or arrangement
intending to qualify as an employee stock purchase plan under Section 423 of
the Code (the " _Maxtor ESPP_ "). The Maxtor ESPP and all outstanding rights
thereunder shall terminate at the Effective Time and the offering periods
thereunder shall be deemed to end on the NYSE trading day immediately
preceding the Closing Date, and the rights of each participating Maxtor
employee then outstanding shall be deemed to be automatically exercised on
such NYSE trading day. On such trading day, each participating Maxtor employee
will be credited with the number of shares of Maxtor Common Stock purchased
for his or her account(s) under the Maxtor ESPP during such offering period
and such shares shall be treated in the manner described in Section 2.1.





 

3 (c) Except as provided herein or as otherwise agreed to by the parties, Maxtor
shall ensure that following the Effective Time no holder of a Maxtor Option
nor any holder of any other equity-based right shall have any right to acquire
equity securities of Maxtor or the Surviving Company.



(d) At the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit award granted by
Maxtor under the Maxtor 2005 Performance Incentive Plan and the Restricted
Stock Unit Plan (the " _Maxtor RSU Plans_ ") representing a right to receive
upon a future date or dates shares of Maxtor Common Stock (each a "
_Maxtor RSU_ ") which is outstanding and which has not been settled by the
issuance of shares of Maxtor Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall cease to represent a right to receive upon settlement shares of
Maxtor Common Stock and shall be assumed by Seagate and converted
automatically into a right to receive upon settlement shares of Seagate Common
Stock (a " _Converted RSU_ ") in an amount determined as provided below (and
the Converted RSU otherwise shall remain subject to the terms of the
applicable Maxtor RSU Plan, and the agreements, notices or letters evidencing
grants thereunder). The number of shares of Seagate Common Stock to be subject
to the Converted RSU shall be equal to the product of (x) the number of
shares of Maxtor Common Stock subject to the Maxtor RSU and (y) the Exchange
Ratio, _provided_ that any fractional shares of Seagate Common Stock resulting
from such multiplication shall be rounded down to the nearest whole share.
Prior to the Effective Time, Maxtor shall take all action necessary to be
taken by Maxtor in order to effect the foregoing provisions of this Section
2.4(d).



(e) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, and not more
than ten (10) Business Days thereafter, Seagate shall deliver to each holder
of a Converted Option or Converted RSU an appropriate notice evidencing the
foregoing assumption of the option or restricted stock unit award by Seagate.
Seagate shall comply with the terms of the Maxtor Stock Plans and the Maxtor
RSU Plans, as applicable, and the agreements, notices or letters, subject to
the adjustments pursuant to this Section. Each holder of a Converted Option or
Converted RSU shall be credited with such holders service with Maxtor or its
Subsidiaries for purposes of determining such holders vesting under such
Converted Option or Converted RSU, as applicable.



(f) Seagate shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance
a sufficient number of shares of Seagate Common Stock for delivery upon
the exercise of the Converted Options and settlement of Converted RSUs. As
soon as practicable after the Effective Time, and not more than ten (10)
Business Days thereafter, Seagate shall file a registration statement on Form
S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate form) with respect to the shares
of Seagate Common Stock subject to the Converted Options and Converted RSUs
and shall use its best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such
registration statement or registration statements (and maintain the current
status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as the
Converted Options and Converted RSUs remain outstanding. Seagate shall
administer each Converted Option and Converted RSU held by a Maxtor Insider
in a manner that complies with Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act
to the extent the Maxtor Options and Maxtor RSUs were administered in a manner
that complied with such rule prior to the date of this Agreement. 



(g) Employees of Maxtor and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time shall
be permitted to participate in the Seagate employee stock purchase plan
commencing on the first enrollment date of such plan following the Effective

service with Maxtor or Seagate or any of their respective Subsidiaries).

reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and that
this Agreement shall be, and is hereby, adopted as a plan of reorganization
for purposes of Section 368 of the Code.



   3. | EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES FOR MERGER CONSIDERATION 
---|--- 



3.1 _Seagate to Make Merger Consideration Available_. At or as promptly as
practicable after the Effective Time, Seagate shall deposit, or shall cause
to be deposited, with a bank or trust company designated by Seagate  



 

4  and reasonably acceptable to Maxtor (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for the
benefit of the holders of certificates or evidence of shares in book-entry
form which immediately prior to the Effective Time evidenced shares of Maxtor
Common Stock (each a " _Certificate_ "), for exchange in accordance with this
Section 3, certificates or evidence of shares in book-entry form representing
the shares of Seagate Common Stock and any cash that may be payable in lieu of
any fractional shares (such cash and certificates or other evidence for shares
of Seagate Common Stock, together with any dividends or distributions
with respect thereto, being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_
").



3.2 _Exchange of Shares_.



(a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange
Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a Certificate a form of letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for certificates representing the
shares of Seagate Common Stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Seagate Common Stock, if any, into which the shares of Maxtor Common Stock
represented by such Certificate or Certificates shall have been converted
pursuant to this Agreement. Upon proper surrender of a Certificate for
exchange and cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with a properly
completed letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, as applicable, (i)
a certificate or evidence of shares in book-entry form representing that
number of shares of Seagate Common Stock (if any) to which such former holder
of Maxtor Common Stock shall have become entitled pursuant to the provisions
of Section 2 hereof, and (ii) a check representing the amount of cash (if
any) payable in lieu of fractional shares of Seagate Common Stock, which such
former holder has the right to receive in respect of the Certificate
surrendered pursuant to the provisions of this Section 3, and the Certificate
so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or
accrued on the cash payable in lieu of fractional shares.



(b) No dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective
Time with respect to Seagate Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificate until the holder thereof shall surrender such
Certificate in accordance with this Section 3\. After the surrender of a
Certificate in accordance with this Section 3, the record holder thereof
shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or other distributions,
without any interest thereon, which theretofore had become payable with
respect to shares of Seagate Common Stock represented by such Certificate, and
pursuant to any and all record dates set by Seagate and occurring at or after
the Effective Time.



(c) If any certificate representing shares of Seagate Common Stock is to be
issued in the name of any person other than the registered holder of the
Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor, it shall be a condition of the
issuance of such Seagate Common Stock that the Certificate so surrendered
shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate instrument of
transfer) and otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that the person
requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any
transfer or other taxes required by reason of the issuance of a certificate
representing shares of Seagate Common Stock in the name of and payment of cash
to any person other than the registered holder of the Certificate
surrendered, or required for any other reason relating to such holder or
requesting person, or shall establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the
Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not payable. 



(d) At and after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of Maxtor of the shares of Maxtor Common Stock which were
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates representing such shares are presented
for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for
the shares of Seagate Common Stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares
deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.



(e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by
the stockholders of Maxtor for six months after the Effective Time shall be
paid or delivered, at the request of Seagate, to Seagate. Any stockholders of
Maxtor who have not theretofore complied with this Section 3 shall thereafter
look only to Seagate for issuance  



 

5  of the shares of Seagate Common Stock, payment of cash in lieu of any
fractional shares, and payment of unpaid dividends and distributions on the
Seagate Common Stock deliverable in respect of each share of Maxtor Common
Stock held by such stockholder at the Effective Time, as determined pursuant
to this Agreement, in each case, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, none of Seagate, Maxtor, the
Surviving Company, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to
any former holder of shares of Maxtor Common Stock for any amount properly
delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar laws.



(f) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Seagate or the
Exchange Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable and
customary amount as Seagate or the Exchange Agent may determine is reasonably
necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the shares of Seagate Common Stock
and cash in lieu of fractional shares deliverable in respect thereof pursuant
to this Agreement.



(g) Seagate or the Exchange Agent will be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby to any holder of Maxtor Common Stock
such amounts as Seagate (or any affiliate thereof) or the Exchange Agent are
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code, or any applicable provision of U.S. federal, state, local or
non-U.S. tax law. To the extent that such amounts are properly withheld by
Seagate or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts will be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Maxtor
Common Stock in respect of whom such deduction and withholding were made by
Seagate or the Exchange Agent.

Seagate concurrently herewith (the " _Maxtor Disclosure Schedule_ "). The
Maxtor Disclosure Schedule shall be arranged in sections and paragraphs
corresponding to the numbered and lettered sections and paragraphs contained
in this Section 4, and the disclosure in any section or paragraph shall
qualify (a) the corresponding section or paragraph in this Section 4 and (b)

4.1 _Corporate Organization_.



(a) Maxtor is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. Maxtor has the
corporate power and authority to own or lease all of its properties and assets
and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, and is duly
licensed or qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature
of the business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties
and assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification
necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified would not
have a Material Adverse Effect (as defined below) on Maxtor. As used in this
Agreement, the term " _Material Adverse Effect_ " means, with respect to
Maxtor, Seagate, or Seagate and Maxtor (taken together, as a whole), as the
case may be, any fact, event, change, development, circumstance or effect that
has a substantial, material and long term adverse effect on the business,
results of operations, financial condition, assets (including intangible
assets), liabilities, or properties of such party and its Subsidiaries taken
as a whole; _provided_ , _however_ , that in determining whether a Material
Adverse Effect has occurred, there shall be excluded any fact, event,
change, development, circumstance or effect on the referenced party or
parties which resulted from or is attributable to: (A) any change in
applicable laws, rules or regulations or interpretations thereof by courts or
governmental authorities, (B) any change in generally accepted accounting
principles (" _GAAP_ ") or  



 

6  accounting requirements applicable to such party or its Subsidiaries, (C)
any change in general economic conditions in the United States or any
other country in which the referenced party conducts significant operations
or derives significant sales, (D) any change or condition affecting the

or trading volume of such partys common stock (provided that the underlying
causes of such decrease (subject to the other provisions of this Section)

forecasts or published revenue or earnings predictions for any period
(provided that the underlying causes of such failures (subject to the other

pendency or consummation of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, including, any resulting (i) shortfalls or declines in revenue,

supplier and/or vendor relationships, or (iii) loss of personnel, (H) any
disruption, deterioration, or restructuring of, or loss of market share,
revenues, margins or profitability from or in one or more divisions or product
groups to the extent such effects are attributable to normal
operating results, problems or events (provided that such effects shall not
be excluded with respect to Maxtor in the event that they are attributable to
a breach by Maxtor of Section 6.1, and such breach would entitle Seagate to
refuse to effect the Merger pursuant to Section 8.2(b)) or (I) the
performance of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including compliance with the covenants contained herein.



(b) The copies of the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of Maxtor which
have previously been made available to Seagate are true, complete and correct
copies of such documents as in effect as of the date of this Agreement.

good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize the concept of
good standing) as a corporation or partnership, as the case may be, under the
laws of its jurisdiction of organization, (ii) is duly licensed or qualified
to do business and is in good standing in all jurisdictions (whether federal,
state, local or foreign) where its ownership or leasing of property or the
conduct of its business requires it to be so licensed or qualified and in
which the failure to be so qualified would reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Maxtor and
(iii) has all requisite corporate power and authority to own or lease its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as now conducted. For
purposes of this Agreement, " _Subsidiary_ " means, with respect to any
person, any corporation, partnership, joint venture, limited liability company
or any other entity of which such person is a general partner or owns at least
a majority of the stock or other equity interests in such entity the holder
of which is generally entitled to vote for the election of the board of
directors or other governing body of such entity.



(d) The minute books of Maxtor previously made available to Seagate contain
true, complete and correct records of all meetings and other corporate
actions held or taken since December 27, 2003 of their respective stockholders
and Boards of Directors (including committees of their respective Boards of
Directors) other than the portion of any minutes regarding deliberations of
the Board of Directors of such entities in connection with entering into this
Agreement or pursuing strategic alternatives.

receive any shares of Maxtor capital stock (including any rights plan or
agreement). Section 4.2(a) of the Maxtor Disclosure Schedule sets forth a
true, complete and correct list of (i) the aggregate number of shares of
Maxtor Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of each stock option granted

Disclosure Schedule, Maxtor owns, directly or indirectly, all of the issued
and outstanding shares of capital stock of or all other equity interests in
each of Maxtors Subsidiaries, free and clear of any liens, charges,

liability attaching to the ownership thereof. Neither Maxtor nor
any Subsidiary thereof has or is bound by any outstanding subscriptions,
options, warrants, calls, commitments or agreements of any character calling

conducted as of or prior to the Closing Date, including the design,
development, use, import, branding, advertising, promotion, marketing,

circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Seagate has made
available to Maxtor true, correct and complete copies of all written
correspondence between the SEC, on the one hand, and Seagate and any of its
Subsidiaries, on the other hand, occurring since December 31, 2003, and prior

recurring adjustments, none of which are expected to be material in nature or
amount) the results of the consolidated operations and changes in
stockholders equity and consolidated financial position of Seagate and its

adversely affect Seagates ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information and (y) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in
Seagates internal controls over financial reporting. These disclosures were
made in writing by management to Seagates auditors and audit committee. As of

any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, the party that discovers such

shall take all lawful action to solicit the approval of the Seagate Share
Issuance by such stockholders. The Board of Directors of Seagate shall
recommend approval of the issuance of shares of Seagate Common Stock in the
Merger by the stockholders of Seagate and shall (x) not withdraw, modify or

other action or make any other public statement in connection with the Seagate
Stockholders Meeting inconsistent with such recommendation (collectively, a "
_Change in Seagate Recommendation_ "); _provided_ that the foregoing shall
not prohibit accurate disclosure (and such disclosure shall not be deemed to
be a Change in Seagate Recommendation) of factual information regarding the
business, financial condition or results of operations of Seagate or Maxtor

provisions of Section 7.8(b), Maxtor and its Board of Directors shall be
permitted to effect a Change in Maxtor Recommendation if and only to the
extent that Maxtors Board of Directors, after consultation with its outside
counsel, determines in good faith that failure to take such action would
reasonably be expected to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under
applicable law. Notwithstanding any Change in Maxtor Recommendation this
Agreement shall be submitted to the stockholders of Maxtor at the Maxtor
Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of adopting this Agreement and nothing
contained herein shall be deemed to relieve Maxtor of such obligation. In

time prior to the date of this Agreement, or who becomes prior to the
Effective Time, a director or officer of Maxtor or any of its Subsidiaries
(the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") is, or is threatened to be, made a party based
in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining
to (i) the fact that he is or was a director, officer or employee of Maxtor,

expenses (including prompt payment of all reasonable attorneys fees and
expenses in advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding
or investigation to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by
law upon receipt of an undertaking, to the extent required by applicable law,

determined by a final and non-appealable judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction that such Indemnified Party could not lawfully be provided

settlement in connection with any such threatened or actual claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation. Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim
indemnification under this Section 7.6, upon learning of any such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall notify Seagate thereof,
_provided_ that the failure to so notify shall not affect the obligations of
Seagate under this Section 7.6 except (and only) to the extent such failure to
notify materially prejudices Seagate. 



(b) Seagate shall, or shall cause the Surviving Company to, use its best
efforts to cause the persons now or previously serving as officers and
directors of Maxtor prior to the Effective Time to be covered for a period of
six (6) years from the Closing Date by the directors and officers liability
insurance policy or policies maintained by Maxtor to the extent such persons
are covered by such policy or policies as of the Effective Time ( _provided_
that (x) Seagate or the Surviving Company may substitute therefor policies of
at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which
are in the aggregate no less advantageous to such directors and officers of
Maxtor than the terms and conditions of the existing directors and
officers liability insurance policy of Maxtor, or (y) arrange for "tail"
coverage for such six-year period under Maxtors current directors and
officers liability insurance policy), _provided_ , _however_ , that in
no event will Seagate or the Surviving Company be required to expend for any
one year an amount in excess of 200% of the annual premiums currently paid by
Maxtor for such insurance (the " _Insurance Amount_ "), and _provided further_
, that if Seagate or the Surviving Company is unable to maintain or obtain
the insurance called for by this Section 7.6(b) as a result

Company to, use its best efforts to obtain as much comparable insurance as
available for the Insurance Amount) with respect to acts or omissions
occurring prior to the Effective Time which were committed by such officers
and directors in their capacity as such or as employees or agents of Maxtor or
its Subsidiaries.



(c) The provisions of this Section 7.6 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and
representatives, and are intended to be in addition to the rights otherwise
available to the current officers and directors of the Company by law,
charter, statute, by-law or agreement.



7.7 _Advice of Changes_. Seagate and Maxtor shall promptly advise the other
party of any change or event which, individually or in the aggregate with

7.8 _No Solicitation_.



(a) None of Maxtor, Maxtors Subsidiaries or any of their respective officers,
directors, employees, agents, representatives and affiliates (collectively, "
_Representatives_ ") shall, directly or indirectly (i) initiate, solicit, or
knowingly and intentionally encourage or facilitate, any inquiries or
proposals with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) engage in any
negotiations concerning, or provide any nonpublic information to, or have any
discussions with, any person relating to, any Acquisition Proposal, (iii)
waive, terminate, modify or fail to enforce any provision of any contractual
"standstill" or similar obligation of any person other than Seagate or its
affiliates or (iv) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or
recommend, any Acquisition Proposal, or execute or enter into any letter of
intent, agreement in principle, merger agreement, share purchase agreement,
asset purchase or share exchange agreement, option agreement or other similar
agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal or publicly propose or agree to
do any of the foregoing; _provided_ that, in the event Maxtor receives an
unsolicited _bona fide_ Acquisition Proposal and Maxtors board of directors
concludes in good faith that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is
reasonably likely to constitute a Superior Proposal, prior to the closing of
the polls as to the approval of this Agreement at the Maxtor Stockholders
Meeting, Maxtor may, and may permit its Subsidiaries and its and their
Representatives to, take any action described in clause (ii) above to the
extent that the board of directors of Maxtor concludes in good faith (after
consultation with its outside counsel) that failure to take such actions would
reasonably be expected to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under
applicable law; _provided further_ that (x) prior to providing any nonpublic
information permitted to be provided pursuant to the foregoing proviso, Maxtor
shall have entered into a confidentiality agreement with such third party on
terms no less favorable to Maxtor than the Confidentiality Agreement
(including, without limitation, "standstill" provisions no less favorable to
Maxtor than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement), and (y)
Maxtor shall also furnish to Seagate a copy of any confidential data or
information that it is furnishing to any third party pursuant to this Section
7.8(a) to the extent not previously furnished to Seagate. Maxtor will
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any activities, discussions or
negotiations it or its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives
may have conducted before the date of this Agreement with any persons other
than Seagate with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and will (and will
cause its Subsidiaries and their Representatives to) enforce any
confidentiality or similar agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal,
including by requiring the other parties thereto to promptly return or destroy
any confidential information previously furnished by Maxtor or such
Subsidiaries or Representatives thereunder and by using its best efforts to
obtain injunctions or other equitable remedies to prevent or restrain any
breaches of such agreements and to enforce specifically the terms thereof in
a court of competent jurisdiction. Maxtor will promptly (within one Business
Day) advise Seagate following receipt of any Acquisition Proposal, or of any
request for nonpublic information or access to the books and records of
Maxtor in connection with a possible Acquisition Proposal, describing the
substance thereof (including the identity of the person making such
Acquisition Proposal or request for information or access), and will keep
Seagate apprised of the status and the material terms and conditions of the
Acquisition Proposal and any material changes thereto on a current basis  



 

32  (and in any event no later than 48 hours after the occurrence of any such
material changes). Without limiting the foregoing, Maxtor shall promptly, and
in any event within 24 hours, notify Seagate orally and in writing if it
determines to begin providing information or to engage in negotiations
concerning an Acquisition Proposal pursuant to this Section 7.8.



As used in this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " means any  _bona fide_
written Acquisition Proposal which the Board of Directors of Maxtor concludes
in good faith to be more favorable from a financial point of view to its
stockholders than the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby, (1) after receiving the advice of its financial advisor (who shall be
a nationally recognized investment banking firm), (2) after taking into
account the likelihood of consummation of such transaction on the terms set
forth therein (as compared to, and with due regard for, the terms herein) and
(3) after taking into account all legal (with the advice of outside counsel),
financial (including the financing terms of any such proposal), regulatory and
other aspects of such proposal and any other relevant factors permitted under
applicable law; _provided_ that for purposes of the definition of "Superior
Proposal", the references to "more than 25%" in the definition of Acquisition
Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "a majority" and the definition
of Acquisition Proposal shall only refer to a transaction directly involving
Maxtor (and not exclusively its Subsidiaries).



(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if, at
any time after the date of this Agreement and prior to the adoption of this
Agreement by the stockholders of Maxtor, Maxtor receives an Acquisition
Proposal and the Board of Directors shall have concluded in good faith that
such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal after giving effect
to all of the adjustments which may be offered by Seagate pursuant to clause
(iii) below, the Board of Directors of Maxtor may (x) effect a Change in
Maxtor Recommendation and/or (y) terminate this Agreement to enter into a
definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal if the Board of
Directors of Maxtor determines in good faith, after consultation with outside
counsel, that failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to
result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law; _provided_
, _however_ that Maxtor shall not terminate this Agreement pursuant to the
foregoing clause (y), and any purported termination pursuant to the foregoing
clause (y) shall be void and of no force or effect, unless concurrently with
such termination Maxtor pays to Seagate the Termination Fee payable pursuant
to Section 9.2(b); and _provided_ , _further_ , that the Board of Directors
may not effect such a Change in Maxtor Recommendation pursuant to the
foregoing clause (x) or terminate this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing
clause (y) unless:



(i) Maxtor shall have complied in all material respects with this Section
7.8;



(ii) Maxtor shall have provided prior written notice to Seagate, at least
five Business Days in advance (the " _Notice Period_ "), of its intention to
effect a Change in Maxtor Recommendation in response to such Superior Proposal
or terminate this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect
to such Superior Proposal, which notice shall specify the material terms and
conditions of any such Superior Proposal (including the identity of the party
making such Superior Proposal), and shall have contemporaneously provided a
copy of the relevant proposed transaction agreements with the party making
such Superior Proposal and other material documents; and



(iii) prior to effecting such a Change in Maxtor Recommendation or terminating
this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such
Superior Proposal, Maxtor shall, and shall cause its financial and legal
advisors to, during the Notice Period, negotiate with Seagate in good faith
(to the extent Seagate desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the
terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal
ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal.



Maxtor shall be required to deliver a new written notice to Seagate in the
event of any material revisions to the Superior Proposal, in which event
the Notice Period shall commence following the receipt by Seagate of such new
written notice.



(c) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent Maxtor or its board of
directors from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act
with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, _provided_ that such  



 

33  Rules will in no way eliminate or modify the effect that any action pursuant
to such Rules would otherwise have under this Agreement; and
_provided further_ , that any such disclosure (other than a "stop, look and
listen" letter or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule
14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) shall be deemed to be a Change in Maxtor
Recommendation unless the Maxtor Board of Directors (i) expressly reaffirms
its recommendation in favor of the adoption of this Agreement (as then
modified) in such disclosure and (ii) expressly rejects such other Acquisition
Proposal in such disclosure. 



(d) Maxtor agrees that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this
Section 7.8 by any Representative of Maxtor or any of its Subsidiaries, at the
direction or with the consent or prior knowledge or awareness of Maxtor or its
Subsidiaries, shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section 7.8 by Maxtor.



7.9 _Employee No-Hire/Non-Solicit_. Neither Seagate nor Maxtor will, until
the earlier of (i) the Closing Date or (ii) three months after the date this
Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, directly or indirectly,
(A) solicit the employment or consulting services of technical and/or
management-level employees of the other party, in accordance with the terms
set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement, or (B) solicit the employment or
consulting services of, or hire or employ or engage as a consultant, any of
the executive officers, vice presidents, senior directors or executive
directors or other key employees of the other party, so long as they are
employed or engaged by the other party and for three months after they cease
to be employed or engaged by the other party; _provided_ , _however_ , that
(i) soliciting by means of a general advertisement not directed at (A) any
particular individual or (B) the employees or consultants of the other
party generally and (ii) appropriate actions taken in furtherance of
integration planning, shall not be deemed to be a breach of this Section 7.9.
For purposes of this paragraph, "other key employees" shall mean and include
all employees with a base salary in excess of $175,000.



7.10  _Tax Reporting Requirement_. Seagate and Maxtor shall timely satisfy or
cause to be timely satisfied the reporting requirements contained in United
States Treasury Regulation Section 1.367(a)-3(c)(6).



7.11 _Resignation of Maxtor Directors_. At the Closing, Maxtor shall deliver
to Seagate evidence reasonably satisfactory to Seagate of the resignation of
all directors of Maxtor. Upon the request of Seagate, as specified by Seagate
reasonably in advance of the Closing, Maxtor will seek to obtain the
resignation of all directors of Subsidiaries of Maxtor, in each case,

Seagate following the Effective Time an individual who serves on the Board of
Directors of Maxtor as of the date of this Agreement.



7.13 _Exemption From Liability Under Section 16(b)_. Assuming that Maxtor
delivers to Seagate the Section 16 Information (as defined below) reasonably
in advance of the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of Seagate, or a
committee of Non-Employee Directors thereof (as such term is defined for
purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act), shall reasonably promptly
thereafter and in any event prior to the Effective Time adopt a resolution
providing that the receipt by the Maxtor Insiders (as defined below) of
Seagate Common Stock in exchange for shares of Maxtor Common Stock, and of
options to purchase and other rights to receive Seagate Common Stock upon

transactions contemplated hereby and to the extent such securities are listed
in the Section 16 Information provided by Maxtor to Seagate prior to the
Effective Time, are intended to be exempt from liability pursuant to Section
16(b) under the Exchange Act such that any such receipt shall be so exempt. "

respects regarding the Maxtor Insiders, the number of shares of Maxtor Common
Stock held by each such Maxtor Insider and the number and description of the
Maxtor Options and Maxtor RSUs held by each such Maxtor Insider. " _Maxtor

34  Maxtor who after consummation of the Merger will be subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act and who are listed in

7.14 _Takeover Statutes_. If any Takeover Statute is or may become applicable
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each of Maxtor and Seagate
and their respective Board of Directors shall, subject to applicable law,

all such representations and warranties (other than Section 4.2(a)) shall be

this Agreement; _provided_ , that for such purposes the representations and
warranties contained in Section 4.2(a) as of the date of this Agreement shall

invoice from Maxtor for its actual, documented expenses). " _Maxtor Expenses_
" means those fees and expenses actually incurred by Maxtor in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby through the date of
termination of this Agreement, including fees and expenses of
counsel, investment bankers, accountants, experts, consultants and other
Representatives of Maxtor.



(f) Any amount that becomes payable pursuant to Sections 9.2(b), 9.2(c),
9.2(d) or 9.2(e) shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to an account designated by the party entitled to receive such funds.



(g) Maxtor and Seagate agree that the agreements contained in Sections
9.2(b), 9.2(c), 9.2(d) and 9.2(e) are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, that without such agreement Maxtor and Seagate
would not have entered into this Agreement, and that such amounts do
not constitute a penalty. If either party fails to pay the amounts due under
Sections 9.2(b), 9.2(c), 9.2(d) or 9.2(e) within the time periods specified in
such sections, such party shall pay the costs and expenses (including
reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred by the other party in connection
with any action, including the filing of any lawsuit, taken to collect payment
of such amounts, together with interest on the amount of any such unpaid
amounts at the prime lending rate prevailing during such period as published
in _The Wall Street Journal_ , calculated on a daily basis from the date such
amounts were required to be paid until the date of actual payment.



(h) Maxtor and Seagate agree that notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary (i) payment in full of the Termination Fee pursuant to this
Section 9.2 constitutes full performance by Maxtor under this Agreement with
respect to such termination (and shall also be Seagates and Merger Subs sole
and exclusive remedy with respect to any breach by Maxtor of this Agreement
that may have occurred prior to such termination, and that all other damages
or remedies, at law or in equity (including provisional remedies), that might
otherwise have been available to Seagate and Merger Sub are waived by Seagate
and Merger Sub upon their acceptance of such payment) and (ii) payment in full
of the Non-Clearance Fee pursuant to this Section 9.2  



 

39  constitutes full performance by Seagate and Merger Sub under this Agreement
with respect to such termination (and shall also be Maxtors sole
and exclusive remedy with respect to any breach by Seagate or Merger Sub of
this Agreement that may have occurred prior to such termination, and that all
other damages or remedies, at law or in equity (including provisional
remedies), that might otherwise have been available to Maxtor are waived by
Maxtor upon its acceptance of such payment). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Maxtor agrees that, in the event that Maxtor (i) does not reject or refuse to
accept payment of the Non-Clearance Fee within five Business Days of the date
such payment is tendered or (ii) institutes any suit, claim, action or
proceeding against Seagate or Merger Sub seeking any damages or remedies, at
law or in equity, under or by reason of this Agreement (other than for
payment of the Non-Clearance Fee), Maxtor shall be deemed to have irrevocably
waived and forfeited any right to collect the Non-Clearance Fee pursuant to
Section 9.2 and Seagate shall under no circumstances be thereafter obligated
to pay to Maxtor the Non-Clearance Fee pursuant to Section 9.2.



9.3 _Amendment_. Subject to compliance with applicable law, this Agreement may
be amended by the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their
respective Boards of Directors, at any time before or after approval of the
matters presented in connection with the Merger by the stockholders of Maxtor
or of Seagate; provided, however, that after any approval of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement by Maxtors stockholders, there may not be,
without further approval of such stockholders, any amendment of this Agreement
which changes the amount or changes the form of the consideration to be
delivered to the Maxtor stockholders hereunder other than as contemplated by
this Agreement, or which adversely affects the intended tax treatment of the
Merger for holders of Maxtor Common Stock. This Agreement may not be amended
except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties
hereto.



9.4 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties
hereto may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties
hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any
agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall
be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such
party, but such extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance
with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a
waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

hereunder using any other means (including electronic mail), but no such
notice or other communication shall be deemed to have been duly given unless
and until it is acknowledged as actually received by the party for whom it is
intended.



10.4  _Interpretation; Mutual Drafting_. The words "hereof," "herein" and

refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of
this Agreement, and Section references are to this Agreement unless otherwise

this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation." The table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement
are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, no provision of this Agreement shall be construed to require
Maxtor, Seagate or any of their respective officers, directors, Subsidiaries
or affiliates to take any action which would violate or conflict with any
applicable law (whether statutory or common), rule or regulation. Each party
hereto has participated in the drafting of this Agreement, which each party
acknowledges is the result of extensive negotiations among the parties.



 

41 10.5 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, all of
which shall be considered one and the same agreement, and shall become
effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and
delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all parties need not
sign the same counterpart.



10.6 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (together with the documents and the
instruments referred to herein) constitutes the entire agreement and
supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, other than the
Confidentiality Agreement, as amended by Section 7.2(b) hereof, which shall
survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement.



10.7 _Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Trial by Jury_.



(a) This Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, and all disputes
between the parties under or related to this Agreement or the facts and
circumstances leading to its execution, whether in contract, tort or
otherwise, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of
the State of Delaware, applicable to contracts executed in and to
be performed entirely within the State of Delaware.



(b) In any action or proceeding between any of the parties arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or the agreements delivered in connection herewith
or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or by such related
agreements, each of the parties hereto : (a) irrevocably and unconditionally
consents and submits, for itself and its property, to the exclusive
jurisdiction and venue of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or,
case of any claim as to which the federal courts have exclusive subject
matter jurisdiction, the Federal court of the United States of America,
sitting in Delaware); (b) agrees that all claims in respect of such action or
proceeding must be commenced, and may be heard and determined, exclusively in
the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if applicable, such
Federal court); (c) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and
effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the
laying of venue of any such action or proceeding in the Court of Chancery of
the State of Delaware (and, if applicable, such Federal court); and (d)
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient
forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if applicable, such Federal court).
Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or
proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by
suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Each party to
this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner
provided for notices in Section 10.3. Nothing in this Agreement shall affect
the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner
permitted by law.



(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT
ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY
RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE
AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (B) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS
CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (C) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS
VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY,
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION
10.7(c).



10.8 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement which is
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be
ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without
rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or
provisions of this  



 

42  Agreement in any other jurisdiction, and if any provision of this Agreement
is determined to be so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall
be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable, in all cases so long as
neither the economic nor legal substance of the transactions contemplated
hereby is affected in any manner materially adverse to any party or its
stockholders. Upon any such determination, the parties shall negotiate in
good faith in an effort to agree upon a suitable and equitable substitute
provision to effect the original intent of the parties.



10.9 _Publicity_. Seagate and Maxtor shall consult with each other before
issuing any press release with respect to the Merger or this Agreement and
shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement
without the prior consent of the other party, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld; _provided_ , _however_ , that a party may, without the prior
consent of the other party (but after prior consultation, to the extent
practicable in the circumstances) issue such press release or make such public
statement as they may determine, after consulting with outside counsel, are
required by law or the rules and regulations of the NYSE. Without limiting
the reach of the preceding sentence, Seagate and Maxtor shall cooperate to
develop all public announcement materials and make appropriate management
available at presentations related to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as reasonably requested by the other party. In addition, Maxtor and
its Subsidiaries shall (a) consult with Seagate regarding communications with
customers, stockholders, prospective investors and employees related to the
transactions contemplated hereby, (b) provide Seagate with stockholder lists
of Maxtor and (c) allow and facilitate Seagate contact with stockholders of
Maxtor and other prospective investors.



10.10 _Assignment; Third Party Beneficiaries_. Neither this Agreement nor any
of the rights, interests or obligations of any party hereunder shall be
assigned by any of the parties hereto (whether by operation of law or
otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other party. Subject to
the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective successors
and permitted assigns. Except as otherwise specifically provided in Section
7.6 hereof, nothing in this Agreement is intended to confer upon any person
other than the parties hereto any rights, benefits or remedies of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement; _provided_ , that, only after
the Effective Time, former holders of Maxtor Common Stock shall be entitled
to the benefits of Sections 3.1 and 3.2 solely with respect to their right to
receive shares of Seagate Common Stock subject to, and in accordance with, the
terms of this Agreement.
