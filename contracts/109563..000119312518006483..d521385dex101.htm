(which would be expressed as a negative number) (the "Working Capital

Sellers Representative in its sole discretion, either (x) the Estimated
Closing Statement delivered by the Partnership to Parent pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 2.6(a)_ shall be deemed final for all purposes herein or (y)
the Sellers Representative shall retain (at the sole cost and expense of
Parent) a nationally recognized independent accounting firm to provide an
audit of the Surviving Partnerships books, determine the calculation of, and

_Section_ __ _ 2.7(a)_, the determination of such accounting firm being
conclusive, final and binding on the parties hereto; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Sellers Representative reserves any
and all other rights granted to it in this Agreement. Parent shall promptly
reimburse the Sellers Representative upon its request for all fees, costs and
expenses incurred by the Sellers Representative in connection with clause
(y) in the immediately preceding sentence. Upon delivery of the Closing
Statement by Parent, Parent and the Surviving Partnership shall provide the

Subs and the Partnership, as the case may be, and any other document or
information reasonably requested by the Sellers Representative (including the
work papers of Parent and the auditors of the Surviving Partnership) necessary
to allow the Sellers Representative and its Representatives to verify the
accuracy of the Closing Statement.

(b) In the event that the Sellers Representative does not object to the
Closing Balance Sheet or Closing Statement by written notice of objection (the
"Notice of Objection") delivered to Parent within forty-five (45) days after
the Sellers Representatives receipt of the Closing Balance Sheet and the

the amount of the Closing Cash, (iii) the amount of any Partnership
Transaction Expenses, (iv) the Closing Working Capital and the Working

not subject to dispute or objection pursuant to a timely-delivered Notice of
Objection, Parent and the Sellers Representative shall joint instruct the
Escrow Agent to immediately release such portion of the Purchase Price Escrow
Amount to Sellers and/or Parent as contemplated by the Closing Statement.

(c) If the Sellers Representative delivers a Notice of Objection to Parent
within the forty-five (45) day period referred to in _Section_ __ _ 2.7(b)_,
then any element of the Closing Statement that is not in dispute on the date
such Notice of Objection is given shall be treated as final and binding and
any dispute (all such disputed amounts, the "Disputed Amounts") shall be
resolved as follows:

(i) the Sellers Representative and Parent shall promptly endeavor in good
faith to resolve the Disputed Amounts listed in the Notice of Objection. In
the event that a written agreement determining the Disputed Amounts has not
been reached within ten (10) Business Days (or such longer period as may be
agreed by the Sellers Representative and Parent) after the date of receipt by
Parent from the Sellers Representative of the Notice of Objection, the
resolution of such Disputed Amounts shall be submitted to KPMG US LLP (the
"Arbitrator"). If one or more Disputed Amounts are submitted to the Arbitrator
for resolution, the Sellers Representative and Parent shall enter into a
customary engagement letter with, and to the extent necessary each party to
this Agreement will waive and cause its controlling Affiliates to waive any
conflicts with, the Arbitrator at the time such dispute is submitted to the
Arbitrator and shall cooperate with the Arbitrator in connection with its
determination pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.7_. Within ten (10) days
after the Arbitrator has been retained, each of Parent, on the one hand, and
the Sellers Representative, on the other hand, shall furnish, at its own
expense to the Arbitrator and substantially simultaneously to the other a
written statement of its position with respect to each Disputed Amount. Within
five (5) Business Days after the expiration of such ten (10) day period, each
of Parent and the Sellers Representative may deliver to the Arbitrator its
response to the others position on each Disputed Amount; _provided_ , that
they deliver a copy thereof substantially simultaneously to the other. With
each submission, each of Parent and the Sellers Representative may also
furnish to the Arbitrator such other information and documents as they deem
relevant or such information and documents as may be requested by the
Arbitrator; _provided_ that they deliver a copy thereof substantially
simultaneously to the other. The Arbitrator may, at its discretion, conduct
one or more conferences (whether in person or by teleconference) concerning
the Disputed Amounts and each of Parent and the Sellers Representative shall
have the right to present additional documents, materials and other
information and to have present its Representatives at such conferences;

 

(ii) the Sellers Representative and Parent shall instruct the Arbitrator to
promptly (and in any event within thirty (30) days of the submission of the
Disputed Amounts to the Arbitrator) render a decision in accordance with this
_Section_ __ _ 2.7(c)_ along with a written statement delivered to each of
Parent and the Sellers Representative, which shall include the Arbitrators
(A) determination as to the calculation of each of the

 



25  Disputed Amounts and (B) the corresponding corrective calculations set forth
in the Closing Statement that are derived from its determination as to the
calculations of the Disputed Amounts. The decision of the Arbitrator shall be
final and binding upon each party hereto and the decision of the Arbitrator
shall constitute an arbitral award that, absent manifest error (which shall
include the Arbitrators failure to adhere to the policies set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 2.7(c)_), will be final, binding and non-appealable and upon
which a judgment may be entered by a court having jurisdiction thereover;

 

(iii) the Final Purchase Price shall be recalculated based upon the final
determination (or deemed determination) of the Arbitrator with respect to the
Disputed Amounts and the Final Purchase Price, as so recalculated, shall be
deemed to be final and binding;

 

(iv) in the event the Sellers Representative and Parent submit any Disputed
Amounts to the Arbitrator for resolution, the Sellers, on a several basis
(and not jointly and severally) in accordance with their Pro Rata Portions, on
the one hand and Parent, on the other hand, shall each pay their own costs and
expenses incurred under this  _Section_ __ _ 2.7(c)_ (it being understood
that the costs and expenses of the Sellers shall be paid from the Expense
Holdback Amount). The Sellers Representative shall pay from the Expense
Holdback Amount that fraction of the fees and costs of the Arbitrator equal
to (1) the absolute value of the difference between the Sellers
Representatives calculation of the Final Purchase Price derived from its
aggregate position regarding the Disputed Amounts and the Final Purchase
Price derived from the Arbitrators final determination with respect to the
Disputed Amounts over (2) the absolute value of the difference between the
Sellers Representatives calculation of the Final Purchase Price derived
from its aggregate position regarding the Disputed Amounts and Parents
calculation of the Final Purchase Price derived from its aggregate position
regarding the Disputed Amounts, and Parent shall be responsible for
the remainder of such fees and costs; and

(v) the Arbitrator shall act as an arbitrator to determine, based upon
the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 2.7(c)_, only the Disputed Amounts and
the determination of each amount of the Disputed Amounts shall be made in
accordance with the procedures set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 2.7(a)_. The
Arbitrator shall only decide the specific items under dispute by the parties
and if (A) the Arbitrators determination of any Disputed Amount is less than
the lesser of the amounts claimed by either the Sellers Representative or
Parent, then such disputed amount shall be deemed to be the lesser of the
amounts claimed by either the Sellers Representative or Parent or (B) the
Arbitrators determination of any Disputed Amount is more than the greater of
the amounts claimed by either the Sellers Representative or Parent, then such
disputed amount shall be deemed to be the greater of the amounts claimed by
either the Sellers Representative or Parent. 

(d) Upon the determination, in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.7(b)_ or
_Section_ __ _ 2.7(c)_, of the Final Purchase Price, Sellers, on the one
hand, or Parent, on the other hand, as the case may be, shall make, or cause
to be made, the payment(s) required by this _Section_ __ _ 2.7(d)_. __

 



26  The amount payable by Sellers, on the one hand, or Parent, on the other
hand, pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.7(d)_ is referred to herein as the
"Purchase Price Adjustment."

(i) If the Final Purchase Price is greater than the Initial Purchase Price (a
"Parent Adjustment Payment"), then (A) Parent shall cause the Partnership to,
within three (3) Business Days after the determination of the Final Purchase
Price pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.7(d)_, pay by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to the Sellers Representative or its designee
(on behalf of the Sellers) the Parent Adjustment Payment and (B) Parent and
the Sellers Representative shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to
immediately release the Purchase Price Escrow Amount to the Sellers
Representative or its designee (on behalf of the Sellers). Promptly upon
receipt of the Parent Adjustment Payment and the Purchase Price Escrow Amount,
the Sellers Representative or its designee, as applicable, shall pay to each
Seller its Pro Rata Portion of the Parent Adjustment Payment and the Purchase
Price Escrow Amount, and Parent shall not have any responsibility for, or
obligation with respect to, such payment. After those joint payments to
Sellers Representative described in this _Section_ __ _ 2.7(d)(i)_ are made
in accordance herewith, Parent shall not have any liability or obligation to
Sellers with respect to such amounts.

 

(ii) If the Final Purchase Price is less than the Initial Purchase Price, then
within three (3) Business Days after the determination of the Final Purchase
Price, Parent and the Sellers Representative shall jointly instruct the
Escrow Agent to immediately release (A) to Parent from the Purchase Price
Escrow Amount an amount equal to the amount by which the Initial Purchase
Price exceeds the Final Purchase Price (the "Seller Adjustment Payment") and
(B) to Sellers Representative or its designee (on behalf of the Sellers) the
remaining balance of the Purchase Price Escrow Amount, if any (after giving
effect to the distribution in clause (A)). Promptly upon receipt of any amount
described in clause (B), the Sellers Representative or its designee, as
applicable, shall pay to each Seller its Pro Rata Portion of such amount, and
Parent shall not have any responsibility for, or obligation with respect to,
such payments. After that payment to Sellers Representative described in this
_Section_ __ _ 2.7(d)(ii)_ is made in accordance herewith, Parent shall not
have any liability or obligation to Sellers with respect to such amount. In
the event that the Purchase Price Escrow Amount is less than the Seller
Adjustment Payment, none of Parent, the Surviving GP, the
Surviving Partnership nor any other Person shall have any recourse against
any Seller or any other Person with respect to any such deficiency.

 

Section 2.8 _No Further Rights of Transfers_. __

38 Section 4.10 _Employee Benefit Plans._

 

 _(a)_ _Section 4.10(a)_ of the Partnership Disclosure Letter sets forth a
complete list of each material Employee Benefit Plan. As used herein,
"Employee Benefit Plan" (or "Plan") means (i) each "employee benefit plan," as
defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, (ii) each employee pension benefit plan as
defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA (a "Pension Plan"); (iii) each employee
welfare benefit plan, as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA (a "Welfare Plan");
and (iv) each compensation and employment arrangement or agreement,
including, but not limited to, any fringe benefit, incentive compensation,
phantom stock, bonus, severance, vacation, deferred compensation, supplemental
executive compensation plan, employment agreement, salary continuation,
incentive, stock option, retirement, pension, or profit sharing plans,
Contracts, programs, funds or arrangements of any kind (each, a "Benefit
Arrangement) that is maintained by the Partnership or any Partnership
Subsidiary. Since October 15, 2012, each Employee Benefit Plan has been
maintained, operated and administered in material compliance with its terms
and any related documents or agreements and in material compliance with all
applicable Laws and Orders.

 

 _(b)_ The form of each Pension Plan and each Welfare Plan is in compliance in
all material respects with the applicable terms of ERISA, the Code, and all
other Applicable Laws and written applicable Plan documents. Each Pension Plan
that is intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a
favorable determination letter, or in case of a master prototype plan, a
favorable opinion letter, from the Internal Revenue Service as to its
qualified status, and, to the Knowledge of the Partnership, nothing has
occurred since the date of such determinations that is likely to cause the
loss of such qualification. All contributions (including all employer
contributions and employee contributions) that have been required to have been
paid with respect to each Plan have been paid within the time required by such
Plan or applicable Laws, other than as would not reasonably be expected to
result in a material liability to the Partnership, any Partnership Affiliate
or any ERISA Affiliate. Except as required by the Code or this Agreement, the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not
accelerate the time of vesting or the time of payment, or increase the amount,
of compensation due to any director, employee, officer, former employee or
former officer of the Partnership, any Partnership Subsidiary or an ERISA
Affiliate. No written or, to the Knowledge of the Partnership, oral
representations have been made to any employee or former employee of the
Partnership, any Partnership Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate at any time
promising or guaranteeing any employer payment or funding for the
continuation of medical, dental, life or disability coverage for any period of
time beyond the end of the current plan year (except to the extent of coverage
required under COBRA). Neither the Partnership, nor any
Partnership Subsidiary nor any ERISA Affiliate has at any time within six
years sponsored, maintained or contributed to a Pension Plan subject to Title
IV of ERISA, a multiemployer plan as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA (a
"Multiemployer Plan"), a multiple employer plan within the meaning of Section
210 of ERISA or Section 413(c) of the Code (a "Multiple Employer Plan"), or a
voluntary employees beneficiary association, as defined in Section 501(c)(9)
of the Code. Except for ordinary benefit payment obligations under the Plans
set forth on _Section_ __ _ 4.10(b)_ of the Partnership Disclosure Letter, no
act or omission has occurred with respect to any Pension Plan, Welfare Plan,
Benefit Arrangement, Multiemployer Plan, or Multiple Employer Plan that will
result in any material liability to the Partnership, any Partnership
Subsidiary or Parent or will have an adverse impact upon the Partnership
or any Partnership Subsidiary or subject the Partnership, any Partnership
Subsidiary or Parents assets to any lien under ERISA, the Code, or

 



39 applicable Laws. Each Plan that is a nonqualified deferred compensation plan,
as defined in Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code, has been operated in
compliance, in all material respects, with the provisions of Section 409A. As
used herein, the term " _ERISA Affiliate_ " shall mean the Partnership, any
Partnership Subsidiary and any trade or business (whether or not
incorporated) that is part of the same controlled group, or under common
control with, or part of an affiliated service group that includes the
Partnership or any Partnership Subsidiary within the meaning of Sections
414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code.

Disclosure Letter,

no reportable event within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA or "prohibited
transaction" within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA has occurred with
respect to any Plan and no tax has been imposed pursuant to Section 4975 or
Section 4976 of the Code in respect thereof, (iii) neither the Sellers nor any
Partnership Subsidiary has incurred any Liability to the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation with respect to any Plan which is a pension plan subject
to Title IV of ERISA other than liability for premiums (which have been paid
when due); and (iv) all material amounts required to be paid pursuant to each
by the Plans on or before the Closing Date have been paid by the Closing Date.

(e) Each Welfare Plan that provides medical benefits to employees of the
Partnership or the Partnership Subsidiaries has been operated in compliance in
all material respects with the requirements of Sections 601 through 608 of

material liability to the Partnership or any Partnership Subsidiary or any
ERISA Affiliate or to such Plan or a fiduciary of such Plan.

 



40 (i) Neither the Partnership nor any of the Partnership Subsidiaries, nor, to
the Knowledge of the Partnership, any other "disqualified person" or "party
in interest" (as defined in Section 4975(e)(2) of the Code and Section 3(14)
of ERISA, respectively) has engaged in any transactions in connection with any
Employee Benefit Plan that would reasonably be expected to result in the
imposition of a penalty pursuant to Section 502 of ERISA or a Tax pursuant to
Section 4975 of the Code that in each case would reasonably be expected to
result in a material liability to the Partnership or any Partnership
Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate or to such Plan or a fiduciary of such Plan.

is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction, including its jurisdiction of organization, in which the nature
of its business or the ownership or leasing of its properties makes such

equivalent charter or organizational documents, in each case, as amended and
in full force and effect as of the date hereof. Neither Parent nor either

subject to any consents, approvals, authorizations, declarations, filings and
notices required under any Antitrust Laws or set forth in _Section_ __ _
5.4_, contravene any Law or any Order applicable to Parent or either Merger
Sub or by which any of their respective properties or assets are bound,
except, in the case of clause (ii) above, for such conflicts, breaches,
defaults or accelerations which, or such consents, approvals, authorizations,
declarations, filings or notices the failure of which to obtain, would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

 



50 Section 5.3 _Ownership; Operations_. Each of the Merger Subs is a Subsidiary
of Parent and Parent owns beneficially and of record all of the outstanding
membership interests of each of the Merger Subs, free and clear of any Liens
of any kind. Parent and Merger Subs were formed solely for the purpose of
engaging in the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and have not
engaged in any business activities or conducted any operations, and have not
incurred Liabilities or obligations of any nature, other than in connection
with such transactions.

 

Section 5.4 _Consents and Approvals_. Assuming all filings required under the
Antitrust Laws are made and any waiting periods thereunder have been
terminated or expired, no consent of or filing with any Governmental Entity or
any other Person, must be obtained or made in connection with the execution

Parent and/or Merger Subs, threatened, against or affecting Parent or either
Merger Sub, or any of their respective properties or rights, which would

Material Adverse Effect, each of Parent and each of the Merger Subs is in

51 Section 5.10 _Investment Intent_. __

 

(a) Parent is acquiring the Units and the membership interests of GP for its
own account, for investment purposes only and not with a view toward, or for
sale in connection with, any distribution thereof, nor with any present
intention of distributions or selling the Units or the membership interests of
GP, in violation of the federal securities Laws or any applicable foreign or
state securities Law.

Rule 501(a) promulgated pursuant to the Securities Act.

(c) Parent understands that the acquisition of the Units and the membership
interests of GP to be acquired by it pursuant to the terms of this Agreement
involves substantial risk. Parent and its officers have experience as an
investor in securities and equity interests of companies such as the ones
being transferred pursuant to this Agreement, and Parent can bear the
economic risk of its investment (which may be for an indefinite period) and
has such knowledge and experience in financial or business matters that Parent
is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of its investment in the Units
and the membership interests of GP to be acquired by it pursuant to the
transactions contemplated hereby.

(d) Parent understands that the Units and the membership interests of GP to
be acquired by it pursuant to this Agreement have not been registered under
the Securities Act. Parent acknowledges that such securities may not be
transferred, sold, offered for sale, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise
disposed of without registration under the Securities Act and any other
provision of applicable state securities Laws or pursuant to an applicable
exemption therefrom. Parent acknowledges that there is no public market for
the Units or the membership interests of GP and that there can be no
assurance that a public market shall develop.

Section 5.11 _Acknowledgment by Parent and Merger Subs; GP s and the
Partnerships Liability._ Parent and Merger Subs have conducted their own
independent investigation, verification, review and analysis of the business,
operations, assets, Liabilities, results of operations, financial condition,
technology and prospects of GP, the Partnership and the Partnership
Subsidiaries, which investigation, verification, review and analysis was
conducted by Parent, Merger Subs and their respective Affiliates and, to the
extent Parent and Merger Subs deemed appropriate, by Parents and Merger Subs
respective Representatives. Each of Parent and each of the Merger Subs
acknowledges that it and its Representatives have been provided adequate
access to the personnel, properties, premises and records of GP, the
Partnership and the Partnership Subsidiaries for such purpose. In entering
into this Agreement, each of Parent and each of the Merger Subs acknowledges
that it has relied solely upon the aforementioned investigation,
verification, review and analysis and not on any factual representations or
opinions of GP, the Partnership or any of the Partnerships Representatives
(except the specific representations and warranties of GP set forth in
_Article III_ and of GP and the Partnership set forth in _Article IV_ ), and
each of Parent and each of the Merger Subs acknowledges and agrees, to the
fullest extent permitted by Law, that:

 



52 (a) except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, none of GP, the
Partnership, the Partnership Subsidiaries or any of their respective
directors, officers, partners, equityholders, members, employees, Affiliates,
controlling Persons, agents, advisors or Representatives makes or has made any
oral or written representation or warranty, either express or implied, as to
the accuracy or completeness of (i) any of the information set forth in
management presentations relating to GP, the Partnership or the Partnership
Subsidiaries made available to Parent, its Affiliates or its Representatives,
in materials made available in any "data room" (virtual or otherwise),
including any cost estimates delivered or made available, financial
projections or other projections, in presentations by the management of GP,
the Partnership or the Partnership Subsidiaries, in "break-out" discussions,
in responses to questions submitted by or on behalf of Parent, Merger Subs,
their respective Affiliates or Representatives, whether orally or in writing,
in materials prepared by or on behalf of GP or the Partnership, or in any
other form (such information, collectively, "Due Diligence Materials"), or
(ii) any information delivered or made available pursuant to _Section_ __ _
6.1(a)_, or (iii) the pro-forma financial information, projections or other
forward-looking statements of GP, the Partnership or the Partnership
Subsidiaries, in each case in expectation or furtherance of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; and

(b) none of GP, the Partnership, the Partnership Subsidiaries or any of their
respective directors, officers, employees, partners, equityholders, members,
Affiliates, controlling Persons, agents, advisors, Representatives or any
other Person shall have any Liability or responsibility whatsoever to Parent,
Merger Subs or their respective directors, officers, employees, Affiliates,
controlling Persons, agents or Representatives on any basis (including in
contract or tort, under federal or state securities Laws or otherwise)
based upon any information provided or made available, or statements made
(including set forth in management summaries relating to GP or the Partnership
provided to Parent, in materials made available in the Partnerships data site
(virtual or otherwise), in presentations by GPs or the Partnerships
management or otherwise), to Parent, Merger Subs or their respective
directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, controlling Persons, advisors,
agents or Representatives (or any omissions therefrom).

Section 5.12 _No Prior Activities and Agreements_. Except for obligations
incurred in connection with its incorporation or organization or the
negotiation and consummation of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, neither Merger Sub has incurred any obligation or
liability or engaged in any business or activity of any type or
kind whatsoever or entered into any agreement or arrangement with any Person.
There are no Contracts between Parent, either Merger Sub or any of their
respective Affiliates, on the one hand, and any member of the management,
directors or equityholders of GP, the Partnership or any Partnership
Subsidiaries, on the other hand, as of the date hereof, that relate in any way
to the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

Section 5.13 _Exclusivity of Representations_. The representations and
warranties made by Parent and Merger Subs in this _Article V_ are the
exclusive representations and warranties made by Parent and Merger Subs. Each
of Parent and each of the Merger Subs hereby disclaims any other express or
implied representations or warranties with respect to itself.

Parent shall be required to obtain as much coverage as is possible under
substantially similar policies for such annual premiums as do not exceed the

62 (c) From and after the Closing Date, Parent shall cause the Surviving GP and

to, and the Surviving GP and the Surviving Partnership shall, from and after

not the obligation) to control the defense of, including the investigation of,
any Indemnified Person Claim through counsel reasonably acceptable to the
Indemnified Person except (x) for claims brought by or on behalf of the

hereby agree that (i) from and after the Closing, the Surviving GP and
the Surviving Partnership shall be the indemnitors of first resort (i.e.,

such other Persons to advance expenses or to provide indemnification for the
same expenses or liabilities incurred by any such Indemnified Person are
secondary) and (ii) from and after the Closing, the Surviving GP and the
Surviving Partnership shall be required to advance the full amount of all

or payment by any of such other Persons on behalf of any such Indemnified
Person with respect to any claim for which such Indemnified Person has sought
indemnification from the Surviving GP or the Surviving Partnership shall
affect the foregoing and such other Persons shall have a right of contribution

in good faith with the other parties prior to making any such disclosure
required by Law or regulations of any applicable stock exchange); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 6.8_ shall prohibit a party

Knowledge of Parent and/or Merger Subs, as the case may be, threatened,
against GP, the Partnership, the Partnership Subsidiaries, Parent or Merger
Subs, as the case may be or (ii) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any fact
or event which would be reasonably expected to cause any condition set forth

representations, warranties or covenants, or the conditions to the obligations
of, any party to this Agreement.

of their Affiliates, (a) any claim they have or may have that WandC has a
conflict of interest in connection with or is otherwise prohibited from

individual" (within the meaning of Code Section 280G and the Treasury
Regulations thereunder), and who the Partnership believes might otherwise
receive, have received, or have the right or entitlement to receive, any
parachute payment under Code Section 280G, and the Partnership shall have
delivered each such Parachute Payment Waiver to Parent on or before the
Closing Date.

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Partnership shall initiate the procedure to
obtain, and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, the
equityholder approval as is required by Code Section 280G(b)(5)(B) so as to
render the parachute payment provisions of Code Section 280G inapplicable to
any and all payments and/or benefits provided pursuant to contracts
or arrangements that, in the absence of the executed Parachute Payment
Waivers by the affected Persons under _Section_ __ _ 6.17(a)_ above, might
otherwise result, separately or in the aggregate, in the payment of any amount
and/or the provision of any benefit that would not be deductible by reason of
Code Section 280G, with such equityholder approval to be obtained in a manner
which satisfies all applicable requirements of such Code Section 280G(b)(5)(B)
and the Treasury Regulations thereunder.

Section 6.18 _Basin Physical Inventory_. Prior to the Closing, the Partnership
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to complete a physical
inventory of Basin.

Section 6.19 _Certificates of Authority_. Prior to the Closing, the
Partnership shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
certificates of authority to do business with respect to those Partnership
Subsidiaries and those states set forth in Section 4.8 of the Partnership
Disclosure Letter.

ARTICLE VIII

 

 _TAX MATTERS_

 

Section 8.1 _Returns and Payment of Taxes._

 

(a) All Returns for Taxes and Tax items relating to the operations or assets
of GP, the Partnership or Partnership Subsidiaries that are not imposed on
GP, the Partnership or Partnership Subsidiaries for taxable periods or
portions thereof ending on or prior to the Closing Date ("Flow-Through
Returns") shall be prepared and filed in the sole discretion of the Sellers
Representative. Parent shall cause the Surviving GP, the Surviving Partnership
and any of the Partnership Subsidiaries, to the extent commercially
reasonable, to provide, at Sellers Representative expense, any assistance
and information reasonably requested by the Sellers Representative to enable
the Sellers Representative (or any other persons preparing Flow-Through
Returns) to prepare Flow-Through Returns. The Flow-Through Returns shall be
filed in accordance with the prior positions and practices of GP, the
Partnership and the Partnership Subsidiaries, unless otherwise required by
Law. The Sellers Representative shall provide drafts of each Flow-Through
Return to Parent at least 30 days prior to the due date of such Flow-Through
Return for Parents review and comment. Within twenty (20) days after the date
of receipt by the Parent of such Flow-Through Return, Parent may deliver to
Sellers Representative a written request for changes to such Flow-Through
Return. Sellers Representative shall consider such comments in good faith.

 



70 (b) Parent and Sellers Representative shall cooperate fully, to the extent
commercially reasonable, in connection with (i) filing of Returns, (ii) any
audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes and Returns and
(iii) the preparation of any financial statements to the extent related to
Taxes. Notwithstanding the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 8.1_, the
Sellers Representative shall have the right to control any audit, litigation
or other proceeding with respect to Flow-Through Returns (such tax matter,
a "Seller Tax Matter"). Parent shall provide the Sellers Representative with
notice of any written inquiries, audits, examinations or proposed adjustments
by the Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing authority, which relate
to any Seller Tax Matter promptly upon the receipt of such notice.

(c) To the extent it is necessary for purposes of this Agreement to determine
the allocation of Taxes among a Straddle Period, the amount of any Taxes based
on or measured by income, receipts, payroll or sales of GP, the Partnership,
the Surviving GP, the Surviving Partnership or the Partnership Subsidiaries
for the Pre-Closing Tax Period will be determined based on an interim closing
of the books as of the close of business on the Closing Date (and for such
purpose, the taxable period of any partnership or other pass through entity
in which the Partnership or any Partnership Subsidiary holds a beneficial
interest will be deemed to terminate at such time) and the amount of other
Taxes of GP, the Partnership, the Surviving GP, the Surviving Partnership, or
the Partnership Subsidiaries for a Straddle Period that relates to the Pre-
Closing Tax Period will be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire
taxable period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number
of days in the taxable period ending on and including the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of days in such Straddle Period.

 

Section 8.2 _Controversies_.

 

(a) Parent shall promptly notify the Sellers Representative upon receipt by
Parent or any Affiliate of Parent (including Merger Subs and, after the
Closing, the Surviving GP, the Surviving Partnership or the Partnership
Subsidiaries) of written notice of any Tax Matter with respect to Taxes for
which GP Parent, any Seller or the Sellers Representative may be liable.
The Sellers Representative, at its sole expense, shall have the authority to
represent the interests of the Surviving GP, the Surviving Partnership and the
Partnership Subsidiaries with respect to any Tax Matter with respect to Taxes
for which GP Parent, any Seller or the Sellers Representative may be liable
before any taxing authority or any other Governmental Entity and shall have
the right to control the defense, compromise or other resolution of such Tax
Matter, including responding to inquiries, filing Returns and contesting,
defending against and resolving any assessment for additional Taxes or notice
of Tax deficiency or other adjustment of Taxes of, or relating to, such Tax
Matter; _provided_ , that neither the Sellers Representative nor any of its
Affiliates shall enter into any settlement of or otherwise compromise any such
Tax Matter that adversely affects or may adversely affect the Tax liability of
Parent, the Surviving GP, the Surviving Partnership or the Partnership
Subsidiaries or any Affiliate of the foregoing for any Post-Closing Period,
without the prior written consent of Parent, which consent shall not be

 



71 unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. The Sellers Representative
shall keep Parent reasonably informed with respect to the commencement,
status and nature of any Tax Matter with respect to Taxes for which GP Parent,
any Seller or the Sellers Representative may be liable. The Sellers
Representative shall, in good faith, allow Parent to make comments to the
Sellers Representative, regarding the conduct of or positions taken in any
such proceeding.

(b) Except as otherwise provided in _Section_ __ _ 8.2(a)_, or if the
Sellers Representative does not elect to control a proceeding pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 8.2(a)_, Parent shall have the sole right to control any
audit or examination by any Tax authority, and contest, resolve and defend
against any assessment for additional Taxes, notice of Tax deficiency or other
adjustment of Taxes of or relating to, the income, assets or operations of GP,
the Partnership and the Partnership Subsidiaries for all taxable periods;
_provided_ , _however_ , that neither Parent nor Merger Subs shall, and shall
cause the Surviving GP, the Surviving Partnership and the Partnership
Subsidiaries not to, enter into any settlement of any contest or otherwise
compromise any issue with respect to the portion of the Overlap Period ending
on or prior to the Closing Date that could materially increase the Tax
liability of GP Parent, any Seller or the Sellers Representative without the
prior written consent of the Sellers Representative, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 

Section 8.3 _Notification_. Parent, the Surviving GP, the Surviving
Partnership, the Partnership Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates
shall promptly forward to the Sellers Representative all written
notifications and other communications from any Tax authority received by the
Surviving GP, the Surviving Partnership and the Partnership Subsidiaries
relating to any Tax Matter relating to any federal, state, local or foreign
income Tax liability of GP, the Partnership or the Partnership Subsidiaries
with respect to a Pre-Closing Period.

 

Section 8.4 _Post-Closing Access and Cooperation_.

 

(a) After the Closing Date, Parent, the Surviving GP, the Surviving
Partnership and the Partnership Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and
the Sellers Representative, on the other hand, shall furnish or cause to be
delivered to each other, upon request, as promptly as practicable, such
information and assistance (including access to books, records, work papers
and Returns for Pre-Closing Periods) relating to the Surviving GP, the
Surviving Partnership and the Partnership Subsidiaries as is reasonably
necessary for the preparation of any Return, claim for refund or audit, and
the prosecution or defense of any claim, suit or proceeding relating to any
proposed Tax adjustment. Upon reasonable notice and during regular business
hours, the Sellers Representative and Parent shall make their, or shall cause
the Surviving GP, the Surviving Partnership or the Partnership Subsidiaries,
as applicable, to make their, employees and facilities available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide reasonable explanation of any documents or
information provided hereunder; provided, that such assistance shall not
unreasonably disrupt the operations of the Sellers Representative, Parent,
the Surviving GP, the Surviving Partnership or such Partnership Subsidiary, as
applicable, and any recipient of such assistance shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to minimize any such disruption.

(b) Any request for information or documents pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
8.4 _shall be made by the requesting party in writing. The other parties
hereto shall promptly (and in no event later than thirty (30) days after
receipt of the request) provide the requested information. 

 



72 The requesting party shall reimburse the other parties for any out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by such parties in this _Section_ __ _ 8.4_. Any
information obtained under this _Section_ __ _ 8.4_ shall be kept
confidential, except as otherwise reasonably may be necessary in connection
with the filing of Returns or claims for refund or in conducting any Tax
audit, dispute or contest.

 

Section 8.5 _Elections_. From and after the Closing Date, Parent shall not,
and shall cause the Surviving GP, the Surviving Partnership and the
Partnership Subsidiaries not to, without the prior consent of the Sellers
Representative (which may, in its sole and absolute discretion, withhold such
consent), make, cause or permit to be made any Tax election or adopt
or change any method of accounting, in each case that may affect Taxes for
any Pre-Closing Period of the Surviving GP, the Surviving Partnership or the
Partnership Subsidiaries or otherwise affect the liability of GP Parent, any
Seller and/or the Sellers Representative.

Section 8.6 _Allocation of Transaction Expenses_. Parent, the Sellers
Representative, the Surviving GP, the Surviving Partnership and the
Partnership Subsidiaries shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
any Partnership Transaction Expenses arising in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to accrue before the Closing
Date, to the extent allowable under the Code and applicable Law.

 

Section 8.7 _Tax Indemnity_. __

 

(a) After the Closing, Parent shall be permitted to recover from the Surviving
Partnership, from time to time, Taxes as provided in paragraph (b) hereof to
the extent such Taxes have not been included in the Closing Working Capital.

(b) The obligations of the Surviving Partnership to reimburse Parent for
Taxes shall extend to (i) all Taxes with respect to Pre-Closing Tax Periods,
(ii) all Straddle Periods to the extent that such Taxes are allocable to the
period prior to Closing pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(c), _in each case
with respect to the Partnership or Partnership Subsidiaries (together
"Indemnified Taxes"). Such obligations shall be without regard to
whether there was any breach of any representation or warranty under _Article
III_ or _Article IV_ with respect to such Indemnified Tax or any disclosures
that may have been made with respect to _Article III_ or _Article IV_.
The indemnification obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 8.7_ shall apply
even if the Indemnified Tax liability results from the filing of a Tax Return
or amended Tax Return with respect to a pre-closing transaction or period (or
portion of a period) by or at the direction of Parent, provided that Parent
shall not cause or permit the Surviving GP, the Surviving Partnership or any
Partnership Subsidiary to file an amended Tax Return with respect to any Pre-
Closing Tax Period or any Straddle Period unless (y) the Sellers
Representative consents in its sole discretion or (z) with respect to any
Partnership Subsidiary, Parent obtains a legal opinion from counsel reasonably
acceptable to the Sellers Representative that such amended return is legally
required to be filed (provided, further, that such legal opinion may
not assume any facts that are disputed in good faith by the Sellers
Representative), and the Sellers Representative consents to such amended
return (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).
The indemnification provided for in this _Section_ __ _ 8.7_ shall be funded
solely from the RandW Insurance Policy. For the avoidance of doubt,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary, none of the Sellers or the Sellers
Representative shall have any liability or obligation to any Person under
this Section 8.7.

upon any Nonparty Affiliates with respect to the performance of
this Agreement or any representation or warranty made in, in connection with,

(c) Without limiting anything set forth in _Section_ __ _ 10.5(b)_,
effective as of the Closing Date, each of Parent, the Surviving GP and the
Surviving Partnership (each, a "Releasor"), on behalf of itself and its
officers, directors, equityholders, Subsidiaries and Affiliates, and each of
their respective successors and assigns, hereby releases, acquits and forever
discharges, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, GP Parent, each of the

present or future officers, managers, directors, equityholders, partners,
members, Affiliates, employees, counsel and agents (each, a "Releasee")

managers, directors, equityholders, partners, members, Affiliates, employees,
counsel and agents of GP Parent, the Sellers and the Sellers Representative)

Partnership or their respective successors or assigns ever had, now has or
may have on or by reason of any matter, cause or thing whatsoever to the
Closing Date. Each Releasor agrees not to, and agrees to cause its officers,
directors, equityholders, Subsidiaries and Affiliates, and each of their
respective successors and assigns, not to, assert any claim against the
Releasees that are released hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each
Releasor and its officers, directors, equityholders, Subsidiaries and
Affiliates, and each of their respective successors and assigns retain, and
do not release, their rights and interests under the terms and conditions of
this Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything contained in this _Section_ __ _ 10.5_ or
otherwise provided for in this Agreement, the insurer under the RandW Insurance
Policy shall have no right of subrogation against any of the Sellers except
the right to proceed against a Seller for monetary damages caused by the Fraud
of such Seller in its capacity as such for the duration of the survival
period of the applicable representation or warranty as set forth in the RandW
Insurance Policy. For the purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 10.5(d)_, in no
event shall the Fraud of any Seller be imputed to any other Seller. For the
avoidance of doubt, Parent, Merger Subs and the Sellers acknowledge and agree
that Parent shall be permitted to assert claims of Fraud against a Seller only
(i) at the direction of the insurer(s) under the RandW Insurance Policy, (ii)
after making a claim against such insurer(s) for losses suffered with respect
to such claim, and (iii) for aggregate monetary damages not to exceed the
policy limits under the RandW Insurance Policy plus the reasonable
and documented out-of-pocket expenses of the insurer(s) under the RandW
Insurance Policy for the enforcement of such claim against such Seller in the
exercise of the subrogation rights described in the first sentence of this
_Section_ __ _ 10.5(d)_. __

 



78 Section 10.6 _Binding Effect; Benefit; Assignment_. This Agreement shall inure
to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto. Other than (a)
_Section_ __ _ 6.7_ which is intended to benefit the Indemnified Persons, (b)
_Section_ __ _ 6.14_, which is intended to benefit WandC and its partners and
employees and (c) _Section_ __ _ 2.6(f)_, which is intended to benefit the
applicable Employee Bonus Recipients, no other Person not party to this
Agreement shall be entitled to the benefits of this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Partnership shall have the right, which right is hereby
acknowledged by Parent and Merger Subs, to enforce the rights of GP Parent and
the Sellers to (A) pursue damages on behalf of GP Parent and the Sellers in
the event of Parent or Merger Subs breach or wrongful termination of this
Agreement, and (B) receive the Merger Consideration or any other amounts
payable to GP Parent and the Sellers hereunder, in which event of
either clause (A) or (B), the damages recoverable by the Partnership for
itself and on behalf of GP Parent and the Sellers shall be determined by
reference to the total amount that would have been recoverable by GP Parent
and the Sellers if GP Parent and all such Sellers brought an action against
Parent or Merger Subs and were recognized as intended third party
beneficiaries hereunder. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties
hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties; _provided_ ,
that (x) Parent may assign its rights and interests hereunder for the purpose
of securing any financing of the transactions contemplated hereby and (y) the
Sellers Representative may assign its rights and obligations under this
Agreement to any of its Affiliates without prior written consent; _provided_ ,
that no such assignment referred to in clauses (x) or (y) shall relieve
Parent or the Sellers Representative of any of its obligations hereunder. Any
attempted assignment in violation of this _Section_ __ _ 10.6_ shall be void.
The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of
negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the
parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are
subject to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance with  _Section_ __ _
10.2_ without notice or liability to any other Person. In some instances, the
representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation
among the parties hereto of risks associated with particular matters
regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto. Consequently,
Persons other than the parties hereto may not rely upon the representations
and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or
circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any other date.

Section 10.7 _Amendment and Modification_. This Agreement may not be amended
or modified except by a written instrument executed by all parties to this
Agreement.

Section 10.8 _Non-Survival_. EXCEPT FOR THOSE COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS THAT BY
THEIR TERMS APPLY OR ARE TO BE PERFORMED IN WHOLE OR IN PART AFTER THE
CLOSING, NONE OF THE REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, AGREEMENTS OR COVENANTS SET

AND AGREEMENTS THAT BY THEIR TERMS APPLY OR ARE TO BE PERFORMED IN WHOLE OR IN

AGREEMENTS THAT BY THEIR TERMS APPLY OR ARE TO BE PERFORMED IN WHOLE OR IN

counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, and all of
which together shall be deemed to be one and the same instrument. Signed

Section 10.10 _Applicable Law; Dispute Resolution_. THIS AGREEMENT AND THE
LEGAL RELATIONS BETWEEN THE PARTIES HERETO SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED
IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, WITHOUT REGARD TO THE
CONFLICT OF LAWS RULES THEREOF EXCEPT THAT THE ACTS SHALL APPLY TO THE EXTENT
REQUIRED IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGERS. THE STATE OR FEDERAL COURTS LOCATED
WITHIN THE STATE OF NEW YORK SHALL HAVE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OVER ANY AND
ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN THE PARTIES HERETO, WHETHER IN LAW OR EQUITY, ARISING OUT
OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE AGREEMENTS, INSTRUMENTS AND
DOCUMENTS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY AND THE PARTIES HERETO CONSENT TO AND AGREE TO
SUBMIT TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF SUCH COURTS. EACH OF THE PARTIES
HERETO HEREBY WAIVES AND AGREES NOT TO ASSERT IN ANY SUCH DISPUTE, TO THE
FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY CLAIM THAT (A) SUCH PARTY IS
NOT PERSONALLY SUBJECT TO THE JURISDICTION OF SUCH COURTS, (B) SUCH PARTY AND
SUCH PARTYS PROPERTY IS IMMUNE FROM ANY LEGAL PROCESS ISSUED BY SUCH COURTS
OR (C) ANY LITIGATION OR OTHER PROCEEDING COMMENCED IN SUCH COURTS IS BROUGHT
IN AN INCONVENIENT FORUM. THE PARTIES HEREBY AGREE THAT MAILING OF PROCESS OR
OTHER PAPERS IN CONNECTION WITH ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING IN THE MANNER
PROVIDED IN  _SECTION 10.3_ , OR IN SUCH OTHER MANNER AS MAY BE PERMITTED BY
LAW, SHALL BE VALID AND SUFFICIENT SERVICE THEREOF AND HEREBY WAIVE ANY
OBJECTIONS TO SERVICE ACCOMPLISHED IN THE MANNER HEREIN PROVIDED.

 

Section 10.11 _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
contained in this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or
other authority to be invalid, void, unenforceable or against its regulatory
policy, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions
contained in this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall
in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated, and this Agreement shall be
reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction as if such invalid,
illegal or unenforceable term, provision, covenant or restriction or any
portion thereof had never been contained herein. Upon such a determination,
the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so
as to effect the original intent of the parties hereto as closely as possible
in a reasonably acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated
hereby may be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent
possible.

 



80 Section 10.12 _Specific Enforcement_.

 

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached or threatened to be breached
and that an award of money damages would be inadequate in such event.
Accordingly, it is acknowledged that the parties hereto and the third
party beneficiaries of this Agreement shall be entitled to seek equitable
relief, without proof of actual damages, including an injunction or
injunctions or Orders for specific performance to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement (including any Order sought by Parent, GP, the Partnership and/or
the Sellers Representative to cause any of the Parties to perform its
agreements and covenants contained in this Agreement), in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity as a remedy for
any such breach or threatened breach. Each party further agrees that no other
party hereto or any other Person shall be required to obtain, furnish or
post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to
obtaining any remedy referred to in this _Section_ __ _ 10.12_, and each
party hereto (i) irrevocably waives any right it may have to require
the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument
and (ii) agrees, subject to the immediately succeeding sentence, to cooperate
fully in any attempt by any other party hereto in obtaining such equitable
relief. Each party hereto further agrees that the only permitted objection
that it may raise in response to any action for equitable relief is that it
contests the existence of a breach or threatened breach of this Agreement.

 

(b) The parties hereto agree that (i) by seeking the remedies provided for in
this _Section_ __ _ 10.12_, a party shall not in any respect waive its right
to seek at any time any other form of relief that may be available to a party
under this Agreement and (ii) nothing set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 10.12_
shall require any party hereto to institute any proceeding for (or limit any
partys right to institute any proceeding for) specific performance under this
_Section_ __ _ 10.12_ prior or as a condition to exercising any termination
right under _Article IX_ (and pursuing monetary damages, subject to the
limitations set forth in this Agreement, after such termination), nor shall
the commencement of any legal proceeding pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
10.12_ or anything set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 10.12_ restrict or limit
any partys right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms of
_Article IX_ or pursue any other remedies under this Agreement that may be
available then or thereafter.

(c) If a court of competent jurisdiction has declined to specifically enforce
the obligations of Parent or either Merger Sub to consummate the Closing
pursuant to a claim for specific performance brought against Parent and/or
Merger Subs and has instead granted an award of damages for such alleged
breach, then the Partnership may enforce such award.

 

Section 10.13 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, AND AGREES TO CAUSE ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND
AFFILIATES TO WAIVE, ALL RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR
COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

 



81 Section 10.14 _Rules of Construction_. The parties hereto agree that they have
been represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this
Agreement and have participated jointly in the drafting of this Agreement and,
therefore, waive the application of any Law, holding or rule of construction
providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document shall be
construed against the party drafting such agreement or document.

Section 10.15  _Interpretation_. The Disclosure Letters relate to and qualify
certain of the representations, warranties, covenants and obligations of the
parties hereto in this Agreement and the Disclosure Letters are not intended
to broaden or constitute, and shall not be construed or otherwise be deemed
to broaden or constitute, any representation, warranty, covenant or obligation
of any party hereto or any other Person except to the extent expressly
provided in this Agreement. Matters reflected in the Disclosure Letters are
not necessarily limited to matters required by this Agreement to be reflected
in the Disclosure Letters. To the extent any such additional matters are
included in the Disclosure Letters, such additional matters are included for
informational purposes and do not necessarily include other matters of a
similar nature. In no event shall any disclosure of any such additional
matters be deemed or interpreted to broaden or otherwise amend any of the
representations, warranties, covenants or obligations in this Agreement. To
the extent that the Disclosure Letters include brief descriptions or summaries
of certain agreements and instruments, such descriptions do not purport to be
comprehensive, and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the text
of the documents and instruments described. Headings and subheadings have been
inserted in the Disclosure Letters for convenience of reference only and shall
to no extent have the effect of amending or changing the express description
thereof as set forth in this Agreement. Disclosure of any fact or item in this
Agreement or any Disclosure Letters referenced by a particular Section in this
Agreement shall be deemed to have been disclosed with respect to every other
Section in this Agreement to the extent that it is reasonably apparent from
the face of such disclosure that such disclosure would apply to such other
Sections. Any matter, condition or set of facts which is more
specifically (rather than generally or by implication) covered in any of the
representations and warranties of _Articles III_ and _IV_ shall be solely
governed by such more specific representation and warranty without reference
to or inclusion within a more generalized representation and warranty that
but for this sentence could be applicable to such matter, condition or set of
facts. No reference to or disclosure of any item or other matter in this
Agreement or the Disclosure Letters, Annexes or Exhibits attached hereto
shall be construed as an admission, representation or indication that such
item or other matter is "material" or would have a Partnership Material
Adverse Effect or a Parent Material Adverse Effect or that such item or other
matter is required to be so referred to or so disclosed. Each party may, at
its option, include in its Disclosure Letter items that are not material in
order to avoid any misunderstanding, and such inclusion, or any references
to dollar amounts, shall not be deemed to be an acknowledgement or
representation that such items are material, to establish any standard of
materiality or to define further the meaning of such terms for purposes of
this Agreement or otherwise. The specification of any dollar amount or the
inclusion of any item in the representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement or the Disclosure Letters, Annexes or Exhibits attached hereto is
not intended to imply that those amounts, or higher or lower amounts, or the
items so included, or other items,

 



82 are or are not required to be disclosed (including whether such amounts or
items are required to be disclosed as material or threatened) or are within
or outside of the ordinary course of business, and no party hereto shall use
the fact of the setting of the amounts or the fact of the inclusion of any
item in this Agreement or the Disclosure Letters, Annexes or Exhibits in any
dispute or controversy between the parties as to whether any obligation, item
or matter not described or included in this Agreement or in any section of the
Disclosure Letters, Annexes or Exhibits is or is not required to be disclosed
(including whether the amount or items are required to be disclosed as
material or threatened) or is within or outside of the ordinary course of
business for purposes of this Agreement. The information contained in this
Agreement and in the Disclosure Letters, Annexes and Exhibits hereto is
disclosed solely for purposes of this Agreement. No disclosure in any
Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to be an admission by any Person to any
other Person of any matter whatsoever (including with respect to any possible
breach or violation of any Law, Order or Contract) and nothing in any
Disclosure Letter shall constitute an admission of any Liability or obligation
of any Person to any other Person or shall confer or give any Person any
remedy, claim, Liability, reimbursement, cause of action or any other right.
The parties hereto do not assume any responsibility to any Person that is not
a party to this Agreement for the accuracy of any information set forth in the
Disclosure Letters. The information set forth in the Disclosure Letters was
not prepared or disclosed with a view to its potential disclosure to others.
Subject to applicable Law, such information is disclosed in confidence for the
purposes contemplated in this Agreement and is subject to the confidentiality
provisions of any other agreements, including the Confidentiality Agreement,
entered into by the parties hereto or their Affiliates. Moreover, in
disclosing the information in the Disclosure Letters, each party hereto
expressly does not waive any attorney-client privilege associated with such
information or any protection afforded by the work-product doctrine with
respect to any of the matters disclosed or discussed therein. Any attachments
to the Disclosure Letters form an integral part of the Disclosure Letters and
are incorporated by reference for all purposes as if set forth in the
Disclosure Letters.

 

Section 10.16 _Sellers  Representative_. __

 

(a) GP Parent and the Sellers have constituted, appointed and empowered
effective from and after the date of such consent, Harvest Partners, LP as
the Sellers Representative, for the benefit of GP Parent and the Sellers and
the exclusive agent and attorney-in-fact to act on behalf of GP Parent and
each Seller, in connection with and to facilitate the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, which shall include the power and authority:
(i) to negotiate, execute and deliver such waivers, consents and amendments
(other than (A) the written consent referred to in this sentence and (B) any
written consent of GP Parent and the Sellers adopting this Agreement) under
this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby as
the Sellers Representative, in its sole discretion, may deem necessary or
desirable; (ii) as the Sellers Representative, to enforce and protect the
rights and interests of GP Parent and the Sellers and to enforce and protect
the rights and interests of such Persons arising out of or under or in any
manner relating to this Agreement and the transactions provided for herein,
and to take any and all actions which the Sellers Representative believes are
necessary or appropriate under this Agreement for and on behalf of GP Parent
and the Sellers including, consenting to, compromising or settling any such
claims, conducting negotiations with Parent, the Surviving GP, the Surviving
Partnership and their respective Representatives

 



83  regarding such claims, and, in connection therewith, to (A) assert any claim
or institute any action, proceeding or investigation; (B) investigate, defend,
contest or litigate any claim, action, proceeding or investigation initiated
by Parent, the Surviving GP, the Surviving Partnership or any other Person, or
by any Governmental Entity against the Sellers Representative, GP Parent
and/or any of the Sellers, and receive process on behalf of GP Parent and/or
any or all Sellers in any such claim, action, proceeding or investigation and
compromise or settle on such terms as the Sellers Representative shall
determine to be appropriate, and give receipts, releases and discharges with
respect to, any such claim, action, proceeding or investigation; (C) file any
proofs of debt, claims and petitions as the Sellers Representative may deem
advisable or necessary; (D) settle or compromise any claims asserted under
this Agreement; and (E) file and prosecute appeals from any decision, judgment
or award rendered in any such action, proceeding or investigation, it being
understood that the Sellers Representative shall not have any obligation to
take any such actions, and shall not have any Liability for any failure to
take any such actions; (iii) to refrain from enforcing any right of GP Parent
and the Sellers arising out of or under or in any manner relating to
this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such failure to act on the
part of the Sellers Representative, except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, shall be deemed a waiver of any such right or interest by the
Sellers Representative or by GP Parent and/or the Sellers unless such waiver
is in writing signed by the waiving party or by the Sellers Representative;
(iv) to make, execute, acknowledge and deliver all such other agreements,
guarantees, orders, receipts, endorsements, notices, requests, instructions,
certificates, stock powers, letters and other writings, and, in general, to do
any and all things and to take any and all action that the Sellers
Representative, in its sole and absolute discretion, may consider necessary
or proper or convenient in connection with or to carry out the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; (v) to engage special counsel, accountants and
other advisors and incur such other expenses on behalf of GP Parent and the
Sellers in connection with any matter arising under this Agreement; and (vi)
to collect, hold and disburse the Initial Purchase Price, Final Purchase
Price, the Purchase Price Adjustment and the Expense Holdback Amount
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

(b) The Sellers Representative shall be entitled to receive reimbursement
from, and be indemnified by, the Sellers for certain expenses, charges and
Liabilities as provided below. In connection with this Agreement, and in
exercising or failing to exercise all or any of the powers conferred upon the
Sellers Representative hereunder, (i) the Sellers Representative shall
incur no responsibility whatsoever to GP Parent or any Sellers by reason of
any error in judgment or other act or omission performed or omitted hereunder,
excepting only responsibility for any act or failure to act which represents
willful misconduct, and (ii) the Sellers Representative shall be entitled to
rely on the advice of counsel, public accountants or other independent experts
experienced in the matter at issue, and any error in judgment or other act or
omission of the Sellers Representative pursuant to such advice shall in no
event subject the Sellers Representative to Liability to GP Parent or any
Sellers. Each Seller shall indemnify, severally and not jointly, based on
such Sellers Pro Rata Portion, the Sellers Representative against all
losses, damages, Liabilities, claims, obligations, costs and expenses,
including reasonable attorneys, accountants and other experts fees and the
amount of any judgment against them, of any nature whatsoever (including, but
not limited to, any and all expense whatsoever reasonably incurred in
investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, commenced
or threatened or any claims whatsoever), arising out of or in connection with
any

 



84  claim, investigation, challenge, action or proceeding or in connection with
any appeal thereof, relating to the acts or omissions of the Sellers
Representative hereunder. The foregoing indemnification shall not apply in
the event of any action or proceeding which finally adjudicates the liability
of the Sellers Representative hereunder for its willful misconduct. The
Sellers Representative shall have the right to recover, at its sole
discretion, from the Expense Holdback Amount, prior to any distribution to the
Sellers, any amounts to which it is entitled pursuant to the expense
reimbursement and indemnification provisions of this  _Section_ __ _
10.16(b)_. In the event of any indemnification hereunder, upon written notice
from the Sellers Representative to the Sellers as to the existence of a
deficiency toward the payment of any such indemnification amount, each Seller
shall promptly deliver to the Sellers Representative full payment of its Pro
Rata Portion of the amount of such deficiency. The Sellers Representative
shall be entitled to refuse to take or to continue to take any action
hereunder unless it shall first be fully indemnified to its reasonable
satisfaction by the Sellers (based on their respective Pro Rata Portions)
against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by
reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. The Sellers
Representative shall establish such terms and procedures for administering,
investing and disbursing any amounts from the Expense Holdback Amount as it
may determine in its reasonable judgment to be necessary, advisable or
desirable to give effect to the provisions of this Agreement. If any balance
of the Expense Holdback Amount remains undisbursed at such time as all
disputes, claims and other matters relating to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and all other instruments and agreements to be delivered
pursuant hereto have been finally resolved, then the Sellers Representative
shall distribute to each Seller, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated by each Seller, such Sellers Pro
Rata Portion of such remaining balance of the Expense Holdback Amount.

 

(c) All of the indemnities, immunities and powers granted to the Sellers
Representative under this Agreement shall survive the Effective Time and/or
any termination of this Agreement.

(d) Parent, the Surviving GP and the Surviving Partnership shall have the
right to rely upon all actions taken or omitted to be taken by the Sellers
Representative pursuant to this Agreement, all of which actions or omissions
shall be legally binding upon the Sellers.

 

(e) The grant of authority provided for herein (i) is coupled with an interest
and shall be irrevocable and survive the death, incompetency, bankruptcy or
liquidation of any Seller and (ii) shall survive the consummation of the
Mergers, and any action taken by the Sellers Representative pursuant to the
authority granted in this Agreement shall be effective and absolutely binding
on each Seller notwithstanding any contrary action of or direction from such
Seller, except for actions or omissions of the Sellers Representative
constituting willful misconduct. The Sellers Representative may resign from
its capacity as the Sellers Representative at any time by written notice
delivered to GP Parent, Sellers and Parent. If there is a vacancy at any time
in the position of the Sellers Representative for any reason, a
successor Sellers Representative shall be appointed by the vote of Sellers
who are entitled to receive more than fifty percent (50%) of the Merger
Consideration.

 



85 (f) Each of GP, the Partnership, Parent and each of the Merger Subs
acknowledges and agrees that the Sellers Representative is a party to this
Agreement solely to perform certain administrative functions in connection
with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Accordingly,
each of GP, the Partnership, Parent and each of the Merger Subs acknowledges
and agrees that the Sellers Representative shall have no Liability to, and
shall not be liable for any losses of, any of GP, the Partnership, Merger Subs
or Parent in connection with any obligations of the Sellers Representative
under this Agreement or otherwise in respect of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, except to the extent such losses shall be
proven to be the direct result of willful misconduct by the
Sellers Representative in connection with the performance of its obligations
hereunder.

 

* * * * * 

 



86 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Parent, Merger Subs, the Partnership, GP and the Sellers
Representative have caused this Agreement to be duly executed by their
respective officers thereunto duly authorized, all as of the date first above
written.
