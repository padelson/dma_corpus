Corporation Law of the State of Delaware or (iv)&nbsp;for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. If the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware is subsequently amended to further eliminate or limit the
liability of a director, then a director of the corporation, in addition to the circumstances in which a director is not personally liable as set forth in the preceding sentence, shall not be liable to the fullest extent permitted by the amended
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. For purposes of this Article IX, &#147;fiduciary duty as a director&#148; shall include any fiduciary duty arising out of serving at the Corporation&#146;s request as a director of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture or other enterprise, and &#147;personal liability to the corporation or its stockholders&#148; shall include any liability to such other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, and
any liability to the corporation in its capacity as a security holder, joint venture, partner, beneficiary, creditor or investor of or in any such other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise. </P>
