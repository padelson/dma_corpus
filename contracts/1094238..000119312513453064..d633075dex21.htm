ARTICLE 2

_The Offer_

 

Section 2.01. _The Offer_.

 

(a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance
with Section 11.01 and nothing shall have occurred that, had the Offer been
commenced, would give rise to a right to terminate the Offer pursuant to any
of the conditions set forth in Annex I hereto (the " _Offer Conditions_ ")
(other than the conditions 

 



7  set forth in clause (i) and subclause (D) of clause (ii)), as promptly as
practicable after the date hereof, but in no event later than 10 Business Days
following the date of this Agreement, Acquisition Subsidiary shall, and
Parent shall cause it to, commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the
1934 Act) the Offer to purchase for cash all of the outstanding Shares at the
Offer Price. The Offer shall be subject to the Minimum Condition and the
satisfaction, or waiver by Parent or Acquisition Subsidiary, of the other
Offer Conditions. The date on which Acquisition Subsidiary commences (within
the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the 1934 Act) the Offer is referred to as the
" _Offer Commencement Date_ ".

(b) Parent and Acquisition Subsidiary expressly reserve the right to waive any
of the Offer Conditions and to make any change in the terms of or conditions
to the Offer, including raising the Offer Price; _provided_ that, without the
prior written consent of the Company, neither Parent nor Acquisition
Subsidiary shall:

 

(i) waive or change the Minimum Condition;

 

(ii) decrease the Offer Price (except pursuant to Section 2.01(e)(ii);

 

(iii) change the form of consideration to be paid in the Offer;

 

(iv) decrease the number of Shares sought in the Offer;

 

(v) extend or otherwise change the expiration date of the Offer except as
otherwise provided herein; or

 

(vi) impose additional Offer Conditions or otherwise amend, modify or
supplement any of the Offer Conditions or terms of the Offer in a manner that
adversely affects, or would reasonably be expected to adversely affect, the
holders of the Shares generally.

(c) Unless extended as provided in this Agreement, the Offer shall expire at
midnight, New York City time, on the date that is thirty-four (34) Business
Days (calculated as set forth in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the 1934 Act) after
the Offer Commencement Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (A) Acquisition
Subsidiary shall, and Parent shall cause it to, extend the Offer for any
period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC
or the staff thereof or Nasdaq applicable to the Offer or for any period
otherwise required by Applicable Law and (B) if, on the initial expiration
date or any subsequent date as of which the Offer is scheduled to expire, any
Offer Condition is not satisfied and has not been waived, then Acquisition
Subsidiary shall, and Parent shall cause it to, extend the Offer for one or
(as needed) more periods of five (5) Business Days each (or such shorter
period as the Company agrees to or such longer period as the parties hereto
may agree); _provided, however_ , that in no event shall Acquisition
Subsidiary be required to extend the Offer to a date later than the End Date.
Notwithstanding the foregoing clause (B), if at the end of the initial
expiration date (or the expiration date as extended in accordance with
Section 2.01(f), if necessary), all of the Offer Conditions are satisfied
other than the Minimum Condition, then Acquisition Subsidiary shall be
required to, and Parent shall cause it to, extend the Offer for one
additional period of five (5) Business Days, and if at the end of such five
(5) Business Day period, the Minimum Condition continues to not be satisfied,
Acquisition Subsidiary shall be required to, and Parent shall cause it to,
extend the Offer for one more period of five (5) Business Days; _provided,
however_ that if at the end of any expiration date as of which the Offer is
scheduled to expire, (i) all of the Offer Conditions are satisfied other than
the Minimum Condition and (ii) an Acquisition Proposal shall have been
publicly announced or a tender offer or exchange offer shall have been
commenced by a Third Party (and in each case not withdrawn),
Acquisition Subsidiary shall be required to, and Parent shall cause it to,
extend the Offer for one or (as needed) more periods of five (5) Business Days
each (or such shorter period as the Company agrees to or such longer period as
the parties hereto may agree) until the earlier of (i) February 28, 2014 and
(ii) five (5) Business Day after the date such Acquisition Proposal or tender
or exchange offer has been withdrawn, after which Acquisition Subsidiary shall
not be required to extend the Offer ; _provided further_ , that in no event
shall Acquisition Subsidiary be required to extend the Offer to a date later
than the End Date. The Offer may be terminated prior to its expiration date
(as such expiration date may be extended and re-extended in accordance with
this Section 2.01(c)), but only if this Agreement is validly terminated in
accordance with Article 11.

 

(d) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and to the
satisfaction of the Minimum Condition and the satisfaction or waiver of the
other Offer Conditions, Acquisition Subsidiary shall, and Parent

 



8  shall cause it to, promptly after the expiration of the Offer, accept for
payment and pay for all Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to
the Offer (the time at which Shares are first accepted for payment under the
Offer, the " _Acceptance Time_ "). The obligation of Acquisition Subsidiary to
accept for payment and pay for all Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer shall
be subject only to the satisfaction of the Minimum Condition and the
satisfaction or waiver of each of the other Offer Conditions (and shall not be
subject to any other conditions). Promptly after the Acceptance Time,
Acquisition Subsidiary shall pay the Offer Price for such Shares.

 

(e) On the Adjustment Date, the Company shall deliver to Parent and
Acquisition Subsidiary its calculation of (i) the Estimated World Wide Cash
Amount and (ii) the World Wide Cash Amount Statement reflecting such Estimated
World Wide Cash Amount, and reasonable supporting documentation for each of
the foregoing. The Company and Parent shall work in good faith to resolve
any disputes regarding the Companys calculations of the Estimated World Wide
Cash Amount and World Wide Cash Amount Statement within two (2) days following
the date such calculations were received by Parent, and in the event such
agreement is reached, shall within such two (2) day period mutually amend (if
necessary) the World Wide Cash Amount Statement originally delivered by the
Company to reflect any agreed-upon changes thereto. If the parties are not
able to reach agreement within such two (2) day period, within one day after
the end of the four (4) Business Day period starting the day after the
Adjustment Date, the Company shall instead deliver to Parent and Acquisition
Subsidiary its calculation of (i) the Actual World Wide Cash Amount and (ii)
World Wide Cash Amount Statement reflecting such Actual World Wide Cash
Amount, and reasonable supporting documentation for each of the foregoing. The
Company and Parent shall work in good faith to resolve any disputes regarding
the Companys calculation of the Actual World Wide Cash Amount and World Wide
Cash Amount Statement within two (2) days following the date such calculations
were received by Parent. The Company, shall within such two (2) day period
revise (if necessary) the World Wide Cash Amount Statement originally
delivered by the Company to reflect any changes to the Actual World Wide Cash
Amount and/or World Wide Cash Amount Statement that the Company in good faith
determines appropriate (in each case taking into account any such disputes).
For the avoidance of doubt, but without limiting the other provisions and
definitions of this Agreement, the final determination of the Actual
World Wide Cash Amount and the World Wide Cash Adjusted Amount shall be made
solely by the Company in accordance with such provisions and definitions.
Following final determination of the World Wide Cash Adjusted Amount set forth
in the World Wide Cash Amount Statement (whether calculated using the
Estimated World Wide Cash Amount or Actual World Wide Cash Amount, as
determined as set forth above), the Offer Price shall be adjusted as follows
in the circumstances set forth below:

 

(i) if the World Wide Cash Adjusted Amount is greater than $9,350,000, the
Offer Price shall be increased, so that from and after the Adjustment Date
the Offer Price shall be equal to (x) $2.00, plus (y) an amount equal to the
quotient (rounded to the nearest whole $0.01) of (A) the amount by which the
World Wide Cash Adjusted Amount exceeds $9,300,000  _divided by_ (B) the
number of Shares issued and outstanding as of the Adjustment Date on a Fully
Diluted basis.

 

(ii) if the World Wide Cash Adjusted Amount is less than $9,250,000, the Offer
Price shall be decreased, so that from and after the Adjustment Date the
Offer Price shall be equal to (x) $2.00, less (y) an amount equal to the
quotient (rounded to the nearest whole $0.01) of (A) the amount by which the
World Wide Cash Adjusted Amount is less than $9,300,000  _divided by_ (B) the
number of Shares issued and outstanding as of the Adjustment Date on a Fully
Diluted basis.

For the avoidance of doubt, if the World Wide Cash Adjusted Amount is equal
to or greater than $9,250,000 and less than or equal to $9,350,000, the Offer
Price shall not be adjusted.

 

(f) In the event the Offer Price is adjusted pursuant to Section 2.01(e), then
Acquisition Subsidiary shall, and Parent shall cause it to, no later than
9:00 AM New York Time on the Business Day following final determination of the
World Wide Cash Adjusted Amount as set forth in the World Wide Cash Amount
Statement (as revised, if applicable) (x) provide notice of such adjustment
to the Companys stockholders pursuant to and in compliance with Rule 14e-1(b)
under the 1934 Act and any other applicable rules and regulations of the SEC
or other Applicable Law and (y) to the extent that the date as of which the
Offer is scheduled to expire is less than

 



9  ten (10) Business Days (calculated as set forth in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under
the 1934 Act) following such notice, extend the Offer such that the expiration
date is ten (10) Business Days following such notice. In the event the Offer
Price is not adjusted pursuant to Section 2.01(e), then Acquisition Subsidiary
shall, and Parent shall cause it to, no later than 9:00 AM New York Time on
the Business Day following final determination of the World Wide Cash
Adjusted Amount as set forth in the World Wide Cash Amount Statement (as
revised, if applicable) (x) provide notice of the foregoing to the Companys
stockholders and (y) to the extent that the date as of which the Offer is
scheduled to expire is less than five (5) Business Days (calculated as set
forth in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the 1934 Act) following such notice, extend
the Offer such that the expiration date is five (5) Business Days following
such notice.

(a) As soon as practicable on the Offer Commencement Date, Parent and
Acquisition Subsidiary shall (i) file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement

not be responsible with respect to information supplied by the Company for

made, not misleading. The Company shall cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so
corrected to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to holders of

whereupon the separate existence of Acquisition Subsidiary shall cease, and
the Company shall be the surviving corporation (the " _Surviving Corporation_
").

 

(b) The Merger shall be governed by Section 251(h) of the Delaware Law. The
parties hereto agree to take all necessary and appropriate action to cause

_Closing_ ") shall take place in New York City at the offices of Fried,
Frank, Harris, Shriver and Jacobson LLP, One New York Plaza, New York, New York,
10004 as soon as possible following the consummation of the Offer, but in any
event no later than two Business Days after the date the conditions set forth
in Article 10 (other than conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied
at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent permissible,
waiver of those conditions at the Closing) have been satisfied or, to the
extent permissible, waived by the party or parties entitled to the benefit of
such conditions, or at such other place, at such other time or on such other
date as Parent and the Company may mutually agree.

 

(d) At the Closing, the Company and Acquisition Subsidiary shall file a
certificate of merger with the Delaware Secretary of State and make all other
filings or recordings required by Delaware Law in connection with the Merger.
The Merger shall become effective at such time (the " _Effective Time_ ") as
the certificate of merger is duly filed with the Delaware Secretary of State
(or at such later time as may be mutually agreed upon by Parent, Acquisition
Subsidiary and the Company and specified in the certificate of merger).

 

(e) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall possess
all the rights, powers, privileges and franchises and be subject to all of

(a) Except as otherwise provided in Section 3.02(b), Section 3.02(c) or
Section 3.04, each Share outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into the right to receive the Offer Price in cash, without
interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). As of the Effective Time, all such
Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and
retired and shall cease to exist, and shall thereafter represent only the
right to receive the Merger Consideration.

 

(b) Each Share held by the Company as treasury stock or owned by Parent or
Acquisition Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
canceled, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto.

 



12 (c) Each Share held by any Subsidiary of either the Company or Parent (other
than the Acquisition Subsidiary) immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into such number of shares of stock of the Surviving
Corporation such that each such Subsidiary owns the same percentage of the
outstanding capital stock of the Surviving Corporation immediately following
the Effective Time as such Subsidiary owned in the Company immediately prior
to the Effective Time.

(d) Each share of common stock of Acquisition Subsidiary outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one
share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights,
powers and privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute the
only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation (except
for any such shares resulting from the conversion of Shares pursuant to
Section 3.02(c)).

 

Section 3.03. _Surrender and Payment_.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a bank or trust company
or similar entity reasonably acceptable to the Company which is authorized to
exercise corporate trust or stock powers to act as Exchange Agent in the
Merger (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the purpose of exchanging for the Merger
Consideration (i) certificates representing Shares (the " _Certificates_ ")
or (ii) uncertificated Shares (the " _Uncertificated Shares_ "). At or prior
to the Effective Time, Parent shall provide the Exchange Agent funds
representing the aggregate Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the
Certificates and the Uncertificated Shares pursuant to Section 3.02(a) (the "
_Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Agent shall cause the Exchange Fund to be (i)
held for the benefit of the holders of Shares and (ii) promptly applied to
making the payments provided for in Section 3.02(a). The Exchange Fund shall
not be used for any purpose that is not provided for herein. The Exchange
Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund, in direct
obligations of the United States of America, obligations for which the full
faith and credit of the United States of America is pledged to provide for the
payment of all principal and interest, or as otherwise directed by Parent.
Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be kept
in the Exchange Fund. To the extent that there are losses with respect to such
investments, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for other reasons below the level
required to make prompt payments of the Merger Consideration as contemplated
hereby, Parent shall promptly replace or restore the portion of the Exchange
Fund lost through investments or other events so as to ensure that the
Exchange Fund is, at all times, maintained at a level sufficient to make such
payments.

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent or the Surviving Corporation
shall send, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of
Shares at the Effective Time a letter of transmittal and instructions (which
shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates or transfer of the
Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange Agent) for use in such exchange. Each
holder of Shares that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration shall be entitled to receive, upon (i) surrender to the
Exchange Agent of a Certificate (or affidavit that such Certificate has been
lost, stolen or destroyed as provided in Section 3.8), together with a
properly completed letter of transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an "agents
message" by the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as
the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry
transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the Merger Consideration payable for each
Share represented by a Certificate or for each Uncertificated Share. Until so
surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, each such Certificate or
Uncertificated Share shall represent after the Effective Time for all
purposes only the right to receive the Merger Consideration.

(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the
transferred Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to
such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or
shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or, in the case of
Uncertificated Shares, that such documentation as may be reasonably requested
by the Exchange Agent is provided and (ii) the Person requesting such payment
shall pay to the Exchange Agent any 

 



13  transfer or other Taxes required as a result of such payment to a Person
other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share
or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been
paid or is not payable.

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration
of transfers of Shares. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall
be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration provided for, and in
accordance with the procedures set forth in, this Article 3.

(e) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange
Agent pursuant to Section 3.03(a) (and any interest or other income earned
thereon) that remains unclaimed by the holders of Shares twelve months after
the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent, upon demand, and any such
holder who has not exchanged such Shares for the Merger Consideration in
accordance with this Section 3.03 prior to that time shall thereafter look
only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Merger Consideration in
respect of such Shares without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any
holder of Shares for any amount paid to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

 

Section 3.04. _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding Section 3.02, Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who
is entitled to demand and properly has demanded appraisal for such Shares in
accordance and full compliance with Delaware Law shall not be converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration, unless such holder fails
to perfect, withdraws, waives or otherwise loses the right to appraisal. If,
after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect, withdraws, waives or
loses the right to appraisal, such Shares shall be treated as if they had been
converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands
received by the Company for appraisal of Shares, and Parent, at its expense,
shall have the right to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect
to such demands, so long as Parent does not create obligations for the Company
prior to the Effective Time. Except with the prior written consent of Parent,
the Company shall not (and shall not agree to) make any payment with respect
to, or offer to settle or settle, any such demands or waive any failure to
timely deliver a written demand for appraisal or take any other action with
respect to such demand.

 

Section 3.05. _Equity Awards_.

 

(a) At or immediately prior to the Acceptance Time, each option to purchase
Shares (each, an " _Option_ ") outstanding under any Company Benefit
Arrangement that provides for equity-based compensation (each, an " _Option
Plan_ ") shall, without any action on the part of any holder of such Option or
the Company, fully vest and become exercisable. To the extent not exercised
prior to the Effective Time, upon the Effective Time each Option shall be
cancelled and the Surviving Corporation shall pay each holder promptly after
the Effective Time for each such Option an amount in cash determined by
multiplying (i) the excess, if any, of the Offer Price over the applicable
per Share exercise price of such Option by (ii) the number of Shares such
holder could have purchased had such holder exercised such Option in full
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall not assume any Options
in connection with the Merger.

(b) At or immediately prior to the Acceptance Time, each Share outstanding
under any Option Plan (each, a " _Restricted Share_ ") shall, without any
action on the part of any holder of such Restricted Share or the Company,
cease to be subject to any forfeiture or vesting conditions. At the Effective
Time, each such Restricted Share shall automatically be converted into, and
canceled in exchange for, the right to receive the Merger Consideration
pursuant to Section 3.02 and payable pursuant to Section 3.03. Parent
shall not assume any Restricted Shares in connection with the Merger.

Section 3.06. _Adjustments_. If, during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding Shares shall have been
changed into a different number of shares or a different class (including by
reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination,
exchange or readjustment of

 



14  Shares, or stock dividend thereon with a record date during such period, but
excluding any change that results from any exercise of options outstanding as
of the date hereof to purchase Shares granted under the Companys stock
option or compensation plans or arrangements), the Offer Price, the Merger
Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement shall
be appropriately adjusted.

 

Section 3.07. _Withholding Rights_. Notwithstanding any provision contained
herein to the contrary, each of the Exchange Agent, the Surviving
Corporation, the Acquisition Subsidiary and Parent, as applicable, shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to
any Person pursuant to Articles 2 and 3 such amounts as it is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under any
provision of Applicable Law relating to Taxes and shall timely pay such
withheld amounts to the appropriate Taxing Authority. If the Exchange Agent,
the Surviving Corporation, the Acquisition Subsidiary or Parent, as the case
may be, so withholds amounts and pays such amounts over to the appropriate
Taxing Authority, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to such Person in respect of which the Exchange
Agent, the Surviving Corporation, the Acquisition Subsidiary or Parent, as the
case may be, made such deduction and withholding.

 

Section 3.08. _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond,
in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of
the Shares represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this Article
3\.

between the Company and Parent (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), the
Company shall (i) give Parent and its Representatives, upon reasonable notice,
reasonable access during normal business hours to the offices, properties,

Schedule 7.02(a)(ii) and (iii) instruct the Representatives of the Company and
its Subsidiaries to cooperate with Parent in the matters described in clauses
(i) and (ii) above and on Schedule 7.02(a)(iii). Any investigation pursuant to

unreasonably with the conduct of the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries. Nothing in this Section 7.02 shall require the Company to
provide any access, or to disclose any information (i) if providing such
access or disclosing such information would violate Applicable Law (including
antitrust and privacy laws) or (ii) if such information is protected by
attorney-client privilege to the extent such privilege cannot be protected by
the Company through exercise of its reasonable efforts; provided that in each
case the parties work in good faith to attempt to mitigate such restrictions
and find a way to allow disclosure of such information to the extent doing so
would not result in the violation of Applicable Law or result in loss
of attorney-client privilege.

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, with respect to the information disclosed
pursuant to Section 7.03(a), Parent shall comply with, and shall cause its
Representatives to comply with, all of its obligations under the
Confidentiality Agreement.

 

Section 7.03. _Solicitation; Other Offers_.

 

(a) _General Prohibitions_. After the date hereof and prior to the earlier of
the Acceptance Time and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
this Section 7.03 or Article 11, the Company and its

 



31  Subsidiaries (and its and their directors and officers) shall not (and the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its or any of its
Subsidiaries other Representatives not to), directly or indirectly, (i)
solicit, initiate or knowingly take any action to facilitate or encourage the
submission of any Acquisition Proposal, or any offer or inquiry that could
reasonably be expected to result in an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter into,
continue or participate in any discussions or negotiations with, furnish any
information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or afford
access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of the Company

(iii) fail to make, withdraw, modify or amend in a manner adverse to Parent

advisable (or agree or publicly propose to approve, recommend or declare
advisable) an Acquisition Proposal) (any of the foregoing in this clause
(iii), an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ "), (iv) terminate, amend,
modify, grant any waiver, release or consent under or fail to enforce the
Rights Agreement (other than the amendment contemplated by Section 5.23) or
any standstill, confidentiality or similar agreement involving the Company
and its securities, other than, in the case of any standstill, confidentiality
or similar agreement involving the Company and its securities, to allow any
Third Party to such agreement to make an Acquisition Proposal to the Company
that is not publicly disclosed by such Third Party and is not directly made to
the Companys stockholders, (v) approve, adopt, recommend or enter into (x)
any merger agreement, acquisition agreement or other similar definitive
agreement (an " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ") or (y) any agreement in
principle, letter of intent, term sheet, option agreement or other agreement
or instrument relating to (or that contemplates or that would reasonably be
expected to lead to) an Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality
agreement with a Third Party to whom the Company is permitted to provide
information in accordance with Section 7.03(b)(i)), or (vi) resolve, publicly
propose or agree to do any of the foregoing.

(b) _Exceptions_. Notwithstanding Section 7.03(a), at any time prior to the
Acceptance Time:

(i) the Company, directly or indirectly through its Representatives, may (x)
in response to a bona fide, unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal that the
Board of Directors in good faith reasonably believes, after consultation with
its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, constitutes (or could
be reasonably likely to lead to) a Superior Proposal, engage in negotiations
or discussions with any Third Party and its Representatives or financing
sources that has made after the date of this Agreement and (y) furnish to such
Third Party or its Representatives or its financing sources non-public
information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to a
confidentiality agreement (a copy of which shall be provided for informational
purposes only to Parent) with such Third Party with terms no less favorable
in the aggregate to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement (which shall include a standstill no less restrictive than the
standstill in the Confidentiality Agreement that was in effect prior to the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, except that it may allow such Third
Party to make a Acquisition Proposal to the Company that is not publicly
disclosed by such Third Party and is not directly made to the
Companys stockholders); _provided_ all such information provided or made
available to such Third Party (or its Representatives or financing sources)
(to the extent that such information has not been previously provided or made
available to Parent) is provided or made available to Parent, as the case may
be, prior to or substantially concurrently with the time it is provided or
made available to such Third Party (or its Representatives or financing
sources)); in each case referred to in the foregoing only if the Board of
Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, that the failure to take such action could be reasonably likely to
result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under Delaware Law;

 

(ii) the Board of Directors may make an Adverse Recommendation Change solely
pursuant to and in compliance with Sections 7.03(d) and (e); and

(iii) the Company may terminate this Agreement to enter into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement solely pursuant to and in compliance Sections 7.03(d)
and (e) and Section 11.01(d);

In addition, nothing contained herein shall prevent the Board of Directors
from (i) complying with Rule 14e-2(a) under the 1934 Act with regard to an
Acquisition Proposal so long as any action taken or statement made to so
comply is consistent with this Section 7.03; __provided__ that any such
action taken or statement made

 



32  that relates to an Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be an Adverse
Recommendation Change unless the Board of Directors reaffirms without
qualification the Company Board Recommendation in such statement or in
connection with such action or (ii) issuing a "stop, look and listen"
disclosure or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f)
under the 1934 Act (which it is agreed shall not constitute an Adverse
Recommendation Change).

(c) _Required Notices_. The Board of Directors shall not take any of the
actions referred to in Section 7.03(b) unless the Company shall have
delivered to Parent a prior written notice advising Parent that it intends to
take such action. In addition, the Company shall notify Parent promptly (but
in no event later than 36 hours) after receipt by the Company (or any of its
Representatives) of any Acquisition Proposal, including the identity of the
person making such Acquisition Proposal, and a copy of such Acquisition
Proposal, including draft agreements or term sheets submitted in connection
therewith (or, where no such copy is available, a description of the material
terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal), including any
modifications thereof, and shall keep Parent reasonably informed as to the
status (including changes to the material terms) of such Acquisition
Proposal. The Company shall also notify Parent promptly (but in no event later
than 36 hours) after receipt by the Company of any request for non-public
information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or for access
to the business, properties, assets, books or records of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries by any Third Party that has informed the Company that it is
considering making, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal (with the Company to
promptly provide Parent a copy of such request). The Company and its
Subsidiaries are not party to and shall not enter into any Contract that
prohibits the Company from providing such information to Parent. 

(d) _Adverse Recommendation Change and Alternative Acquisition Agreement_. At
any time prior to the Acceptance Time, following compliance with Section
7.03(e), the Board of Directors may:

(i) effect an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to an Intervening
Event if and only if the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel and taking
into account any offers to adjust the terms of this Agreement made by
Parent pursuant to Section 7.03(e), that the failure to take such action
could be reasonably likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under
Delaware Law; and

 

(ii) effect an Adverse Recommendation Change to recommend or approve an
Acquisition Proposal and/or cause the Company to terminate this Agreement to
enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement in compliance with Section
11.01(d) if and only if (A) a _bona fide_ , unsolicited written Acquisition
Proposal is made to the Company after the date hereof, which has not been
withdrawn and did not result from or arise as a result of a breach of Section
7.03(a) or (b), (B) the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel and taking
into account any offers to adjust the terms of this Agreement made by Parent
pursuant to Section 7.03(e), that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a
Superior Proposal and (C) the Board of Directors determines in good
faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to
take such action could be reasonably likely to result in a breach of its
fiduciary duties under Delaware Law.

 

(e) _Match Right_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, the Board of Directors shall not be entitled to make an Adverse
Recommendation Change pursuant to Section 7.03(d) or cause the Company to
terminate this Agreement to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement
unless this Section 7.03 has been complied with in all material respects and
the Company promptly notifies Parent, in writing, at least five (5) days
before taking such action (the " _Notice Period_ "), of its intention to do
so, which notification (x) in respect of an Intervening Event, shall describe
such Intervening Event and the reasons for the proposed Adverse Recommendation
Change (a " _Notice of Intervening Event_ ") or (y) in respect of a Superior
Proposal, shall have attached thereto the most current version of any
proposed agreement or, if there is no proposed agreement, a detailed summary
of the material terms of any such proposal and the identity of the offeror) (a
" _Notice of Superior Proposal_ "), and

 

(i) after delivery of a Notice of Intervening Event: (1) during such Notice
Period, the Company shall (and shall cause its Representatives to) engage in
good faith negotiations with Parent (to the extent Parent

 



33  wishes to negotiate) regarding changes to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement such that failing to make an Adverse Recommendation Change could not
be reasonably likely to result in a breach of the Board of Directors
fiduciary duties under Delaware Law and (2) at the end of such Notice Period,
the Board of Directors shall have determined in good faith, after consultation
with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel and taking into account
any offers to adjust the terms of this Agreement made by Parent during the
Notice Period, that the failure to make an Adverse Recommendation Change with
respect to such Intervening Event could be reasonably likely to result in a
breach of its fiduciary duties under Delaware Law. Any material change to the
Intervening Event shall require the Company to issue a new Notice of
Intervening Event (with a new Notice Period) and the Company shall again be
required to comply with the requirements of this clause (i); or

(ii) after delivery of a Notice of Superior Proposal: (1) during the Notice
Period, the Company shall (and shall cause its Representatives to) engage in
good faith negotiations with Parent (to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate)
regarding such changes to the terms and conditions of this Agreement such that
the Acquisition Proposal that was determined to constitute a Superior
Proposal may no longer be reasonably considered a Superior Proposal and (2) at
the end of such Notice Period, the Board of Directors shall have determined in
good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel and taking into account any offers to adjust the terms of this
Agreement made by Parent during the Notice Period, that (A) such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and (B) the failure to make an
Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement to enter into an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement for such Superior Proposal could be
reasonably likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under
Delaware Law. Any amendment to the financial terms or other material terms of
such Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice of Superior Proposal (and a
new Notice Period) and the Company shall again be required to comply with
the requirements of this clause (ii).

(f) _Definition of Superior Proposal and Intervening Event_. For purposes of
this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " means a _bona fide_ , unsolicited
written Acquisition Proposal made after the date hereof and that did not
result from or arise as a result of a breach of Section 7.03(a) or (b) (
_provided_  that, for the purposes of this definition, references to "20%" in
the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed replaced with
references to "50%") that the Board of Directors determines in good faith by a
majority vote, after considering the advice of its outside legal counsel and
a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, would result in a
transaction more favorable, from a financial point of view to the Companys
stockholders than as provided hereunder, after giving effect to any changes
to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in response to such offer or
otherwise and taking into account all financial, regulatory, legal and other
aspects of such proposal, as the Board of Directors determines in good faith
to be relevant. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Intervening Event_ " means,
with respect to the Company, a material event, occurrence, development,
circumstance or other matter that materially alters the financial condition
or prospects of the Company and was not known to the Company or its Board of
Directors on the date of this Agreement (or if known, the consequences of
which are not known to or reasonably foreseeable by the Company or its Board
of Directors as of the date hereof), which event, occurrence, development,
circumstance or other matter, or any material consequences thereof, becomes
known to the Board of Directors prior to the Acceptance Time; provided,
however, that in no event shall the receipt, existence or terms of an
Acquisition Proposal or any matter relating thereto or consequence thereof
constitute an Intervening Event.

 

(g) _Obligation of the Company to Terminate Existing Discussions_. The Company
and its Subsidiaries (and its and their officers and directors) (i) shall,
and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and their other
Representatives to, cease immediately and cause to be terminated any and all
existing activities, discussions or negotiations, if any, with any
Third Party and its Representatives and its financing sources conducted prior
to the date hereof with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) shall
request the prompt return or destruction of all confidential information
previously furnished in connection therewith (and have such Third Party (and
its Representatives and financing sources) certify such return or destruction
to the extent required under the applicable confidentiality agreement) and
(iii) shall terminate all access of such persons to any electronic or other
data room containing information about the Company.

 



34 Section 7.04. _Compensation Arrangements_ _._ Prior to the Effective Time,
the Company (acting through its Compensation Committee of the Board of
Directors or its independent directors, to the extent required under
Applicable Law) will take all steps that may be necessary or advisable to
cause each Company Benefit Arrangement with any of its officers, directors or
employees, and each other Company Benefit Arrangement, in all such cases in
which any such Company Benefit Arrangement is amended, modified or supplement
or pursuant to which consideration is or shall be paid to such officers,
directors or employees, to satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive safe
harbor set forth in Rule 14d-10(d) of the 1934 Act; _provided_ that the
Company shall deliver to Parent drafts of all calculations,
resolutions, consents, disclosures and other documents prepared in connection
with the actions required under this Section 7.04, and provide 10 Business
Days for Parents review and comment on all such calculations, resolutions,
consents, disclosures and other documents (and the Companys acceptance of
Parents reasonable comments shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed).

 

Section 7.05. _Credit Agreement_ _._ At least one Business Day prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall deliver to Parent a copy of an executed
payoff letter with respect to (x) the Credit Agreement, in customary form,
from the administrative agent under the Credit Agreement and (y) the
Debenture, dated November 17, 1998 with Barclay Bank PLC, each of which
payoff letter shall state that (i) the Credit Agreement (or Debenture, as
applicable) and all related instruments and agreements, including any security
or pledge agreements and guarantees shall be, as of the Effective Time,
terminated and of no further force and effect and (ii) all Liens in
connection therewith relating to the assets and properties of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries securing such Credit Agreement (or Debenture, as
applicable) shall be, as of the Effective Time, released and terminated, and
the Company shall confirm it will, as of the release and termination of such
Liens, be in possession of any collateral (including the equity securities of
any Subsidiaries) previously held by the administrative or collateral agent
pursuant to the Credit Agreement or related security or pledge agreements or
pursuant to the Debenture.

 

Section 7.06. _Consents_ _._ The Company and its Subsidiaries shall, and shall
cause their Representatives, to use commercially reasonable efforts to
procure prior to the Acceptance Time such written consents as may be
reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, in form and substance reasonable acceptable to
Parent, including for each of the Contracts set forth on Section 7.06 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule; provided, however, that neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to (i) pay any consent or similar
fees or payments or (ii) agree to any materially adverse contractual
provisions, in each case, to obtain consents under any Contract unless such
action is conditioned upon the consummation of the Offer.

 

ARTICLE 8

_Covenants of Parent _

Parent agrees that:

 

Section 8.01. _Obligations of Acquisition Subsidiary_. Parent shall take all
action necessary to cause Acquisition Subsidiary to perform its obligations
under this Agreement and to consummate the Offer and the Merger on the terms
and conditions set forth in this Agreement.

 

Section 8.02. _Director and Officer Liability_. Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation, and the Surviving Corporation hereby agrees, to do the
following:

(a) For six years from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall indemnify and hold harmless the present and former officers and
directors of the Company (each, an " _Indemnified Person_ ") in respect of
acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time to the fullest
extent permitted by Delaware Law or any other Applicable Law or provided
under the Companys certificate of incorporation and bylaws in effect on the
date hereof; _provided_ that such indemnification shall be subject to any
limitation imposed from time to time under Applicable Law.

 



35 (b) For six years from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be
maintained in effect provisions in the Surviving Corporations certificate of
incorporation and bylaws (or in such documents of any successor to the
business of the Surviving Corporation) regarding elimination of liability of
directors, indemnification of officers, directors and employees and
advancement of expenses that are no less advantageous to the intended
beneficiaries than the corresponding provisions in existence on the date of
this Agreement.

 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall or, if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective
Time to, obtain and fully pay the premium for the non-cancellable extension of
the directors and officers liability coverage of the Companys existing
directors and officers insurance policies and the Companys existing
fiduciary liability insurance policies (collectively, " _D andO Insurance_"), in
each case for a claims reporting or discovery period of at least six years
from and after the Effective Time with respect to any claim related to any
period or time at or prior to the Effective Time from an insurance carrier
with the same or better credit rating as the Companys current insurance
carrier with respect to DandO Insurance with terms, conditions, retentions and
limits of liability that are no less favorable in the aggregate than the
coverage provided under the Companys existing policies with respect to any
actual or alleged error, misstatement, misleading statement, act,
omission, neglect, breach of duty or any matter claimed against a director or
officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by reason of him or her
serving in such capacity that existed or occurred at or prior to the Effective
Time (including in connection with this Agreement or the transactions or
actions contemplated hereby); _provided_ that the Company shall give Parent a
reasonable opportunity to participate in the selection of such tail policy and
the Company shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any
comments made by Parent with respect thereto. If the Company or the Surviving
Corporation for any reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, continue to maintain in effect, for a period of
at least six years from and after the Effective Time, the DandO Insurance in
place as of the date hereof with the Companys current insurance carrier or
with an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the
Companys current insurance carrier with respect to DandO Insurance with terms,
conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable in
the aggregate than the coverage provided under the Companys existing policies
as of the date hereof, or the Surviving Corporation shall purchase from the
Companys current insurance carrier or from an insurance carrier with the
same or better credit rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with
respect to DandO Insurance comparable DandO Insurance for such six-year period
with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no
less favorable in the aggregate than as provided in the Companys existing
policies as of the date hereof; _provided_ that in no event shall Parent or
the Surviving Corporation be required to expend and in no event shall the
Company spend for such policies pursuant to this sentence an annual premium
amount in excess of 300% of the amount per annum the Company paid in its last
full fiscal year, which amount is set forth in Section 8.02(c) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule; and  _provided further_ that if the aggregate premiums
of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall
be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available, with
respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time, for a cost not
exceeding such amount.

(d) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the
extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall
assume the obligations set forth in this Section 8.02.

(e) The rights of each Indemnified Person under this Section 8.02 shall be in
addition to any rights such Person may have under the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, under
Delaware Law or any other Applicable Law or under any agreement of any
Indemnified Person with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. These rights
shall survive consummation of the Merger and are intended to benefit, and
shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person.

 



36 Section 8.03. _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) During the period beginning on the Effective Time and ending on December
31, 2014, Parent shall provide to those individuals who are employed with the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries as of the Closing and for such period of
time, if any, as applicable thereafter (each, a " _Continuing Employee_ ") (i)
an annual rate of base salary (or hourly wage), and annual cash, performance-
based incentive compensation opportunity that is no less favorable in the
aggregate to each such Continuing Employee than the aggregate annual rate of
base salary (or hourly wage) and annual cash, performance-based
incentive compensation opportunity (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt,
any retention bonus compensation) provided to such Continuing Employee as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time; and (ii) employee benefits that,
taken as a whole, are no less favorable in the aggregate than those employee
benefits provided to similarly situated employees of Parent and its Affiliates
(other than such benefits provided under any equity-based plans of Parent or
its Affiliates) as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(b) Parent shall provide credit for each Continuing Employees length of
service with the Company and its Subsidiaries for purposes of eligibility,
vesting, benefit accrual and determination of the level of benefits under each
plan, program, policy or arrangement of Parent and its Affiliates that such
employees may be eligible to participate in after the Effective Time to the
same extent that such service was recognized under a similar plan, program,
policy or arrangement of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as of Closing;
_provided_ that such prior service credit shall not be required (i) to the
extent that it results in a duplication of benefits for the same period of
service, (ii) for benefit accrual purposes under any defined benefit pension
plan or (iii) for any newly established plan, program, policy or arrangement
by Parent or any of its Affiliates, for which similarly situated employees of
Parent or the applicable Affiliate do not receive past service credit.

 

(c) Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts with respect to each
benefit plan of Parent and its Affiliates in which any Continuing Employee
participates after the Effective Time that provides for medical, dental,
health, pharmaceutical or vision benefits (each, a " _Parent Welfare Plan_ ")
to (i) waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions, exclusions and
service conditions with respect to participation and coverage requirements,
other than limitations that were in effect with respect to such Continuing
Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective Time under the corresponding
Company Benefit Arrangement, (ii) honor any payments, charges and expenses of
such Continuing Employee (and his or her eligible dependents) that were
applied toward the deductible, out-of-pocket maximums and co-payments under a
Company Benefit Arrangement in satisfying any applicable deductibles, out-of-
pocket maximums and co-payments under the corresponding Parent Welfare Plan
during the same plan year in which such payments, charges and expenses were
made, and (iii) waive any waiting period limitation or evidence of
insurability requirement that would otherwise be applicable to such Continuing
Employee following the Effective Time to the extent that such Continuing
Employee had satisfied any similar limitation under the corresponding Company
Benefit Arrangement.

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions that may
be necessary to: (i) cause the exercise (as of the last Business Day prior to
the Effective Time) of each outstanding purchase right under the ESPP, and
make any pro-rata adjustments that may be necessary to reflect the shortened
offering period but otherwise cause such shortened offering period thereunder
to be treated as a fully effective and completed offering period for all
purposes under the ESPP and (ii) provide that no further offering period or
purchase period shall commence under the ESPP after the Effective Time,
_provided, however_ , that such exercise of outstanding purchase rights, and
the cessation of further offering and purchase periods, shall be conditioned
upon the consummation of the Merger. Immediately prior to and effective as of
the Effective Time (and subject to the consummation of the Merger), the
Company shall terminate the ESPP. Each Share purchased under the ESPP shall be
automatically converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration on
the same basis as all other Shares.

(e) Parent shall, or shall cause the Acquisition Subsidiary to, assume and
honor the obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries under all Company
Benefit Arrangements, in accordance with their terms, subject to the right to
make amendments or modifications to the extent permitted by such terms.

 



37 (f) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 8.03, the
provisions of Section 8.03 shall apply only with respect to Continuing
Employees who are covered under Company Benefit Arrangements that are
maintained primarily for the benefit of Continuing Employees employed in the
United States (and Continuing Employees regularly employed outside the United
States to the extent that they participate in such Company Benefit
Arrangement). With respect to Continuing Employees not described in the
preceding sentence, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries to, comply with all Applicable Laws relating to
Continuing Employees and employee benefit matters applicable to such
employees.

 

(g) This Section 8.03 shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of
each party hereto, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is
intended to or shall confer upon any other person any right, benefit or remedy
of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Section 8.03. In no event
shall the terms of this Agreement (i) be deemed to establish, amend or modify
any Company Benefit Arrangement or any other benefit plan, program, agreement
or arrangement maintained or sponsored by Parent, the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company or any of their respective Affiliates, (ii) alter,
limit or prohibit Parent or any of its Affiliates (including, after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of the Surviving
Corporation) from amending, modifying or terminating any Company Benefit
Arrangement or any other benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or
arrangement after the Effective Time to the extent expressly permitted by the
terms of such Company Benefit Arrangement, plan, program, agreement or
arrangement, or (iii) require Parent or any of its Affiliates (including,
after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of the
Surviving Corporation) to continue the employment of any Continuing Employee
for any period of time, constitute or create an employment or agreement with,
or modify the at-will status of any, employee or other service provider or,
subject to Section 8.03(a) or any applicable Company Benefit Arrangement
covering such Continuing Employee, to provide such Continuing Employee with
any payments or benefits upon any termination of such Continuing Employees
employment. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 8.03 shall be
construed to limit any obligation of Parent or any of its Affiliates
(including, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation or any
Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation) with respect to the Continuing
Employees under Applicable Law.

 

(h) Immediately following the Closing (but on the date of the Closing), if
such employment termination shall not have occurred prior thereto, Parent
shall terminate the employment of the individuals listed on Section 8.03(h) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule and shall cause the Company to pay, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds, the amounts listed on Section
8.03(h) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (such amount in the aggregate,
whether paid by the Company prior to or on the date of the Closing, the "
_Executive Termination Amount_ "), less any applicable withholding taxes, in
satisfaction of the Companys obligations pursuant to each such executives
employment agreement with the Company.

ARTICLE 9 

_Covenants of Parent and the Company_

 

The parties hereto agree that:

 

Section 9.01. _Regulatory Undertaking_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company and
Parent shall each use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable under Applicable Law to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) preparing and filing as promptly
as practicable with any Governmental Authority or other third party all
documentation to effect all necessary filings, notices, petitions, statements,
registrations, submissions of information, applications and other documents
and (ii) obtaining and maintaining all approvals, consents, registrations,

the Company shall make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report
Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby with the United States Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ") and the

_Antitrust Division_ ") as promptly as practicable and in any event within 10
Business Days of the date hereof. Each of Parent and the Company shall (i)
respond as promptly as practicable to any inquiries received from the FTC or
the Antitrust Division for additional information or documentation and to all

the Antitrust Division not to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, except with the prior written consent of the other parties
hereto. Parent shall offer to take (and if such offer is accepted, commit to

transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each party shall (i) promptly
notify the other party of any substantive communication to that party from the
FTC, the Antitrust Division, any State Attorney General, any other
Governmental Authority or a private party in respect of any filings,
investigation or inquiry concerning any competition or antitrust matters in

to Applicable Law, permit the other party and its counsel to review in
advance any proposed substantive written communication to any of the foregoing
and consider in good faith the other partys reasonable comments; (ii) not
agree to participate in any substantive meeting or discussion with any
Governmental Authority in respect of any filings, investigation or inquiry

party the opportunity to attend and participate thereat; and (iii) subject to
Applicable Law furnish the other party with copies of all correspondence,
filings, and communications (and memoranda setting forth the substance
thereof) between them and their affiliates and their respective
representatives on the one hand, and any Governmental Authority or members or
their respective staffs on the other hand, with respect to any competition or
antitrust matters in connection with this Agreement and the Merger.

44 Section 12.05. _Disclosure Schedule and SEC Document References_ _._ The

assignment shall not relieve Parent or Acquisition Subsidiary of its
obligations under the Offer, enlarge, alter or change any obligation of any
other party hereto or due to Parent or Acquisition Subsidiary or prejudice the
rights of tendering stockholders to receive payment for Shares validly
tendered and accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer. __

any of its Affiliates) shall be brought in the Delaware Chancery Court or, if
such court shall not have jurisdiction, any federal court located in the
State of Delaware or other Delaware state court, and each of the parties
hereby irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and of the
appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit, action or
proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any
objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any

action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum. Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be
served on any party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the

Agreement will affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve
process in any other manner permitted by Applicable Law.

 _CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION_

 

 _OF_

_HARRIS INTERACTIVE INC._

The undersigned, in order to form a corporation for the purpose hereinafter
stated, under and pursuant to the provisions of the General Corporation Law
of the State of Delaware, hereby certifies that:

Article I. The name of the corporation (the " _Corporation_ ") is Harris
Interactive Inc.

Article II. The address of the registered office in the State of Delaware
is: Corporation Trust Center, 1209 Orange Street, Wilmington, New Castle
County, Delaware 19801. The name of its registered agent at such address is:
The Corporation Trust Company.

 

Article III. The purpose of the Corporation is to engage in any lawful act or
activity for which corporations may be organized under the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.

Article IV. The total number of shares of all classes of stock that the
Corporation shall have authority to issue is 1,000 shares of Common Stock
having the par value of $0.01 per share.

Article V. The number of directors of the Corporation shall be fixed from
time to time by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.

Article VI. In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred upon
it by law, the Board of Directors of the Corporation is expressly authorized
to adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws of the Corporation.

 

Article VII. Unless and except to the extent that the Bylaws of the
Corporation so require, the election of directors of the Corporation need not
be by written ballot.

Article VIII. The Corporation shall indemnify each of the Corporations
directors and officers in each and every situation where, under Section 145
of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as amended from time
to time ("Section 145"), the Corporation is permitted or empowered to make
such indemnification. The Corporation may, in the sole discretion of the
Board of Directors of the Corporation, indemnify any other person who may be
indemnified pursuant to Section 145 to the extent the Board of Directors deems
advisable, as permitted by Section 145\. The Corporation shall promptly make
or cause to be made any determination required to be made pursuant to Section
145\.

No person shall be personally liable to the Corporation or its stockholders
for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, provided,
however, that the foregoing shall not eliminate or limit the liability of a
director (i) for any breach of the directors duty of loyalty to the
Corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not in good faith
or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (iii)
under Section 174 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware or
(iv) for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal
benefit. If the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware is
subsequently amended to further eliminate or limit the liability of a
director, then a director of the corporation, in addition to the circumstances
in which a director is not personally liable as set forth in the preceding
sentence, shall not be liable to the fullest extent permitted by the
amended General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. For purposes of
this Article IX, "fiduciary duty as a director" shall include any fiduciary
duty arising out of serving at the Corporations request as a director of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture or other enterprise, and
"personal liability to the corporation or its stockholders" shall include any
liability to such other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or
other enterprise, and any liability to the corporation in its capacity as a
security holder, joint venture, partner, beneficiary, creditor or investor of
or in any such other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise. Neither any amendment nor repeal of this Article IX nor the adoption of any
provision of this Certificate of Incorporation inconsistent with this Article
IX, shall eliminate or reduce the effect of this Article IX in respect of any
matter occurring, or any cause of action, suit or claim that, but for this
Article IX, would accrue or arise, prior to such amendment, repeal or
adoption of an inconsistent provision.

respect of any act or omission occurring prior to the time of such repeal or
modification.
