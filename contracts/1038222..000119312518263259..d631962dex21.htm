ARTICLE I

THE OFFER AND THE MERGER

Section 1.1 _The Offer_.

 

(a) _Commencement of the Offer_. Provided that this Agreement shall not have
been terminated in accordance with Article VII, and subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, as promptly as practicable but in no event later
than ten (10) Business Days after the date of this Agreement, Merger Sub
shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, commence (within the meaning of
Rule 14d-2 promulgated by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission
(the "SEC") under the Exchange Act) the Offer.

 

(b) _Terms and Conditions of the Offer_. The obligations of Merger Sub to, and
of Parent to cause Merger Sub to, accept for payment, and pay for, any shares
of Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer are subject only to the
satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted under this Agreement) of the
conditions set forth in _Exhibit A_ (as they may be amended in
accordance with this Agreement, the "Offer Conditions"). Merger Sub expressly
reserves the right to waive any Offer Condition or modify the terms of the
Offer, except that, without the prior written consent of the Company, Merger
Sub shall not (i) reduce the number of shares of Common Stock subject to the
Offer, (ii) reduce the Offer Price (except to the extent required pursuant to
Section 1.1(e)), (iii) change, modify or waive the Minimum Tender
Condition, (iv) impose any condition to the Offer in addition to the Offer
Conditions, (v) extend

or otherwise change the expiration date of the Offer (except as required or
permitted by the provisions of Section 1.1(c)), (vi) change the form of
consideration payable in the Offer, or (vii) otherwise amend, modify or
supplement any of the other terms of the Offer in any manner adverse to the
Company or the holders of Common Stock.

 

(c) _Expiration and Extension of the Offer_. The initial expiration date of
the Offer shall be 11:59 PM (New York City time) on the twentieth (20th)
Business Day (determined using Rule 14d-1(g)(3) promulgated under the Exchange
Act) following the commencement of the Offer (within the meaning of
Rule 14d-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act). Subject to the parties
respective termination rights under Article VII, Merger Sub shall (and Parent
shall cause Merger Sub to) (i) extend the Offer for the minimum period
required by any applicable Law, interpretation or position of the SEC or the
staff thereof applicable to the Offer and (ii) if, on the initial expiration
date or any subsequent date as of which the Offer is scheduled to expire, any
Offer Condition shall not have been satisfied or waived (if permitted
hereunder), extend the Offer on one or more occasions in consecutive
increments of up to ten (10) Business Days each (or such longer period as the
parties hereto may agree) until the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms; provided, however, that Merger Sub shall not be

paid, shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to
the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

(g) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares for any amount properly paid to a public official under

paper obligations of issuers organized under the Law of a state of the United
States of America, rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service,
Inc. or Standard and Poors Ratings Service, respectively, in certificates of
deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial

complied with this Article II shall look only to Parent, which shall remain
responsible for payment of the applicable Merger Consideration, subject to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any amounts remaining
unclaimed by such holders at such time at which such amounts would otherwise
escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority shall become, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, the property of the Surviving
Corporation or its designee, free and clear of all claims or interest of any
Person previously entitled thereto.

Section 2.3 _Company Equity Awards_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, each option to acquire shares of Common Stock

Effective Time and without any action by Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or
the holder of that Company Option, shall be canceled, and each Company Option
with an exercise price that is less than the Merger Consideration shall be
converted into the right to receive from the Surviving Corporation an amount
in cash, without interest, equal to the Option Consideration (as defined
below) multiplied by the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock that may
be acquired upon exercise of such Company Option whether or not then
exercisable or vested, immediately before the Effective Time. "Option
Consideration" means the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the
per share exercise or purchase price of the applicable Company Option. For the
avoidance of doubt, at the Effective Time, each Company Option with an
exercise price that is more than the Merger Consideration outstanding

Option, shall be canceled without consideration.

the "Company Equity Awards") outstanding immediately before the Effective
Time, by virtue of the occurrence of the Effective Time and without any
action by Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder of that Company RSU,
shall be, to the extent not already vested, vested and each Company RSU shall
be canceled and converted into the right to receive from the Surviving
Corporation an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the Merger
Consideration multiplied by the number of shares of Common Stock underlying
such Company RSUs.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary
to effect the provisions of Section 2.3(a) and Section 2.3(b), including
providing any notices, and using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
from holders of Company Options surrender agreements, in each case that are
reasonably determined by the Company or Parent in good faith to be necessary
in connection therewith. The Company shall provide Parent with drafts of, and
a reasonable opportunity to comment on, all resolutions and other written
actions as may be required to give effect to the provisions of Section 2.3(a)
and Section 2.3(b).

 

(d) Promptly following the Effective Time (and in any event not later than the
first payroll date thereafter), the Surviving Corporation shall pay to each
applicable holder of a Company Equity Award the amount due and payable to such
holder pursuant to this Section 2.3. Any such amounts may, at Parents
election, be made through the Surviving Corporations payroll system, through
the Paying Agent or otherwise.

Section 2.4 _No Dissenters_ __ _or Appraisal Rights_. No dissenters or
appraisal rights or rights of an objecting stockholder shall be available with

which such statements were made, not misleading in any material respect. As

reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and is
accumulated and communicated to the Companys management as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. To the Knowledge of

independent registered accountant has identified or been made aware of: (i)
any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
operation of internal controls over financial reporting, and (ii) any fraud,

Action) that would have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company

a favorable determination letter or opinion has been issued by the IRS with
respect to such qualification, and (ii) to the Knowledge of the Company, no
event has occurred since the date of such letter or opinion that would
adversely affect such qualification. All contributions required to be made to
each Company Benefit Plan, and all payments required to be made pursuant to

group health plan continuation Law, the cost of which is fully paid by such
current or former employees or their dependents.

 

(g) Except as set forth in this Agreement, the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions will not (either alone or
in combination with another event) (i) result in any payment or benefit from

any compensation due, to any current or former employee, officer, director,

benefits otherwise payable under any Company Benefit Plan or otherwise payable
from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any current or former

paid or payable pursuant to each Company Benefit Plan subject to Section 409A
of the Code is not includible in the gross income of a service provider
(within the meaning of Section 409A) until received by the service provider
and is not subject to interest or the additional tax imposed by Section 409A
of the Code. The per share exercise price of each Company Option is not less
than fair market value of a share of Common Stock on the date of grant of such
Company Option determined in a manner consistent with Section 409A of the
Code.

 

(j) There is no Contract, agreement, arrangement or policy to which the
Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates is a party, or by which it is bound,
to compensate any current or former employee of the Company or any Company

such Takeover Proposal to clarify the terms of such Takeover Proposal, and
(ii) if the Company Board determines, after consultation with outside legal

Companys Directors, under applicable Law, then

 



40

    

 the Company may, in response to such Takeover Proposal, (x) furnish access
and non-public information with respect to the Company and any of
its Subsidiaries to the Person or Persons who has made such Takeover Proposal

any event within twenty-four (24) hours) with the time it is provided to such
Person or Persons (or any of their potential sources of funding), and (y)
participate or engage in discussions and negotiations regarding such Takeover
Proposal. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
Company Board shall be permitted, to the extent it determines, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action
would be inconsistent with the duties of the Companys Directors under
applicable Law, to modify, waive, amend, release or fail to enforce any
existing standstill or similar obligations owed by any Person to the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

(c) From and after the date of this Agreement, the Company shall promptly (but
in any event within the earlier of one (1) Business Day and forty-eight (48)

Parent may make an additional request after any material change in the terms
of, or upon the public announcement of the satisfaction or fulfillment of a
material condition to, such Takeover Proposal), or (vi) fail to recommend
against any Takeover Proposal that is a tender offer or exchange offer subject
to Regulation 14D under the Exchange Act within ten (10) Business Days after

(e) Notwithstanding Section 5.4(d), if the Company or the Company Board
receives, after the date of this Agreement and at any time prior to the
Acceptance Time, a _bona fide_ written Takeover Proposal that did not result
from a breach of this Section 5.4, and the Company Board determines in good
faith (i) after consultation with Companys outside legal and financial
advisors that such Takeover Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and (ii)
after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel, that in light of
such Takeover Proposal, a failure to take such actions would be inconsistent
with the duties of the Companys Directors under applicable Law, the Company
Board may terminate this Agreement to enter into a Contract with respect to
such Superior Proposal or make an Adverse Recommendation Change, but only
if: 

 



41

    

(i) the Company shall have first provided written notice to Parent at least
four (4) Business Days prior to any such proposed termination that it is
prepared to terminate this Agreement to enter into a Contract with respect to
a Superior Proposal, which notice shall include the material terms and
conditions of the transaction that constitutes such Superior Proposal and the
identity of the party making such Superior Proposal, and shall, if requested
by Parent, have negotiated with Parent in good faith during such four (4)
Business Day period regarding modifications of the terms and conditions of
this Agreement proposed by Parent so that such Superior Proposal is no longer
a Superior Proposal; and

 

(ii) Parent does not make, within four (4) Business Days after the receipt of
such notice (it being understood and agreed that any material change to the
financial or other material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal
shall require an additional notice to Parent and a new two (2) Business Day
period), a binding and irrevocable written and complete proposal that the
Company Board determines, after consultation with its financial advisor and
outside legal counsel, causes the Takeover Proposal that constituted a
Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, at any time
before the Acceptance Time, the Company Board may make an
Adverse Recommendation Change if, in response to an Intervening Event, (i)
the Company Board has concluded, following consultation with its outside legal
counsel, that its failure to make such Adverse Recommendation Change would be
inconsistent with the duties of the Companys Directors under applicable Law
and (ii) at least four (4) Business Days prior to such Adverse Recommendation
Change, the Company shall have provided to Parent notice stating that an
Intervening Event has occurred and describing such Intervening Event and, if
requested by Parent, negotiated in good faith with Parent during such four (4)

complying with Rules 14d-9, 14e-2 and Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A
promulgated under the Exchange Act, or from issuing a "stop, look and listen"
statement pending disclosure of its position thereunder, provided that the
Company Board shall not make any Adverse Recommendation Change except in
accordance with Section 5.4(e) and Section 5.4(f).

 

(h) Neither Parent nor Merger Sub, nor any of their respective Affiliates or
Representatives shall propose or enter into any formal or informal
arrangements or understandings (whether or not binding) with any Person making
a Takeover Proposal (other than Representatives of Parent) with respect to any
Takeover Proposal involving the Company.

2018 performance year, payable at the same time as the Company AIP bonuses
are paid to other eligible employees in respect of the 2018 performance year,
with such prorated bonus in an amount equal to (i) that amount, if any, to
which the Continuing Employee would have otherwise been entitled had the
Continuing Employee remained an active employee as of December 31, 2018,
multiplied by (ii) the fraction the numerator of which is the number of days
the Continuing Employee was actively employed in 2018 and the denominator of
which is 365.

(d) With respect to any employee benefit plan or arrangement of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation and their respective Affiliates, including severance
and vacation or other paid-time off benefits made available to any Continuing
Employee after the Effective Time (other than any defined benefit pension plan
and any equity plan) (the "New Plans"), Parent shall provide that (i) each
Continuing Employee shall receive credit for such Continuing Employees years
of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries before the Effective Time
(including predecessor or acquired entities or any other entities) for
purposes of eligibility to participate in and vesting thereunder (but not
benefit accrual) (except to the extent such credit would result in a
duplication of accrual of benefits or with respect to New Plans created after
the Effective Time for which similarly situated employees of Parent or the
applicable Affiliate do not receive past service credit), (ii) to the extent
commercially practicable, at the Effective Time, any waiting time limitation
in any New Plan is waived to the extent such waiting time was satisfied under
the similar or comparable Company Benefit Plan in which such Continuing
Employee participated immediately before the Effective Time (such
plans, collectively, the "Old Plans"), and (iii) to the extent commercially
practicable, all pre-existing condition exclusions or limitations and
actively-at-work requirements of each New Plan be waived or satisfied for such
Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents to the extent waived or
satisfied under the analogous Old Plan as of the Effective Time.

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take such corporate actions
and issue such participant communications as reasonably necessary to
terminate in accordance with its terms and applicable Law the Reis Services,
LLC 401(k) Plan (the "Company 401(k) Plan"), effective as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time and contingent upon the Effective Time occurring.
Following the Effective Time, the Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, (i) take such actions as reasonably necessary to complete the
distribution of the assets of the Company 401(k) Plan to participants in
accordance with its terms and applicable Law; and (ii) shall take such actions
as may be necessary to cause a New Plan that is a qualified retirement plan
with a 401(k) deferral feature (the "Parent 401(k) Plan") to allow each
Continuing Employee who receives a distribution from the Company 401(k) Plan
to make a "direct rollover" to the Parent 401(k) Plan of the account balances
of the Continuing Employee (including promissory notes evidencing any
outstanding loans to the extent reasonably practicable) under the Company
401(k) Plan if such direct rollover is elected by the Continuing Employee in
accordance with applicable Law. As soon as reasonably practicable following
the Effective Time, Parent will provide information to Continuing Employees
regarding their eligibility to participate in the Parent 401(k) Plan on the
same terms and conditions as similarly situated employees of Parent, taking
into account each Continuing Employees length of service with the Company in
accordance with Section 5.5(d). Prior to the Closing, the Company shall
provide Parent with evidence that the Company Board has adopted resolutions
for the termination of the Company 401(k) Plan as contemplated hereby.

(f) This Section 5.5 is solely for the benefit of the parties to this
Agreement, and nothing in this Section 5.5, whether express or implied, shall
confer upon any current or former employee, officer, director, or consultant
of the Company, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Affiliates or any beneficiary or dependent thereof, any rights or remedies,
including any right to employment or continued employment for any specified
period, of any nature or kind whatsoever. No provision of this Section 5.5 is
intended to modify, amend or create any employee benefit plan of the Company,
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates.

Section 5.6 _Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __ _ Indemnification and
Insurance_.

(a) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cause all rights to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation now existing in
favor of any present or former director, officer or employee of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries (the "Indemnified Parties") as provided in (i) the
Company Organizational Documents or (ii) agreements between an Indemnified
Party and the Company or one of its Subsidiaries (in effect as of the date of
this Agreement) to survive the Merger and to continue in full force and effect
for a period of not less than six (6) years (plus ninety (90) days) after the
Effective Time or, if longer, for such period as is set forth in any
applicable agreement with an Indemnified Party in effect as of the date of
this Agreement.

 

(b) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to indemnify all Indemnified
Parties to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law with respect to all
acts and omissions arising out of or relating to their services as directors,
officers or employees of the Company, its Subsidiaries or another Person, if
such Indemnified Party is or was serving as a director, officer or employee
of such other Person at the request of the Company, whether asserted or
claimed before, at or after, or occurring before or at, the Effective Time
(including in connection with the negotiation and execution of this Agreement
and the consummation of the Transactions or otherwise). If any Indemnified
Party is or becomes involved in any Legal Action in connection with any matter
subject to indemnification hereunder, then Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to advance as incurred any costs or expenses (including legal
fees and disbursements), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or
Liabilities ("Damages") arising out of or incurred in connection with such
Legal Action, subject to the Surviving Corporations receipt of an
undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnified Party, if required by the
MGCL, to repay such Damages if it is ultimately determined under applicable
Law that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified. In the
event of any such Legal Action, (i) each of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall cooperate with the Indemnified Party in the defense of any
such Legal Action and (ii) neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall
settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment, in each case on
behalf of an Indemnified Party, in any Legal Action pending or threatened in
writing to which an Indemnified Party is a party (and in respect of which
indemnification could be sought by such Indemnified Party hereunder), unless
such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of
such Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such Legal Action.

 

(c) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, jointly and severally,
maintain in effect for at least six (6) years after the Effective Time the
current policies of directors and officers liability insurance maintained by
the Company or policies of at least the same coverage and amounts containing
terms and conditions that are no less advantageous with respect to
claims arising out of or relating to events which occurred before or at the
Effective Time (including in connection with the negotiation and execution of
this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions or otherwise) so long
as Parent and the Surviving Corporation are not required to pay an annual
premium in excess of 350% of the last annual premium paid by the Company for
such insurance before the date of this Agreement (such 350% amount being the
"Maximum Premium"). If Parent or the Surviving Corporation are unable to
obtain the insurance described in the prior sentence for an amount less than
or equal to the Maximum Premium, then Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall, jointly and severally, instead obtain as much comparable insurance as
possible for an annual premium equal to the Maximum Premium. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in lieu of the arrangements contemplated by this Section
5.6(c), before the Effective Time, the Company shall be entitled to purchase
a "tail" directors and officers liability insurance policy covering the
matters described in this Section 5.6(c) and, if the Company elects to
purchase such a policy before the Effective Time, then Parent and the
Surviving Corporations obligations under this Section 5.6(c) shall be
satisfied so long as Parent and the Surviving Corporation cause such policy to
be maintained in effect for a period of six (6) years following the
Effective Time; provided, that the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to apply any returned premium received by the Company in connection
with the Companys current policies of directors and officers liability
insurance as a result of the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement to
the cost of such "tail" policy.

 



45

    

(d) The covenants contained in this Section 5.6 are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and
their respective heirs and legal representatives and shall not be deemed
exclusive of any other rights to which an Indemnified Party is entitled,
whether pursuant to Law, Contract or otherwise.

(e) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall take all necessary
action so that the successors or assigns of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall succeed to the obligations set forth in this Section 5.6.

Section 5.7 _Reasonable Best Efforts_. Upon the other terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement (including in Section 5.8) and in
accordance with applicable Law, each of the parties to this Agreement shall,
and shall cause its Affiliates to, use reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to ensure that the Offer Conditions and the
conditions set forth in Article VI are satisfied and to consummate the
Transactions as promptly as practicable.

 

Section 5.8 _Consents; Filings; Further Action_.

terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and in accordance with
applicable Law, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to as promptly as practicable, (i) obtain any
consents, approvals or other authorizations, and make any filings and
notifications, required in connection with the Transactions, and (ii) make
any other submissions either required or reasonably deemed appropriate by
Parent or the Company in connection with the Transactions, under the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the HSR Act, the MGCL, the Applicable
Exchange rules and regulations and any other applicable Law. Parent and the
Company shall cooperate and consult with each other in connection with the
making of all such filings and notifications, including by providing copies
of all relevant documents (except to the extent containing confidential
information of such party) to the non-filing party and its Representatives
before filing.

 



46

    

(b) Parent and the Company shall as promptly as practicable, but in any event
within ten (10) Business Days following the execution and delivery hereof,
file or cause to be filed with the United States Federal Trade Commission (the
"FTC") and the United States Department of Justice (the "DOJ")
the notification and report forms required for the Transactions (which such
filings shall request early termination of the applicable waiting period under
the HSR Act) and promptly file or cause to be filed any supplemental
information requested in connection therewith pursuant to the HSR Act. Parent
and the Company shall furnish to the other such necessary information and
reasonable assistance as the other may request in connection with its
preparation of any filing that is necessary under the HSR Act.

(c) Parent and the Company shall keep the other apprised of the status of any
communications with, and any inquiries or requests for additional information
from the FTC, the DOJ, or any other Governmental Authority and shall comply as
promptly as practicable with any such inquiry or request and provide any
supplemental information requested in connection with the filings made
hereunder pursuant to the HSR Act or any other applicable Law. No party shall
participate in any meeting or engage in any material substantive conversation
with any Governmental Authority without giving the other party prior notice
of the meeting or conversation and the opportunity to participate in such
meeting or conversation. No party shall agree to extend any waiting period
under the HSR Act or enter into any agreement with any Governmental Authority
not to consummate the Transactions, except with the prior written consent of
the other party. Subject to applicable Law, Parent and the Company shall (i)
discuss with and permit the other party (and its counsel) to review in
advance, and consider in good faith the other partys reasonable comments in
connection with, any proposed filing or communication to the FTC, the DOJ, or
any other Governmental Authority or, in connection with any proceeding by a
private party to any other Person, relating to any filing, investigation,
inquiry or other Legal Action in connection with the Transactions, and (ii)
furnish the other party promptly with copies of all correspondence, filings
and communications relating to filing, investigation, inquiry or other Legal
Action between them and their Affiliates and their respective Representatives
on the one hand, and the FTC, the DOJ, or any other Governmental Authority or
members of their respective staffs on the other hand, with respect to
this Agreement or the Transactions, _provided_ __ that such materials may be
redacted (x) to remove references concerning the valuation of the Company, (y)
as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements and (z) as necessary to
address reasonable attorney-client or other privilege or confidentiality
concerns.

(d) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, but subject to the
proviso below, Parent shall take steps necessary to (i) resolve, avoid, or
eliminate impediments or objections, if any, that may be asserted with respect
to the Transactions by any Governmental Authority, and (ii) vigorously
contest (including by means of litigation) (x) any Legal Action or
investigation brought, or threatened to be brought, by any Governmental
Authority or any other Person seeking to enjoin, restrain, prevent, prohibit
or make illegal the consummation of any of the Transactions or seeking
damages or to impose any terms or conditions in connection with the
Transactions, and (y) any Order that enjoins, restrains, prevents, prohibits
or makes illegal the consummation of any of the Transactions or imposes any
damages, terms or conditions in

 



47

    

 connection with the Transactions. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and Affiliates to,
(A) propose, negotiate, commit to and effect, by consent decree, hold
separate orders or otherwise, the sale, divesture, disposition, license of any
assets, properties, businesses, products, product lines, rights, or services
of Parent and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates, or the Company and its
Subsidiaries or any interest or interests therein, and (B) otherwise take or
commit to take actions that after the Closing would limit Parents or its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates freedom of action with respect to, or its or
their ability to retain, one or more of the assets, properties, businesses,
product lines, relationships or services of Parent and its Subsidiaries and
Affiliates, the Company and its Subsidiaries or any interest or interests
therein, in each case of (A) and (B) to obtain any clearance required under
the HSR Act or any other approval, consent or authorization necessary under
applicable Law for the consummation of the Transactions; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any such action in each case of (A) and (B), (i) shall be
conditioned upon the consummation of the Transactions and (ii) would not, or
would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, (x)
have a material adverse effect on the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole, or Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (with materiality
being measured based on the size of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole) or (y) materially impair the overall benefits reasonably expected to
be realized by Parent from the consummation of the Transactions, taking into
account, among other things, effects on the assets, business and operations
and relationships of both Parent and its Subsidiaries and of the Company and
its Subsidiaries (with materiality being measured based on the size of the
Company and its Subsidiaries).

(e) Parent shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, acquire or agree
to acquire by merging or consolidating with, or by purchasing a substantial
portion of the assets of or equity in, any Person, or otherwise acquire or
agree to acquire any assets, if the entering into of a definitive agreement
relating to or the consummation of such acquisition, merger or consolidation
would reasonably be expected to (i) impose any material delay in the obtaining
of, or materially increase the risk of not obtaining, any authorizations,
consents, orders, declarations or approvals of any Governmental Authority
necessary to consummate the Transactions or the expiration or termination of
any applicable waiting period, (ii) materially increase the risk of any
Governmental Authority entering an order prohibiting the consummation of the
Transactions, or (iii) materially delay the consummation of the Transactions.

 

(f) The Company shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (i) take all
actions necessary so that no Takeover Law becomes applicable to the
Transactions and (ii) if any such Takeover Law becomes applicable to the
Transactions, take all actions necessary so that the Transactions may be
consummated as promptly as practicable.

 

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, but
subject to Parents obligations set forth in this Section 5.8, Parent,
following consultation with the Company and after giving due consideration to
its views and acting reasonably and in good faith, shall have the right to
direct all matters with respect to any Governmental Authority in connection
with obtaining any necessary consents, clearances or approvals under Antitrust
Laws (including the HSR Act) consistent with its obligations hereunder, and
shall have the principal responsibility for devising and implementing the
strategy for, obtaining any consents, clearances or approvals under Antitrust
Laws (including the HSR Act), and shall take the lead in all meetings and
communications with any Governmental Authority in connection with obtaining
any necessary consents, clearances or approvals under Antitrust Laws
(including the HSR Act).

or required by applicable Law, Parent and the Company shall consult with each
other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public
statements (including via social media) about this Agreement or any of the
Transactions. Neither Parent nor the Company, nor any of their respective
Subsidiaries, shall issue any such press release or make any such public
statement prior to such consultation, except to the extent required by
applicable Law or the Applicable Exchange requirements (or, with respect to
Parent or Merger Sub, the New York Stock Exchange requirements), in which case
that party shall use its reasonable best efforts to provide an opportunity
(reasonable under the circumstances) to the other party to review and
comment upon such press release or other public statement, to consult with
the other party before issuing any such release or making any such public
statement and shall give due consideration to all reasonable additions,
deletions or changes suggested thereto; _provided_ that the Company shall not
be required to consult with the other party or provide any such review or
comment to the other party in connection with any disclosure contemplated by
Section 5.4 or any disclosure relating to any Takeover Proposal or Adverse
Recommendation Change. Nothing in this Section 5.9 shall limit the ability of
any party to make additional disclosures that are consistent in all but _de
minimis_ respects with the prior public disclosures regarding the
Transactions so long as such disclosures are still accurate.

Section 5.10 _Fees and Expenses_. Except as explicitly provided otherwise in
this Agreement, whether or not the Transactions are consummated, all expenses
(including those payable to Representatives) incurred by any party to this
Agreement or on its behalf in connection with this Agreement and the
Transactions ("Expenses") shall be paid by the party incurring those Expenses;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall pay any applicable filing fees
under the HSR Act in connection with the Transactions.

 

Section 5.11 _Section_ __ _ 16b-_ _3_. Prior to the Acceptance Time, the
Company shall (and shall be permitted to) take such steps as may be
reasonably required to cause dispositions of the Companys equity securities
(including derivative securities) pursuant to the Transactions by each
individual who is a director or officer of the Company to be exempt under
Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

Section 5.12 _Compensation Arrangements_. Prior to the Acceptance Time, the
Company (acting through the Compensation Committee of the Company Board or its
independent directors, to the extent required under applicable Law) will take
all steps that may be necessary or advisable to cause all amounts payable to
holders of Company Equity Awards granted or issued under a Company Benefit
Plan, in all such cases in which any such Company Benefit Plan is amended,
modified or supplemented or pursuant to which consideration is or shall be
paid to such holder, to satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive safe
harbor set forth in Rule 14d-10(d) of the Exchange Act. The Company shall

to the Leases set forth on Section 5.14 of the Company Disclosure Letter to
use commercially reasonable efforts (without being required to make any
payment) to obtain prior to the Closing an estoppel certificate duly executed
by each applicable landlord or sublandlord under each such
Lease substantially in the form of _Exhibit B_ or such other form as each
applicable landlord or sublandlord is required to provide pursuant to the
terms of the applicable Lease; provided that for the avoidance of doubt and
without limiting the Companys obligation to cause its Subsidiaries to use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain prior to the Closing the estoppels
contemplated by this Section 5.14, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree
that obtaining any such estoppel certificates prior to the expiration of the
Offer or the Closing is not, and shall not be deemed to be, condition to the
Offer or the Closing.

 

Section 5.15 _Director Resignations_. The Company shall cause to be delivered
to Parent resignations executed by each director of the Company in office as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time and effective upon the Effective
Time.

Company Credit Agreement (the "Payoff Letter"). The Payoff Letter shall (i)
indicate the total amount required to be paid to fully satisfy all principal,
interest, prepayment premiums, penalties, breakage costs and any other
monetary obligations then due and payable under the Company Credit Agreement

state that upon receipt of the Payoff Amount under the Payoff Letter, the
Company Credit Agreement and all related loan documents shall be terminated
(but excluding any contingent obligations, including, without
limitation, indemnification obligations, that in any such case are not then
due and payable and that by their terms are to survive the termination of the
Company Credit Agreement and the related loan documents), and (iii) provide
that all Liens and all guarantees in connection therewith relating to the
assets and properties of the Company, any parent company of the Company or any
of its subsidiaries securing such obligations shall be, released and
terminated upon the payment of each Payoff Amount on the Closing Date
(subject to delivery of funds as arranged by the Company and the filling of
appropriate UCC-3 termination statements and other termination filings as
arranged by the Company).

 



50

or prior to the third (3rd) Business Day prior to the Closing Date.

Section 5.17 _Financing_. Parent shall keep the Company informed on
a reasonably current basis of the status of the obtaining of funds necessary

severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions of this
Agreement. If any provision of this Agreement, or the application of that
provision to any Person or any circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable,
then (a) a suitable and equitable provision shall be substituted for that
provision in order to carry out, so far as may be valid and enforceable, the
intent and purpose of the invalid or unenforceable provision, and (b) the
remainder of this Agreement and the application of that provision to other
Persons or circumstances shall not be affected by such invalidity or
unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or unenforceability affect the
validity or enforceability of that provision, or the application of that
provision, in any other jurisdiction.

Section 8.12 _Rules of Construction_. The parties have participated jointly
in negotiating and drafting this Agreement. If an ambiguity or a question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if
drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof
shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of
any provision of this Agreement. Subject to and without limiting the
introductory language to Article III, the Company has or may have set forth
information in the Company Disclosure Letter in a section of such disclosure
letter that corresponds to the section of this Agreement to which it relates.
The fact that any item of information is disclosed in the Company Disclosure
Letter shall not constitute an admission by such party that such item is
material, that such item has had or would have a Company Material Adverse
Effect or that the disclosure of such be construed to mean that such
information is required to be disclosed by this Agreement.

 

Section 8.13 _Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall
inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their permitted successors and
assigns. No party to this Agreement may assign or delegate, by operation of
law or otherwise, all or any portion of its rights or liabilities under this
Agreement without the prior written consent of the other parties to this
Agreement, which any such party may withhold in its absolute discretion. Any
purported assignment without such prior written consents shall be void.

Section 8.14 _Specific Performance_. The parties to this Agreement agree
that irreparable damage would occur if any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties to this
Agreement shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the Chosen Courts, this being in
addition to any other remedy at law or in equity, and the parties to this
Agreement hereby waive any requirement for the posting of any bond or similar
collateral in connection therewith. Each party hereto agrees that it will not
oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and
other equitable relief on the basis that or otherwise assert that (a) the
other party has an adequate remedy at law or (b) an award of specific
performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity.

 

Section 8.15 _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be executed in
any number of counterparts, as if the signatures to each counterpart were
upon a single instrument, and all such counterparts together shall be deemed
an original of this Agreement. Facsimile signatures or signatures received as
a pdf attachment to electronic mail shall be treated as original signatures
for all purposes of this Agreement. This Agreement shall become effective
when, and only when, each party hereto shall have received a counterpart
signed by all of the other parties hereto.
