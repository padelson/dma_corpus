 _EXECUTION COPY_

 

GUARANTEE

 

GUARANTEE, dated as of December 1, 2015 (this " _Guarantee_ "), by Beijing
E-Town International Investment and Development Co., Ltd. (the " _Guarantor_ ")
in favor of Mattson Technology, Inc. (the " _Guaranteed Party_ "). Capitalized
terms used but not defined herein shall have the meaning ascribed to them in
the Merger Agreement (as defined below).

1\. _GUARANTEE_. To induce the Guaranteed Party to enter into an Agreement and
Plan of Merger, dated as of the date hereof (as amended, restated,
supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the " _Merger Agreement_
") by and among Beijing E-Town Dragon Semiconductor Industry Investment Center
(Limited Partnership) (" _Parent_ "), a directly or indirectly wholly-owned
subsidiary of Parent which will be established promptly following the date
hereof (" _Acquisition Sub_ "), and the Guaranteed Party, pursuant to which
Acquisition Sub will merge with and into the Guaranteed Party (the " _Merger_
"), the Guarantor, intending to be legally bound, hereby absolutely,
irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees to the Guaranteed Party (a) the
full and complete performance of all of the respective obligations of Parent
and Acquisition Sub under the Merger Agreement and any document, instrument or
other agreement among the Guaranteed Party, on the one hand, and Parent or
Acquisition Sub, on the other, contemplated by or referred to in the Merger
Agreement (each such document a " _Transaction Document_ " and, collectively,
the " _Transaction Documents_ ") and (b) the full, due and punctual payment as
and when due of the payment obligations of Parent and Acquisition Sub under
the Merger Agreement and any other Transaction Document (the " _Obligations_
"). All payments hereunder shall be made in lawful money of the United States,
in immediately available funds. The Guarantor promises and undertakes to make
all payments hereunder free and clear of any deduction, offset, defense, claim
or counterclaim of any kind. If Parent or Acquisition Sub fails to pay or
perform the Obligations when due, then the Guarantors liabilities to the
Guaranteed Party hereunder in respect of such Obligations shall, at the
Guaranteed Partys option, become immediately due and payable and the
Guaranteed Party may at any time and from time to time, at the Guaranteed
Partys option, take any and all actions available hereunder or under
applicable law to collect or perform the Obligations from the Guarantor. In
furtherance of the foregoing, the Guarantor acknowledges that the
Guaranteed Party may, in its sole discretion, bring and prosecute a separate
action or actions against the Guarantor for the full amount or performance of
the Obligations, regardless of whether any action is brought against Parent or
Acquisition Sub. The Guarantor agrees to pay on demand all reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses of
counsel) incurred by the Guaranteed Party in connection with enforcement of
its rights hereunder.

 

2\. _CHANGES IN OBLIGATION, CERTAIN WAIVERS_. The Guarantor agrees that the
Guaranteed Party may, in its sole discretion, at any time and from time to
time, without notice to or further consent of the Guarantor, extend the time
of payment of the Obligations, and may also make any agreement with Parent or
Acquisition Sub for the extension or renewal thereof, in whole or in part,
without in any way impairing or affecting the Guarantors obligations under
this Guarantee or affecting the validity or enforceability of this Guarantee.
The Guarantor agrees that the obligations of the Guarantor hereunder shall not
be released or discharged, in whole or in part, or otherwise affected by (a)
the failure or delay on the part of the Guaranteed Party to assert any claim
or demand or to enforce any right or remedy against Parent or Acquisition Sub;
(b) any change in the time, place or manner of payment of the Obligations or
any rescission, waiver, compromise, consolidation  or other amendment or modification of any of the terms or provisions of the
Merger Agreement made in accordance with the terms of Section 10.13
(Amendment) or Section 10.14 (Extension; Waiver) thereof or any agreement
evidencing, securing or otherwise executed in connection with the Obligations;
(c) the addition, substitution or release of any entity or other Person
interested in the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; (d) any
change in the corporate existence, structure or ownership of Parent,
Acquisition Sub or any other Person interested in the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement; (e) any insolvency, bankruptcy,
reorganization or other similar proceeding affecting Parent, Acquisition Sub
or any other Person interested in the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement; (f) the existence of any claim, set-off or other right which the
Guarantor may have at any time against Parent, Acquisition Sub or the
Guaranteed Party or any of their respective Affiliates, whether in connection
with the Obligations or otherwise except as provided herein; (g) the adequacy
of any other means the Guaranteed Party may have of obtaining payment related
to the Obligations; or (h) any discharge of the Guarantor as a matter of
applicable law or any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a
legal or equitable discharge or defense of a guarantor (other than as a
result of, and to the extent of, full payment and performance of the
Obligations in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement). To the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Guarantor hereby expressly
waives any and all rights or defenses arising by reason of any applicable law
which would otherwise require any election of remedies by the Guaranteed
Party. The Guarantor waives promptness, diligence, notice of the acceptance of
this Guarantee and of the Obligations, presentment, demand for payment,
notice of non-performance, default, dishonor and protest, notice of the
Obligations incurred and all other notices of any kind (other than notices
expressly required to be provided to Parent or Acquisition Sub pursuant to
the Merger Agreement), all defenses which may be available by virtue of any
valuation, stay, moratorium law or other similar law now or hereafter in
effect, any right to require the marshalling of assets of Parent or
Acquisition Sub or any other Person interested in the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and all suretyship defenses generally
(other than defenses to the performance or payment of the Obligations (x) that
are available to Parent or Acquisition Sub under the Merger Agreement, (y) in
respect of a breach by the Guaranteed Party of this Guarantee or (z) in
respect of fraud of the Guaranteed Party or any of its Affiliates in
connection with the Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated
thereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that Guarantor may not assert defenses that
Parent or Acquisition Sub possess relating to (i) lack of validity or
enforceability of the Merger Agreement or any other Transaction
Document against Parent or Acquisition Sub, as applicable, arising from
Parent or Acquisition Subs, as applicable, defective incorporation or lack of
qualification to do business in any applicable jurisdiction, (ii) Parents or
Acquisition Subs lack of corporate authority to enter into or perform the
Merger Agreement or any other Transaction Document or the due execution and
delivery thereof, or (iii) the termination of existence, dissolution,
liquidation, insolvency, bankruptcy, receivership, or other reorganization of
Parent or Acquisition Sub, as applicable). The Guarantor acknowledges that it
will receive substantial direct and indirect benefits from the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement and that the waivers set forth in this
Guarantee are knowingly made in contemplation of such benefits. Subject to the
Guaranteed Partys rights set forth in Section 10.8 of the Merger Agreement,
the Guaranteed Party hereby covenants and agrees that it shall not institute,
and shall cause its respective Affiliates not to institute, any proceeding or
bring any other claim arising under, or in connection with, the Merger
Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby, against any of the Parent
Related Parties other than the Guarantor or Parent or Acquisition Sub or their
respective successors and assigns under the Merger Agreement or this Guarantee
(such Parent Related Parties other than the Guarantor or Parent or Acquisition
Sub or their respective successors and assigns under the Merger Agreement or
this Guarantee, collectively, each a " _Non-Recourse Party_ ").

 



2 3\. _NO WAIVER; CUMULATIVE RIGHTS_. No failure on the part of the Guaranteed
Party to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, remedy or power
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial
exercise by the Guaranteed Party of any right, remedy or power hereunder
preclude any other or future exercise of any right, remedy or power
hereunder. Each and every right, remedy and power hereby granted to the
Guaranteed Party or allowed it by Law or other agreement shall be cumulative
and not exclusive of any other, and may be exercised by the Guaranteed Party
at any time or from time to time. The Guaranteed Party shall not have any
obligation to proceed at any time or in any manner against, or exhaust any or
all of the Guaranteed Partys rights against, Parent, Acquisition Sub or any
other Person liable for the Obligations prior to proceeding against the
Guarantor hereunder.

4\. _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES_. The Guarantor hereby represents and
warrants that:

(a) the Guarantor is duly incorporated or organized, as applicable, validly
existing and in good standing under the Laws of its jurisdiction of
incorporation or organization, as applicable;

 

(b) the Guarantor is duly licensed or qualified in each jurisdiction in which
the ownership or operation of its assets or the character of its activities
is such as to require it to be so licensed or qualified, except where the
failure to be so licensed or qualified would not reasonably be expected,
individually or in the aggregate, to interfere with, prevent or delay
the ability of the Guarantor to enter into and perform its obligations under
this Guarantee or consummate the transactions contemplated hereby;

 

(c) the execution, delivery and performance of this Guarantee have been duly
authorized by all necessary action and do not contravene any provision of the

organizational documents or any Law, regulation, rule, decree, order, judgment
or contractual restriction binding on such Guarantor or its assets;

(d) Other than any consent, approval, Order or authorization of, filing or
registration with, or notification to any Governmental Authorities
contemplated by the Merger Agreement as being necessary for the entry into and
consummation of the transactions contemplated thereunder, all consents,
approvals, authorizations, permits of, filings with and notifications to, any
governmental authority necessary for the due execution, delivery and
performance of this Guarantee by the Guarantor have been obtained or made and
all conditions thereof have been duly complied with, and no other action by,
and no notice to or filing with, any governmental authority or regulatory
body is required in connection with the execution, delivery or performance of
this Guarantee;

 



3 (e) this Guarantee constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of
the Guarantor enforceable against the Guarantor in accordance with its terms,
subject to (i) the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting creditors rights
generally, and (ii) general equitable principles (whether considered in a
proceeding in equity or at law); and

(f) the Guarantor has the financial capacity to pay and perform its
obligations under this Guarantee, and all funds necessary for the Guarantor to

Guarantor for so long as this Guarantee shall remain in effect in accordance

assign or delegate their respective rights, interests or obligations hereunder
to any other Person (by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior
written consent of the Guaranteed Party or the Guarantor, as the case may be.
Upon any such permitted assignment, the references in this Guarantee to
Guarantor shall also apply to any such assignee unless the context otherwise
requires. This Guarantee shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the

4 7\. _CONTINUING GUARANTEE_. Subject to Section 2, this Guarantee may not
be revoked or terminated and shall remain in full force and effect, and shall
continue to be binding on the Guarantor and its successors or assigns until
the Obligations have been paid and performed in full.

 

8\. _NO RECOURSE_. Nothing set forth in this Guarantee shall confer or give or
shall be construed to confer or give to any Person (including any Person
acting in a representative capacity) any rights or remedies against any Person
other than the Guarantor as expressly set forth herein. Notwithstanding
anything that may be expressed or implied in this Guarantee or any
document or instrument delivered in connection herewith, and notwithstanding
the fact that the Guarantor may be a partnership or limited liability company,
by its acceptance of the benefits of this Guarantee, the Guaranteed Party
acknowledges and agrees that no Person other than the Guarantor (and its
successors and assigns) has any obligation hereunder and that no recourse
shall be had hereunder, or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason
of, such obligation or their creation, against, and no personal liability
shall attach to, any Non-Recourse Party, through Parent, Acquisition Sub or
otherwise, whether by or through attempted piercing of the corporate veil, by
or through a claim by or on behalf of the Guaranteed Party against any Non-
Recourse Party, by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or
equitable proceeding, by virtue of any statute, regulation or applicable Law
or otherwise. The Guaranteed Party acknowledges and agrees that Parent and
Acquisition Sub have no assets other than certain contract rights and cash in
a _de minimis_ amount and that no additional funds are expected to be
contributed to Parent or Acquisition Sub unless the Closing occurs. Subject to
the Guaranteed Partys rights set forth in Section 10.8 of the Merger
Agreement, recourse against the Guarantor pursuant to this Guarantee shall be
the sole and exclusive remedy of the Guaranteed Party and all of its
Affiliates against the Guarantor in respect of any liabilities or obligations
arising under, or in connection with, the Merger Agreement or the transactions
contemplated thereby.

9.  _NATURE OF GUARANTEE_. The Guarantors liability hereunder is absolute,
full and unconditional, irrevocable and continuing irrespective of any
modification, amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from the
Merger Agreement that may be agreed to by Parent or Acquisition Sub or any
circumstance whatsoever that might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable
discharge or defense of a surety or guarantor. The Guaranteed Party shall not
be obligated to file any claim relating to the Obligations in the event that
Parent or Acquisition Sub becomes subject to a bankruptcy, reorganization or
similar proceeding, and the failure of the Guaranteed Party to so file shall
not affect the Guarantors obligations hereunder. In the event that any
payment to the Guaranteed Party in respect of any of the Obligations is
rescinded or must otherwise be returned for any reason whatsoever, the
Guarantor shall remain liable hereunder with respect to such Obligations as
if such payment had not been made. This Guarantee is an unconditional and
continuing guarantee of payment and not merely of collection, and the
Guaranteed Party shall not be required to proceed against Parent or
Acquisition Sub before proceeding against the Guarantor hereunder. The
parties hereto acknowledge and agree that irreparable damage would occur in
the event that any of the provisions of this Guarantee were not performed in
accordance with its specific terms or were otherwise breached and further
agree that the Guaranteed Party shall be entitled to an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Guarantee
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, in addition to
any other remedy to which it is entitled at law or in equity, and shall not be
required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such
order or

 



5  injunction. Guarantor further agrees that it will not oppose the granting of
any such injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on the
basis that (x) the Guaranteed Party has an adequate remedy at law or (y) an
award of an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief is not
an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity.

 

10\. _GOVERNING LAW; JURISDICTION_. This Guarantee, and all claims and causes
of action arising out of, based upon, or related to this Guarantee or the
negotiation, execution or performance hereof, shall be governed by, and
construed, interpreted and enforced in accordance with, the Laws of the State
of Delaware, without regard to choice or conflict of law principles
that would result in the application of any Laws other than the Laws of the
State of Delaware. Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or
relating to this Guarantee, including the existence, validity, interpretation,
performance, breach or termination thereof, or any dispute regarding non-
contractual obligations arising out of or relating to it shall be referred to
and finally resolved by arbitration administered by the Hong Kong
International Arbitration Centre under the HKIAC Administered Arbitration
Rules in force when the notice of arbitration is submitted. The seat of
arbitration shall be Hong Kong. The arbitration shall be decided by a tribunal
of three (3) arbitrators. Each of the Guarantor and the Guaranteed Party
shall be entitled to nominate one (1) arbitrator. The third arbitrator, who
shall act as the chairman of the tribunal, shall be chosen by the two
arbitrators nominated by the parties, respectively. The arbitration
proceedings (including but not limited to any arbitral award rendered) shall
be in English. The award of the arbitration tribunal shall be final and
conclusive and binding upon the parties as from the date rendered. Judgment
upon any award may be entered and enforced in any court having jurisdiction
over a party or any of its assets. To the extent that the Guarantor may be
entitled in any jurisdiction to claim for itself or its assets immunity
(whether state or sovereign or otherwise) from service of
process, jurisdiction, suit, judgment, execution, attachment (whether before
judgment, in aid of execution, or otherwise) or legal process in respect of
its obligations under this Agreement, or to the extent that, in any such
jurisdiction, such immunity (whether or not claimed) may be attributed to it
or its assets, the Guarantor hereby irrevocably agrees not to claim, and
hereby irrevocably waives, such immunity to the fullest extent permitted by
the laws of such jurisdiction with the intent, inter alia, that such waiver
of immunity shall have irrevocable effect.

11\. _COUNTERPARTS_. This Guarantee may be executed by facsimile or other
digital imaging device and in one or more counterparts, and by the different
parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when executed shall be
deemed to be an original but all of which taken together shall constitute one
and the same agreement.

12\. _MISCELLANEOUS_.

 

(a) This Guarantee contains the entire agreement between the parties relative
to the subject matter hereof. No modification or waiver of any provision
hereof shall be enforceable unless agreed to by the Guaranteed Party and the
Guarantor in writing.

(b) Any provision hereof that is prohibited or unenforceable in any
jurisdiction shall be, as to such jurisdiction, ineffective solely to the
extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the
remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in
any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable

 



6  such provision in any other jurisdiction and the application of such
provision to other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further
agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Guarantee with a
valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the
economic, business and other purposes of such void or
unenforceable provision.

(c) The descriptive headings herein are inserted for convenience of reference
only and are not intended to be part of or to affect the meaning or
interpretation of this Guarantee.

(d) All parties acknowledge that each party and its counsel have reviewed
this Guarantee and that any rule of construction to the effect that any
ambiguities are to be resolved against the drafting party shall not be
employed in the interpretation of this Guarantee.
