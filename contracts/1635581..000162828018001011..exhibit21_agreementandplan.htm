(a) Conversion of OpCo Common Units and OpCo Subordinated Units Owned by the
Sponsors. At the OpCo Merger 2 Effective Time, all of the issued and
outstanding OpCo Common Units held by a Sponsor OpCo Owner and all of the

pursuant to Section 2.2(a). At the OpCo Merger 2 Effective Time, the books and
records of the Surviving LLC will be revised to reflect the removal of the
Sponsors or their Affiliates as Members of the 

Surviving LLC, the number of OpCo Units held by Parent and the Surviving
Partnership and the simultaneous cancellation of all other limited liability
company interests (other than the Managing Member Interest, the Partnership
Owned Units and the IDRs) in OpCo (as the Surviving LLC).

(f) Adjustment to the OpCo Merger Consideration. If, between the date of this
Agreement and the OpCo Merger 2 Effective Time, the outstanding OpCo Common

of units by reason of any interest split, interest distribution, reverse
interest split, reclassification, recapitalization, or other similar
transaction or event, or there occurs a record date with respect to any of the

items, as the case may be, shall be appropriately adjusted to provide the
holders of OpCo Common Units and OpCo Subordinated Units with the same
economic effect as was contemplated by this Agreement prior to giving effect
to such event.

Section 2.3 Effect of the Partnership Merger. Upon the terms and subject to

immediately prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time will (i) be

interest, with respect to such Class A Shares with a record date occurring
prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time that was declared or made by
the General Partner Board prior to the Partnership Merger Effective time with
respect to such shares in accordance with the terms of the Partnership
Agreement and this Agreement and which remains unpaid as of the Partnership
Merger Effective Time (an "Unpaid Partnership Distribution").

(d) Conversion of the Limited Partner Interests of Partnership Merger Sub. The
limited liability company interests in Partnership Merger Sub issued and
outstanding 

immediately prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time will be converted
into a number of Class A Shares equal to the number of Class A Shares canceled

admission of 8point3 Solar as the only Shareholder holding all the Class A
Shares of the Surviving Partnership and the simultaneous cancellation of all
other Partnership Interests (other than the General Partner Interest) in the
Partnership (as the Surviving Partnership).

(e) Adjustment to the Share Merger Consideration. If, between the date of this
Agreement and the Partnership Merger Effective Time, the outstanding Class A
Shares are changed into a different number or class of shares by reason of any
stock split, stock dividend, reverse stock split, reclassification,
recapitalization, or other similar transaction or event, or there occurs a
record date with respect to any of the foregoing, then the Share Merger
Consideration and any similarly dependent items, as the case may be, shall be
appropriately adjusted to provide the holders of Class A Shares with the same
economic effect as was contemplated by this Agreement prior to giving effect
to such event.

Section 2.4 Exchange of OpCo Units.

(a) Exchange. As promptly as practicable after the OpCo Merger 2 Effective

entry form ("Book-Entry Units"), a duly executed unit power for such Book-
Entry Units, in each case instructing the cancellation of such OpCo Units in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and (ii) upon Parent's receipt
thereof, Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, to each Sponsor OpCo Owner, by

writing by such Sponsor OpCo Owner, as applicable, to Parent, an amount in
cash equal to the OpCo Merger Consideration plus any Unpaid OpCo Distribution
pursuant to Section 2.2(a) with respect to each OpCo Unit so surrendered by
such Sponsor OpCo Owner. For the avoidance of doubt, no amount of the OpCo
Merger Consideration or any Unpaid OpCo Distribution shall be used to make
payments to the Partnership in connection with OpCo Units owned by the
Partnership.

(b) No Further Transfers. From and after the Partnership Merger Effective
Time, there will be no further registration on the books of OpCo of transfers

such OpCo Units, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement.

Section 2.5 Exchange of Book-Entry Shares.

(a) Paying Agent.

(i) At or prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall appoint a paying agent
reasonably acceptable to the Partnership (the "Paying Agent") for the purpose
of 

exchanging Class A Shares held of record by Shareholders in book-entry form

Partnership Distribution.

(ii) Subject to Section 2.5(c), as soon as reasonably practicable after the
Partnership Merger Effective Time, Parent will send, or will cause the Paying
Agent to send, to each holder of Book-Entry Shares (other than DTC) as of the
Partnership Merger Effective Time (and, to the extent commercially
practicable, Parent will, or will cause the Paying Agent to, make available
for collection by hand, during customary business hours commencing immediately
after the Partnership Merger Effective Time, if so elected by a holder of
Book-Entry Shares), a letter of transmittal in customary form (each such
letter, a "Letter of Transmittal") to be used for surrender of Book-Entry
Shares pursuant to this Article II.

(b) Deposit.

(i) At the Closing, each of 8point3 Solar CEI, the Partnership and OpCo shall
cause to be delivered to the Escrow Agent a written notice, in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to the Escrow Agent, directing the Escrow
Agent to disburse all of the funds held in the Escrow Account to the Paying
Agent on the Closing Date.

(ii) At the Closing, Parent will deposit or cause to be deposited with the
Paying Agent, in trust for the benefit of the holders of Book-Entry Shares, an
amount of cash in U.S. dollars equal to the Share Merger Consideration to be
paid pursuant to Section 2.3(a) (which shall include the amount of the OpCo
Merger 1 Partnership Distribution distributed with respect to each such Unit
to the Partnership at the OpCo Merger 1 Effective Time pursuant to Section
2.1(f)) plus any Unpaid Partnership Distribution pursuant to Section 2.3(a),
less any amount deposited pursuant to Section 2.5(b)(i), payable upon due
surrender of the Book-Entry Shares pursuant to the provisions of this Article
II. All cash deposited with the Paying Agent is referred to as the "Exchange
Fund." The Paying Agent will, pursuant to irrevocable instructions delivered
by Parent at or prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time, deliver the
Share Merger Consideration and any Unpaid Partnership Distribution
contemplated to be paid pursuant to this Article II out of the Exchange Fund.
The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

(c) Exchange.

(i) Each holder of Book-Entry Shares other than DTC, upon surrender thereof by
delivery of a Letter of Transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance
with the terms of such Letter of Transmittal, and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, will be entitled to receive in
exchange for each surrendered Book-Entry Share a cash amount equal to the
Share Merger Consideration (after giving effect to any required Tax
withholdings as provided in Section 2.6) plus any Unpaid Partnership
Distribution. DTC, upon surrender of its Book-Entry Shares in accordance with
the customary surrender 

procedures of DTC and the Paying Agent, will be entitled to receive in
exchange for each surrendered Book-Entry Share a cash amount equal to the
Share Merger Consideration (after giving effect to any required Tax
withholdings as provided in Section 2.6) plus any Unpaid Partnership
Distribution. Each Book-Entry Share surrendered pursuant to this Section
2.5(c)(i) will be canceled.

(ii) The Share Merger Consideration and any Unpaid Partnership Distribution
will be paid (A) to the holders of Book-Entry Shares other than DTC, as
promptly as practicable after receipt by the Paying Agent of the Letter of
Transmittal in respect thereof, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds, and (B) to DTC, as promptly as practicable after the Partnership Merger
Effective Time, by wire transfer of immediately available funds.

(iii) Payment of the Share Merger Consideration and any Unpaid Partnership
Distribution with respect to Book-Entry Shares will only be made to the Person
in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered. No interest will be paid
or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of Book-Entry Shares.
Until surrendered and paid as contemplated hereby, each Book-Entry Share will
be deemed at any time after the Partnership Merger Effective Time, as
applicable, to represent only the right to receive the Share Merger
Consideration and any Unpaid Partnership Distribution in cash as contemplated
by this Agreement. The Share Merger Consideration and any Unpaid Partnership
Distribution paid upon surrender of such Book-Entry Shares will be deemed to
have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Book-
Entry Shares.

(iv) No Person beneficially owning Class A Shares through DTC will be required
to deliver a Letter of Transmittal to receive the Share Merger Consideration
or any Unpaid Partnership Distribution that such holder is entitled to receive

any Unpaid Partnership Distribution in accordance with the customary payment
procedures of DTC following the Partnership Merger Effective Time.

(d) No Further Transfers. From and after the Partnership Merger Effective
Time, there will be no further registration on the books of the Partnership of

Property and the Non-Controlled Leased Real Property, the "Real Property").
Any Contract evidencing the rights of a Partnership Group Entity or a Non-
Controlled Partnership Group Entity to the Real Property (each, a "Real
Property Contract") constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of each
Partnership Group Entity party thereto (and, to the Knowledge of the
Partnership Entities, each Non-Controlled Partnership Group Entity and each
other Person party thereto), and is in full force and effect and enforceable
against each Partnership Group 

Entity party thereto (and, to the Knowledge of the Partnership Entities, each
Non-Controlled Partnership Group Entity and each other Person party thereto)

Effect. Except for such defaults as would not, individually or in the

Controlled Partnership Group Entity or any other Person, in each case, under
any Real Property Contract. Each Partnership Group Entity and, to the
Knowledge of the Partnership Entities, each Non-Controlled Partnership Group
Entity and each other Person, in each case, has complied with and is in

precautions to protect the secrecy and confidentiality of the trade secrets

Effect.

the one of the Parent Entities is a party or by which the Parent Entities or
any of their respective properties are bound, except, in the case of clauses

which they are a party, do not and will not require any consent, approval,
authorization or permit of, action by, filing with or notification to, any
Governmental Authority, except for (i) the joint filing of a Notification and

(a) There is no Proceeding pending for which the Parent Entities have received
written notice or, to the Knowledge of the Parent Entities, threatened in
writing against the Parent Entities or any of their respective properties by
or before any Governmental Authority that (i) would, individually or in the

(b) Neither of the Parent Entities nor any of their respective properties is

material obligations under this Agreement.

Section 5.6 Tax Matters.

(a) No Parent Entity is a Disqualified Person.

(b) The Transactions will not cause any entity that is a partnership for
federal income tax purposes in which OpCo holds a direct or indirect Equity
Interest to become a "related person" to any purchaser under any existing
power purchase agreement for purposes of Section 267 or Section 707 of the
Code, assuming that any such partnership is not currently a "related person"
to any such purchaser.

(c) The Transactions will not cause any entity that is a partnership for
federal income tax purposes in which OpCo holds a direct or indirect Equity
Interest to be classified as an entity other than a partnership (or to be
classified as a publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation) for
federal income tax purposes.

Section 5.7 Information Supplied. None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by the Parent Entities in writing specifically for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Transaction Filings will, when filed with
the SEC or when distributed or disseminated to the Shareholders, as
applicable, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Parent Entities makes any
representation or warranty with respect to any information provided by or on
behalf of the Partnership Group Entities, Holdings or their respective
Representatives in writing specifically for incorporation by reference in the
Transaction Filings. 

Section 5.8 Solvency. Assuming satisfaction of the conditions to Parent's
obligation to consummate the Mergers, or waiver of such conditions, and after
giving effect to the Transactions, including the payment of the aggregate
Share Merger Consideration and OpCo Merger Consideration, payment of all
amounts required to be paid in connection with the consummation of the
Transactions, and payment of all related fees and expenses, and assuming that
the Partnership, OpCo and the Partnership Entities are Solvent immediately
before the Closing and consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
each of the entities comprising Parent, the Surviving Partnership and the
Surviving LLC will be Solvent as of the Closing and immediately after the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. For the purposes of this
Agreement, the term "Solvent" when used with respect to any Person, means
that, as of any date of determination (a) the amount of the "fair saleable
value" of the assets of such Person will, as of such date, exceed (i) the
value of all "liabilities" of such Person, including "contingent and other
liabilities", as of such date, as such quoted terms are generally determined
in accordance with applicable Laws governing determinations of the insolvency
of debtors, and (ii) the amount that will be required to pay the probable
liabilities of such Person on its existing debts (including contingent and
other liabilities) as such debts become absolute and mature, (b) such Person
will not have, as of such date, an unreasonably small amount of capital for
the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be
engaged following such date, and (c) such Person will be able to pay its
liabilities, including contingent and other liabilities, as they mature. For
purposes of this definition, "not have an unreasonably small amount of capital
for the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be
engaged" and "able to pay its liabilities, including contingent and other
liabilities, as they mature" means that such Person will be able to generate
enough cash from operations, asset dispositions or refinancing, or a
combination thereof, to meet its obligations as they become due.

Section 5.9 Financing.

(a) Parent has delivered to the Partnership a complete and accurate copy, as
of the date of this Agreement, of an executed commitment letter, dated as of
the date of this Agreement, from The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, UFJ, Ltd
(together with any permitted assignees thereof, the "Debt Financing Sources"),
and each of their respective affiliated entities named therein (the "Debt
Commitment Letter"), pursuant to which the Debt Financing Sources have
committed to provide, upon the terms and subject to the conditions thereof,
the Bridge Facility (as defined therein) debt financing in an aggregate amount
set forth therein (being collectively referred to as the "Debt Financing").
The term "Debt Commitment Letter" as used herein shall mean (i) the Debt
Commitment Letter to the extent not superseded by a New Debt Commitment Letter
at the time in question and (ii) a New Debt Commitment Letter to the extent
then in effect. Parent also has delivered to the Partnership a true, complete
and correct copy of the executed fee letter, dated as of the date of this
Agreement, from the Debt Financing Sources (the "Debt Fee Letter"), in
connection with the Debt Commitment Letter (it being understood that any such
Fee Letter provided to the Partnership is redacted to omit the numerical fee
amounts and certain other commercially sensitive numbers and provisions set
forth therein that would not adversely affect the aggregate amount,
availability or conditionality of the Debt Financing).

(b) The amount of funds contemplated to be provided pursuant to the Debt
Commitment Letter, together with the equity funds available to the Parent at
the Closing (the "Equity Funds"), are sufficient to satisfy all of Parent's
payment obligations under this Agreement, 

including under Article II, and to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby and to pay all other amounts payable by Parent in connection with the
Debt Financing.

(c) Neither the Debt Commitment Letter nor the Debt Fee Letter has been
amended, restated or otherwise modified as of the date of this Agreement and,
except as permitted by Section 6.16 or as otherwise agreed to in writing by
the Partnership, as of the Closing Date, and no such amendment, restatement or
modification is presently contemplated, and the commitments set forth in the
Debt Commitment Letter have not been withdrawn, modified or rescinded in any
respect. The Debt Commitment Letter, in the form so delivered to the
Partnership on the date of this Agreement, is in full force and effect and
constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent and, to the
Knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto, in each case except as that
enforceability may be (i) limited by any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium or similar Laws affecting the
enforcement of creditors' rights generally and (ii) subject to general
principles of equity (regardless of whether that enforceability is considered
in a proceeding in equity or at law).

(d) There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the
funding of the full amount of the Debt Financing, other than as expressly set
forth in the Debt Commitment Letter, or the Equity Funds, other than as
expressly set forth in Article VII. Assuming the accuracy of the Partnership's
representations and warranties contained herein, as of the date of this
Agreement, no event has occurred that, with or without notice, lapse of time
or both, constitutes or would reasonably be expected to constitute a default
or breach on the part of Parent or the Debt Financing Sources, as applicable,
or, to the Knowledge of Parent, any other parties thereto under any term or
condition of the Debt Commitment Letter, except that no representation or
warranty is made to the extent that any term or condition requires any action
by, or otherwise relates to, the Partnership, OpCo or their respective
Subsidiaries. Assuming the accuracy of the Partnership's representations and
warranties contained herein, as of the date of this Agreement, Parent has no
reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Debt Financing will not be
satisfied or that the full amount of the Debt Financing and Equity Funds will
not be available to Parent for purposes of satisfying its payment obligations
hereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby on the
Closing Date.

(e) Except for the Debt Fee Letter referred to in Section 5.9(a) (which does
not relate to the amounts or conditionality of, or contain any conditions
precedent to, the funding of the Debt Financing), there are no side letters or
other written or oral agreements, contracts or arrangements related to the
funding or investing, as applicable, of the full amount of the Debt Financing
other than as expressly set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter and delivered
to the Partnership on or prior to the date of this Agreement. Parent has fully
paid or caused to be paid any and all commitment and other fees, costs and
expenses that have been incurred and are due and payable on or prior to the
date of this Agreement in connection with the Debt Commitment Letter.

Section 5.10 Financial Statements.

(a) The unaudited balance sheet of CD CEI V JV Holdco as of December 31, 2017,
attached hereto as Schedule 5.10 (the "Parent Balance Sheet"), (i) was
prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis during the
period involved (subject 

to (1) the lack of footnotes and normal year-end adjustments which are not,
individually or in the aggregate, material and (2) first year audit procedures
of FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements, related to Level III fair market
value investments that are in operation), and (ii) fairly presents in all
material respects the consolidated financial position of CD CEI V JV Holdco as
of the date thereof (subject to (1) normal year-end adjustments which are not,
individually or in the aggregate, material and (2) first year audit procedures
of FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements, related to Level III fair market
value investments that are in operation).

(b) Since December 31, 2017, through the date of this Agreement, except as
otherwise contemplated or permitted by this Agreement, there has not been any
event, development or state of circumstances that would, individually or in
the aggregate, be reasonably likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.
Since December 31, 2017, neither CD CEI V JV Holdco nor any of its Affiliates
has incurred, any liabilities that would be required by GAAP to be reflected
on a consolidated balance sheet of CD CEI V JV Holdco, except liabilities (i)
that are accrued or reserved against in the Parent Balance Sheet or reflected
in the notes thereto, (ii) incurred in accordance with this Agreement or in
connection with the Transactions contemplated herein, (iii) that would not
reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a
Parent Material Adverse Effect or (iv) that have been discharged or paid in
full.

(c) Neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar contract or any "off-balance sheet arrangements"
(as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC), where the purpose of
such contract is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or
material liabilities of, Parent in Parent's financial statements.

Section 5.11 Brokers. Neither Holdings nor any Parent Entity or Partnership
Group Entity will have any liability for, and no broker, investment banker or
financial advisor is entitled to, any broker's, finders' or financial
advisor's fee or commission, or the reimbursement of expenses, in connection
with the Transactions based on the Contracts made by or on behalf of any
Parent Entity.

Section 5.12 Acknowledgement by the Parent Entities.

(a) Except for (i) the representations and warranties made in this Agreement,
(ii) the representations and warranties made (A) in any Letter of Transmittal
or (B) in connection with any payment of Share Merger Consideration through
DTC and (iii) the representations and warranties made in any certificate
required to be delivered under Section 7.2(d), none of the Partnership
Entities, Holdings or any other Person is making or has made, and none of the
Parent Entities is relying on, or has relied on, any other representations or
warranties, either express or implied, with respect to the Transactions, the
Partnership Entities, Holdings or their respective businesses, operations,
assets, liabilities, financial condition, results of operations, future
operating or financial results, estimates, projections, forecasts, plans or
prospects (including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such
estimates, projections, forecasts, plans or prospects), or on the accuracy or
completeness of any information regarding the General Partner, Holdings 

or the Partnership Group Entities or any other material furnished or provided
to the Parent Entities or made available to the Parent Entities in any "data
rooms," "virtual data rooms," management presentations or in any other form,
in expectation of, or in connection with, this Agreement or the Transactions.

(b) In connection with the due diligence investigation of Partnership Entities
by the Parent Entities, the Parent Entities have received and may continue to
receive from the Partnership Entities certain estimates, projections,
forecasts and other forward-looking information, as well as certain business
plan and cost-related plan information, regarding the Partnership Group
Entities, Non-Controlled Partnership Group Entities and their respective
businesses and operations. The Parent Entities hereby acknowledge that there
are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such estimates, projections,
forecasts and other forward-looking statements, with which the Parent Entities
are familiar, that the Parent Entities are taking full responsibility for
making their own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates,
projections, forecasts and other forward-looking information, as well as such
business plans and cost-related plans, so furnished to them (including the
reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections,
forecasts, forward-looking information, business plans or cost-related plans),
and that the Parent Entities will have no claim against the Partnership Group
Entities, the Non-Controlled Partnership Group Entities, or any of their
respective equityholders, directors, managers, officers, employees,
Affiliates, advisors, agents or representatives, or any other Person, with
respect thereto.

ARTICLE VI 
ADDITIONAL COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS

Section 6.1 Shareholder Meeting; Preparation of the Proxy Statement.

(a) The Partnership shall, in accordance with the Partnership Organizational
Documents and with the cooperation of the Parent Entities, as promptly as
practicable following the date of this Agreement, establish a record date for,
duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a special meeting of the
Shareholders (including any postponements, adjournments or recesses thereof,
the "Shareholder Meeting") for the purpose of (i) obtaining the Shareholder
Approval and (ii) obtaining a vote of the holders of Class A Shares with
respect to the approval of the OpCo Merger. Subject to Section 6.3, the
Partnership shall, through the GP Conflicts Committee and the General Partner
Board, recommend to the Shareholders approval of this Agreement and the
Mergers (the "Board Recommendation") and use reasonable best efforts to obtain
from the Shareholders the Shareholder Approval. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, but subject to Section 6.3, the Partnership's
obligations pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 6.1(a) shall not be
affected by the withdrawal or modification by the GP Conflicts Committee or
the General Partner Board of the Board Recommendation. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Partnership may postpone or
adjourn, with approval of the General Partner Board after due consideration of
the recommendation of the GP Conflicts Committee, the Shareholder Meeting (i)
to solicit additional proxies for the purpose of obtaining the Shareholder
Approval, (ii) for the absence of quorum, and (iii) to allow reasonable
additional time for the filing and/or mailing of any supplemental 

or amended disclosure that the General Partner Board or the GP Conflicts
Committee has determined after consultation with outside legal counsel is
necessary under applicable Law and for such supplemental or amended disclosure
to be disseminated and reviewed by the Shareholders prior to the Shareholder
Meeting. Unless this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with
Article VIII, the Partnership, with the cooperation of the Parent Entities,
shall submit this Agreement and the Mergers to the Shareholders for approval
at the Shareholder Meeting even if the General Partner Board or the GP
Conflicts Committee shall have made an Adverse Recommendation Change. Upon
obtaining the Shareholder Approval, OpCo shall use its reasonable best efforts
to obtain the Unitholder Approval.

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement,
the Partnership shall prepare and file with the SEC a proxy statement (the
"Proxy Statement") in preliminary form relating to the Shareholder Meeting;
provided, however, that Parent and its counsel shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy Statement before it is filed.
Subject to Section 6.3, the Proxy Statement shall include the Board
Recommendation. The Parties shall cooperate with one another in connection
with the preparation of the Proxy Statement. Parent and its counsel shall be
given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any amendment to the
Proxy Statement each time before it is filed with the SEC. The Partnership
shall promptly provide Parent and its counsel with (i) any comments or other
communications, whether written or oral, that the Partnership or its counsel
may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Proxy Statement promptly after receipt of those comments or other
communications and (ii) a reasonable opportunity to participate in the
Partnership's response to those comments and to provide comments on that
response, including by participating with the Partnership or its counsel in
any discussions or meetings with the SEC. Each of the Partnership and Parent
shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to
any comments of the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement, and the
Partnership shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the definitive
Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Shareholders as promptly as practicable
after the SEC has completed its review of the Proxy Statement. If, at any time
prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time, any information relating to
the Partnership, the General Partner, OpCo, Parent, Partnership Merger Sub or
OpCo Merger Subs or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors
is discovered by the Partnership or Parent that should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement so that such documents would
not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, the Party that discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other Parties and an appropriate
amendment or supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed
with the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable Law, disseminated to
the Shareholders.

Alternative Proposal. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, (A) the Partnership may grant a waiver, amendment or release under

the extent necessary to allow an Alternative Proposal to be made to the

Conflicts Committee).

their obligations under this Agreement and it being understood that the
Partnership Entities and Holdings may enter into a confidentiality agreement
without a standstill provision) and (B) engage or participate in discussions

such Alternative Proposal or its Representatives which was not previously
provided or made available to Parent. 

(c) Subject to the permitted actions contemplated by Section 8.1(d)(ii),
neither the General Partner Board nor the GP Conflicts Committee shall (i)
withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to the Parent Entities the Board
Recommendation, (ii) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or
recommend, any Alternative Proposal, (iii) fail to include the Board
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement distributed to the Shareholders in
connection with the Transactions, or (iv) resolve or publicly propose to do
any of the foregoing (any of such actions, an "Adverse Recommendation
Change"). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6.3 or any
other provision of this Agreement, if, prior to obtaining the Partnership
Shareholder Approval, (A) an Intervening Event has occurred and is continuing
and the General Partner Board or the GP Conflicts Committee determines in good
faith, after consultation with outside financial and legal advisors, that the
consummation of the Mergers would not be in, or would be adverse to, the best
interests of the Partnership Group or the Public Shareholders or would
otherwise be inconsistent with its duties under the Partnership Agreement or
applicable Law, then the General Partner Board or the GP Conflicts Committee
may effect an Adverse Recommendation Change and/or (B) the Partnership
receives a Bona Fide Alternative Proposal and the General Partner Board after
due consideration of the recommendation of the GP Conflicts Committee
determines in good faith, after consultation with outside financial and legal
advisors, that (I) such Alternative Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal
and (II) the consummation of the Mergers would not be in, or would be adverse
to, the best interests of the Partnership Group or the Public Shareholders or
would otherwise be inconsistent with its duties under the Partnership
Agreement or applicable Law, then the General Partner Board may effect an
Adverse Recommendation Change and/or the Partnership, upon receiving such
authorization from the General Partner Board, may enter into a definitive
acquisition agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal (an "Alternative
Acquisition Agreement") if, with respect to this clause (B), the Partnership
concurrently terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(ii). If the
GP Conflicts Committee determines in good faith, after consultation with
outside financial and legal advisors, that (1) such Alternative Proposal
constitutes (or could reasonably be expected to constitute) a Superior
Proposal and (2) the consummation of the Mergers would not be in, or would be
adverse to the best interests of the Partnership Group or the Public
Shareholders or would otherwise be inconsistent with its duties under the
Partnership Agreement or applicable Law and the General Partner Board does not
act consistently with the recommendation of the GP Conflicts Committee, the GP
Conflicts Committee may effect an Adverse Recommendation Change. The General
Partner Board or the GP Conflicts Committee, as applicable, shall not be
entitled to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change or authorize the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(ii) unless:

(i) the Partnership notifies Parent in writing at least three Business Days
before taking that action of its intention to do so, and specifies the reasons
therefor, including, if applicable, the identity of the person making the
Alternative Proposal;

(ii) to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate, the Partnership has negotiated,
and has caused its Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with Parent and
its Representatives during such three Business Day period, to enable 

Parent to effect revisions to the terms and conditions of this Agreement that
would, if a Superior Proposal has been made, cause such Superior Proposal to
no longer constitute a Superior Proposal or, in connection with an Adverse
Recommendation Change, it would cause the General Partner Board or the GP
Conflicts Committee to no longer believe that making an Adverse Recommendation
Change would be in, or not adverse to, the best interests of the Partnership
Group or the Public Shareholders or would otherwise be consistent with their
duties under the Partnership Agreement or applicable Law; and

(iii) if Parent makes a proposal during such three Business Day period to
adjust the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the General Partner Board
or the GP Conflicts Committee, as applicable, after taking into consideration
the adjusted terms and conditions of this Agreement as proposed by Parent,
continue to determine in good faith, after consultation with its outside
financial and legal advisors, that such Superior Proposal continues to be a
Superior Proposal, if applicable, and that the failure to make an Adverse
Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement, as applicable, could be
adverse to the interests of the Partnership Group or the Public Shareholders
or would otherwise be inconsistent with their duties under the Partnership
Agreement or applicable Law.

(d) The Partnership promptly (and in any event within 48 hours) shall advise
Parent orally and in writing of the receipt of any written Alternative
Proposal and any written request for non-public information relating to the
General Partner and the Partnership Group Entities and the Non-Controlled
Partnership Group Entities, other than requests for information not reasonably
expected to be related to an Alternative Proposal, and, in each case, shall
disclose to Parent the identity of the Person making the written Alternative
Proposal or request, and in the case of an Alternative Proposal, the material
terms and conditions of such Alternative Proposal. The Partnership shall, upon
the request of Parent, keep Parent reasonably informed of any material
developments with respect to any Alternative Proposal.

(e) Nothing set forth in this Agreement shall prevent the Partnership, the
General Partner Board or the GP Conflicts Committee from (i) taking and
disclosing to its Shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule
14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act (or
any similar communication to Shareholders in connection with the making or
amendment of a tender offer or exchange offer) or (ii) making any required
disclosure to the Shareholders if the General Partner Board or the GP
Conflicts Committee determines, in good faith after consultation with outside
financial and legal advisors, that the failure to disclose such information
would reasonably be expected to violate its obligations under the Partnership
Agreement or applicable Law.

Section 6.4 Cooperation; Regulatory Approvals.

(a) Except to the extent that the Parties' obligations are specifically set
forth elsewhere in this Article VI, the Parties shall cooperate fully with
each other and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Transactions to
be consummated as promptly as 

reasonably practicable (including by using reasonable best efforts to cause
the conditions to closing set forth in Article VII to be satisfied). Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Parties (i) shall make all
filings (if any) and give all notices (if any) required to be made by such
Party with any Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions, and
shall submit as promptly as reasonably practicable any additional information
requested in connection with such filings and notices, (ii) shall use
reasonable best efforts to obtain each Consent (if any) required to be
obtained (pursuant to any applicable Law or Contract, or otherwise) by such
Party in connection with the Transactions, and (iii) shall use reasonable best
efforts to oppose or to lift, as the case may be, any restraint, injunction,
or other legal bar to the Transactions. The Partnership shall as promptly as
reasonably practicable deliver to Parent a copy of each such filing made, each
such notice given, and each such Consent obtained, by the Partnership (other
than such filings, notices and Consents related to the HSR Act, the FERC
Approval and the CFIUS Approval, the obligations with respect to which are set
forth in Section 6.4(b), (c) and (d), respectively). Parent shall as promptly
as reasonably practicable deliver to the Partnership a copy of each such
filing made, each such notice given, and each such Consent obtained, by Parent
(other than such filings, notices and Consents related to the HSR Act, the
FERC Approval and the CFIUS Approval, the obligations with respect to which
are set forth in Section 6.4(b), (c) and (d), respectively). Nothing in this
Agreement shall require Holdings or any Partnership Entity or any of their
respective Subsidiaries to take or agree to take any action with respect to
its business or operations unless the effectiveness of such agreement or
action is conditioned upon Closing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement and for the avoidance of doubt, the obligation of this
Section 6.4(a) shall not apply to matters related to the CFIUS Approval and
the subject matter of Section 6.4(d), which instead shall be governed by the
standard of conduct set forth in Section 6.4(d).

(b) Without limiting the generality of Section 6.4(a), Holdings, the
Partnership and Parent shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the
date of this Agreement prepare and, in no event later than ten (10) Business
Days after the date of this Agreement, file the notifications required under
the HSR Act. Without limiting the foregoing, Holdings, the Partnership and
Parent shall take all such further action as may be necessary to resolve such
objections, if any, as the United States Federal Trade Commission, the
Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice, state antitrust
enforcement authorities or competition authorities of any other nation or
other jurisdiction, or any other person, may assert under any applicable Law
with respect to the Transactions, and to avoid or eliminate, and minimize the
impact of, each and every impediment under any applicable Law that may be
asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to the Transactions, in
each case so as to enable the Closing to occur as promptly as reasonably
practicable (and in any event no later than the Outside Date). Holdings, the
Partnership and Parent shall respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to
any inquiries or requests received from any Governmental Authority in
connection with antitrust or related matters. Each of Holdings, the
Partnership and Parent shall (i) give the other Party notice as promptly as
reasonably practicable of the commencement or threat of commencement of any
Proceeding by or before any Governmental Authority with respect to the
Transactions, (ii) keep the other Party informed as to the status of any such
Proceeding or threat, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably practicable inform
the other Party of any material communication concerning Antitrust Laws to or
from any Governmental Authority 

regarding the Transactions (provided, however, that the parties shall be
permitted to redact any communication to the extent such communication
contains competitively sensitive information, including information relating
to the valuation of the Transactions). Except as may be prohibited by any
Governmental Authority or by any Applicable Law, Holdings, the Partnership and
Parent will consult and cooperate with one another, and will consider in good
faith the views of one another, in connection with any analysis, appearance,
presentation, memorandum, brief, argument, opinion, or proposal made or
submitted in connection with any Proceeding under or relating to the HSR Act
or any other Antitrust Law. In addition, except as may be prohibited by any
Governmental Authority or by any applicable Law, in connection with any
Proceeding under or relating to the HSR Act, each of Holdings, the Partnership
and Parent will permit authorized Representatives of the other Parties to be
present at each meeting or conference relating to any such Proceeding and to
have access to and be consulted in connection with any document, opinion, or
proposal made or submitted to any Governmental Authority in connection with
any such Proceeding.

(c) Without limiting the generality of Section 6.4(a), Holdings, the
Partnership and Parent shall, (i)(A) as promptly as reasonably practicable
after the date of this Agreement prepare and, in no event later than ten (10)
Business Days after the date of this Agreement, submit an application for the
FERC Approval, (B) use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all other actions and do, or cause to be done, all other things necessary,
proper or advisable to obtain the FERC Approval so as to be able to consummate
and make effective the Transactions, including taking all such further action
as may be necessary to resolve such objections, if any, as the FERC may assert
under applicable Law (including the FPA) with respect to the Transactions so
as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible (and in any
event no later than the Outside Date) and (ii) subject to applicable legal
limitations and the instructions of any Governmental Authority, keep each
other apprised of the status of matters relating to the completion of the
transactions contemplated thereby, including promptly furnishing the other
with copies of notices or other communications received by the Partnership
Entities or the Parent Entities, as the case may be, or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, from any third party or any Governmental Authority
with respect to such transactions. The Partnership Entities and Parent
Entities shall permit counsel for the other parties reasonable opportunity to
review in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the other party in
connection with, any proposed written communication to any Governmental
Authority. Each of the Partnership and Parent agrees not to participate in any
substantive meeting or discussion, either in person or by telephone, with any
Governmental Authority in connection with the proposed transactions unless it
consults with the other parties in advance and, to the extent not prohibited
by such Governmental Authority, gives the other party the opportunity to
attend and participate.

(d) Each Party shall, and shall cause its Affiliates (other than any Non-U.S.
Member) to, use its reasonable best efforts to obtain CFIUS Approval,
including exercising reasonable best efforts to promptly (and not later than
15 Business Days after the date hereof, unless otherwise agreed by the
Parties) making the joint draft filing required in connection with the CFIUS
Approval in accordance with the DPA, promptly making the joint final filing in
connection with the CFIUS Approval and in accordance with the DPA after
receipt of confirmation that CFIUS has no further comment to the draft filing,
and 

providing any information requested by any Governmental Authority in
connection with the CFIUS review or investigation of the Transactions within
the timeframes set forth in the DPA; provided that Parent shall not be in
breach of its obligations hereunder if any of its Non-U.S. Members declines to
provide information that it deems to be proprietary or otherwise not advisable
to make available, provided that Parent exercised reasonable best efforts in
requesting such information of its Non-U.S. Members. In the event that CFIUS
makes CFIUS Approval contingent on Parent agreeing to certain conditions,
restrictions or other actions, Parent shall exercise reasonable best efforts
to implement such conditions, restrictions or other actions in order to obtain
CFIUS Approval; provided that Parent shall have the ability to negotiate any
such conditions, restrictions and other actions with CFIUS for a reasonable
period of time before agreeing to implement any such conditions, restrictions
or other actions; and provided further that Parent shall not be required to
agree to any such conditions, restrictions or other actions that require any
action or concession be taken or made by, any of its direct or indirect owners
(including the Non-U.S. Members) or require any such direct or indirect owner
to approve a matter relating to its investment in CD CEI V JV Holdco or any of
the other Parent Entities that would disproportionately and adversely affect
such direct or indirect owner relative to any of the other direct or indirect
owners in order to implement any such conditions, restrictions or other
actions. Subject to applicable Laws or any requirement of any Governmental
Authority, each of the Parties shall cooperate with and keep each other
reasonably informed as to the status of and the processes and proceedings
relating to obtaining the CFIUS Approval, and shall promptly notify each other
of any material communication from CFIUS in respect of this Agreement or the
Transactions, and, unless it consults with the other Party in advance, shall
not make any submissions, correspondence or filings, or participate in any
communications or meetings with CFIUS, and, to the extent not precluded by any
Governmental Authority, give the other Party the reasonable opportunity to
review drafts of, and provide final copies of, any submissions, correspondence
or filings, and to attend and participate in any communications or meetings.

(e) Information. Subject to applicable Law, each Party will, upon request by
any other Party, furnish the other with all information concerning itself, its
Subsidiaries, directors, officers, members, managers, general partners and
stockholders and such other matters as may be necessary or advisable in
connection with any statement, filing, notice or application made by or on
behalf of any Party to any Governmental Authority or other Person in
connection with the Parties' respective obligations under this Section 6.4.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement and for the
avoidance of doubt, the obligation of this Section 6.4(e) shall not apply to
matters related to the CFIUS Approval and the subject matter of Section
6.4(d), which instead shall be governed by the standard of conduct set forth
in Section 6.4(d).

(f) Fees and Other Costs of Governmental Consents. Each of the Parties will be
responsible for its own respective fees, costs and expenses, including costs
and expenses of any necessary experts or consultants, incurred by such Party,
as applicable, in connection with any review of, inquiry into, investigation
of, or challenge to any of the Transactions; provided that Parent will be
responsible for paying the filing fees under the HSR Act and any filing fee
associated with any other applicable Antitrust Laws. 

Section 6.5 Public Announcements. The initial press release with respect to
the execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release to be
reasonably agreed upon by Parent and the General Partner. None of Holdings,
Parent or the General Partner will, and each of the foregoing will cause its
Representatives not to, issue any public announcements or make other public
disclosures regarding this Agreement or the Transactions without the prior
written approval of the Parties; provided, however, that a Party or its
Representatives may issue a public announcement or other public disclosures
(i) required by Law or the rules of any stock exchange upon which such Party's
or its parent entity's capital stock or any other equity interest is traded,
or (ii) with respect to any dispute between or among the Parties regarding
this Agreement or the Transactions, provided that, in the case of clause (i),
such Party affords the other Parties a reasonable opportunity to first review
the content of the proposed disclosure and provide reasonable and timely
comment regarding same; provided, however, that the Partnership shall not be
required by this Section 6.5 to consult with any other Party with respect to a
public announcement in connection with the receipt and existence of an
Alternative Proposal and matters related thereto or an Adverse Recommendation
Change, subject to the obligations set forth in Section 6.3.

Section 6.6 Access to Information; Confidentiality.

(a) From the date of this Agreement to the Partnership Merger Effective Time
or the earlier termination of this Agreement, upon reasonable prior written
notice and subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information,
each of the Partnership Entities and Holdings shall, and shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause its Subsidiaries, officers, directors
and Representatives to, (i) afford Parent and its Representatives reasonable
access (and, with respect to books and records, the right to copy), during
normal business hours, to their respective officers, employees, agents,
properties, assets, books, offices, facilities and records and other
information reasonably requested by Parent (in each case, whether in physical
or electronic form), (ii) furnish promptly during normal business hours such
information concerning the business, properties, offices, facilities, assets
and liabilities of the Partnership Group Entities as Parent or its
Representatives reasonably request and (iii) reasonably cooperate with Parent
and its Representatives to organize and facilitate meetings among Parent and
its Representatives and the Partnership Entities and their respective
Representatives to be located at the offices and facilities of the Partnership
Group Entities at such times as Parent may reasonably request; provided,
however, that such access shall be provided on a basis that minimizes the
disruption to the operations of the Partnership Entities and in no event shall
include invasive sampling or testing of the Environment; and provided further,
that the foregoing will not require the Partnership Entities (i) to permit any
inspection, or to disclose any information, that in the reasonable judgment of
the Partnership Entities (after consultation with its outside legal counsel)
would (A) result in the disclosure of any trade secrets of third parties or
violate any of its obligations with respect to confidentiality if the
Partnership Entities have used commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the
Consent of such third party to such inspection or disclosure or (B) result in
a violation of any Antitrust Laws, (ii) to disclose any privileged information
of the Partnership Group Entities to the extent such disclosure would result
in the loss of such privilege (in each case, it being agreed that the
Partnership Entities shall give notice to Parent of the fact that it is
withholding such access or information and thereafter the Partnership Entities
shall use 

their respective commercially reasonable efforts to cause such access or
information, as applicable, to be provided, or made available, in a manner
that would not reasonably be expected to cause such a disclosure, violation or
waiver) or (iii) to disclose any information relating to the Partnership
Entities' consideration of the Transactions, including the minutes of the
General Partner Board or GP Conflicts Committee.

(b) Except for disclosures permitted by the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement, Parent and its Representatives will hold all information received
from the Partnership Entities pursuant to this Section 6.6 in confidence in
accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

Section 6.7 Indemnification and Insurance.

(a) From and after the Partnership Merger Effective Time, CD CEI V JV Holdco
shall, and Parent shall cause the General Partner and the Surviving Entities
to, indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Indemnified Person against all
liabilities, losses, damages, claims, fees, costs, expenses (including
attorneys' fees), interest, awards, judgments, fines, inquiries, penalties
suffered or incurred and amounts paid in settlement (collectively, "Losses")
in connection with any Proceeding arising out of or pertaining to the fact
that the Indemnified Person is or was an officer, director, employee,
fiduciary or agent of the General Partner or any Partnership Group Entity
whether commenced, asserted or claimed before or after the Partnership Merger
Effective Time to the fullest extent permitted under Applicable Law but
subject to any limitations and exclusions of any such indemnity as set forth
in the General Partner LLC Agreement, the Partnership Agreement or the OpCo
LLC Agreement (or in the comparable governing documents of any other
Partnership Group Entity); provided, however, that there shall be no
obligation of CD CEI V JV Holdco, the General Partner, the Partnership or OpCo
to indemnify any Indemnified Person to the extent of such Indemnified Person's
fraud or willful misconduct. In the event of any Proceeding in which an
Indemnified Person is entitled to indemnification pursuant to the immediately
preceding sentence, (i) Parent, the General Partner and the Surviving Entities
shall pay, as incurred, the fees and expenses of the Indemnified Person, in
advance of the final disposition of any such Proceeding to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law and, if required, upon receipt of any undertaking
required by applicable Law to repay the amounts so advanced to the extent it
is ultimately determined that such Indemnified Person is not entitled to
indemnification, and (ii) Parent, the General Partner and the Surviving
Entities will cooperate in the defense of any such matter; provided that none
of Parent, the General Partner or the Surviving Entities shall settle,
compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any pending or
threatened Proceeding in which indemnification could be sought by such
Indemnified Person hereunder, unless such settlement, compromise or consent
includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person from all
liability arising out of such Proceeding or such Indemnified Person otherwise
consents in writing.

(b) All rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation
from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Partnership Merger Effective Time now existing in favor of any Indemnified
Person as provided in the General Partner LLC Agreement, the Partnership
Agreement or the OpCo LLC Agreement (or in 

the comparable governing documents of any other Partnership Group Entity),
under applicable Law, or otherwise, shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms from and after the Partnership Merger Effective
Time, and shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner
that would adversely affect and right thereunder of any such Indemnified
Person.

(c) Prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time, the Partnership Entities
will purchase a single-premium pre-paid "tail policy" for a period of six
years from the Closing Date having coverage terms, benefits, levels of
coverage (including limits, self-insured retentions and deductibles) and other
terms and conditions which are in the aggregate not less advantageous to the
Indemnified Persons as those in effect under the director and officer
insurance policies (the "DandO Insurance") of the Partnership Group Entities or
the General Partner as of immediately prior to the Closing. Parent shall cause
such policy to be maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and
cause all obligations thereunder to be honored by the General Partner and the
Surviving Entities. If the Partnership Entities for any reason fail to obtain
such "tail policy" as of the Partnership Merger Effective Time, the General
Partner and the Surviving Entities shall, and Parent shall cause the General
Partner and the Surviving Entities to, continue to maintain in effect for a
period of at least six years from and after the Partnership Merger Effective
Time the DandO Insurance in place as of immediately prior to the Closing having
coverage terms, benefits, levels of coverage (including limits, self-insured
retentions and deductibles) and other terms and conditions which are in the
aggregate not less advantageous to the Indemnified Persons as of immediately
prior to the Closing, or the General Partner and the Surviving Entities shall,
and Parent shall cause the Surviving Entities to, use reasonable best efforts
to purchase comparable DandO Insurance for such six-year period having coverage
benefits, levels of coverage (including limits, self-insured retentions and
deductibles) and other terms and conditions which are in the aggregate not
less advantageous to the Indemnified Persons as of immediately prior to the
Closing; provided, however, that in no event shall Parent, the General Partner
or the Surviving Entities be required to expend for such policies an annual
premium amount in excess of 300% of the annual premiums currently paid by the
Partnership Entities for such insurance; and, provided further that if the
annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the General
Partner and the Surviving Entities shall obtain a policy with the greatest
coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount.

(d) The rights of any Indemnified Person under this Section 6.7 will be in
addition to any other rights such Indemnified Person may have under the
Organizational Documents of the Partnership Group Entities or the General
Partner, any Contract with any Partnership Group Entity or the General
Partner, the DRULPA or the DLLCA. The provisions of this Section 6.7 will
survive the Closing Date for a period of six years and are expressly intended
to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Persons and
their respective heirs, successors, assigns, executors and administrators;
provided, however, that in the event that any claim or claims for
indemnification set forth in this Section 6.7 are asserted or made within such
six-year period, all rights to indemnification in respect of any such claim or
claims will continue until disposition of all such claims. If Parent, the
General Partner, the Surviving Entities or any of their respective successors
or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person or (ii)
transfers 

or conveys all or substantially all of their businesses or assets to any other
Person, then, in each such case, to the extent necessary, a proper provision
shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent, the General
Partner or the Surviving Entities, as the case may be, shall assume the
obligations of Parent, the General Partner and the Surviving Entities set
forth in this Section 6.7.

Section 6.8 Transaction Litigation. The Partnership Entities and Holdings will
give the Parent Entities prompt notice of any Proceeding commenced or, to the
Knowledge of the Partnership Entities, threatened, against any of them or
their respective directors, officers, managers, partners or Affiliates
relating to this Agreement or the Transactions (collectively, "Transaction
Litigation") and shall keep the Parent Entities reasonably informed with
respect to the status thereof (including by promptly furnishing to Parent and
its Representatives such information relating to such Proceeding as may be
reasonably requested). The Partnership Entities and Holdings shall reasonably
consult with the Parent Entities regarding the defense or settlement of any
Transaction Litigation and shall not compromise, settle, come to an
arrangement regarding or agree to compromise, settle or come to an arrangement
regarding any Transaction Litigation or consent to the same, without the prior
written consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed); provided that the Partnership Entities and Holdings
may at any time, without Parent's consent, settle such Transaction Litigation
pursuant to settlements providing solely for (i) money damages and the payment
of attorney's fees in an aggregate amount not in excess of amounts equal to
the dollar amount of the limits of the DandO Insurance and for which the
insurers under the DandO Insurance have accepted liability along with a
dismissal of such Transaction Litigation that either is on a with prejudice
basis or a release of all claims executed by all Persons that are the
counterparties to such Transaction Litigation and/or (ii) providing additional
disclosure in the Proxy Statement that does not disparage the Parent Entities,
the Partnership Entities, any of their respective Affiliates or any of their
respective businesses.

Section 6.9 Partnership Debt.

(a) Existing Credit Facility. At the OpCo Merger 1 Effective Time, the Initial
Surviving LLC shall (i) use a portion of the Debt Financing Proceeds to repay
or cause to be repaid all Indebtedness, liabilities and other obligations

and Liens securing, such Indebtedness, liabilities and obligations, in each
case, including obtaining customary payoff letters and causing the filing of
any UCC-3 termination statements, mortgage releases or similar documents
evidencing termination or release of such Indebtedness and Liens. In
connection with the foregoing, the Parent Entities and the Partnership
Entities (other than OpCo) shall cooperate with OpCo to cause to be terminated
and released any and all guarantees of, and Liens securing, such Indebtedness,
liabilities and obligations, in each case.

(b) First Solar Note. At the OpCo Merger 1 Effective Time, the Initial
Surviving LLC shall use a portion of the Debt Financing Proceeds to (i) pay in
full that 

certain Promissory Note, dated as of December 1, 2016, by OpCo in favor of
First Solar Asset Management, LLC (the "First Solar Note") and (ii) terminate
or release, or cause to be terminated and released, any and all Liens securing
such Indebtedness, liabilities and obligations, in each case, including
obtaining customary payoff letters, releases or similar documents evidencing
termination or release of such Indebtedness and Liens. In connection with the
foregoing, the Parent Entities and the Partnership Entities shall cooperate to
cause to be terminated and released any and all Liens securing such
Indebtedness, liabilities and obligations.

(c) Cooperation. The Parties shall, and the Partnership Entities shall cause
the other Partnership Group Entities to, reasonably cooperate with the Parent
Entities in the foregoing and in the preparation, execution, delivery and
filing of the necessary and appropriate documentation in connection with any
actions reasonably requested by Parent pursuant to Section 6.9(a) and (b) and
in order to satisfy the conditions set forth in Section 7.3(d) and Section
7.3(e), including the release on the Closing Date of any outstanding letters
of credit under the Existing Credit Facility by the beneficiaries that are
holding such outstanding letters of credit and the release on the Closing Date
of all Liens securing the liability and obligations associated with such
outstanding letters of credit.

Section 6.10 Fees and Expenses. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, including Section 6.4(f), all fees and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement, the Mergers and the Transactions shall be paid
by the Party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Mergers are
consummated, except that the expenses incurred by the Partnership Entities in
connection with the filing, printing and mailing of the Proxy Statement
(including applicable SEC filing fees) and the solicitation of the Shareholder
Approval and the Unitholder Approval shall be borne one-half by Parent and
one-half by the Partnership Entities. The Partnership Entities shall use their
reasonable best efforts to cause any fees and expenses that they incur in
connection with this Agreement to be paid at or prior to the Closing and, to
the extent that any fees and expenses are not paid prior to the Closing, the
Partnership Entities shall use their reasonable best efforts to obtain an
estimate of any fees and expenses that will remain outstanding after the
Closing. Prior to the date hereof, the Partnership Entities have delivered to
Parent a budget estimating the fees and expenses that the Partnership Entities
expect to incur in connection with this Agreement. The Partnership Entities
will exercise reasonable best efforts to incur fees and expenses consistent
with such budget.

Section 6.11 Termination of Trading and Deregistration. The Partnership
Entities and Holdings will cooperate with the Parent Entities and use
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and
all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on their part under
applicable Laws and rules and policies of NASDAQ to cause (a) the delisting of
the Class A Shares from NASDAQ and the termination of trading of the Class A
Shares on the Closing Date and prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time
and (b) the deregistration of the Class A Shares under the Exchange Act as
promptly as practicable after the Partnership Merger Effective Time.

Section 6.12 Takeover Laws. If any Takeover Law is or may become applicable to
the Transactions, the Partnership Entities and their respective boards of
directors or managers and/or the Parent Entities and their respective boards
of directors or managers, as applicable, will grant such approvals and take
such actions as are necessary so that the Transactions may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and the
Parties will otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such
Takeover Law on the Mergers. 

Section 6.13 Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Partnership Merger Effective
Time, to the extent reasonably necessary, the Partnership Entities will take
all such steps as may be necessary or appropriate to cause any dispositions of
Class A Shares resulting from the Transactions by each individual who is
subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act
with respect to the Partnership Entities to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

Section 6.14 FIRPTA Certificate. At the Closing, Holdings and each Sponsor
shall deliver to Parent a certificate, dated as of the Closing Date, which
satisfies the requirements set forth in Treasury Regulation Section
1.1445-2(b)(2).

Section 6.15 Tax Matters.

(a) Holders of OpCo Units will be allocated all items of income, gain, loss,
deduction and credit of OpCo for income Tax purposes through and including the
Closing Date.

(b) The Sponsors will be responsible for the preparation of all OpCo and
General Partner Tax Returns with respect to all taxable periods ending on or
before the Closing Date that are required to be filed or delivered after the
Closing Date, which Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with
the past practices of OpCo or the General Partner, as applicable, unless
otherwise required by applicable Law; provided that any out-of-pocket, third
party costs, fees or expenses incurred with respect to the foregoing shall be
borne by OpCo or the General Partner. The Sponsors will provide to Parent
copies of all such OpCo Income Tax Returns at least 30 days prior to the date
on which such OpCo Income Tax Return is required to be filed or delivered for
Parent's review and comment, and any reasonable comments of Parent shall be
considered and accepted for incorporation into such OpCo Income Tax Return by
the Sponsors prior to filing or delivery by OpCo.

(c) With respect to any Tax Return of OpCo or the General Partner for a
taxable period beginning on or before the Closing Date and ending after the
Closing Date that is required to be filed by OpCo or the General Partner after
the Closing Date, (w) Parent shall cause such Tax Return to be prepared (in a
manner consistent with practices followed in prior taxable periods and in
compliance with applicable Law) and, in making allocations to Sponsors for
such taxable period, shall use the interim closing method in accordance with
applicable Treasury Regulations, treating the books of the applicable
partnership as closing as of the end of the Closing Date, (x) Parent shall
deliver a draft of such Tax Return to the Sponsors for their review and
comment at least fifteen (15) days prior to the due date (including
extensions) for filing such Tax Return, (y) any reasonable comments of the
Sponsors shall be considered and accepted for incorporation into such Tax
Return prior to the date for filing, and (z) Parent shall cause such Tax
Return to be executed and duly and timely filed with the appropriate
Governmental Authority and shall pay all Taxes shown as due and payable on
such Tax Return..

(d) Following the Closing, the Parties shall, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates (and their respective officers, directors, employees or agents) to,
cooperate with the other Parties regarding the preparation and filing of all
OpCo and General Partner Tax 

Returns, including providing the other Parties with reasonable access, during
normal business hours, to their respective offices, employees, outside
accountants, books, records and Tax Returns, subject to the proviso in Section
6.6(b).

(e) Following the Closing, Parent shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates
(including OpCo) not to, amend, refile or otherwise modify any OpCo Income Tax
Returns filed prior to the Closing Date or pursuant to Section 6.15(b), except
with the consent of the Sponsors (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) or as required by applicable Law. With
respect to any tax audit or similar proceeding with respect to tax periods of
OpCo beginning prior to the Closing Date or that otherwise subject a Sponsor
or Sponsor Affiliate to a greater tax liability than it would have borne if
the Opco Merger 1 Partnership Distribution, OpCo Merger 1 OpCo Distribution,
and associated borrowing never occurred and the OpCo Merger Consideration had
been increased by the amount of the OpCo Merger 1 OpCo Distribution (an "Audit
Proceeding"), (i) Parent and its Affiliates (including OpCo) shall promptly
notify Sponsors of the commencement of the proceeding, and (ii) Sponsors shall
have the right to participate in the proceeding, including the right to review
in advance and comment upon any written communications to the relevant
governmental authority and to receive reasonable advance notice from Parent
and its Affiliates (including OpCo) of, and to participate in, any meetings
with the governmental authority. Parent and its Affiliates (including OpCo)
shall not settle or otherwise compromise any such Audit Proceeding without the
consent of Sponsors, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. Further, Parent and its Affiliates (including OpCo)
shall not adopt any position in any such Audit Proceeding that would increase
the tax liability of Sponsor or its Affiliates without the consent of
Sponsors, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. In the event that the Sponsors do not consent to a position proposed
to be adopted by Parent and its Affiliates (including OpCo) with respect to
any such Audit Proceeding, the disputed positions shall be submitted to a
national accounting firm acceptable to both parties, whose determination over
the proper position to take shall be binding on the parties. Following the
Closing, Parent shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates (including OpCo) and
any person designated as the "partnership representative" of OpCo in
accordance with the rules prescribed pursuant to Section 6223 of the Code not
to, make any available election under Section 6226 of the Code to the extent
such election would adversely affect Sponsors as a result of taxable items or
events arising after the Closing that are not related to the Transactions.
Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, Parent and its Affiliates
(including OpCo) shall not be precluded from making any available election
under Section 6226 of the Code.

(f) The Parties shall cause OpCo to have a valid election in effect under
Section 754 of the Code for any taxable period which includes the Closing Date
and shall not revoke such election without the consent of Parent.

(g) The Parties agree that the OpCo Merger Consideration (plus any applicable
liabilities for U.S. federal income Tax purposes) will be allocated among the
underlying assets of OpCo (and, to the extent applicable, the Subsidiaries of
OpCo or the other Equity Securities owned by OpCo) for purposes of Sections
743(b), 751, 755 and 1060 of the Code and the statements required to be filed
under Treasury Regulations Sections 1.751-1(a)(3) and 1.743-1(k) (and any
similar provision of state, local or foreign Law, as applicable) (the "OpCo
Merger Consideration Allocation"). Within 45 days after the Closing Date,
Parent shall provide the Sponsors with a proposed OpCo Merger Consideration
Allocation. Within 30 days after the date of the delivery of such proposed
allocation to the Sponsors, the Sponsors shall propose to Parent any changes
to 

such allocation in writing or otherwise shall be deemed to have agreed with
such allocation upon the expiration of such 30 day period. The Sponsors and
Parent shall cooperate in good faith to mutually agree to such allocation and
shall reduce such agreement to writing. The Parties shall file timely any
forms and statements required under U.S. federal or state income Laws with
respect to Taxes consistent with such OpCo Merger Consideration Allocation.
The Parties shall not file any Tax Return or otherwise take any position with
respect to Taxes which is inconsistent with such OpCo Merger Consideration
Allocation, except as required by a final "determination" within the meaning
of Section 1313 of the Code or any similar state Law.

(h) Parent and the Partnership Entities shall each be liable for and shall pay
one-half of any transfer, conveyance, documentary, sales, use, registration,
stamp, excise, value-added or other similar Taxes payable by reason of the
Transactions ("Transfer Taxes"). The Party responsible under applicable Tax
Law for submitting payment of such Transfer Taxes to the applicable taxing
authority shall file all necessary returns, reports or other filings with
respect to all such Taxes. Should a Partnership Entity or any other Person be
responsible for submitting payment of a Transfer Tax for which Parent is
responsible under this Section 6.15(h), Parent shall either (i) provide such
Person with the funds necessary to pay such Transfer Tax at least five (5)
days before such Transfer Tax is due, or (ii) if such Person waives the
requirement in (i), promptly reimburse such Person for such Transfer Tax.

Section 6.16 Financing.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, (i) Parent shall
take all actions, and do (or cause to be done) all things, necessary, proper
or advisable to obtain the Equity Funds, and (ii) Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain the Debt Financing on the terms and
conditions described in the Debt Commitment Letter and the Debt Fee Letter
(including the flex provisions), and shall not consent to any assignment of
the commitments set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter to which it has a
consent right without the Partnership's prior written consent or permit any
amendment or modification to be made to, or consent to any waiver of any
provision or remedy under, the Debt Commitment Letter or the Debt Fee Letter,
if such amendment, modification, consent or waiver would (A) reduce the
aggregate amount of the Debt Financing (including by changing the amount of
fees to be paid or original issue discount) from that contemplated in the Debt
Commitment Letter to an amount that, together with Equity Funds received by
Parent, would not enable Parent to meets its payment obligations under this
Agreement, including under Article II, or (B) impose new or additional
conditions or other terms or otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the
conditions to the receipt of the Debt Financing or any other terms in a manner
that would reasonably be expected to (1) delay or prevent the Closing, (2)
make the timely funding of the Financing or satisfaction of the conditions to
obtaining the Financing less likely to occur or (3) adversely impact the
ability of Parent to enforce its rights against the Debt Financing Sources
under the Debt Commitment Letter. For purposes of clarification, the foregoing
shall not prohibit Parent from amending the Debt Commitment Letter and the
Debt Fee Letter to add additional lender(s) (and Affiliates of such additional
lender(s)) as a party thereto so long as the addition of such lenders would
not reasonably be expected to (x) delay or prevent the Closing, (y) make the
timely funding of the Financing or satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining
the Financing less likely to occur or (z) adversely impact the ability of
Parent to enforce its rights against the Debt Financing Sources under the Debt
Commitment Letter (with any reference in this Agreement to the "Debt Financing
Sources" being deemed to include such additional lender(s)). Any reference in
this Agreement to (a) "Debt Financing" shall include the financing
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter as amended or modified in
compliance with this Section 6.16 and (b) "Debt Commitment Letter" shall
include such documents as amended or modified in compliance with this Section
6.16. 

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Parent shall use
its reasonable best efforts to (A) maintain in effect the Debt Commitment
Letter in accordance with its terms, (B) negotiate and enter into, as soon as
reasonably practicable (and in any event before the Closing), all definitive
agreements with respect to the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter on the terms and conditions contained in the Debt Commitment
Letter and the Debt Fee Letter (including the flex provisions), (C) satisfy on
a timely basis all conditions to the consummation of the Debt Financing that
are applicable to Parent or its Affiliates including the payment of any
commitment, engagement, placement or other fees or expenses required as a
condition to the Debt Financing, and consummate the portion of the Debt
Financing required for the Closing, as applicable, at or prior to such
Closing, (D) deliver a private placement memorandum as required by the Debt
Commitment Letter on or before March 7, 2018, (E) comply with its obligations
under the Debt Commitment Letter, the Debt Fee Letter and any definitive
agreements related to the Debt Financing, (F) cause the proceeds of any
issuance of notes, borrowings of loans or consummation of any other debt
financing that has the effect of reducing the principal amount of funds
available under the Debt Commitment Letter, and that are expected to be
received prior to the Closing Date, to be deposited by the financing sources
thereof into an escrow account and pursuant to escrow arrangements that are
not subject to any conditions more onerous than the Debt Commitment Letter,
(G) diligently and in good faith enforce its rights under the Debt Commitment
Letter and any definitive agreements related to the Debt Financing, including
(upon a good faith request of the Partnership) by filing one or more lawsuits
against the Debt Financing Sources to fully enforce the Debt Financing
Sources' obligations (and the rights of Parent and its Affiliates) thereunder
in the event of a breach by the lenders under the Debt Commitment Letter, (H)
in the event that all conditions in the Debt Commitment Letter have been
satisfied, cause the Debt Financing Sources to fund on the Closing Date the
Debt Financing required to consummate the transactions contemplated by the
Transaction Documents and (I) cause the Debt Financing Proceeds to be
contributed to OpCo Merger Sub 1 on the Closing Date. Parent shall refrain
from taking, directly or indirectly, any action that would reasonably be
expected to result in a failure of (x) any of the conditions related to the
Debt Financing or (y) the Equity Funds to be unavailable to Parent for
purposes of satisfying its payment obligations hereunder and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby on the Closing Date.

(c) Parent shall keep the Partnership informed on a reasonably current basis
and in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Debt
Financing and provide to the Partnership copies of all executed definitive
documents related to the Debt Financing (provided that the Debt Fee Letter may
be redacted as contemplated by Section 5.9 and to omit the numerical fee
amounts and certain other commercially sensitive numbers and provisions set
forth therein). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall
give the Partnership prompt notice (i) of any breach, default, termination or
repudiation by any party to the Debt Commitment Letter or definitive document
related to the Debt Financing of which Parent becomes aware, (ii) of the
receipt by Parent of any notice or other communication from any Person with
respect to any (A) actual or potential breach, default, termination or
repudiation by any party to the Debt Commitment Letter or any definitive
document related to the Debt Financing, of any provisions of the Debt
Commitment Letter or any definitive document related to the Debt Financing or
(B) material dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to the Debt
Commitment Letter or any definitive document related to the Debt Financing and
(iii) of the occurrence of any event or development that Parent expects to
have a material and adverse impact on the ability of Parent to obtain on a
timely basis all or any portion of the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter on the terms, in the manner or from the sources contemplated
by the Debt Commitment Letter or the definitive documents related to the Debt
Financing. As soon as reasonably practicable, but in any event within three
calendar days of the date the Partnership delivers Parent a written request,
Parent shall provide any information reasonably requested by the Partnership
relating to any circumstance referred to in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of the
immediately 

preceding sentence.

(d) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, if any portion of
the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions
contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter and the Debt Fee Letter (including
the flex provisions), Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange
and obtain as promptly as practicable alternative financing from alternative
sources on terms and conditions that do not contain conditions to funding that
are materially more adverse, in the aggregate, to Parent than those contained
in the Debt Commitment Letter and the Debt Fee Letter, and in an amount at
least equal to the amount of the Debt Financing or such unavailable portion
thereof, as the case may be (the "Alternative Debt Financing"), and to obtain
a new financing commitment letter with respect to such Alternative Debt
Financing (the "New Debt Commitment Letter") which shall replace the existing
Debt Commitment Letter, a true, complete and correct copy of which (together
with the Debt Fee Letter) shall be promptly provided to the Partnership. In
the event any New Debt Commitment Letter is obtained, (i) any reference in
this Agreement to the "Debt Financing" shall mean the debt financing
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters as modified pursuant to clause
(ii) below, (ii) any reference in this Agreement to the "Debt Commitment
Letter" shall be deemed to include the Debt Commitment Letters that are not
superseded by a New Debt Commitment Letter at the time in question and the New
Debt Commitment Letters to the extent then in effect, (iii) any reference in
this Agreement to "Debt Fee Letter" shall be deemed to include any fee letter
relating to the Debt Commitment Letters that are not superseded by a New Debt
Commitment Letter at the time in question and any fee letter relating to New
Debt Commitment Letters to the extent then in effect and (iv) any reference in
this Agreement to the "Debt Financing Sources" shall be deemed to include the
parties thereto providing such Alternative Debt Financing.

(e) Parent acknowledges and agrees that it is not a condition to the Closing
or to any of its other obligations under this Agreement that Parent obtain
financing (including the Equity Funds and the Debt Financing) for, or related
to, any of the Transactions. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Debt Financing
or the Equity Funds have not been obtained, Parent shall continue to be
obligated, subject to the fulfillment or waiver of the applicable conditions
set forth in Article VII and the other terms of this Agreement (including any
provisions of this Agreement that may limit the availability of specific
performance or other equitable remedies in the event that the Parent
Termination Fee is paid), to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

Section 6.17 Financing Cooperation. The Partnership agrees to provide
reasonable cooperation in connection with the arrangement and consummation of,
and the negotiation of agreements with respect to, the Debt Financing and any
Alternative Debt Financing. In furtherance of and not in limitation of the
foregoing, the Partnership shall (a) cause the management of the Partnership,
OpCo and their respective Subsidiaries to be reasonably available, on
reasonable advance notice, to Parent and the Debt Financing Sources providing
the Debt Financing and any Alternative Debt Financing to participate in due
diligence sessions, (b) assist in the preparation of one or more appropriate
and customary offering documents and assisting Parent and the Debt Financing
Sources providing the Debt Financing and any Alternative Debt Financing in
preparing other appropriate and customary marketing materials, in each case to
be used in connection with the Debt Financing and any Alternative Debt
Financing, and (c) request the independent auditors with respect to the
Partnership, OpCo and their respective Subsidiaries to prepare and deliver
"comfort letters," dated the date of each offering document used in connection 

with any transaction in connection with the Debt Financing and any Alternative
Debt Financing (with appropriate bring down comfort letters delivered on the
closing date of the Debt Financing and any Alternative Debt Financing), in
compliance with professional standards and otherwise on terms reasonably
acceptable to Parent, as the case may be, in each of the foregoing cases as
may be necessary and customary in connection with a financing substantially
similar to the Debt Financing and any Alternative Debt Financing; provided,
however, that the Partnership shall be reimbursed promptly (and in any event
with 10 Business Days of providing invoices to Parent) by Parent for all
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Partnership in connection
with the foregoing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this
Section 6.17 shall require (i) any officer, employee, director or consultant
of the Partnership, OpCo or any of their respective Subsidiaries to
participate in any way with any Debt Financing or any Alternative Debt
Financing, any capital markets transactions conducted by or on behalf of
Parent, any due diligence sessions, management presentations, roadshows or
other marketing activities in connection with any Debt Financing, Alternative
Debt Financing or any other capital markets transactions or related
transactions by Parent in connection with financing the transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Documents, (ii) the Partnership or any
management of the Partnership, OpCo or any of their respective Subsidiaries to
engage in any action that would interfere unreasonably with the business of
the Partnership, OpCo and their respective Subsidiaries, or (iii) the
Partnership, OpCo or any of their respective Affiliates to pay any commitment
or other similar fee or incur any other liability in connection with any Debt
Financing or any Alternative Debt Financing; provided, however, that the
General Partner, the Partnership and OpCo exercise reasonable efforts to make
their respective management reasonably available in connection with their
obligation to provide reasonable cooperation to the Parent pursuant to this
Section 6.17. Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Partnership, OpCo
and their respective Affiliates and their respective directors, officers and
employees from and against any and all Losses suffered or incurred by them in
connection with the arrangement and completion of any Debt Financing or any
Alternative Debt Financing, capital markets transactions or related
transactions by Parent in connection with financing the transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Documents and any information utilized in
connection therewith except with respect to information in respect of the
Partnership, OpCo and their respective Subsidiaries supplied by the
Partnership and its Representatives specifically for inclusion or
incorporation by reference therein, to the extent such Losses are not caused
by a breach by the General Partner, Partnership or OpCo of this Agreement or
otherwise caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the General
Partner, Partnership, OpCo or any of their respective Affiliates.

Section 6.18 Related Party Transactions. Prior to the Closing, the Partnership
Entities and Holdings shall, and shall cause their Subsidiaries to, take such
actions as are necessary or required to terminate in full all Contracts by and
between the Partnership Group Entities, on the one hand, and the General
Partner and any of its Affiliates (other than the Partnership Group Entities),
on the other hand, other than those Contracts set forth in Section 6.18 of the
Partnership Disclosure Letter, without any liability, obligation or additional
cost for any party thereto or their Affiliates following the Closing.

Section 6.19 GP Conflicts Committee. Prior to the earlier of the Closing and
the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, none of the
Partnership Entities shall, and Holdings shall not permit any Partnership
Entities to, without the consent of the GP Conflicts Committee, eliminate the
GP Conflicts Committee, revoke or materially diminish the authority of 

the GP Conflicts Committee or remove or cause the removal of any director of
the General Partner Board that is a member of the GP Conflicts Committee
either as a member of such board or member of such committee without the
affirmative vote of the members of the General Partner Board, including the
affirmative vote of each of the other members of the GP Conflicts Committee.
For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6.19 shall not apply to the filling
in accordance with the provisions of the applicable governing documents of the
General Partner of any vacancies caused by the death, incapacity or
resignation of any such director.

Section 6.20 Transition Services Agreement. In order to ensure the orderly
transition of the business of the Partnership Group Entities to Parent, the
Partnership shall negotiate in good faith with the Sponsors one or more
transition services agreement(s) between the Partnership and the Sponsors or
their Affiliates, pursuant to which the Sponsors or their Affiliates shall
provide customary information technology and financial reporting, tax,
treasury, insurance, legal and other general support services to the
Partnership.

Section 6.21 Support Obligations. No later than five (5) Business Days
following the date of this Agreement, the General Partner shall deliver to the
Parent Entities a true and complete list of all of the Support Obligations.

all of the SPWR Tax Equity Entity Class C Interests shall have been
transferred to the relevant SPWR Tax Equity Entity Class B Member, such that
at the completion of the Closing, the relevant SPWR Tax Equity Entity Class B
Member owns all of the applicable SPWR Tax Equity Entity Class C Interests

where the failure of such representations and warranties to be so true and
correct (without giving effect to any limitation as to "materiality" or

(a) Generally. In the event of the termination of this Agreement as provided
in Section 8.1, written notice thereof will be given to the other Party or
Parties, specifying the provision of this Agreement pursuant to which such

8.2(b) and Section 8.2(c), there will be no liability on the part of any Party
or their respective directors, managers, officers and Affiliates; provided

intentional breach by such Party of this Agreement prior to such termination.

(b) Termination Fee; Parent Expense Reimbursement.

(i) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the General Partner

Section 8.1(c)(ii), then OpCo shall pay Parent the Termination Fee, by wire

Regulatory Approval from the relevant Governmental Authority), Section
8.1(b)(iii), Section 8.1(c)(i) or Section 8.1(c)(iii), then OpCo shall pay
Parent the Parent Expense Reimbursement, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, no later than three (3) Business Days after the date of such
termination.

(iv) In no event shall the Partnership Entities be required to pay the
Termination Fee or the Parent Expense Reimbursement on more than one occasion.
In the event that both the Termination Fee and the Parent Expense
Reimbursement are payable under the terms of this Agreement, Parent shall only
be entitled to receive, and the Partnership Entities shall only be required to
pay, the Termination Fee. 

(c) Parent Termination Fee; Partnership Expense Reimbursement.

(i) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the General Partner

contemplated by Section 9.9, the Parent Termination Fee or the Partnership
Expense Reimbursement.

(ii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the General
Partner pursuant to (A) Section 8.1(b)(i) if, at the time of such termination,
none of the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 or Section 7.2, other than
Section 7.2(f), have previously failed or are unable to be satisfied if this
Agreement were not terminated or (B) Section 8.1(b)(ii) due to an injunction

shall pay to OpCo the Partnership Expense Reimbursement by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, which amount shall be distributed to OpCo from
the Escrow Account no later than three (3) Business Days after the date of
such termination. In no event shall Parent be required to pay the Partnership
Expense Reimbursement on more than one occasion nor shall the Partnership
Entities be permitted or entitled to receive more than one of specific
performance as contemplated by Section 9.9, the Parent Termination Fee or the
Partnership Expense Reimbursement.

(d) Limitation of Liability.

(i) Except as set forth in Section 8.2(a), upon termination of this Agreement
for the circumstances described in Section 8.2(b), Parent's right, if any, to
receive the Termination Fee or the Parent Expense Reimbursement pursuant to
Section 8.2(b) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Parent Entities
and their respective Affiliates against Holdings, the Partnership Entities,
their respective Subsidiaries, the Non-Controlled Partnership Group Entities
and any of their respective former, current or future equityholders,
directors, managers, officers, Affiliates, agents or other Representatives for
any loss suffered as a result of any breach of any covenant or agreement in
this Agreement or the failure of the Transactions to be consummated, and upon
payment of such amount, none of Holdings, the Partnership Entities, their
respective Subsidiaries, the Non-Controlled Partnership Group Entities or any
of their respective former, current or future stockholders, directors,
officers, Affiliates, agents or other Representatives shall have any further
liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
Transactions. Except as set forth in Section 8.2(a), under no circumstances
shall the aggregate amount of damages payable by Holdings, the Partnership
Entities, their respective Subsidiaries, the Non-Controlled Partnership Group
Entities and any of their respective former, current or future equityholders,
directors, managers, officers, Affiliates, agents or other Representatives in
respect of breaches under this Agreement or any claim arising out of or
related to this Agreement, exceed the amounts specified in Section 8.2(b).
Since the Partnership 

is a publicly traded entity, any claim against the Partnership will likely
adversely affect its trading price, and any claim brought against the
Partnership Entities in excess of the amounts provided above shall result in a
waiver by Parent and its Affiliates to assert any claim hereunder.

(ii) Except as set forth in Section 8.2(a), upon termination of this Agreement
for the circumstances described in Section 8.2(c), the Partnership Group
Entities' right, if any, to receive the Parent Termination Fee or the
Partnership Expense Reimbursement pursuant to Section 8.2(c) shall be the sole
and exclusive remedy of the Partnership Group Entities and their respective
Affiliates against the Parent Entities their respective Subsidiaries and any
of their respective former, current or future equityholders, directors,
managers, officers, Affiliates, agents or other Representatives for any loss
suffered as a result of any breach of any covenant or agreement in this
Agreement or the failure of the Transactions to be consummated, and upon
payment of such amount, none of Parent Entities, their respective Subsidiaries
or any of their respective former, current or future stockholders, directors,
officers, Affiliates, agents or other Representatives shall have any further
liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
Transactions. Except as set forth in Section 8.2(a), under no circumstances
shall the aggregate amount of damages payable by Parent Entities and any of
their respective former, current or future equityholders, directors, managers,
officers, Affiliates, agents or other Representatives in respect of breaches
under this Agreement or any claim arising out of or related to this Agreement,
exceed the amounts specified in Section 8.2(c).

(iii) The provisions of Section 8.2(b), Section 8.2(c) and Section 8.2(d)(i)
and (ii) are an integral part of the Transactions and, without such
provisions, the Parties would not have entered into this Agreement. Each Party
acknowledges and agrees, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, that the
payment of the Termination Fee, the Parent Expense Reimbursement, the Parent
Termination Fee or the Partnership Expense Reimbursement is not a penalty but
instead is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that shall compensate the
Parent Entities or the Partnership Entities, and their respective Affiliates
in the circumstances in which the Termination Fee, the Parent Expense
Reimbursement, the Parent Termination Fee or the Partnership Expense
Reimbursement is payable for the efforts and resources expended and the
opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on
this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the Transactions,
which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision.

(e) Recoverable Damages. The Parent Entities acknowledge and agree that,
without in any way limiting the rights of the Partnership Entities under
Section 9.9, recoverable damages of the Partnership Entities under this
Agreement shall not be limited to reimbursement of expenses or out-of-pocket
costs but shall also include the benefit of the bargain lost by the
Shareholders and the Unitholders (including "lost premium"), taking into
consideration relevant matters, including the total amount payable to the
Shareholders and the Unitholders under this Agreement and the time value of
money, which, in each 

case, shall be deemed in such event to be damages of the Partnership Entities
and shall be recoverable by the Partnership Entities on behalf of the
Shareholders and the Unitholders.

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or any Transaction Document to
the contrary, each Partnership Entity agrees (on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates) that it will not bring or support any Proceeding (whether at law,
in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against any Persons (other than
the Parent Entities) that have committed to provide or otherwise enter into
Contracts in connection with the Debt Financing, and the Debt Financing
Sources shall have no liability or obligations to any Partnership Entity or
any of their Affiliates hereunder, arising out of or in connection with this
Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter, the Debt Fee Letter, the definitive
agreements with respect thereto or the Debt Financing. In addition, in no
event will any Debt Financing Source be liable to any Person for
consequential, special, exemplary, punitive or indirect damages (including any
loss of profits, business or anticipated savings) or damages of a tortious
nature.

ARTICLE IX 
MISCELLANEOUS

Section 9.1 No Survival, Etc. This Article IX and the agreements contained in
Article II, Section 6.7 and Section 6.10 shall survive the consummation of the
Mergers. Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, the representations,
warranties and agreements in this Agreement will terminate at the Partnership
Merger Effective Time, other than those covenants or agreements of the Parties
which by their terms apply, or are to be performed as a whole or in part,
after the Partnership Merger Effective Time. The Confidentiality Agreement
will (i) survive termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms
and (ii) terminate as of the Partnership Merger Effective Time.

Section 9.2 Amendment or Modification. At any time prior to the Partnership
Merger Effective Time, this Agreement may be amended or modified in any and
all respects, whether before or after receipt of the Shareholder Approval,
only by written agreement of the Parties; provided, however, that none of the
General Partner, the Partnership or OpCo may take or authorize any such
amendment or modification unless the General Partner Board has first referred
such action to the GP Conflicts Committee for its consideration and the GP
Conflicts Committee has approved such amendment or modification; provided
further, that after the Shareholder Approval has been obtained, no amendment
may be made that, pursuant to applicable Law or the General Partner's or the
Partnership's governing documents, requires further approval or adoption by
the Shareholders without such further approval or adoption; provided further,
at all time no amendments or modifications of, or supplements to, Section
6.17, Section 8.2(f), this Section 9.2, Section 9.4, Section 9.7 and Section
9.8 (and no definition set forth in this Agreement to the extent that an
amendment, supplement or modification of such definition would amend,
supplement or waive the substance of such sections) that affect the Debt
Financing Sources shall be effective without the prior written consent of the
Debt Financing Sources. This Agreement may not be amended, modified or
supplemented in any manner, whether by course of conduct or otherwise, except
by an instrument in writing specifically designated as an amendment hereto,
signed on behalf of each of the Parties (or, if applicable pursuant to the
preceding sentence, the Debt Financing Sources). 

Section 9.3 Extension of Time, Waiver, Etc. At any time prior to the
Partnership Merger Effective Time, any Party may, subject to applicable Law,
(a) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of any other
Party hereto, (b) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or acts of any other Party hereto or (c) waive compliance by the
other Party with any of the agreements contained herein or, except as
otherwise provided herein, waive any of such Party's conditions.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in addition to any approvals required by
General Partner's or the Partnership's governing documents or under this
Agreement or any Transaction Document, any such waiver or extension of any
Partnership Entity must be approved by the GP Conflicts Committee.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by any Partnership Entity
or any Parent Entity in exercising any right hereunder will operate as a
waiver thereof nor will any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any
other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right
hereunder. Any agreement on the part of a Party hereto to any such extension
or waiver will be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed
on behalf of such Party.

Section 9.4 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder will be assigned, in whole or in part, by
operation of Law or otherwise, by any of the Parties without the prior written
consent of the other Parties, except that Parent, Partnership Merger Sub and
each OpCo Merger Sub may assign, in their respective sole discretion, any or
all of their respective rights, interests and obligations under this Agreement
(a) to one or more controlled Affiliates of such Party, or (b) to any of their
financing sources (including the Debt Financing Sources) as collateral
security, but no such assignment will relieve Parent, Partnership Merger Sub
or either OpCo Merger Sub of any of its obligations hereunder. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit
of, and be enforceable by, the Parties and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. Any purported assignment not permitted under this Section
9.4 will be null and void.

Section 9.5 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (each
of which will be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together will
constitute one and the same agreement) and will become effective when one or
more counterparts have been signed by each of the Parties and delivered to the
other Parties.

Section 9.6 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including the Exhibits hereto),
the Partnership Disclosure Letter and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute
the entire agreement, and supersede all other prior Contracts, both written
and oral, among the Parties with respect to the subject matter of this
Agreement and thereof. In the event of a conflict between the terms of this
Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement, the terms of this Agreement will
control.

Section 9.7 No Third-Party Beneficiaries. Except for (a) Section 6.7 and
Section 9.13, which will inure to the benefit of the Persons benefiting
therefrom, who are expressly intended to be third party beneficiaries thereof

receive the Merger Consideration and the OpCo Merger 1 OpCo Distribution and
(c) Section 6.17, Section 8.2(f), Section 9.2, Section 9.4, this Section 9.7
and Section 9.8, which will insure to the benefit of the Debt Financing
Sources, who are expressly intended to be third party beneficiaries thereof,
this Agreement is not intended to, and does not, confer upon any Person other
than the Parties any rights or remedies hereunder, including the right to rely
upon the representations and warranties set forth herein. The representations
and warranties in this 

Agreement are the product of negotiations among the Parties and are for the
sole benefit of the Parties. Any inaccuracies in such representations and
warranties are subject to waiver by the Parties without notice or liability to
any other Person. In some instances, the representations and warranties in
this Agreement may represent an allocation among the Parties of risks
associated with particular matters regardless of the Knowledge of any of the
Parties. Consequently, Persons other than the Parties may not rely upon the
representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any
other date.



Section 9.8 Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial.

(a) This Agreement and all claims or causes of action (whether in contract,
tort or otherwise) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this
Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement
(including any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of or related
to any representation or warranty made in or in connection with this Agreement
or as an inducement to enter into this Agreement) will be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware (without
regard to conflicts of law principles thereof to the extent such principles
would require application of laws of another jurisdiction).

(b) By execution and delivery of this Agreement, each Party irrevocably agrees
that any Proceeding with respect to this Agreement and the rights and
obligations arising hereunder, or for recognition and enforcement of any
judgment in respect of this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising
hereunder brought by the other Party hereto or its successors or assigns, will
be brought and determined exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery and
any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the
Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular
matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware); provided
that each Party agrees that, except as specifically set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letter or the Debt Fee Letter (as applicable), all Financing Claims
shall be exclusively governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws
of the State of New York. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
each of the parties hereto agree that (a) none of the Partnership Group
Entities or any Parent Entity shall bring or support any Financing Claim in
any forum other than the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York (and appellate courts therefrom) or, if such court does
not have jurisdiction, any New York State Court sitting in the borough of
Manhattan in the City of New York, (b) submits for itself and its property
with respect to any Financing Claim to the exclusive jurisdiction of such
courts, (c) agrees that service of process, summons, notice or document by
registered mail addressed to it at its address provided herein shall be
effective service of process against it for any such Financing Claim in any
such court, (d) irrevocably waives to the fullest extent permitted by law any
objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of, and the
defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of, any Financing Claim in
any such court and (e) agrees that a final, non-appealable judgment in any
such Financing Claim shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law.
Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably submits with regard to any such
Proceeding for itself and in respect of its property, generally and
unconditionally, to the personal jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts 

and agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any
of the Transactions in any court other than the aforesaid courts. Each of the
Parties hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert as a defense,
counterclaim or otherwise, in any Proceeding with respect to this Agreement or
the Transactions, including any Financing Claim, (i) any claim that it is not
personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above named courts for any
reason other than the failure to serve in accordance with this Section 9.8,
(ii) any claim that it or its property is exempt or immune from the
jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such
courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment,
attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or
otherwise) and (iii) to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable Law,
any claim that (x) the Proceeding in such court is brought in an inconvenient
forum, (y) the venue of such Proceeding is improper or (z) this Agreement, or
the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts.

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT
MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE
AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR THEREBY, INCLUDING ANY FINANCING CLAIM. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY
HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN
THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (II) IT
UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (III) IT
MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO
THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS
IN THIS SECTION 9.8(c).

Section 9.9 Specific Enforcement. The Parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur and that the Parties would not have any adequate remedy at law in
the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached, and it is
accordingly agreed, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 6.16(e),
Section 8.2(d) and as otherwise set forth below, that the Parties will be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, in
each case, in accordance with this Section 9.9 in the Delaware Court of
Chancery or any federal court sitting in the State of Delaware, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.
Each of the Parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief as provided herein
on the basis that (x) any Party has an adequate remedy at law or (y) an award
of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or
equity. Each Party further agrees that no Party will be required to obtain,
furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a
condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this Section 9.9, and each
Party irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the obtaining, 

furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument. For the
avoidance of doubt, under no circumstances shall (i) the Parent Entities be
permitted or entitled to receive more than one of a grant of specific
performance in accordance with this Section 9.9, the Termination Fee or the
Parent Expense Reimbursement, as applicable, in respect of the same underlying
claim; and (ii) the Partnership Entities be permitted or entitled to receive
more than one of a grant of specific performance in accordance with this
Section 9.9, the Parent Termination Fee or the Partnership Expense
Reimbursement set forth in Section 8.2(c). The Partnership Entities
acknowledge and agree that in the event that all of the conditions in Section
8.1(d)(iii) have been satisfied and the General Partner would be entitled to
terminate this Agreement, and such failure by the Parent to consummate the
Closing is due to the failure to obtain the funds contemplated to be provided
pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letter (or any New Debt Commitment Letter), or
any other failure of the proceeds of the Debt Financing or Alternative Debt
Financing to be made available to the Parent (except, in each case, if such
failure to obtain the funds pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letter (or any New
Debt Commitment Letter) or the proceeds of the Debt Financing or Alternative
Debt Financing is due to the failure of the Equity Funds to be provided as
required by the Debt Commitment Letter (or any New Debt Commitment Letter),
the General Partner and the Partnership Entities shall have no right to pursue
(or continue pursuing) specific performance in accordance with, and subject to
the terms and conditions of, this Section 9.9 and the sole remedy of the
General Partner and the Partnership Entities shall be to terminate the
Agreement and receive of the Parent Termination Fee.

WHEREAS, Assignor owns [100% of the issued and outstanding membership
interests in the General Partner, including all rights and obligations
relating thereto and all economic and capital interests therein (the "GP

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, the mutual agreements
hereinafter contained and contained in the Merger Agreement and for other good
and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the Parties to this Agreement each hereby agrees as follows:

| 
---|--- 

1.

|

Assignment of [GP Equity Interest]/[IDRs]. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of the Merger Agreement, Assignor hereby assigns, transfers,
conveys and delivers to Assignee, and Assignee hereby acquires and accepts,
all of Assignor's rights, title and interest in and to the [GP Equity

Further Assurances. Assignor and Assignee covenant and agree that each will
do, execute and deliver, or cause to be done, executed and delivered all such
further instruments, documents, agreements and assurances as may be reasonably
requested by the other Party, which may be necessary or desirable, in order to
evidence and provide for the specific assignment of the [GP Equity
Interests]/[IDRs], and to carry out the purposes and intent of this Agreement. 

| 
---|--- 

3.

|

Parties in Interest. This Agreement is binding upon and is for the benefit of
the Parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. This
Agreement is not made for the benefit of any Person not a Party, and no Person
other than the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns
will acquire or have any benefit, right, remedy or claim under or by virtue of
this Agreement. 

| 
---|--- 

4.

|

Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations hereunder will be assigned, in whole or in part, by operation of
Law or otherwise, by either Party without the prior written consent of the
other Party, except that Assignee may assign, in its sole discretion, any or
all of its rights, interests and obligations under this Agreement (a) to one
or more controlled Affiliates of Assignee, or (b) to any of its financing
sources (including the Debt Financing Sources) as collateral security, but no
such assignment will relieve Assignee of any of its obligations hereunder.
Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure
to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Parties and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. Any purported assignment not permitted under
this Section 4 will be null and void. 

| 
---|--- 

5.

|

Waiver. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, no failure
to exercise, delay in exercising, or single or partial exercise of any right,
power or remedy by any Party, and no course of dealing between the Parties,
shall constitute a waiver of any such right, power or remedy. No waiver by a
Party of any default, misrepresentation or breach of warranty or covenant
hereunder, whether intentional or not, shall be deemed to extend to any prior
or subsequent default, misrepresentation or breach of warranty or covenant
hereunder or affect in any way any rights arising by virtue of any prior or
subsequent such occurrence. No waiver shall be valid unless in writing and
signed by the Party against whom such waiver is sought to be enforced. 

| 
---|--- 

6.

|

Severability. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed severable and
the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision hereof shall not affect
the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any
provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or any
circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable
provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may
be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or
unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be
affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or
unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or
the application thereof, in any other jurisdiction. 

| 
---|--- 

7.

|

Governing Law. This Agreement and the legal relations between the Parties
shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of
Delaware, USA without regard to any principles of conflicts of Laws of any
other jurisdiction. 

| 
---|--- 

8.

|

Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the other Transaction Documents and [General
Partner LLC Agreement]/[OpCo LLC Agreement] constitute the entire agreement
among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and
supersede other prior agreements and understandings both written and oral
among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof. This
Agreement, the other Transaction Documents and [General Partner LLC
Agreement]/[OpCo LLC Agreement], read as a whole, set forth the Parties'
rights, responsibilities and liabilities with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. In this Agreement, specific provisions prevail
over general provisions. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to
supersede, enlarge, restrict or modify any of the provisions of any of the
Transaction Documents or [General Partner LLC Agreement]/[OpCo LLC Agreement],
and the rights, obligations and liabilities of the relevant parties
thereunder, all of which shall survive the execution and delivery of this
Agreement as provided in, and subject to the limitations set forth in, the
Transaction Documents and [General Partner LLC Agreement]/[OpCo LLC
Agreement]. The Merger Agreement shall control in the event of any conflict
with the terms of this Agreement. 

| 
---|--- 

9.

|

Amendment. This Agreement may be modified, amended or supplemented only by
written agreement executed by the Parties. 

| 
---|--- 

10.

|

Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts
(delivery of which may occur via facsimile or other electronic means), each of
which shall be binding as of the date first written above, and, when
delivered, all of which shall constitute one and the same instrument. This
Agreement and any documents delivered pursuant hereto, and any amendments
hereto or thereto, to the extent signed and delivered by means of a facsimile
machine or as an attachment to an electronic mail message in "pdf" or similar
format, shall be treated in all manner and respects as an original agreement
or instrument and shall be considered to have the same binding legal effect as
if it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person. No Party
shall raise the use of a facsimile machine or electronic mail attachment in
"pdf" or similar format to deliver a signature, or the fact that any signature
or agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated through the use of
a facsimile machine or as an attachment to an electronic mail message, as a
defense to the formation of a contract and each such Party forever waives any
such defense. A facsimile signature or electronically scanned copy of a
signature shall constitute and shall be deemed to be sufficient evidence of a
Party's execution of this Agreement, without necessity of further proof. Each
such copy shall be deemed an original, and it shall not be necessary in making
proof of this Agreement to produce or account for more than one such
counterpart.
