(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be
merged with and into the Company. As a result of the Merger, the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall continue
as the Surviving Corporation. The Merger shall have the effects set forth
in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all of the property,
rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of the Company and
Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts,
Liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts,
Liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

(b) At the Effective Time, the Company Certificate shall, subject to Section
5.08, by virtue of or in connection with the Merger, be amended and restated
in its entirety to read as set forth in  _Exhibit A_ and, as so amended,
shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter further amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

 

(c) At the Effective Time, and without any further action on the part of the
Company and Merger Sub, the Company Bylaws shall be amended and restated in
their entirety to read as the bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, except that all references therein to Merger Sub
shall be automatically amended and shall become references to the
Surviving Corporation and, as so amended, shall be the bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided therein or by
applicable Law.

(d) The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall,
from and after the Effective Time, be the initial directors of the Surviving
Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their respective
successors shall have been duly elected, designated or qualified, or until
their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with
the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation. The
officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, from and
after the Effective Time, continue as the officers of the Surviving
Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their respective
successors shall have been duly elected, designated or qualified, or until
their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

(e) If at any time after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
determine, in its sole discretion, or shall be advised, that any deeds, bills
of sale, instruments of conveyance, assignments, assurances or any other
actions or things are necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of
record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest
in, to or under any of the rights, properties or assets of either of the
Company or Merger Sub acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation
as a result of, or in connection

 



\- 2 -   with, the Merger or otherwise to carry out this Agreement, then the officers
and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to execute and
deliver, in the name and on behalf of either the Company or Merger Sub, all
such deeds, bills of sale, instruments of conveyance, assignments and
assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of each of such
corporations or otherwise, all such other actions and things as may be
necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm any and all right, title or
interest in, to and under such rights, properties or assets in the Surviving
Corporation or otherwise to carry out this Agreement.

 

Section 1.02 _Closing and Effective Time of the Merger_. The closing of the
Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at 10:00 a.m., Pacific Time, on a
date to be specified by the parties (the " _Closing Date_ "), such date to be
no later than the second Business Day after satisfaction or waiver of all of
the conditions set forth in ARTICLE VI (other than those conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
fulfillment or waiver of those conditions at the Closing), at the offices of
Jones Day, 1755 Embarcadero Road, Palo Alto, California 94303, unless another
time, date or place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto. On the
Closing Date, or on such other date as Parent and the Company may agree to in
writing, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall cause a certificate of

Merger_ ") to be executed and filed with the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL and shall
make all other filings or recordings required under the DGCL. The Merger
shall become effective at the time the Certificate of Merger shall have been
duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or such later
date and time as is agreed upon by the parties and specified in the
Certificate of Merger, such date and time hereinafter referred to as the "
_Effective Time_."

Section 1.03 _Meeting of Stockholders to Approve the Merger_.

(a) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to, within five
Business Days after the date of this Agreement, prepare and file with the SEC
preliminary proxy materials for the Special Meeting (together with any
amendments and supplements thereto and any other required proxy materials,
the " _Proxy Statement_ ") relating to the Merger and this Agreement. Subject
to Section 5.03(d) and Section 5.03(e), the Company shall include the Company
Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement. Parent shall use its reasonable
best efforts to, within four Business Days after the date of this Agreement,
provide the Company with such information concerning Parent and Merger Sub as
may be reasonably requested by the Company for inclusion in the Proxy
Statement.

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 1.03(a), prior to filing the
preliminary Proxy Statement, a definitive Proxy Statement or any other filing
with the SEC in connection with the Transactions, the Company shall provide
Parent and its counsel with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
each such filing in advance, and the Company shall include in such filing all
comments reasonably proposed by Parent in respect of such filings. The Company
shall notify Parent promptly of the receipt of any oral or written comments
from the SEC or its staff (or of notice of the SECs intent to review) and of
any request by the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy
Statement or any other filing with the SEC in connection with the Transactions
or for additional or supplemental information in connection therewith. The
Company shall, as promptly as practicable after the

 



\- 3 -   receipt of such comments from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Proxy
Statement or any other such filing (i) supply Parent with copies of all
written correspondence received in connection therewith and (ii) provide
Parent a reasonably detailed description of any oral comments received in
connection therewith. The Company (1) shall provide Parent with a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on any responses to comments or inquiries
by the SEC with respect to any filings related to the Transactions, (2) shall
include in such response all comments reasonably proposed by Parent in respect
of the filings, (3) shall not file or mail such document, or respond to the
SEC, prior to receiving the approval of Parent, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed, and (4) shall provide Parent and its counsel
with a reasonable opportunity to participate in any discussions or meetings
with the SEC or its staff with respect to such filings. The Company shall
respond in good faith to any comments by the SEC as promptly as practical.
Parent shall provide its comments to the Company as promptly as practicable.

 

(c) If the Company: (i) does not receive comments from the SEC with respect to
the preliminary Proxy Statement, the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to file definitive proxy materials (including the definitive Proxy
Statement) with the SEC and cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed
to the stockholders of the Company on or prior to the third Business
Day after the expiration of the 10-day waiting period provided in Rule
14a-6(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, or (ii) does receive comments
from the SEC with respect to the preliminary Proxy Statement, the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to file definitive proxy materials
(including the definitive Proxy Statement) with the SEC and cause the
definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed to the stockholders of the Company on
or prior to the third Business Day immediately following clearance by the SEC
with respect to such comments.

(d) If, at any time prior to the date of the Special Meeting, any event or
information relating to the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, or any of their
Affiliates should be discovered by Parent or the Company which should be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that such
document would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein not false or
misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly notify
the other parties and the Company shall cause an appropriate amendment or
supplement describing such information to be filed with the SEC as promptly as
practicable thereafter and, to the extent required by applicable Law,
disseminated to the stockholders of the Company. 

(e) The Company, acting through the Company Board, shall, in accordance with
applicable Law: (i) duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a special
meeting of its stockholders as promptly as practicable, and in any event (to
the extent permissible under applicable Law) no earlier than 30 days and no
later than 40 days after the mailing of the definitive Proxy Statement to the
stockholders of the Company, for the purpose of obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval (the " _Special Meeting_ ") and (ii) use its reasonable
best efforts to solicit from the stockholders of the Company proxies in favor
of the adoption of this Agreement and secure the vote or consent of the
stockholders of the Company as required by the rules of the NASDAQ, the DGCL
or other applicable Law to effect the Merger. The Company shall give Parent no
less than 10 Business Days advance notice (or such shorter period of time as
notice is provided to the NASDAQ) of the date which shall be set as the

 



\- 4 -   "record date" for the Special Meeting. The Company shall consult with Parent
regarding the date of the Special Meeting and shall not change the record date
or postpone or adjourn the Special Meeting without the prior written consent
of Parent; _provided_ that Parent may cause the Company to postpone or adjourn
the Special Meeting by prior written notice to the Company to a date that is
not later than five Business Days prior to the Outside Date by prior written
notice to the Company.

(f) The Company shall ensure that the Special Meeting is called, noticed,
convened, held and conducted, and that all Persons solicited in connection
with the Special Meeting are solicited, in compliance in all material respects
with all applicable Law. The adoption of this Agreement and adjournment of
the Special Meeting, as necessary, to solicit additional proxies if there are
insufficient votes in favor of adoption of this Agreement shall be the only
matters which the Company shall propose to be acted on by the stockholders of
the Company at the Special Meeting, unless otherwise approved in writing by
Parent.

(g) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company agrees that
(i) its obligation to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the Special
Meeting shall not be affected by any Change of Board Recommendation and (ii)
its obligations pursuant to this Section 1.03 shall not be affected by the
commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the
Company of any Acquisition Proposal (whether or not a Superior Proposal).
Unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Section 7.01, the
Company agrees that it shall not submit to the vote of the stockholders of
the Company any Acquisition Proposal (whether or not a Superior Proposal)
prior to the vote of the stockholders of the Company with respect to the
Merger at the Special Meeting. 

(h) At the Special Meeting or any postponement or adjournment thereof, Parent
shall vote, or cause to be voted, all of the Shares then owned of record by
Parent or Merger Sub or with respect to which Parent or Merger Sub otherwise
has, directly or indirectly, voting power in favor of the adoption of this
Agreement, and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to deliver or
provide (or cause to be delivered or provided), in its capacity as a
stockholder of the Company, any other stockholder approvals that are required
by applicable Law to effect the Merger.

 

ARTICLE II

 

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES IN THE MERGER

Section 2.01 _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or the holders of any of the following securities:

(a) _Conversion of Shares_. Each Share issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, other than Shares to be cancelled in accordance
with Section 2.01(b) and other than Dissenting Shares, shall be converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration, payable net to the holder in
cash, without interest, subject to any withholding of Taxes required by
applicable Law in accordance with Section 2.02(f) and upon surrender of the
Certificate formerly representing such Shares (or, in the case of Book-Entry
Shares, surrender of such Book-Entry Shares) in accordance with Section 2.02.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, shares of Equity Plan Stock shall be treated in
accordance with Section 2.04(b).

 



\- 5 -  (b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. All Shares that
are held in the treasury of the Company or owned of record by any Company
Subsidiary that is directly or indirectly wholly-owned by the Company, and all
Shares owned of record by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective direct
or indirect wholly owned Subsidiaries shall be cancelled and shall cease to
exist, with no payment being made with respect thereto.

(c) _Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each share of common stock, no par value per
share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be converted into and become one newly and validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

Section 2.02 _Payment for Securities; Surrender of Certificates_. 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent or Merger Sub shall
designate a reputable bank or trust company to act as the paying agent for
purposes of effecting the payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration in
connection with the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ "). At or promptly after the
Effective Time, Parent or Merger Sub shall deposit, or cause to be deposited,
with the Paying Agent funds sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger
Consideration to which holders of Shares shall be entitled at the Effective
Time pursuant to this Agreement upon surrender of Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares as the case may be; _provided_ , _however_ , in the event that
such funds on deposit with the Paying Agent are insufficient to pay the
aggregate Merger Consideration, Parent or Merger Sub shall deposit, or cause
to be deposited, with the Paying Agent such additional funds as are necessary
to ensure that the Paying Agent has funds sufficient to pay the aggregate
Merger Consideration. Such funds shall be invested or otherwise held by the
Paying Agent as directed by Parent or Merger Sub, in their sole discretion,
pending payment thereof by the Paying Agent to the holders of the Shares.
Earnings from such investments, if any, shall be the sole and exclusive
property of Parent or Merger Sub, and no part of any such earnings shall
accrue to the benefit of holders of Shares.

(b) _Procedures for Surrender_. As promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation or Parent shall cause the Paying
Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates that
represented Shares (the " _Certificates_ ") or non-certificated
Shares represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ "), in each case,
which Shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
at the Effective Time pursuant to this Agreement:

 

(i) a letter of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates or transfer of the Book-
Entry Shares, as the case may be, to the Paying Agent, and shall otherwise be
in such form and have such other provisions as Parent or the Paying Agent
may reasonably specify; and

(ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or
transfer of Book-Entry Shares in exchange for payment of the Merger
Consideration.

 



\- 6 -  (c) _Cancellation of Shares; Payment of Merger Consideration_. Upon surrender
of Certificates or transfer of Book-Entry Shares for cancellation to the
Paying Agent, and upon delivery of a letter of transmittal, duly executed and
in proper form in accordance with the instructions thereto, with respect to
such Certificates or an agents message in the case of a book entry transfer
of Book-Entry Shares, the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration for each Share formerly
represented by such Certificates and for each Book-Entry Share. Any
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person
other than the Person in whose name any surrendered Certificate
is registered, it shall be a condition precedent of payment that the
Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in
proper form for transfer, and the Person requesting such payment shall have
paid any transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment
of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of
the Certificate so surrendered and shall have established to the satisfaction
of the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes either have been paid or are not
required to be paid. Payment of the Merger Consideration with respect to Book-
Entry Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry
Shares are registered. Until surrendered as contemplated hereby, each
Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration
in cash as contemplated by this Agreement, without interest thereon.

 

(d) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares_. All cash paid
upon the surrender of Certificates or the transfer of Book-Entry Shares in
accordance with the terms of this ARTICLE II shall be deemed to have been paid
in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares formerly
represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable. At
the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed
and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares
on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders
of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares
except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the
Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as
provided in this Agreement.

(e) _Termination of Fund; Abandoned Property; No Liability_. At any time
following the nine month anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it
any funds (including any interest received with respect thereto) made
available to the Paying Agent and not disbursed to holders of Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look
only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or
other similar Laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect to the
Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender of their Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares and compliance with the procedures in Section 2.02(b), without
interest and subject to any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law in
accordance with Section 2.02(f). If, immediately prior to such time on which
any payment in respect hereof would escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Entity pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Laws, any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares has not complied
with the procedures in Section 2.02(b) to

 



\- 7 -   receive payment of the Merger Consideration to which such holder would
otherwise be entitled, the payment in respect of such Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the
property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent
shall be Liable to any holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry Shares for
Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 

(f) _Withholding Rights_. Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and
the Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the Merger Consideration or any other payment otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares, Company Options, shares of
Equity Plan Stock, or any other Person pursuant to this Agreement,
as applicable, such amounts that Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code, the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder or any provision of applicable Law,
including with respect to any stock transfer Taxes payable by holder of
Shares, Company Options or shares of Equity Plan Stock. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld by Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or
the Paying Agent, Parent shall pay (unless the Paying Agent is the entity
withholding such amounts, in which case, Parent shall use reasonable best
efforts to cause the Paying Agent to pay) such amounts to the appropriate
taxing authority and such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Shares, Company Options or
shares of Equity Plan Stock, as applicable, in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made by Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or
the Paying Agent.

(g) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent shall
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Merger
Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.01(a);
_provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition
precedent to the payment of such Merger Consideration, require the owners of
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as
it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any Action that may be made
against Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent with
respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

Section 2.03 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, Shares outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and held by a holder who is entitled to demand and has properly
demanded appraisal for such Shares in accordance with, and who complies in all
respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (such Shares, the " _Dissenting
Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, and shall instead represent the right to receive payment of the
fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with and to the extent
provided by Section 262 of the DGCL. If any such holder fails to perfect or
otherwise waives, withdraws or loses his right to appraisal under Section 262
of the DGCL or other applicable Law, then the right of such holder to be paid
the fair value of such Dissenting Shares shall cease and such Dissenting
Shares shall be deemed to have been converted, as of the Effective Time, into
and shall be exchangeable solely for the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, without interest and subject to any withholding of Taxes
required by

 



\- 8 -   applicable Law in accordance with Section 2.02(f). The Company shall give
Parent prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of
Shares, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments
served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company relating to rights to
be paid the fair value of Dissenting Shares, and Parent shall have the right
to participate in and to control all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not,
except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment (unless
required by Law) with respect to, or settle or compromise or offer to settle
or compromise, any such demands, or approve any withdrawal of any such
demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing. Any portion of the aggregate
Merger Consideration made available to the Paying Agent to pay for Shares that
have become Dissenting Shares shall be returned to Parent upon demand.

Section 2.04 _Treatment of Company Options, Company Restricted Stock, Company
RSUs and Company Performance RSUs_. No later than immediately prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall have taken all requisite action such that:

(a) _Company Options_. Each Company Option that is unexpired, unexercised and
outstanding as of the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, shall be, by
virtue of the occurrence of the Effective Time and without any action on the
part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the holder of such Company Option or
any other Person, cancelled and converted into the right to receive from the
Surviving Corporation, within 30 days following the Effective Time, an amount
in cash equal to the product of (x) the aggregate number of Shares subject to
such Company Option, and (y) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration
over the per share exercise price under such Company Option. If the per share
exercise price under any such Company Option is equal to or greater than the
Merger Consideration, such Company Option shall be cancelled pursuant to this
Section 2.04(a) without payment of consideration.

 

(b) _Treatment of Company RSUs, Company Performance RSUs, Company Restricted
Stock_. The payout of the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01(a) in
exchange for each Share that immediately prior to the Effective Time remains
subject to the Companys outstanding right to claim the return of such share
under the terms of any Company RSU, Company Performance RSU and share of
Company Restricted Stock (each Company RSU, Company Performance RSU and share
of Company Restricted Stock, a share of " _Equity Plan Stock_ ") shall, after
giving effect to the deemed performance vesting level of Company Performance
RSUs pursuant to Section 2.04(c), remain subject to the time-based vesting
terms that apply with respect to the applicable share of Equity Plan Stock
immediately prior to the Effective Time under the equity plan award agreement
and any other applicable Contract that is in effect on the date of this
Agreement, in each case, pertaining to the applicable share of Equity Plan
Stock (together, the " _Equity Plan Documents_ "). The Merger Consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to Section 2.01(a) in exchange for each share of
Equity Plan Stock that is unvested at the Effective Time (" _Unvested Cash_ ")
shall not be payable by the Surviving Corporation at the Effective Time and
shall instead be paid by Parent in a cash lump-sum on the date upon which the
applicable share of Equity Plan Stock would have vested under the time-based
vesting terms and other conditions set forth in the Equity Plan Documents (and
provided that if such terms and conditions are not satisfied and time-based
vesting ceases to continue at any point and does not otherwise accelerate
pursuant to the terms of the Equity Plan Documents, no cash payment shall be
made with respect to the applicable share of Equity Plan

 



\- 9 -   Stock). All amounts payable pursuant to this Section 2.04(b) shall be paid
without interest. Following the Effective Time, no Unvested Cash, or right
thereto, may be pledged, encumbered, sold, assigned or transferred (including
any transfer by operation of law), by any Person, other than to the Surviving
Corporation, or be taken or reached by any legal or equitable process in
satisfaction of any Liability of such Person, prior to the payment to such
Person of such Unvested Cash in accordance with this Agreement.
Notwithstanding any of the foregoing to the contrary, each share of Equity
Plan Stock held by a non-employee director of the Company that is outstanding
as of the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, shall not be assumed or
substituted for by Parent and shall instead be cancelled in exchange for a
payment by the Surviving Corporation in respect of each share of Equity Plan
Stock in an amount equal to the Merger Consideration, to be paid in a cash
lump-sum as soon as practicable (but in no event later than 30 days) following
the Effective Time.

(c) _Deemed Performance of Company Performance RSUs_. Prior to the Effective
Time, each Company Performance RSU that will be converted into a right to
receive Unvested Cash pursuant to Section 2.04(b) will be determined as
follows: (i) each Company Performance RSU granted in October 2010 with respect
to the Companys 2011 fiscal year shall be treated as if the award had vested
as set forth in Section 2.04(c)(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule and
(ii) each Company Performance RSU granted in November 2011 with respect to the
Companys 2012 fiscal year shall be treated as if the award had vested as set
forth in Section 2.04(c)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. Following
the Effective Time, the Unvested Cash payable with respect to Company
Performance RSUs pursuant to Section 2.04(b) shall not be subject to any of
the performance-based vesting terms that currently apply to such awards but
shall, in all events, continue to be subject to the time-based vesting terms
currently applicable to such awards.

Section 2.05 _Treatment of Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. Each current
"Offering Period" (as defined in the ESPP) in progress as of the date of this
Agreement under the ESPP shall continue, and the Shares shall be issued to
participants thereunder on the next currently scheduled purchase dates
thereunder occurring after the date of this Agreement as provided under, and
subject to the terms and conditions of, the ESPP. Any Offering Period in
progress as of the Effective Time shall be shortened, and the last day of each
such Offering Period shall be the second Business Day immediately preceding
the Effective Time. Each then outstanding option under the ESPP shall
be exercised automatically on the last day of such Offering Period.
Notwithstanding any restrictions on transfer of stock in the ESPP, the
treatment in the Merger of any Shares under this provision shall be in
accordance with Section 2.01(a). The Company shall terminate the ESPP as of
or immediately prior to the Effective Time. The Company shall, promptly after
the date of this Agreement, take all actions (including, if appropriate,
amending the terms of the ESPP) that are necessary to give effect to the
transactions contemplated by this Section 2.05 and as are appropriate to avoid
the commencement of any new offering of options thereunder at or after the
date of this Agreement and prior to the earlier of the termination of
this Agreement or the Effective Time.

Section 2.06 _No Right to Equity Under Awards. The parties_ agree that
following the Effective Time, no holder of a Company Option, Company RSU,
Company Performance RSU or any other equity-based awards shall have any right
hereunder to acquire any Equity Interest (including any "phantom" stock or
stock appreciation rights) in the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries or
the Surviving Corporation.

 



\- 10 -  Section 2.07 _Waivers; Board or Committee Resolutions_.

 

(a) To the extent necessary to give effect to the transactions contemplated in
Section 2.04, the Company shall, at least 10 Business Days prior to the
Effective Time, use its reasonable best efforts to provide notice, in a form
and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent, to each holder of outstanding
Company Options and shares of Equity Plan Stock.

 

(b) Prior to or promptly after the date of this Agreement, the Company Board
or any committee thereof that administers the Company Stock Option Plans
shall adopt resolutions, in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent, that (i)
implement the transactions set forth in Section 2.04, (ii) terminate each
Company Stock Option Plan effective as of or immediately prior to
the Effective time and (iii) approve the transactions contemplated in Section
2.04 as valid under the terms of the Company Stock Option Plans and the award
agreements issued thereunder and further document that:

 

(i) the transactions contemplated in Section 2.04 are consistent with the
terms of the Company Stock Option Plans and the award agreements issued
thereunder;

(ii) Parents assumption of the obligation to pay the Merger Consideration
with respect to any Unvested Cash that vests pursuant to the terms set forth
in Section 2.04(b) and Section 2.04(c) will result in Parent substituting an
equivalent award for each share of Equity Plan Stock that becomes subject to
the terms set forth in Section 2.04(b) and Section 2.04(c); and

(iii) the consummation of the Merger will not accelerate the vesting of any
shares of Equity Plan Stock that are exchanged for Unvested Cash, except as
specifically provided by (A) Section 2.04(a) with respect to Company Options,
(B) Section 2.04(b) with respect to any such shares held by non-employee
directors of the Company or (C) the express terms of the Equity Plan Documents
relating to such award and the terms of the Company Stock Option Plan as in
effect on the date of this Agreement.

 

Section 2.08 _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that the Company
changes (or establishes a record date for changing) the number of shares of
Company Stock issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result
of a stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, subdivision,
reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction with
respect to the outstanding shares of Company Stock, at any time during the
period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, the Merger
Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such transaction;
_provided, however_ , that nothing in this Section 2.08 shall be construed as
permitting the Company to take any action or enter into any transaction
otherwise prohibited by this Agreement.

Except as set forth in the disclosure schedule delivered by the Company to
Parent and Merger Sub prior to the execution of this Agreement (the " _Company
Disclosure Schedule_ "), which identifies items of disclosure by reference to

Restricted Stock was properly approved by the Company Board (or a duly
authorized committee or subcommittee thereof) in compliance in all
material respects with Law, recorded on the Companys financial statements in

Equity Interests, (ii) the number of its outstanding shares of capital stock
or other Equity Interests and type(s) of such outstanding shares of capital
stock or other Equity Interests and (iii) the record owner(s) thereof. There
are no options or other convertible securities to purchase any shares of

in their capacity as a holder of the outstanding Equity Interests of a

duly authorized and validly issued, are fully paid, nonassessable and free of
preemptive rights and were issued in compliance in all material respects with
applicable Law. Except for Equity Interests in the Company Subsidiaries,
neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary owns directly or indirectly
any Equity Interest in any Person, or has any obligation or has made any
agreement to acquire any such Equity Interest, to provide funds to, or to make
any investment (in the form of a loan, capital contribution or otherwise) in,
any Company Subsidiary or any other Person.

Section 3.03 _Authority_.

 

(a) The Company has all necessary corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and to
consummate the Transactions, including the Merger (subject to and assuming the
receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval in connection with the Merger).
The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company and

(a) The Company and each Company Subsidiary holds all material
authorizations, licenses, permits, certificates, filings, consents, variances,
exemptions, waivers, approvals, orders, registrations and clearances of any
Governmental Entity necessary for the Company and each Company Subsidiary to

past five years been in compliance with the terms of the Company Permits in
all material respects, and all of the Company Permits are valid and in full
force and effect in all material respects. As of the date of this

Benefit Plan on or prior to the Effective Time have been or shall be timely
made or are reflected on the Most Recent Balance Sheet. With respect to any
Contract or insurance policy providing funding for benefits under any Company
Benefit Plan, there is no Liability of the Company, any Company Subsidiary or
any ERISA Affiliate in the nature of a retroactive rate adjustment, loss
sharing arrangement, or 

 



\- 23 -   other Liability, nor would there be any such Liability if such Contract or
insurance policy was terminated on the date of this Agreement, and, to the

insurance company issuing any such policy is in receivership, conservatorship,
liquidation or similar proceeding and no such proceedings with respect to any
such insurer are imminent.

 

(h) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the Transactions (either alone or in conjunction with any other event,
such as termination of employment) will (i) result in any material payment
(including severance, unemployment compensation, parachute or otherwise)
becoming due to any director or employee of the Company, any
Company Subsidiary, any ERISA Affiliate or any of their respective
Affiliates, or to any Governmental Entity or other Person on behalf of any
such director or employee, from the Company, any Company Subsidiary, any ERISA

Plan or otherwise, (ii) materially increase any benefits otherwise payable
under any Company Benefit Plan, (iii) result in any acceleration of the time

None of the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate is a party
to, or otherwise obligated under, any Company Benefit Plan that provides for
the gross-up of the Tax imposed by Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code. The
execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation
of the Transactions will not (either alone or upon the occurrence of
any additional or subsequent events) constitute an event under any Company
Benefit Plan or Contract that would reasonably be expected to result in any
material payment of deferred compensation which will not be in compliance with
Section 409A of the Code.

 



\- 24 -  (k) To the Knowledge of the Company, all Foreign Employee Benefit Plans (i)

unreasonably interfere with the ongoing business or operations of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries and (iv) perform, and to cooperate with Parent in

legislation implementing the Data Privacy Directive of the European Union or
similar legislation, except to the extent permitted by a contractual
undertaking entered into by Company, Parent and Merger Sub regarding the
maintenance of privacy of such data in a form reasonably necessary to effect
compliance with such legislation. No investigation conducted pursuant to this
Section 5.02(a) shall affect or be deemed to qualify, modify or limit
any representation or warranty made by the Company in this Agreement.

(b) Except as expressly prohibited by applicable Law, within 10 Business Days
prior to the Effective Time, solely to the extent the directors and officers
of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries differ from those listed in

knowingly facilitate the making, submission or announcement of any
Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry,

and cause to be terminated any solicitation, knowing encouragement, discussion
or negotiation with any Persons, conducted prior to the execution of this
Agreement, by the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or any of the Company
Representatives with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition
Inquiry. Promptly after the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause to be returned or
destroyed all confidential information provided by or on behalf of the Company
or any Company Subsidiary to such Person prior to the date of this Agreement.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at
any time following the date of this Agreement and prior to the receipt of the
Company Stockholder Approval, in response to a bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal that the Company Board determines in good faith After Consultation
constitutes or would reasonably be expected to result in a Superior
Proposal, the Company and the Company Representatives may (i) engage or
participate in discussions or negotiations with, and only with, the Person (or
such Persons representatives) that has made such Acquisition Proposal and
(ii) furnish to the Person (or such Persons representatives) that has made
the Acquisition Proposal information relating to the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries and/or afford access to the business, properties, assets, books,
records or the personnel of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, in each
case, pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement after such Person
has provided the Company with written acknowledgement that the Company will be
permitted to comply with its obligations under this Section 5.03; _provided_
that (A) the Company did not receive such Acquisition Proposal after breaching
or violating the terms of this Section 5.03, (B) the Company received the
Acquisition Proposal from a Person that is not in breach of its contractual
obligations to the Company or any Company Subsidiary under a standstill or
nondisclosure agreement, (C) the Company Board has determined in good faith,
After Consultation, that the failure to take such action is or would
reasonably be likely to be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties
to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law, (D) prior to engaging
or participating in any such discussions or negotiations with or furnishing
any information to, such Person, the Company gives Parent written notice of
the identity of such Person and its representatives and of the material terms
and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal and of the Companys intention
to engage or participate in discussions or negotiations with, or furnish
information to such Person and (E) contemporaneously with or prior to
furnishing any non-public information to such Person, the Company furnishes
such information to Parent (to the extent such information has not been
previously furnished by the Company to Parent).

(c) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in Section
5.03(b), the Company shall promptly, and in all cases within 24 hours after
the Company attains knowledge of the receipt by the Company of any Acquisition
Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry, notify Parent orally and in writing of the
receipt by the Company of any Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry,
which notice shall include (x) the material terms and conditions of such
Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry (for the avoidance of doubt, this
clause (x) shall be deemed satisfied in the event a copy of any written
Acquisition Proposal and any related agreements, reflecting conditions or
other material terms relating to any Acquisition Proposal, including
the financing thereof, is furnished to Parent) and (y) the identity of the
Person or group (as defined under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) making
any such Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry. Commencing upon the
provision of any notice referred to

 



\- 50 -   above until any such Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry has been
withdrawn, the Company (or its outside counsel) shall (A) keep Parent
reasonably informed on a current basis (and in any event no later than 24
hours) of any material change in the status of discussions regarding the
material terms (including all amendments) of any such Acquisition Proposal or
Acquisition Inquiry and (B) promptly (and in any event not later than 24
hours) after receipt or delivery thereof, provide Parent (or its outside
counsel) with copies of all material documents (including any written, or
electronic material to the extent such material contains any financial terms,
conditions or other material terms relating to any Acquisition Proposal,
including the financing thereof) exchanged between the Company or Company
Subsidiaries or any of the Company Representatives, on the one hand, and the
Person making an Acquisition Proposal or any of its Affiliates, or their
respective officers, directors, employees, investment bankers, attorneys,
accountants or other advisors or representatives, on the other hand. The
Company shall provide Parent with at least 24 hours prior notice (or such
shorter notice as may be provided to the Company Board) of a meeting of the
Company Board at which the Company Board is reasonably expected to consider an
Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall not, and shall cause the Company
Subsidiaries not to, enter into any Contract with any Person subsequent to
the date of this Agreement, and neither the Company nor any of the Company
Subsidiaries is party to any Contract, that prohibits the Company from
providing the information described in Section 5.03(b) or this Section
5.03(c) to Parent.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if the
Company receives an Acquisition Proposal from a Person that is not in
violation of such Persons contractual obligations to the Company or any
Company Subsidiary under a standstill or nondisclosure agreement, other than
after breaching or violating this Section 5.03, that the Company Board
concludes in good faith, After Consultation, constitutes a Superior Proposal,
the Company Board may, at any time prior to the receipt of the Company
Stockholder Approval, if it determines in good faith, After Consultation
(including with its outside legal counsel), that the failure to take such
actions contemplated by clauses (x) and/or (y) below would result in a breach
of the Company Boards fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company
under applicable Law, (x) effect a Change of Board Recommendation with respect
to a Superior Proposal and/or (y) terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
7.01(f) and simultaneously enter into a definitive agreement with respect to
such Superior Proposal; _provided, however_ , that the Company shall not
terminate this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (y), and any
purported termination pursuant to the foregoing clause (y) shall be void and
of no force or effect, unless in advance of or concurrently with such
termination the Company pays the Termination Fee in accordance with Section
7.02; and _provided further_ that the Company Board may not effect a Change
of Board Recommendation pursuant to the foregoing clause (x) or terminate this
Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (y) unless:

(i) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent, at least
four Business Days in advance (the " _Superior Proposal Notice Period_ "), of
its intention to effect a Change of Board Recommendation (which notice itself
shall not constitute a Change of Board Recommendation) or terminate this
Agreement to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to
such Superior Proposal, which notice shall specify the basis upon which the
Company Board intends to terminate this Agreement or effect such Change of
Board Recommendation and the identity of the party making such Superior
Proposal, and shall have contemporaneously provided the execution draft of
the relevant proposed definitive transaction

 



\- 51 -   agreements with the Person making such Superior Proposal (the " _Alternative
Acquisition Agreement_ ")) and other material documents with respect to such
Superior Proposal (including any with respect to the financing thereof); and

(ii) prior to effecting such Change of Board Recommendation or
terminating this Agreement to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement
with respect to such Superior Proposal, (A) if requested by Parent, the
Company shall, and shall cause the Company Representatives to, during the
Superior Proposal Notice Period, negotiate with Parent in good faith to make
such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such
Acquisition Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal, and (B) Parent
shall not have, during the Superior Proposal Notice Period, made a written
offer that would, upon the Companys acceptance thereof, be binding on Parent
and that, after consideration of such offer by the Company Board in good faith
and After Consultation, results in the Company Board determining that such
Superior Proposal no longer constitutes a Superior Proposal.

In the event of any amendment to the financial terms or any other material
revisions to the Superior Proposal, the Company shall be required to deliver a
new written notice to Parent pursuant to Section 5.03(d)(i) and to comply with
the requirements of this Section 5.03(d) with respect to such new written
notice (including a new Superior Proposal Notice Period), except the Superior
Proposal Notice Period shall be at least three Business Days (rather than the
four Business Days contemplated by Section 5.03(d)(i) above).

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, and
solely in response to an Intervening Event, the Company Board may effect a
Change of Board Recommendation prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder
Approval if the Company Board determines in good faith, After Consultation,
that the failure to effect a Change of Board Recommendation would reasonably
be likely to result in a breach of the Company Boards fiduciary duties to the
stockholders of the Company under applicable Law; _provided, however_ , that
the Company Board may not effect such a Change of Board
Recommendation unless:

(i) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent, at least
four Business Days in advance (the " _Intervening Event Notice Period_ "), of
its intention to effect such a Change of Board Recommendation (which notice
itself shall not constitute a Change of Board Recommendation), which notice
shall specify the details of such Intervening Event and the basis upon which
the Company Board intends to effect a Change of Board Recommendation; and

(ii) prior to effecting such Change of Board Recommendation, if requested by
Parent, the Company shall, and shall cause the Company Representatives to,
during the Intervening Event Notice Period, negotiate with Parent in good
faith to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement
so that a Change of Board Recommendation is no longer necessary; _provided,
further_ , that Parent shall not have, during the Intervening Event Notice
Period, made a written offer that would, upon the Companys acceptance
thereof, be binding on Parent and that, after due consideration of such offer
by the Company Board in good faith and After Consultation, results in the
Company Board determining that it would continue to be reasonably likely to
result in a breach of the Company Boards fiduciary duties to the stockholders
of the Company under applicable Law to not effect the Change of Board
Recommendation.

 



-52 -  (iii) In the event of any material changes to the circumstances applicable to
the Intervening Event, after the start of the Intervening Event Notice
Period, the Company shall be required to deliver a new written notice to
Parent pursuant to Section 5.03(e)(i) and to comply with the requirements of
this Section 5.03(e) with respect to such new written notice (including a new
Intervening Event Notice Period), except the Intervening Event Notice Period
shall be at least three Business Days (rather than the four Business Days
contemplated by Section 5.03(e)(i) above).

(f) The Company shall keep confidential any proposals made by Parent to revise
the terms of this Agreement, other than in the event of any amendment to this
Agreement and to the extent required to be disclosed in any Company SEC
Documents.

 

(g) The Company agrees that any action taken by a Company Representative that,
if taken by the Company, would constitute a material breach of the
restrictions set forth in this Section 5.03 shall be deemed to be a material
breach of this Section 5.03 by the Company.

(h) Nothing contained in this Section 5.03 shall prohibit the Company Board
from taking and disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or otherwise complying with the
provisions of Rule 14d-9; _provided, however_ , that in no event shall the
Company Board take any action prohibited by this Section 5.03.

(i) No Change of Board Recommendation shall change the approval of the Company
Board for purposes of causing any Takeover Law to be applicable to the
Transactions.

its Affiliates to give) any notices and shall use its reasonable best efforts

any Contracts of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, as may be
necessary or appropriate for the consummation of the Transactions or required
by the terms of any Contract of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
(including such consents as are necessary such that no third party will obtain
additional rights under any such Contract as a result of the consummation of
the Transactions) as a result of the execution, performance or consummation of
the Transactions, including such consents as are required to be disclosed in
the Company Disclosure Schedule; _provided_ that, the Company shall coordinate
with Parent and cooperate in determining whether any actions, consents,
approvals or waivers are required to be obtained from third parties (including
under any Company Material Contract) in connection with consummation of the
Transactions and seeking any such actions, consents, approvals or waivers. In
the event that the Company shall fail to obtain any third party action,
approval, consent or waiver described in this Section 5.04(a), the Company
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts, and shall take any such
actions reasonably requested by

 



\- 53 -   Parent, to minimize any adverse effect upon the Company and Parent, their
respective Subsidiaries, and their respective businesses resulting, or which

materials to the directors, officers or employees of such receiving party
without the advance written consent of the producing party.

with obtaining any approval or consent from any Person with respect to the
Merger or the other Transactions, other than filing fees required to be paid
in connection with a filing under any applicable Antitrust Laws or Exon-
Florio, (i) without the prior written consent of Parent (which will not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), none of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary shall pay or commit to pay to such Person whose approval or
consent is being solicited any cash or other consideration (other than _de
minimis_ amounts), make any commitment or incur any Liability or other
obligation due to such Person, and (ii)

 



\- 56 -   neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall be required to pay or commit to pay to

consideration (other than _de minimis_  amounts), make any commitment or

communicating, exchanging, or furnishing information, negotiating, disclosing,
entering into or consummating potential or definitive strategic transactions
through both internally generated and third-party proposals. 

Section 5.05 _Certain Notices_. From and after the date of this Agreement
until the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Company shall promptly
notify the other party of the occurrence of any event that would be likely to
cause any condition to the obligations of Parent or the Company, respectively,
to effect the Merger or any other Transaction not to be satisfied; _provided_
, _however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 5.05
shall not cure any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement contained in this Agreement or otherwise limit or affect the
remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice.

Section 5.06 _Public Announcements_. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger
Sub agrees that no public release or announcement concerning the Transactions
shall be issued by any party or its parent company or Subsidiaries without the
prior written consent of the Company and Parent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed), except as such release or announcement may
be required by applicable Law or the rules or regulations of any applicable
national securities exchange or Governmental Entity to which the
relevant party is subject. The Company, Parent and Merger Sub agree that the
initial press release announcing the execution and delivery of this Agreement
shall be a joint press release of, and shall not be issued prior to the
approval of each of, the Company, on the one hand, and Parent or Guarantor,
on the other hand, except as otherwise required by applicable Law.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions

 



\- 57 -   of this Section 5.06, (i) Guarantor, Parent, the Parent Representatives, the
Company and the Company Representatives and Guarantors and the Companys

the Transactions that are not inconsistent with previous press releases or
announcements made by Parent and/or the Company in compliance with this
Section 5.06 and (ii) the restrictions set forth in this Section 5.06 shall
not apply to any release or announcement made or proposed to be made in
connection with a Change of Board Recommendation that is effected in

Section 5.07 _Employee Benefit Matters_.

(a) With respect to any "employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of
ERISA (and that is subject to ERISA) maintained by Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary in which any director, officer or employee of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary (the " _Company Employees_ ") will participate effective as
of or after the Effective Time (collectively, " _New Plans_ "), subject to
applicable Law and applicable Tax qualification requirements, Parent shall,
or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, recognize all service of the
Company Employees with the Company or a Company Subsidiary that is reflected
in the books and records of the Company, as the case may be, for vesting and
eligibility purposes (but not for accrual purposes, except for vacation and
severance, if applicable) in any New Plan in which such Company Employees may
be eligible to participate after the Effective Time, in each case except to
the extent that recognizing such service would result in a duplication of
benefits. To the extent any Company Employee participates in a New Plan that
is a welfare plan or arrangement of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary
following the Closing Date (a " _Parent Welfare Plan_ "), Parent and any
Parent Subsidiary will, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and any
insurer or service provider under the applicable Parent Welfare Plan, cause
all (i) pre-existing condition limitations which otherwise would be
applicable to such Company Employee and his or her covered dependents to be
waived to the extent satisfied under a Company Benefit Plan comparable to such
Parent Welfare Plan immediately prior to the Closing Date or, if later,
immediately prior to such Company Employees commencement of participation in
such Parent Welfare Plan, and (ii) participation waiting periods under each
Parent Welfare Plan that would otherwise be applicable to such Company
Employee to be waived to the same extent waived or satisfied under the Company
Benefit Plan comparable to such Parent Welfare Plan immediately prior to the
Closing Date or, if later, immediately prior to such Company Employees
commencement of participation in such Parent Welfare Plan.

(b) No later than two Business Days prior to its distribution, the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries shall provide Parent with a copy of any
communication intended to be made to any of their respective employees
relating to the Transactions, and will provide an opportunity for Parent
to make reasonable revisions thereto.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take such actions as Parent
may reasonably request so as to enable the Surviving Corporation to effect
such actions relating to the 401(k) plan of the Company (the " _401(k) Plan_
") as Parent may deem necessary or appropriate, including amending and/or
terminating the 401(k) Plan prior to the Effective Time, subject to the terms
of the 401(k) Plan and applicable Law and provided that such action does not
preclude the immediate participation of the Company Employees in any successor
plan. As promptly as practicable after the Company Employees are transferred
to Parents or any Parent

 



\- 58 -   Subsidiarys (other than the Surviving Corporations) payroll and subject to
applicable Law, applicable Tax qualification requirements and the terms of any
401(k) plan sponsored or maintained by Parent or any Parent Subsidiary in
which Company Employees will become eligible to participate (the " _Parent
401(k) Plan_ "), Parent will permit Company Employees located in the United
States to participate in the Parent 401(k) Plan in accordance with Parents
or the applicable Parent Subsidiarys ordinary course policies and procedures
with respect to timing for participation in such plan.

 

(d) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to timely satisfy the
Companys obligations to pay all amounts and provide all benefits that
continue following the Effective Time under the Company Benefit Plans listed
on Section 5.07(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

(e) This Section 5.07 shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of
each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this Section 5.07,
express or implied, is intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or
remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Section 5.07.
Nothing contained herein shall (i) be treated as an amendment of any
particular Company Benefit Plan, (ii) give any third party any right to
enforce the provisions of this Section 5.07 or (iii) require Parent or any of
its Affiliates to (A) maintain any particular Company Benefit Plan or (B)
retain the employment of any particular employee. 

Section 5.08 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_.

 

(a) For a period of six years from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to)
indemnify and hold harmless all past and present directors, officers and
employees of the Company to the same extent such Persons are indemnified as of
the date of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to applicable Law, the
Company Certificate, the Company Bylaws, and indemnification agreements in
existence on the date of this Agreement and listed in Section 5.08(a) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule (accurate and complete copies of which have been
provided to Parent), arising out of acts or omissions in their capacity as
directors, officers or employees of the Company occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time. The Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to) advance expenses (including reasonable legal fees
and expenses) incurred in the defense of any Actions with respect to the
matters subject to indemnification pursuant to this Section 5.08(a) in
accordance with the procedures set forth in the Company Certificate, the
Company Bylaws and indemnification agreements, if any, in existence on the
date of this Agreement; _provided, however_ , that the director, officer or
employee of the Company to whom expenses are advanced undertakes, to
the extent required by the DGCL, to repay such advanced expenses to the
Surviving Corporation if it is ultimately determined that such director,
officer or employee is not entitled to indemnification under applicable Law.

 

(b) The indemnification agreements listed in Section 5.08(a) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule shall continue in full force and effect in accordance
with their terms following the Effective Time.

 



\- 59 -  (c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall purchase a
"tail" officers and directors liability insurance policy, which by its
terms shall survive the Merger and shall provide each Indemnified Party with
coverage for not less than six years following the Effective Time on terms and
conditions no less favorable than the terms of the directors and officers
liability insurance policy currently maintained by the Company (a correct and
complete copy of which has been delivered to Parent) (the " _D andO Insurance_")
in respect of actions or omissions of such officers and directors prior to
the Effective Time in their capacities as such; _provided, however_ , that in
no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend more
than 300% of the current annual premium paid by the Company for such policy
(the " _Maximum Amount_ "); _provided, further, however_ , that if the amount
of the premium necessary to procure such insurance coverage exceeds the
Maximum Amount, Parent shall spend up to the Maximum Amount to purchase such
lesser coverage as may be obtained with such Maximum Amount. The Indemnified
Parties may be required to make reasonable application and provide reasonable
and customary representations and warranties to applicable insurance carriers
for the purpose of obtaining such insurance. Parent shall upon request furnish
a copy of such insurance policy to each beneficiary of such policy.

 

(d) In the event the Surviving Corporation, any Company Subsidiary or any of
their successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other
Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then proper provision shall be made so
that such continuing or surviving corporation or entity or transferee of such
assets, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this
Section 5.08, without relieving Parent of its obligations under this Section
5.08.

(e) The obligations under this Section 5.08 shall not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to adversely affect in any material respect any
indemnitee to whom this Section 5.08 applies without the consent of such
affected indemnitee (it being expressly agreed that the indemnitees to whom
this Section 5.08 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section
5.08).

Section 5.09 _State Takeover Laws_. If any Takeover Law becomes or is deemed
to be applicable to the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or the Merger, including
by reason of the acquisition of Shares pursuant thereto, or any other
transaction contemplated to be consummated by the parties pursuant to this
Agreement, then the Company Board shall take all action necessary to render
such Law inapplicable to the foregoing.

Board, or an appropriate committee of non-employee directors thereof, shall
adopt a resolution consistent with the interpretive guidance of the SEC so
that the disposition by any officer or director of the Company who is a
covered person of the Company for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act
and the rules and regulations thereunder (" _Section 16_ ") of Shares
(including the disposition of shares of Company Restricted Stock), Company
Options and Shares acquired upon the vesting of any Company RSUs and Company

such Company SEC Document filed pursuant to the Exchange Act to not contain

contract, tortious conduct or otherwise and whether predicated on common law,
statute or otherwise) in Delaware Court of Chancery (and if jurisdiction in
the Delaware Court of Chancery shall be unavailable, the Federal courts of the
United States of America sitting in the State of Delaware). Each of the
parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such Action (whether for
breach of contract, tortious conduct or otherwise and whether predicated on
common law, statute or otherwise) shall be conclusive and may be enforced in
other jurisdictions within and outside the United States of America by suit on
the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law. Each party to this
Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process anywhere in the world in
the manner provided for notices in Section 8.03. Nothing in this Agreement
will affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process in any
other manner permitted by Law.

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT
MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE
AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (II) IT UNDERSTANDS AND
HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (III) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS
VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY,
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION
8.12(C).

 

(d) The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in the
defense, settlement or compromise of any Action against the Company and/or
its directors relating to the Transactions and will obtain the prior written
consent of Parent prior to settling or satisfying any such Action. For
purposes of this Section 8.12(d), "participate" means that Parent will be
kept apprised of proposed strategy and other significant decisions with
respect to the Action by the Company (to the extent that the attorney-client
privilege between the Company and its counsel is not breached), and Parent may
offer comments or suggestions with respect to the Action but will not be
afforded any decision-making power or other authority over the Action, except
for the settlement or compromise consent set forth above.

 



\- 87 -  Section 8.13 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and
delivered (including by facsimile transmission or by e-mail of a .pdf, .tif,
.jpeg or similar attachment (" _Electronic Delivery_ ")) in two or more
counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts,
each of which when executed and delivered shall be deemed to be an original
but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.
Any such counterpart, to the extent delivered using Electronic Delivery shall
be treated in all manner and respects as an original executed counterpart and
shall be considered to have the same binding legal effect as if it were the
original signed version thereof delivered in person. No party hereto shall
raise the use of Electronic Delivery to deliver a signature or the fact that
any signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated
through the use of Electronic Delivery as a defense to the formation of a
contract, and each such party forever waives any such defense, except to the
extent that such defense relates to lack of authenticity.

Section 8.14 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached, and that money damages or other legal remedies would not
be an adequate remedy for any such damage. It is accordingly agreed that prior
to any valid termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 7.01,
(a) each party shall be entitled at its election to seek an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to seek to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity,
and this right shall include the right of the Company to cause Parent and
Merger Sub to cause the Merger to be consummated and (b) the parties shall
waive, in any Action for specific performance, the defense of adequacy of a
remedy at Law. A partys pursuit of specific performance at any time shall
not be deemed an election of remedies or waiver of the right to pursue any
other right or remedy to which such party may be entitled, including the right
to pursue remedies for Liabilities or damages incurred or suffered by such
party in the case of a breach of this Agreement involving fraud or willful or
intentional misconduct.

 

Section 8.15 _Guaranty._

(a) To induce the Company to enter into this Agreement, SAP AG, an
_Aktiengesellschaft_ organized under the laws of Germany (" _Guarantor_ "),
intending to be legally bound, hereby absolutely, irrevocably and
unconditionally guarantees to the Company the due and punctual payment and
performance of (i) Parents and Merger Subs obligations under this Agreement,
including with respect to all fees and expenses associated therewith and (ii)
Parents and Merger Subs Liability and obligations (including for breach)
under this Agreement (collectively, the " _Guaranteed Obligations_ "), in each
case, as and when due pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. This guarantee
may not be revoked or terminated and shall remain in full force and effect
without interruption and shall be binding on Guarantor and its successors and
assigns until the Guaranteed Obligations have been satisfied in full.
Guarantor further covenants and agrees that, if requested by the Company, it
will promptly appoint in accordance with applicable Law a registered agent for
service of process in the State of Delaware, and Guarantor shall
maintain such registered agent as its agent for service of process in the
State of Delaware without interruption until the Effective Time.

 



\- 88 -  (b) All payments pursuant to this Section 8.15 shall be made in lawful money
of the United States, in immediately available funds. Guarantor promises and
undertakes to make all payments hereunder free and clear of any deduction,
offset, defense, claim or counterclaim of Guarantor of any kind.

 

(c) The guarantee set forth in Section 8.15(a) (the " _Guarantee_ ") is an
absolute, unconditional and continuing guarantee of the full and punctual
payment and performance by Parent and Merger Sub of the Guaranteed Obligations
and not of collection. Should Parent or Merger Sub default in the payment or
performance of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, Guarantors obligations
hereunder shall become immediately due and payable to the Company or, to the
extent that such obligations become due and payable after the Effective Time,
to the stockholders of the Company. Claims hereunder may be made on one or
more occasions. If any payment in respect of any Guaranteed Obligation is
rescinded or must otherwise be returned for any reason whatsoever, Guarantor
shall remain liable hereunder with respect to such Guaranteed Obligation as if
such payment had not been made.

(d) Guarantor agrees that the Guaranteed Obligations shall not be released or
discharged, in whole or in part, or otherwise affected by (i) the failure or
delay on the part of the Company to assert any claim or demand or to enforce
any right or remedy against Parent or Merger Sub; (ii) any change in the time,
place or manner of payment of the Guaranteed Obligations or rescission,
waiver, compromise, consolidation or other amendment or modification of any of
the terms or provisions of this Agreement made in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement or any agreement evidencing, securing or otherwise executed in
connection with any of the Guaranteed Obligations; (iii) the addition,
substitution or release of any Person interested in the Transactions; (iv) any
change in the corporate existence, structure or ownership of Parent or Merger
Sub; (v) any insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or other similar
proceeding affecting Parent or Merger Sub or their assets; (vi) the adequacy
of any means the Company may have of obtaining payment related to the
Guaranteed Obligations; or (vii) the existence of any claim, set-off or other
right which Parent or Merger Sub may have at any time against the Company
(other than rights of Merger Sub pursuant to this Agreement), whether in
connection with the Guaranteed Obligations or otherwise. Guarantor waives
promptness, diligence, notice of the acceptance of the Guarantee and of the
Guaranteed Obligations, presentment, demand for payment, notice of non-
performance, default, dishonor and protest, notice of the Guaranteed
Obligations incurred and all other notices of any kind, all defenses which may
be available by virtue of any valuation, stay, moratorium Law or other similar
Law now or hereafter in effect, any right to require the marshalling of
assets of Parent or Merger Sub or any other Person interested in the
Transactions, and all suretyship defenses generally (other than, in each case,
fraud, willful misconduct and intentional misrepresentation by the Company or
any of its Affiliates), defenses to the payment of the Guaranteed Obligations
that are available to Parent or Merger Sub under this Agreement and defenses
available to Guarantor under the Guarantee. Guarantor acknowledges that it has
received and will receive substantial direct and indirect benefits from the
Transactions and that the waivers set forth in this Section 8.15 are knowingly
made in contemplation of such benefits.

 



\- 89 -  (e) No failure on the part of the Company to exercise, and no delay in
exercising, any right, remedy or power pursuant to this Section 8.15 shall
operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise by the
Company of any right, remedy or power pursuant to this Section 8.15 preclude
any other or future exercise of any right, remedy or power pursuant to this
Section 8.15. Each and every right, remedy and power granted to the Company
pursuant to this Section 8.15 or allowed it by Law or agreement with respect
to this Section 8.15 shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any other, and
may be exercised by the Company at any time or from time to time. The Company
shall not have any obligation to proceed at any time or in any manner against,
exhaust any or all of the Companys rights against Parent, Merger Sub or any
other Person liable for any Guaranteed Obligations prior to proceeding against
Guarantor hereunder or resort to any security or other means of collecting
payment. The Guarantee may only be amended by a writing signed and delivered
by Guarantor and the Company. Guarantor hereby covenants and agrees that it
shall not institute, and shall cause its respective Affiliates not to
institute, any Action asserting that the Guarantee is illegal, invalid or
unenforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to the effects of
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium or
similar Laws affecting creditors rights generally, and general
equitable principles (whether considered an Action in equity or at law).

(f) Guarantor hereby represents and warrants to the Company and covenants
that: (i) the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement have been
duly authorized by all necessary action and do not contravene any provision of
Guarantors organizational documents or any Law or contractual restriction
binding on Guarantor or its assets; (ii) this Agreement constitutes a legal,
valid and binding obligation of Guarantor enforceable against Guarantor in
accordance with its terms, subject to the effect of any applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency (including, without limitation, all Laws relating to
fraudulent transfers), reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting
creditors rights generally and subject to the effect of general principles of
equity (regardless of whether considered in an Action at law or in equity),
(iii) nothing in this Agreement will terminate Guarantors obligations under
the Confidentiality Agreement and (iv) Guarantor will not issue any press
release or other communication in contravention of Section 5.06.

(g) Nothing in this Section 8.15 shall waive any defenses, counterclaims or
rights of setoff that Parent or Merger Sub may have under this Agreement or
applicable Law.
