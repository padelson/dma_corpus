this Section 2.04(b), each RTMRG Certificate shall be deemed, from and after the
First Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive the applicable Per
Share Merger Consideration. The Per Share Merger Consideration issued or paid
upon the surrender of any RTMRG Certificate shall be deemed to have been issued
or paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to that RTMRG Certificate
and the shares of RTMRG Common Stock formerly represented by it.

         (c)    DISTRIBUTIONS WITH RESPECT TO UNEXCHANGED SHARES. No dividends
or other distributions payable with respect to shares included in the Aggregate
Share Consideration that have a record date after the Effective Time shall be
paid to a holder of an unsurrendered RTMRG Certificate until that RTMRG
Certificate is properly surrendered in accordance with this Article II. Subject
to applicable Laws, following the proper surrender of any such RTMRG
Certificate, there shall be issued or paid to the holder of the certificate
representing shares included in the Aggregate Share Consideration (each, a
"TRIARC CERTIFICATE") issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the
time of such surrender, the dividends or other distributions payable with
respect to the shares included in the Aggregate Share Consideration represented
by that Triarc Certificate that have a record date after the First Effective
Time and a payment date on or prior to the date of issuance of that Triarc
Certificate and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the dividends or other
distributions payable with respect to the shares included in the Aggregate Share
Consideration represented by that Triarc Certificate that have a record date
after the First Effective Time and a payment date after the date of issuance of
that Triarc Certificate.

         (d)    NO FURTHER TRANSFERS. At the First Effective Time, the transfer
books of RTMRG shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of
transfers of


                                      -11-
<PAGE>

the shares of RTMRG Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the
First Effective Time.

         (e)    FRACTIONAL SHARES. Each holder of RTMRG Certificates who would
otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share included in the
Aggregate Share Consideration under this Article II (after taking into account
all RTMRG Certificates delivered by such holder) shall receive from the Exchange
Agent, in accordance with the provisions of this Article II, a cash payment in
lieu of such fractional share interest based upon the Current Market Price.
Triarc shall pay to the Exchange Agent simultaneously with the payment made
pursuant to Section 2.04(a) an amount in cash sufficient for the Exchange Agent
to pay each holder of RTMRG Certificates an amount in cash equal to the product
obtained by multiplying (A) the fraction of a share included in the Aggregate
Share Consideration to which such holder would otherwise have been entitled by
(B) the Current Market Price.

         (f)    REQUIRED WITHHOLDING. Triarc and the Exchange Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from any Per Share Merger Consideration and with
respect to any RTMRG Rollover Options such amounts as they may be required to
deduct and withhold from such payment under any applicable Laws, and shall
deduct and withhold from any Per Share Merger Consideration payable to an RTMRG
Shareholder an amount equal to the amounts specified under Section 1445 of the
Code (assuming for these purposes the application of Section 1445 of the Code to
the First Merger and the RTMAC Purchase) if such RTMRG Shareholder does not duly
execute and deliver the FIRPTA Certificate, which FIRPTA Certificate shall set
forth all of the information required by, and otherwise be executed in
accordance with, Treasury Regulation ss. 1.1445-2(b)(2), together with the duly
executed and delivered letter of transmittal. If Triarc or the Exchange Agent,
as the case may be, so deducts or withholds any such amounts, such amounts shall
be treated for all purposes as having been paid to the Person in respect of whom
Triarc or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, made such deduction and
withholding.

         (g)    RESTRICTIVE LEGEND. The Triarc Certificates, when issued
pursuant to this Agreement and, if the Triarc B-2 Election shall have been made,
when issued upon conversion of the shares of Triarc Class B-2 Common Stock, will
contain the following legend:

                NEITHER THESE SECURITIES NOR THE SECURITIES ISSUABLE UPON
                CONVERSION OF THESE SECURITIES HAVE BEEN REGISTERED WITH THE
                SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION OR SECURITIES REGULATORS OF
                ANY STATE IN RELIANCE UPON AN EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION UNDER
                THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE "SECURITIES ACT"),
                AND, ACCORDINGLY, MAY NOT BE, NOR MAY ANY INTEREST THEREIN BE,
                OFFERED OR SOLD EXCEPT PURSUANT TO AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION
                STATEMENT UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OR PURSUANT TO AN AVAILABLE
                EXEMPTION FROM, OR IN A TRANSACTION NOT SUBJECT TO,


                                      -12-
<PAGE>

                THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES ACT AND IN
                ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS AS EVIDENCED
                BY, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS, A LEGAL OPINION OF COUNSEL TO
                THE TRANSFEROR TO SUCH EFFECT, IN FORM AND SUBSTANCE OF WHICH
                SHALL BE REASONABLY ACCEPTABLE TO THE COMPANY.

         (h)    INVESTMENT OF EXCHANGE FUND. The Exchange Agent shall invest the
cash portion of the Exchange Fund as directed by Triarc. Any interest and other
income resulting from such investment shall become a part of the Exchange Fund,
and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable under Section 2.02(c) shall be
paid promptly to Triarc.

         (i)    TERMINATION OF EXCHANGE FUND. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
that remains unclaimed by the holders of RTMRG Certificates 180 days after the
Effective Time shall be delivered by the Exchange Agent to Triarc upon demand.
Any holder of RTMRG Certificates who has not complied with this Article II shall
look thereafter only to Triarc for payment of the Per Share Merger
Consideration.

         (j)    NO LIABILITY. None of Triarc, the Surviving Corporation, the
Surviving LLC or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder of RTMRG
Certificates for any Per Share Merger Consideration properly delivered to a
public official under any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Laws. If any RTMRG Certificates have not been surrendered prior to five years
after the First Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on
which any Per Share Merger Consideration in respect of those RTMRG Certificates
would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity),
any Per Share Merger Consideration payable in respect of those RTMRG
Certificates shall become the property of Triarc, free and clear of all claims
or interests of any Person previously entitled to that Per Share Merger
Consideration, to the extent permitted by applicable Laws.

         (k)    LOST, STOLEN OR DESTROYED CERTIFICATES. If any RTMRG Certificate
is lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the Person claiming such RTMRG Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and
the posting by such Person of a bond in the form and amount reasonably required
by Triarc as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Triarc on
account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction, the Exchange Agent shall
issue the Per Share Merger Consideration in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed RTMRG Certificate.

         Section 2.05   ESCROW.

         (a)    There shall be withheld from (x) the shares that would otherwise
be included in the Aggregate Share Consideration issuable pursuant to Section
2.02(c)(ii)(B), a number of shares of Triarc Class B-1 Common Stock (if the
Triarc B-1 Election shall have been made) or Triarc Class B-2 common Stock (if
the Triarc B-2 election shall have been made) that is equal to the quotient
obtained by dividing $18 million by the Current Market Price, and (y) the cash
that would otherwise


                                      -13-
<PAGE>

be included in the Per Share Merger Consideration payable to each holder of
RTMRG Common Stock (the "RTMRG SHAREHOLDERS') pursuant to Section 2.02(c)(i) and
Section 2.02(c)(ii)(A), cash in an amount equal to $2 million (such shares and
cash being withheld pursuant to this Section 2.05(a) being hereinafter referred
to as the "RTM ESCROW FUND"). To determine the number of shares and amount of
cash to be withheld from each RTMRG Shareholder:

                (i)     $20 million will be divided by the number of shares of
RTMRG Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the First
Effective Time, other than Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares, to determine
the "ESCROW AMOUNT PER SHARE"; and each RTMRG Shareholder's "INDIVIDUAL ESCROW
AMOUNT" will be determined by multiplying the number of shares of RTMRG Common
Stock owned by such RTMRG Shareholder immediately prior to the First Effective
Time by the Escrow Amount Per Share.

                (ii)    There shall be withheld from each RTMRG Shareholder
listed in ANNEX G a pro rata portion of the total number of shares of Triarc
Common Stock to be withheld for the RTM Escrow Fund determined based on the
number of such shares to be issued to such RTMRG Shareholder and to all RTMRG
Shareholders listed in ANNEX G.

                (iii)   There shall be withheld from each RTMRG Shareholder
listed in ANNEX G an amount of cash for the RTM Escrow Fund equal to the
difference determined by subtracting from such RTMRG Shareholder's Individual
Escrow Amount the value of the shares of Triarc Common Stock being withheld from
him or her, valued at the Current Market Price.

                (iv)    There shall be withheld from each RTMRG Shareholder
listed in ANNEX F a pro rata portion of the amount of cash to be withheld for
the RTM Escrow Fund MINUS the amount of cash withheld pursuant to Section
2.05(a)(iii) determined based on the number of shares of RTMRG Common Stock
owned immediately prior to the First Effective Time by such RTMRG Shareholder
and all RTMRG Shareholders listed on Annex F.

         (b)    Triarc shall deliver such cash and Triarc Certificates
representing such number of shares included in the RTM Escrow Fund to an
institution reasonably acceptable to Triarc and the RTM Representatives, as
escrow agent (the "ESCROW AGENT"), and the RTMRG Shareholders will deliver to
the Escrow Agent related stock transfer powers executed by the RTMRG
Shareholders. The Escrow Agent shall hold such cash and Triarc Certificates
representing the RTM Escrow Fund as security for (x) the obligations of the
RTMRG Shareholders, the RTMAC Sellers, RTMMC and the RTMMC Members under the
Escrow Agreement. The Triarc Certificates included in the RTM Escrow Fund shall
be represented by stock certificates issued in the names of the applicable RTMRG
Shareholders.

         (c)    By their approval and adoption of this Agreement and by their
acceptance of the Per Share Merger Consideration, the RTMRG Shareholders will be


                                      -14-
<PAGE>

conclusively deemed to have consented to, approved and agreed to be bound by:
(i) the obligations under 2.09 in respect of post Closing adjustments to the
Aggregate Merger Consideration; (ii) the indemnification provisions of Article
VIII and Article XI; (iii) the Escrow Agreement; and (iv) the appointment of
Russell V. Umphenour, Jr., Dennis E. Cooper and J. Russell Welch, as the RTM
Representatives.

         (d)    There shall also be withheld from the Aggregate Cash
Consideration the amount of $100,000 (the "EXPENSES FUND"), allocated to each
RTRMG Shareholder pro rata based on the number of shares of RTRMG Common Stock
owned immediately prior to the First Effective Time by such RTMRG Shareholder
and the number of such shares so owned by all RTMRG Shareholders. The Expenses
Fund shall be paid over to the RTM Representatives as an advance on expenses
that they may incur in performing their duties as such, and may be held and
applied by them in the manner they consider appropriate. Upon paying the
Expenses Fund over to the RTM Representatives as herein provided, neither Triarc
nor any of its Affiliates shall have any further obligations or any Liability
with respect thereto.

         Section 2.06   TREATMENT OF RTMRG STOCK OPTIONS. Except for the RTMRG
Rollover Options, RTMRG shall take all necessary actions to cause each option to
acquire shares of RTMRG Common Stock (each, an "RTMRG OPTION" and collectively,
the "RTMRG OPTIONS") outstanding, whether or not then exercisable or vested,
either to be exercised or terminated and cancelled immediately prior to the
First Effective Time and without any Liability after the First Effective Time to
RTMRG, Triarc or any of their Affiliates, including obtaining all necessary
consents or approvals from holders of RTMRG Options. From and after the First
Effective Time, no holder of an RTMRG Option shall have any rights in respect
thereof. If requested by Triarc, RTMRG will use reasonable efforts to cause each
holder of an RTMRG Option to execute and deliver to Triarc prior to the Closing
a waiver and release form relating to such termination and cancellation in a
form reasonably satisfactory to Triarc. Each RTMRG Rollover Option shall be
terminated and cancelled, in accordance with the terms thereof, at the First
Effective Time and without any Liability after the First Effective Time to
RTMRG, Triarc or any of their Affiliates and an option to acquire such number of
shares of Triarc Class B-1 Common Stock (if the Triarc B-1 Election shall have
been made) or Triarc Class B-2 Common Stock (if the Triarc B-2 Election shall
have been made) shall be granted (each option so granted, individually, a
REPLACEMENT OPTION and, collectively, the "REPLACEMENT OPTIONS") to replace such
terminated RTMRG Rollover Option as is determined in a manner consistent with a
methodology mutually agreed to by Triarc and the RTM Representative and that
complies with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code (and any guidance
issued by the IRS thereunder) and other requirements of applicable Law, with
such exercise prices and other provisions (which, to the extent permitted by
Section 409A of the Code, shall be at least as favorable as the provisions of
the RTMRG Rollover Option being replaced as such provisions are in effect at the
time of such replacement) as are set forth in the respective agreements granting
such Replacement Options to the holders thereof.

         Section 2.07   DISSENTING SHARES.

         (a)    Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
any outstanding shares of RTMRG Common Stock for which the holder thereof (i)
has not consented to the First Merger in writing and (ii) has demanded the
appraisal of such shares in accordance with, and has complied in all respects
with, Sections 14-2-1301 to 14-2-1332 of the GBCC (collectively, the "DISSENTING
SHARES") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger
Consideration in accordance with Section 2.02(c). At the First Effective Time,
(x) all Dissenting Shares shall be cancelled and cease to exist and (y) the
holder or holders of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled only to such rights as
may be granted to them under Sections 14-2-1301 to 14-2-1332 of the GBCC.

         (b)    Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.07(a), if any holder
of Dissenting Shares effectively withdraws or loses such appraisal rights
(through failure to perfect such appraisal rights or otherwise), then that
holder's shares (i) shall no longer be deemed to be Dissenting Shares and (ii)
shall be treated as if they had been converted automatically at the First
Effective Time into the right to receive the applicable Per Share Merger
Consideration upon surrender of the RTMRG Certificate representing such shares
in accordance with Section 2.04.

         (c)    RTMRG shall give Triarc (i) prompt notice of any demands for
appraisal of any outstanding shares of RTMRG Common Stock, the withdrawals of
such demands, and any other instrument served on RTMRG under the provisions of
Sections 14-2-1301 to 14-2-1332 of the GBCC and (ii) the right to participate in
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the
GBCC. RTMRG shall not offer to make or make any payment with respect to any
demands for appraisal without the prior written consent of Triarc.

         Section 2.08     PRE-CLOSING ADJUSTMENTS BASED ON ESTIMATED NET
LIABILITIES.

         (a)    On the tenth (10th) Business Day prior to the anticipated
Closing Date, (i) Triarc shall deliver to the RTM Representatives a certificate
duly executed by the chief financial officer of Triarc setting forth in
reasonable detail the computation of the estimated Net Liabilities of ARG and
its Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the Closing (the "ARG ESTIMATED NET
LIABILITIES") and (ii) the RTM Representatives shall deliver to Triarc a
certificate duly executed by the chief financial officer of each of the RTM
Parties setting forth in reasonable detail the computation of the estimated Net
Liabilities of the RTM Parties and their Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to
the Closing (the "RTM ESTIMATED NET LIABILITIES"). The items included in the ARG
Estimated Closing Net Liabilities and the RTM Estimated Closing Net Liabilities
shall be based on the most recently available month end balance sheets of ARG
and its Subsidiaries and the RTM Parties and their Subsidiaries, respectively,
with such adjustments thereto as are reasonably appropriate to reflect any
changes which are known to the applicable chief financial officer to have
occurred subsequent to that date or which, in the applicable chief financial
officer's reasonable judgment, will occur prior to the


                                      -16-
<PAGE>

Closing, and shall be calculated in accordance with the accounting principles,
methods and practices utilized in preparing the ARG Audited Financial Statements
and the Restated Combined RTM Audited Financial Statements, as the case may be,
applied on a consistent basis in accordance with GAAP, with such exceptions
thereto as are set forth in the definition of Net Liabilities.

         (b)    At the Closing, based solely on the ARG Estimated Net
Liabilities set forth in such certificate: (i) if the ARG Estimated Net
Liabilities are less than $268.2 million (the "ARG Benchmark"), then Triarc
shall cause ARG to deliver to Triarc cash (by wire transfer of immediately
available funds) in an amount equal to the amount (if any) by which such
difference exceeds $1 million; and (ii) if the ARG Estimated Net Liabilities are
greater than the ARG Benchmark, then Triarc shall deliver to ARG cash (by wire
transfer of immediately available funds) in an amount equal to the amount (if
any) by which such difference exceeds $1 million.

         (c)    At the Closing, based solely on the RTM Estimated Net
Liabilities set forth in such certificate: (i) if the RTM Estimated Net
Liabilities are less than $440.1 million (the "RTM Benchmark"), then the amount
of the Aggregate Cash Consideration to be paid pursuant to Section 2.01(a)(i)
shall be increased by an amount equal to the amount (if any) by which such
difference exceeds $1 million; and (ii) if the RTM Estimated Net Liabilities are
greater than the RTM Benchmark, then the amount of the Aggregate Cash
Consideration shall be decreased by an amount equal to the amount (if any) by
which such difference exceeds $1 million.

         (d)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, the provisions set forth in this Section 2.08 will apply only if the
Closing Date occurs after July 31, 2005.

         Section 2.09   POST-CLOSING ADJUSTMENTS BASED ON CLOSING NET
LIABILITIES.

         (a)    As promptly as practicable and in any event no later than 90
days after the Closing Date, Triarc shall cause ARG to have prepared and
delivered to the RTM Representatives, and shall cause Deloitte & Touche LLP to
audit, at ARG's cost and expense, (i) a consolidated balance sheet of ARG and
its Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the Closing (the "ARG CLOSING
BALANCE SHEET"), together with a statement certified by the chief financial
officer of ARG (the "ARG STATEMENT") setting forth in reasonable detail the
determination of the Net Liabilities of ARG and its Subsidiaries as of
immediately prior to the Closing based upon the amounts set forth on the ARG
Closing Balance Sheet (the "ARG CLOSING NET LIABILITIES"); PROVIDED, that Triarc
shall be obligated to cause Deloitte & Touche LLP to audit the ARG Closing
Balance Sheet only if the Triarc B-2 Election shall have been made; and (ii)
combined balance sheets of RTMRG and its Subsidiaries, RTMAC and the RTMMC
Purchased Assets and Assumed Liabilities as of immediately prior to the Closing
(the "RTM CLOSING BALANCE SHEET" and, together with the ARG Closing Balance
Sheet, the "CLOSING BALANCE SHEETS"), together with a statement certified by the
chief financial officer of ARG (the "RTM STATEMENT" and, together with the ARG
Statement, the


                                      -17-
<PAGE>

"STATEMENTS") setting forth in reasonable detail the determination of the Net
Liabilities of the RTM Parties and their Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to
the Closing based upon the amounts set forth on the RTM Closing Balance Sheet
(the "RTM CLOSING NET LIABILITIES"). The Closing Balance Sheets and the
Statements (to the extent the items included thereon are of the type reflected
on a balance sheet) shall be prepared in accordance with the accounting
principles, methods and practices utilized in preparing the ARG Audited
Financial Statements and the Restated Combined RTM Audited Financial Statements,
as the case may be, applied on a consistent basis in accordance with GAAP, with
such exceptions thereto as are set forth in the definition of Net Liabilities.
The Closing Balance Sheets and the Statements shall be final and binding on the
parties hereto, subject to the process of objection provided in this Section
2.09 below.

         (b)    Triarc shall cause ARG, the Surviving LLC, RTMAC and RTMMC
Acquisition Sub and their respective Subsidiaries to give the RTM
Representatives and their respective Representatives reasonable access to all of
their books, records, personnel, accountants, offices and other facilities and
properties as the RTM Representatives may require to review the Closing Balance
Sheets and the Statements. If the RTM Representatives believe that the
calculation of the ARG Closing Net Liabilities and/or RTM Closing Net
Liabilities was not determined in the manner required by Section 2.09(a), then
the RTM Representatives may, within 45 days after delivery of the Closing
Balance Sheets and Statement, deliver a notice (the "DISPUTE NOTICE") to Triarc,
setting forth the RTM Representatives' calculation of the ARG Closing Net
Liabilities and/or the RTM Closing Net Liabilities and specifying, in reasonable
detail, those items or amounts affecting the calculation as to which it
disagrees and the reasons for such disagreement. If prior to the conclusion of
such 45-day period the RTM Representatives notify Triarc in writing that they
will not provide a Dispute Notice or if a Dispute Notice is not delivered within
such 45-day period, the applicable Closing Net Liabilities, as set forth on the
applicable Statement, shall become final, conclusive and binding on the parties
hereto for all purposes of this Section 2.09.

         (c)    If the RTM Representatives deliver a Dispute Notice as provided
above, Triarc and the RTM Representatives shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to reach agreement on the disputed items or amounts in order to
determine the applicable Closing Net Liabilities. If Triarc and the RTM
Representatives do not resolve all disputed items or amounts set forth in the
Dispute Notice within 15 days after delivery of such Dispute Notice, the
remaining disputed items and amounts will be submitted to a nationally
recognized independent accounting firm in the U.S. mutually agreed to by Triarc
and the RTM Representatives (the "INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS") for resolution of
such disputed items and amounts. Triarc and the RTM Representatives will have
the opportunity to present their positions with respect to such disputed items
and amounts to the Independent Accountants, and such disputed items and amounts
shall be resolved by the Independent Accountants in accordance with the
requirements of Section 2.09(a). The Independent Accountants shall prepare a
written report setting forth the resolution of such disputed items and amounts
and calculating the revised amount of such Closing Net Liabilities, which shall
be delivered to each of Triarc and the RTM Representatives promptly, but in no
event later than 30 days after such disputed items and amounts are submitted to
the Independent Accountants. Such revised amount of such Closing Net


                                      -18-
<PAGE>

Liabilities shall not reflect any difference from the amount of such Closing Net
Liabilities set forth on the applicable Statement other than differences
required to reflect the resolution of such disputed items and amounts by the
Independent Accountants. The revised amount of such Closing Net Liabilities set
forth on the Independent Accountants' written report shall be final, conclusive
and binding upon the parties hereto. The procedures set forth in this Agreement
for resolution of disputes concerning such Closing Net Liabilities shall be
final and binding on all of the parties, and shall not be subject to appeal of
any kind. The fees and disbursements of the Independent Accountants shall be
borne by the party whose determination of such Closing Net Liabilities is
farthest in difference from the revised amount of such Closing Net Liabilities
set forth in the Independent Accountants' written report. Each of Triarc and the
RTM Representatives shall execute a reasonably acceptable engagement letter, if
requested to do so by the Independent Accountants, and shall provide reasonable
access to their respective employees who are responsible for financial matters,
and Triarc shall provide reasonable access to the books and records of Triarc
and its Subsidiaries.

         (d)    The parties shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the final determination of the ARG Closing Net Liabilities in accordance
with this Section 2.09 to occur prior to the earlier of the Trigger Event and
January 3, 2006. Upon the final determination of the ARG Closing Net Liabilities
in accordance with this Section 2.09, the payment called for under Section
2.08(b) shall be recalculated by substituting the ARG Closing Net Liabilities
for the ARG Estimated Net Liabilities in the calculation. If such recalculation
results in Triarc being owed a payment, then Triarc shall cause ARG to deliver
to Triarc or its designee, within five Business Days after such final
determination, cash (by wire transfer of immediately available funds) in an
amount equal to the amount that Triarc would have been paid if the payment
called for in Section 2.08(b) had been calculated on the basis of the ARG
Closing Net Liabilities, PLUS interest thereon at the Applicable Rate accruing
from the Closing Date through the date of payment. If such recalculation results
in Triarc owing a payment, then Triarc shall deliver to ARG, within five
Business Days after such final determination, an amount of cash (by wire
transfer of immediately available funds) equal to the amount that ARG would have
been paid if the payment called for in Section 2.08(b) had been calculated on
the basis of the ARG Closing Net Liabilities, PLUS interest accrued thereon at
the Applicable Rate from the Closing Date to the date of payment. In computing
the amount of the recalculated payment owed by or to Triarc pursuant to this
Section 2.09(d), the effect of any payments made pursuant to Section 2.08(b)
shall be reversed, which may result in a greater or lesser payment being owed by
Triarc or a greater or lesser payment being owed to Triarc under this Section
2.09(d) than would have been the case had no payments been made under Section
2.08(b).

         (e)    Upon the final determination of the RTM Closing Net Liabilities
in accordance with this Section 2.09, the adjustment to the Aggregate Cash
Consideration called for under Section 2.08(c) shall be recalculated by
substituting the RTM Closing Net Liabilities for the RTM Estimated Net
Liabilities in the calculation. If the Aggregate Cash Consideration as
originally adjusted pursuant to Section 2.08(c) is less than the Aggregate Cash
Consideration would have been if the original adjustment were made on the basis
of the RTM Closing Net Liabilities, then Triarc shall cause ARG to deliver to


                                      -19-
<PAGE>

the RTM Representatives, within five Business Days after such final
determination, for distribution by them pro rata to the RTMRG Shareholders, as
an increase to the Aggregate Cash Consideration, cash (by wire transfer of
immediately available funds) in an amount equal to the amount (if any) by which
the Aggregate Cash Consideration that would have been paid if the adjustment
pursuant to Section 2.08(c) had been calculated on the basis of the RTM Closing
Net Liabilities exceeds the Aggregate Cash Consideration that was paid, PLUS
interest thereon at the Applicable Rate accruing from the Closing Date through
the date of payment. If the Aggregate Cash Consideration as originally adjusted
pursuant to Section 2.08(c) is more than the Aggregate Cash Consideration would
have been if the original adjustment were made on the basis of the RTM Closing
Net Liabilities, then the RTMRG Shareholders and the RTMRG Principal
Shareholders (jointly and severally, pursuant to the Transaction Support
Agreement) shall deliver to ARG for no additional consideration an amount of
cash equal to the amount (if any) by which the Aggregate Cash Consideration that
was paid exceeds the Aggregate Cash Consideration that would have been paid if
the adjustment pursuant to Section 2.08(c) had been calculated on the basis of
the RTM Closing Net Liabilities, PLUS interest accrued thereon at the Applicable
Rate from the Closing Date to the date of payment (the "RTM SHORTFALL AMOUNT"),
and such delivery shall be effected as follows: (A) if the RTM Escrow Fund
contains cash at such time, then each of Triarc and the RTM Representatives
shall, in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement, instruct the Escrow

Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and their combined results of operations

                                      -48-

RTMRG has heretofore made available to Triarc a true, complete and correct copy
of any disclosure (or, if unwritten, a summary thereof) by any Representative of
RTMRG or its Subsidiaries to RTMRG's independent auditors relating to (x) any
significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal controls which
could adversely affect the ability of RTMRG or any of its Subsidiaries to
record, process, summarize and report financial data and any material weaknesses

or deletions thereto after the date hereof in compliance with Section 6.02 and

The aggregate amount of prepayment penalties, premiums, make wholes, breakage
and other costs and expenses payable to the lenders as such of all such
Indebtedness solely on account of the repayment of such Indebtedness in the Debt
Refinancings will not exceed $20 million. Section 5.07(c) of the RTMRG
Disclosure Letter specifically identifies all Indebtedness of RTMRG or any of
its Subsidiaries or included in the Winners Indebtedness Amount that constitutes
RTM Non-Prepayable Debt. All such Indebtedness of the RTM Parties and their

past practice or in

RTMRG Disclosure Letter and (iv) Liabilities that are (A) the subject of any
other representation or warranty contained in this Article V and are

materiality or (B) taken into account in the determination of the RTM Estimated
Net Liabilities or RTM Closing Net Liabilities.

         Section 5.10   COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS; PERMITS.

be reasonably likely to result in the revocation, nonrenewal, suspension or
adverse modification of such RTMRG Permit except for such revocations,
non-renewals, suspensions or adverse modifications that have not been and would
not reasonably be expected to be, individually or in the aggregate, material to
RTMRG and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. There is not pending, nor to the
Knowledge of RTMRG, threatened, against RTMRG or any of its Subsidiaries, any
application, action, petition, objection or other pleading, or any proceeding,

director or officer of RTMRG or any of its Subsidiaries (the "D&O INDEMNIFIED
PARTIES") as provided in the articles of incorporation and bylaws (or similar
organizational instruments) of RTMRG or its Subsidiaries, in agreements between
a D&O Indemnified Party and RTMRG or one of its Subsidiaries, or otherwise in
effect on the date of this


                                      -74-
<PAGE>

Agreement shall, in each case, survive the Mergers and the consummation of the
other transactions contemplated hereby and shall continue in full force and
effect for a period of not less than six years after the Closing.

         (b)    Triarc shall cause the Surviving LLC to indemnify all D&O
Indemnified Parties to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws with
respect to all acts and omissions arising out of or relating to its services as
directors or officers of RTMRG or its Subsidiaries occurring prior to the
Closing. If any D&O Indemnified Party is or becomes involved in any Legal Action
in connection with any matter occurring prior to or at the Closing, Triarc shall
cause the Surviving LLC to pay as incurred such D&O Indemnified Party's legal
fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with such Legal Action, subject
to Triarc's receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such D&O Indemnified
Party to repay such legal fees, costs and expenses if it is ultimately
determined under applicable Laws that such D&O Indemnified Party is not entitled
to be indemnified.

         (c)    Triarc shall cause the Surviving LLC to obtain, for a period
of six years after the Closing, extended reporting or tail coverage on, or a
substitute directors' and officers' liability insurance policy for, the
directors' and officers' liability insurance policy maintained by RTMRG and its
Subsidiaries as of the date hereof for the benefit of those persons who are
covered by such policies immediately prior to the Closing, in each case, on
terms and conditions that are, in the aggregate, no less favorable to the
insured with respect to claims arising from acts or omissions arising prior to
and including the Closing than are currently in effect; PROVIDED, that such
extended reporting or tail coverage or such substitute policy, as the case may
be, can be obtained and maintained on commercially reasonable terms and at a
cost to the Surviving LLC not greater than 150 percent of the aggregate annual
premium for the directors' and officers' liability insurance policy maintained
by RTMRG on the date hereof. If the Surviving LLC is unable to obtain such
coverage or policy for the cost indicated in the preceding sentence, Triarc
shall cause the Surviving LLC to procure the most favorable coverage or policy,
in Triarc's reasonable judgment, that the Surviving LLC can reasonably obtain
for the cost indicated in the preceding sentence.

         Section 7.13   PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS. Triarc shall consult with the RTM
Representatives, and RTMRG shall consult with Triarc, before issuing any press
release or otherwise making any public statements about this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Neither Triarc nor RTMRG shall
issue or cause to be issued any such press release or make any such public
statement prior to such consultation, except to the extent required by
applicable Laws, in which case that party shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to consult with the other party before issuing any such release or
making any such public statement.

         Section 7.14   SARBANES-OXLEY COMPLIANCE. Prior to the Closing, RTMRG
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its Representatives to, take all
actions that Triarc may deem necessary or appropriate, and cooperate in the
taking of such actions, to enable Triarc, following the Closing, to satisfy the
applicable obligations under Sections 302, 404 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
of 2002 and the rules and


                                      -75-
<PAGE>

regulations promulgated by the SEC pursuant thereto (as amended from time to
time, the "SOA") and the other requirements of the SOA, including establishing
and maintaining adequate disclosure controls and procedures and internal
controls over financial reporting as such terms are defined in the SOA.

         Section 7.15   RTM INSURANCE MATTERS.

         (a)    The parties agree that Casualty Insurance Claims relating to
any of the RTM Parties or any of their Subsidiaries (including reported claims
and including incurred but not reported claims) and all claims under any of the
group policies identified on Section 5.14 of the RTMRG Disclosure Letter ("GROUP
INSURANCE CLAIMS") relating to any of the RTM Parties or any of their
Subsidiaries (including reported claims and incurred but not reported claims)
will remain with the applicable RTM Parties and their Subsidiaries (or their
successors pursuant to this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement) immediately
following the Closing. The parties agree that Casualty Insurance Claims and
Group Insurance Claims relating to any Affiliates of the RTM Parties that will
not be a Subsidiary of Triarc immediately after the Closing, including the Mrs.
Winners Obligors (the "EXCLUDED RTM AFFILIATES") (including reported claims and
including incurred but not reported claims) will remain with the Excluded RTM
Affiliates immediately following the Closing. For purposes hereof, "CASUALTY
INSURANCE CLAIMS" shall mean workers' compensation and all liability policies
and all related expenses to the extent not covered by insurance, including, but
not limited to, claims, retentions, loss sensitive adjustments, audits and third
party administrative adjustments. The Casualty Insurance Claims and Group
Insurance Claims are subject to the provisions of policies of insurance with
insurance carriers and contractual arrangements with insurance adjusters
maintained by RTMRG prior to the Closing (collectively, the "RTM INSURANCE
POLICIES"). With respect to the Casualty Insurance Claims and Group Insurance
Claims, the following procedures shall apply to Casualty Insurance Claims and
Group Insurance Claims incurred prior to the Closing: (i) the Surviving LLC
shall continue to administer, adjust, settle and pay, in a manner consistent
with past practice, on behalf of the Excluded RTM Affiliates, all Casualty
Insurance Claims and Group Insurance Claims with dates of occurrence prior to
the Closing Date, (ii) to the extent such Casualty Insurance Claims or Group
Insurance Claims are accrued or reserved for on the RTM Closing Balance Sheet,
such payments shall be for the applicable Excluded RTM Affiliates' account, and
(iii) to the extent the aggregate amount of such Casualty Insurance Claims or
Group Insurance Claims exceed the amounts accrued or reserved for on the RTM
Closing Balance Sheet, the Surviving LLC will invoice the Excluded RTM
Affiliates at the end of each month for Casualty Insurance Claims and Group
Insurance Claims paid on behalf of the Excluded RTM Affiliates during the
previous month by the Surviving LLC, or to the extent the Surviving LLC is
obligated to reimburse its insurance companies or insurance adjusters therefor,
by such insurance companies or adjusters. Each such invoice shall be supported
by such detailed information as the Excluded RTM Affiliates may reasonably
request. The Excluded RTM Affiliates shall promptly pay the Surviving LLC each
monthly invoice. Casualty Insurance Claims and Group Insurance Claims to be paid
by the Excluded RTM Affiliates hereunder shall include all costs necessary to
settle claims including, but not limited to, compensatory, medical, legal,
adjusting fees and other expenses reasonably allocated by the Surviving LLC to
the Excluded RTM Affiliates,


                                      -76-
<PAGE>

including audits and any adjustments to required collateral. If there is a
general deductible or self-insurance retention applicable on an aggregate basis
to all claims under an RTM Insurance Policy, the deductible or retention shall
be allocated to the Excluded RTM Affiliates based on their percentage of the
dollar value of all claims under the RTM Insurance Policy as determined by the
Surviving LLC. In the event that any Casualty Insurance Claim or Group Insurance
Claim exceeds a deductible or self-insured retention under the RTM Insurance
Policies, and provided that the Excluded RTM Affiliates shall have promptly paid
any costs related to such Casualty Insurance Claim or Group Insurance Claim, the
Excluded RTM Affiliates shall be entitled to the benefit of any insurance
proceeds that may be available to discharge any portion of such Casualty
Insurance Claims or Group Insurance Claims, which shall be promptly paid over by
RTMRG to the Excluded RTM Affiliates.

         (b)    Neither Triarc nor any of its Affiliates shall be responsible
to the Excluded RTM Affiliates for the failure of any insurer to pay under any
such RTM Insurance Policy other than for a failure to pay premiums when due.

         (c)    Nothing in this Agreement is intended to provide or shall be
construed as providing a benefit or release to any insurer or claims service
organization of any obligation under any RTM Insurance Policy. The parties
confirm that the sole intention of this Section 7.15 is to divide and allocate
between them and the benefits and obligations under the RTM Insurance Policies
as of the Closing Date and not to affect, enhance or diminish the rights and
obligations of any insurer or claims service organization thereunder. Nothing
herein shall be construed as creating or permitting any insurer or claims
service organization the right of subrogation against any of the parties or any
of their Affiliates in respect of payment made by one to the other under any RTM
Insurance Policy.

         Section 7.16   CERTAIN LOAN REPAYMENTS.

         (a)    At the Closing, as part of the Debt Refinancings, Triarc shall
cause ARG to repay in full all of the Indebtedness identified in Section 7.16 of
the RTMRG Disclosure Letter, other than any such Indebtedness which by its terms
may not be prepaid at the Closing or may be prepaid at the Closing only upon
delivery prior to the Closing of irrevocable notice, in which case such
Indebtedness shall be prepaid or repaid in accordance with its terms as soon as
practicable following the Closing and thereupon provide to the RTM
Representatives evidence of the repayment of such Indebtedness and the
termination of all Liens and guarantees related thereto. At the Closing, RTMRG
shall transfer (i) to ARG the RTMMC receivable and (ii) to Triarc the promissory
notes evidencing the RTMRG Shareholders Obligations Amount for cancellation and
delivery to the RTMRG Shareholders in accordance with Article II.

         (b)    At the Closing, Triarc may, at its option, cause ARG to repay to
Triarc (x) all intercompany Indebtedness of ARG or any of its Subsidiaries owed
to Triarc or any of its Subsidiaries (other than ARG or any of its Subsidiaries)
and (y) an amount equal to all capital contributions made to ARG or any of its
Subsidiaries by


                                      -77-
<PAGE>

Triarc or any of its Subsidiaries (other than ARG or any of its Subsidiaries)
after January 2, 2005.

         (c)    Prior to the Closing, Triarc shall cause ARG to request that the
counterparty release the guarantors (the "RELATED PERSON GUARANTORS") under any
or all of the guaranties of performance bonds and leases set forth in Section
7.16(c) of the RTMRG Disclosure Letter, it being acknowledged and agreed that
neither Triarc nor any of its Affiliates shall be obligated to pay any money or
incur any obligations to obtain such release. To the extent ARG fails to obtain
such releases, Triarc shall cause ARG and its Subsidiaries to indemnify, defend
and hold harmless the Related Person Guarantors from and against any Liabilities
arising from and after the Closing Date suffered by them under such guaranties.

         Section 7.17   CO-BRANDED RESTAURANTS. Prior to the Closing, RTMRG
shall, and shall cause the Mrs. Winners Obligors to, amend the terms of the
franchise and other agreements related to the Restaurants that are co-branded
with the Mrs. Winners Obligors to permit the Surviving LLC or its Subsidiaries
to terminate such Mrs. Winner's franchise and other agreements at any time from
and after the Closing without any Liability for any royalty payments payable
thereunder in respect of any period after the date of such termination.

         Section 7.18   RTM TRADEMARKS. Prior to the Closing, RTMRG shall cause
RTM, Inc. to assign all right, title and interest in and to the RTM trade name,
RTM service mark and the RTM trademarks, and all goodwill associated therewith,
including the trademark registrations set forth in Section 7.18 of the RTMRG
Disclosure Letter, to RTMMC. In connection with such assignment, RTMRG shall
cause RTM, Inc. to file assignment documentation, in a form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Triarc, with the United States Patent and Trademark
Office for the purpose of recording such transfer.

         Section 7.19   CHARITABLE COMMITMENTS. Prior to the Closing, (x) RTMRG
shall, or shall cause its applicable Subsidiary to, fund in full and terminate
each charitable commitment described (or that should have been described) in
Section 5.12(a)(xviii) of the RTMRG Disclosure Letter and (y) ARG shall, or
shall cause its applicable Subsidiary to fund in full and terminate each
charitable commitment described (or that should have been described) in Section
3.12(a)(xviii) of the Triarc Disclosure Letter.

         Section 7.20   ACTIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE TRIGGER EVENT. On or
promptly after the date of this Agreement, Triarc shall issue a press release
which shall include the statements with respect to the Trigger Event in
substantially the form attached hereto as ANNEX H. Following the issuance of
such press release, Triarc agrees that, unless an Adverse Board Determination
shall have been made, it shall explore in good faith the implementation of the
Trigger Event. If Triarc's board of directors determines that it is in the best
interests of Triarc and its stockholders (other than stockholders holding shares
of Triarc Class B-2 Common Stock) to effect the Trigger Event and to do so prior
to January 3, 2006 (a "FAVORABLE BOARD DETERMINATION"), then Triarc shall,


                                      -78-
<PAGE>

subject to applicable fiduciary duties of its board of directors and other
applicable Laws, the receipt of all requisite consents and approvals and the
right of its board of directors thereafter to make at any time an Adverse Board
Determination in its sole discretion, use its good faith efforts to effect the
Trigger Event prior to January 3, 2006 on such terms as Triarc's board of
directors determines. Nothing in this Section 7.20 shall be construed to require
(x) the board of directors of Triarc to make a Favorable Board Determination or
not to make an Adverse Board Determination or (y) Triarc to effect the Trigger
Event prior to January 3, 2006 or at any time thereafter.

         Section 7.21   DELIVERY OF 2005 RTM AUDITED FINANCIALS. If the Closing
shall not have occurred prior to the date that is 90 days after May 29, 2005,
then on or prior to such date, RTMRG shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to deliver to Triarc the audited combined balance sheets and statements of
income, net capital deficiency and cash flows as of and for the fiscal year
ended May 29, 2005 for the RTM Parties and their Subsidiaries accompanied by an
unqualified audit report of Ernst & Young LLP (the "2005 RTM AUDITED
FINANCIALS").

         Section 7.22   EXCLUDED ASSET DISPOSITION PROCEEDS. Triarc shall cause
RTMRG promptly to remit to the RTM Representatives for distribution to the RTMRG
Shareholders any proceeds received by RTMRG or any of its Subsidiaries after the
Closing in respect of any Excluded Asset Dispositions.

         Section 7.23   AMENDMENT OF RTMRG ROLLOVER OPTIONS. No later than seven
business days following the date hereof, RTMRG shall amend each RTMRG Rollover
Option to provide that (i) such RTMRG Rollover Option shall continue to vest in
accordance with the vesting schedule set forth in the stock option agreement
pursuant to which such RTMRG Rollover Option was granted, and the vesting of
such RTMRG Rollover Option shall not be accelerated upon, or in connection with,
the consummation of the RTM Transactions and (ii) if not inconsistent with the
requirements of Section 409A of the Code as determined by RTMRG in its sole
discretion, to the extent that such RTMRG Rollover Option has a per share
exercise price that is less than the fair market value of a share of RTMRG
Common Stock immediately prior to the First Effective Time, such RTMRG Rollover
Option shall, to the extent then unvested, become vested upon the occurrence of
a termination of the holder of such RTMRG Rollover Option's employment following
the First Effective Time for any reason entitling such holder to severance
pursuant to the holder's employment agreement.


                                  ARTICLE VIII

                                   TAX MATTERS

         Section 8.01   TAX INDEMNIFICATION.

         (a)    INDEMNIFICATION BY RTMRG SHAREHOLDERS. From and after the
Closing Date, the RTMRG Shareholders (to the extent of the RTM Escrow Fund), and
after the RTM Escrow Fund has been exhausted in full, the RTMRG Principal
Shareholders (jointly and severally, pursuant to the Transaction Support
Agreement),


                                      -79-
<PAGE>

shall, subject to the applicable limitations set forth in Article XI, indemnify
the Triarc Indemnified Parties against and hold harmless from any and all
liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards,
judgments and penalties (including, reasonable fees for both in-house and
outside counsel, accountants and other outside consultants) suffered or incurred
(each a "TAX LOSS" and collectively, the "TAX LOSSES") arising out of:

                (i)     Taxes of RTMRG or its Subsidiaries for periods or
portions thereof ending on or before the Closing Date ("PRE-CLOSING TAXES"), and
Taxes of RTMRG or its Subsidiaries attributable to the RTMRG Transactions, in
excess of the amount of Taxes which are specifically identified as current
liabilities (excluding any reserve for deferred taxes established to reflect
timing differences between book and Tax income) on the RTM Closing Balance
Sheet;

                (ii)    Taxes of any member of an affiliated, consolidated,
combined or unitary group of which RTMRG or any of its Subsidiaries is or was a
member on or prior to the Closing Date by reason of Liability under Treasury
Regulation ss.1.1502-6, Treasury Regulation ss.1.1502-78 or comparable provision
of foreign, state or local Law, excluding any Taxes of any member of an
affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary group of which RTMRG or any of its
Subsidiaries becomes a member on the Closing Date on or after the Closing (or at
any time after the Closing Date) and any Taxes which are specifically identified
as current liabilities (excluding any reserve for deferred Taxes established to
reflect timing differences between book and Tax income) on the RTM Closing
Balance Sheet;

                (iii)   Taxes or other payments with respect to periods or
portions thereof ending on or before the Closing Date which are required to be
paid after the date hereof by RTMRG or any of its Subsidiaries to any party
under any Tax Sharing Agreement (whether written or not) or by reason of being a
successor-in-interest or transferee of another entity; (iv) without duplication,
Taxes imposed on Triarc or any of its Subsidiaries as a result of (x) a breach
of or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty set forth in Section 5.13 or
in the certificate delivered by the RTM Representatives pursuant to Section
9.02(d), as of the date such representation or warranty was made or as if such
representation or warranty were made on and as of the Closing Date (except for
representations and warranties that expressly relate to a specified date, the
breach of or inaccuracy in which will be determined with reference to such
specified date) or (y) a breach of any covenant or agreement set forth in
Section 6.02(p) or this Article VIII; PROVIDED, that for purposes of this
Section 8.01(a)(iv) only, a breach of or inaccuracy in any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement shall be determined without reference to any
materiality qualifier with respect thereto; and

                (v)     Taxes imposed on Triarc or any of its Subsidiaries
attributable to any "excess loss account" (within the meaning of Treasury
Regulation ss. 1.1502-19) existing as of the Closing Date with respect to the
capital stock of any Subsidiaries of RTMRG, except to the extent such Tax would
not have arisen but for the


                                      -80-
<PAGE>

failure of Triarc and its Subsidiaries to make (in whole or in part) the Triarc
ELA Contributions.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the RTMRG Shareholders or the RTMRG Principal
Shareholders (as the case may be) shall not be obligated to pay any amounts
under this Section 8.01(a) (x) for any Tax Losses resulting from any transaction
of RTMRG or its Subsidiaries on the Closing Date but after the Closing, other
than any transaction in the ordinary course of business and any RTMRG
Transactions, or (y) in respect of Pre-Closing Taxes attributable to an audit
adjustment by a Governmental Entity if such audit adjustment conforms the
treatment of an item on a Tax Return (other than a Straddle Return) of RTMRG or
its Subsidiaries for a Pre-Closing Taxable Period ("RTMRG PRE-CLOSING TAX
RETURN") to the treatment of the same item on a Tax Return (other than a
Straddle Return) of RTMRG or its Subsidiaries for any taxable period other than
a Pre-Closing Taxable Period ("RTMRG POST-CLOSING TAX RETURN"), excluding any
items related to any management agreements or similar arrangements among any of
RTMRG, its Affiliates and any of its shareholders, if the treatment of such item
on the RTMRG Post-Closing Tax Return is inconsistent with the treatment of such
item on the RTMRG Pre-Closing Tax Return until the aggregate amount of such
Pre-Closing Taxes equals $1 million (the "RTMRG TAX BASKET AMOUNT"), after which
the RTMRG Shareholders and the RTMRG Principal Shareholders shall be obligated
to pay the full amount of such Pre-Closing Taxes in excess of the RTMRG Tax
Basket Amount.

         (b)    INDEMNIFICATION CALCULATIONS. All indemnification payments
for Tax Losses made pursuant to this Section 8.01, and for Losses made pursuant
to Section 11.02 and Section 11.04, shall be made on an after-tax basis.
Accordingly, in determining the amount of any indemnification payment for a Tax
Loss or Loss suffered or incurred by an indemnitee hereunder, the amount of such
Tax Loss or Loss shall be (i) increased to take into account any additional Tax
cost actually incurred by the indemnitee arising from the receipt of
indemnification payments hereunder ("TAX COSTS") and (ii) decreased to take into
account any deduction, credit or other tax benefit actually realized by the
indemnitee with respect to such Tax Loss or Loss ("TAX BENEFITS"). In computing
the amount of any such Tax Cost or Tax Benefit, the indemnitee shall be deemed
to recognize all other items of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit before
recognizing any item arising from the receipt of any indemnification payment
hereunder or the incurrence or payment of any indemnified Tax Loss or Loss;
PROVIDED, that if a Tax Cost or Tax Benefit is not realized in the taxable
period during which an indemnifying party makes an indemnification payment or
the indemnitee incurs or pays any Tax Loss or Loss, the parties hereto shall
thereafter make payments to one another at the end of each subsequent taxable
period to reflect the net Tax Costs and Tax Benefits realized by the parties
hereto in each such subsequent taxable period.

         Section 8.02   TAX INDEMNIFICATION PROCEDURES.

         (a)    After the Closing, Triarc shall promptly notify the RTM
Representatives in writing of any demand, claim or notice of the commencement of
an audit received by such party from any Governmental Entity or any other Person
with respect to Taxes for which the RTMRG Shareholders or the RTMRG Principal


                                      -81-
<PAGE>

Shareholders (as the case may be) are liable pursuant to Section 8.01; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that a failure to give such notice will not affect the Triarc
Indemnified Parties' rights to indemnification under this Article VIII, except
to the extent that the RTMRG Shareholders or the RTMRG Principal Shareholders
(as the case may be) are actually prejudiced thereby. Such notice shall contain
factual information (to the extent known) describing the asserted Tax liability
and shall include copies of the relevant portion of any notice or other document
received from any Governmental Entity or any other Person in respect of any such
asserted Tax liability.

         (b)    Payment by the RTMRG Shareholders or the RTMRG Principal
Shareholders (as the case may be) of any amount due to the Triarc Indemnified
Parties under this Article VIII shall be made within ten Business Days following
written notice by a Triarc Indemnified Party that payment of such amounts to the
appropriate Governmental Entity or other applicable third party is due by a
Triarc Indemnified Party, PROVIDED, that the RTMRG Shareholders or the RTMRG
Principal Shareholders (as the case may be) shall not be required to make any
payment earlier than five Business Days before it is due to the appropriate
Governmental Entity or applicable third party. In the case of a Tax that is
contested in accordance with the provisions of Section 8.03, payment of such
contested Tax will not be considered due earlier than the date a "final
determination" to such effect is made by such Governmental Entity or a court of
competent jurisdiction. For this purpose, a "final determination" shall mean a
settlement, compromise, or other agreement with the relevant Governmental
Entity, whether contained in an IRS Form 870 or other comparable form, or
otherwise, or such procedurally later event, such as a closing agreement with
the relevant Governmental Entity, and agreement contained in an IRS Form 870-D
or other comparable form, an agreement that constitutes a "determination" under
Section 1313(a)(4) of the Code, a deficiency notice with respect to which the
period for filing a petition with the Tax Court or the relevant state, local or
foreign tribunal has expired or a decision of any court of competent
jurisdiction that is not subject to appeal or as to which the time for appeal
has expired.

         (c)    All amounts required to be paid pursuant to this Article VIII
shall be paid promptly in immediately available funds by wire transfer to a bank
account designated by the indemnified party. In seeking indemnification under
this Article VIII against the RTMRG Shareholders, the Triarc Indemnified Parties
shall first exercise its remedies with respect to the RTM Escrow Fund pursuant
to the Escrow Agreement and, if the RTM Escrow Fund has been exhausted in full,
with respect to the RTMRG Principal Shareholders (individually or jointly)
pursuant to the Transaction Support Agreement.

         (d)    Any payments required pursuant to this Article VIII that are
not made within the time period specified in this Section 8.02 shall bear
interest at a rate and in the manner provided in the Code for interest on
underpayments of federal income Tax and, in the case of payments related to
Taxes other than U.S. federal income Taxes, at a rate and in the manner provided
under applicable Law for underpayments of such Tax.

         Section 8.03   RTM TAX AUDITS AND CONTESTS; COOPERATION.

         (a)    After the Closing Date, the RTM Representatives shall control
the conduct, through counsel of their own choosing, of any audit, claim for
refund, or administrative or judicial proceeding involving any asserted Tax
liability or refund (any such audit, claim for refund, or proceeding relating to
an asserted Tax liability referred to herein as a "CONTEST") that relates solely
to Taxes for which the Triarc Indemnified Parties are indemnified under Section
8.01(a), but Triarc shall have the right to participate in such Contest at its
own expense, and the RTM Representatives shall not settle, compromise and/or
concede any portion of such Contest that is reasonably likely to affect the Tax
liability of Triarc or its Subsidiaries for any taxable year (or portion
thereof) beginning after the Closing Date without the consent of Triarc, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; PROVIDED,
that if the RTM Representatives fail to assume control of the conduct of any
such Contest within a reasonable period following the receipt by the RTM
Representatives of notice of such Contest, Triarc shall have the right to assume
control of such Contest and shall be able to settle, compromise and/or concede
such Contest in its sole discretion.

         (b)    After the Closing Date, subject to Section 8.03(a), Triarc shall
control the conduct of any Contest pertaining to RTMRG or any of its
Subsidiaries, but the RTM Representatives shall have the right to participate in
any such Contest that relates to Taxes for which the Triarc Indemnified Parties
are indemnified under Section 8.01(a) ("PARTICIPATION CONTEST") at their own
expense and Triarc shall not settle, compromise and/or concede any portion of
such Participation Contest if such resolution is reasonably likely to give rise
to a Tax liability for which the Triarc Indemnified Parties are indemnified
under Section 8.01(a), without the consent of the RTM Representatives, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; PROVIDED,
that if Triarc fails to assume control of the conduct of any such Participation
Contest within a reasonable period following the receipt by Triarc of notice of
such Participation Contest, the RTM Representatives shall have the right to
assume control of such Participation Contest and shall be able to settle,
compromise and/or concede such Participation Contest in its sole discretion.

         (c)    Triarc and the RTM Representatives agree to furnish or cause
to be furnished to each other, upon request, as promptly as practicable, such
information (including access to books and records) and assistance relating to
RTMRG and its Subsidiaries as is reasonably requested for the filing of any Tax
Returns and the preparation, prosecution, defense or conduct of any Contest.
Triarc and the RTM Representatives shall reasonably cooperate with each other in
the conduct of any Contest or other proceeding involving or otherwise relating
to RTMRG or its Subsidiaries (or their income or assets) with respect to any Tax
and each shall execute and deliver such powers of attorney and other documents
as are necessary to carry out the intent of this Section 8.03(c). Without

Principal Shareholders (as the case may be) shall be responsible for the
Pre-Closing Taxes due in respect of such Tax Returns for RTMRG and its
Subsidiaries ("PRE-CLOSING RTMRG RETURNS"), to the extent that the aggregate
amount of Pre-Closing Taxes due in respect of all such Tax Returns exceeds the
amount of Taxes that are specifically identified as current liabilities
(excluding any reserve for


                                      -84-
<PAGE>

deferred taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax
income) on the RTM Closing Balance Sheet, and Triarc shall, subject to Section
8.01(a), be responsible for all other Pre-Closing Taxes shown as due on such Tax
Returns. Triarc shall notify the RTM Representatives of any amounts due from the

Tax Return no later than ten Business Days prior to the date on which such Tax
Return is due, and the RTMRG Shareholders or the RTMRG Principal Shareholders
shall remit such payment to Triarc no later than five Business Days prior to the

         (b)    In the case of any Pre-Closing RTMRG Returns, Triarc shall

past practice, except as otherwise required by a change in law or a good faith
resolution of a contest, and shall deliver any such Tax Return to the RTM
Representatives for their review at least 30 days prior to the date such Tax

such Tax Return, they shall notify Triarc of such disputed item (or items) and
the basis for its objection. The parties shall act in good faith to resolve any
such dispute prior to the date on which the relevant Tax Return is required to
be filed. If the parties cannot resolve any disputed item, the item in question
shall be resolved by the Independent Accountants. The fees and expenses of the
Independent Accountants shall be borne equally by Triarc and the RTM
Representatives.

         (c)    With respect to Tax Returns that are required to be filed by or

Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with past practice (except as
otherwise required by a change in law or a good faith resolution of a contest),
and the RTMRG Shareholders or the RTMRG Principal Shareholders (as the case may
be) shall be responsible for the Pre-Closing Taxes due in respect of such
Straddle Returns in excess of the amount of such Taxes which are specifically
identified as current liabilities (excluding any reserve for deferred Taxes
established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax income) on the
RTM Closing Balance Sheet. Triarc shall notify the RTM Representatives of any
amounts due from the RTMRG Shareholders or the RTMRG Principal Shareholders (as
the case may be) in respect of any Straddle Return no later than ten Business
Days prior to the date on which such Straddle Return is due, and the RTMRG
Shareholders or the RTMRG Principal Shareholders (as the case may be) shall

such Straddle Return is due. Triarc shall deliver any Straddle Return to the RTM
Representatives for their review at least 30 days prior to the date on which
such Tax Return is required to be filed. If the RTM Representatives dispute any
item on such Tax Return, they shall notify Triarc of such disputed item (or
items) and the basis for their objection. The parties shall act in good faith to
resolve any such dispute prior to the date on which the relevant Tax Return is
required to be filed. If the parties cannot resolve any disputed item, the item
in question shall be resolved by the Independent Accountants. The fees and
expenses of the Independent Accountants shall be borne equally by Triarc and the
RTM Representatives.

         (d)    Neither Triarc nor any of its Affiliates shall (or shall cause
or permit any of their Subsidiaries to) amend, refile or otherwise modify any
Tax Return

any Pre-Closing Taxable Period without the written consent of the RTM
Representatives, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed.

         Section 8.05   STRADDLE PERIODS. For purposes of this Agreement, in
the case of any Taxes of RTMRG or any of its Subsidiaries that are payable with
respect to any tax period that begins before and ends after the Closing Date (a
"STRADDLE PERIOD"), the portion of any such Taxes that constitutes Pre-Closing
Taxes shall: (i) in the case of Taxes that are either (x) based upon or related
to income or receipts, or (y) imposed in connection with any sale, transfer or
assignment or any deemed sale, transfer or assignment of property (real or
personal, tangible or intangible), be deemed equal to the amount that would be
payable if the tax year or period ended on the Closing Date; and (ii) in the
case of Taxes (other than those described in clause (i) above) that are imposed
on a periodic basis with respect to the business or assets of RTMRG or any of
its Subsidiaries or otherwise measured by the level of any item, be deemed to be
the amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period (or, in the case of such
Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the
immediately preceding Tax period) multiplied by a fraction the numerator of
which is the number of calendar days in the portion of the Straddle Period
ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of
calendar days in the entire Straddle Period. For purposes of clause (i) of the
preceding sentence, any exemption, deduction, credit or other item (including,
without limitation, the effect of any graduated rates of tax) that is calculated
on an annual basis shall be allocated to the portion of the Straddle Period
ending on the Closing Date on a pro rata basis determined by multiplying the
total amount of such item allocated to the Straddle Period times a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the portion of the Straddle
Period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of
calendar days in the entire Straddle Period. In the case of any Tax based upon
or measured by capital (including net worth or long-term debt) or intangibles,
any amount thereof required to be allocated under this Section 8.05 shall be
computed by reference to the level of such items on the Closing Date. The
parties hereto will, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, elect with the
relevant Governmental Entity to treat a portion of any Straddle Period as a
short taxable period ending as of the close of business on the Closing Date.

         Section 8.06   REFUNDS.

         (a)    The RTMRG Shareholders shall be entitled to all credits and

promptly following its receipt.

         (b)    Except as provided in Section 8.06(a), Triarc and its
Subsidiaries shall be entitled to all credits and refunds (including interest

and its Subsidiaries shall not be obligated to make any payment pursuant to any

right to carryback any Tax losses, credits or similar items attributable to such
Person from a taxable period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing
Date to a Pre-Closing Taxable Period.

Requirement is satisfied, Triarc and the RTMRG Shareholders shall file, and
shall cause their respective Affiliates to file, all Federal income Tax Returns
in a manner consistent with the Purchase Price Allocation, and shall take no
position contrary thereto for any Federal income Tax purposes, unless otherwise
required to do so by a good faith resolution of a contest or a change in
applicable law. The RTMRG Shareholders shall file, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates to file, all Federal income Tax Returns in a manner
consistent with the Expected Tax Treatment, and shall take no position contrary
thereto for any Federal income Tax purposes, unless otherwise required to do so
by a good faith resolution of a contest or a change in applicable law.

         (a)    On or prior to the Closing, RTMRG shall, and shall cause each of
its Subsidiaries to, make a capital contribution with respect to the capital

intercompany note, receivable or other obligation owned by RTMRG or any of its
Subsidiaries with respect to which such ELA Subsidiary is the obligor, each as

with respect to each ELA Subsidiary shall be less than the amount of outstanding

Order has become final and nonappealable;

         (c)    by Triarc, if RTMRG breaches any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach

effect, with no Liability on the part of any party to this Agreement (or any
stockholder, member, director, officer, employee, agent or representative of
such party), except that if such termination results from the willful (a)
failure of any party to perform its obligations or (b) breach by any party of
its representations or warranties contained in this Agreement, then such party

limitations:

         (a)    The amount of indemnifiable Losses of an RTMRG Indemnified
Party under Sections 11.02(a) or 11.02(c) shall be measured based on the actual
Losses, if any, suffered by such RTMRG Indemnified Party upon the sale, transfer
or other disposition to an unaffiliated third party of shares included in the
Aggregate Share Consideration or issued upon conversion of such shares and not
based on asserted and unrealized diminutions in value thereof.

         (b)    Triarc shall not be obligated to pay any amounts in respect of
indemnification obligations under Section 11.02(a), except those based upon or
arising from Section 3.01 (first sentence only), Section 3.02, Section 3.03

the aggregate amounts for indemnification in respect of indemnification
obligations under such Sections, except those based upon or arising from the

Stock on January 3, 2006 because the Trigger Event has not occurred or before
January 3, 2006 because an Adverse Board Determination shall have been made, $6
million, or (y) if the Triarc B-2 Election shall have been made and the shares
of Triarc Class B-2 Common Stock are converted into shares of Triarc Class B-1

of the Trigger Event, $15 million (the "TRIARC BASKET AMOUNT"), after which
Triarc shall be obligated to pay in full all such amounts for such
indemnification in excess of the Triarc Basket Amount. Triarc shall not be
obligated to pay any amounts for indemnification under Section 11.02(a), except
those based upon or arising from the Triarc Basket Exclusions, or Section
11.02(c), for any particular Loss unless the amount of such Loss (together with
the amount of all other Losses involving the same or related conduct, facts,
circumstances or events) exceeds $75,000; for the avoidance of doubt, any
amounts for indemnification that Triarc is not obligated to pay pursuant to this
sentence shall not be included in computing whether the Triarc Basket Amount
shall have been exceeded.

         (c)    Triarc shall be obligated to pay any amounts for indemnification
based on the Triarc Basket Exclusions without regard to the individual or
aggregate amounts thereof and without regard to whether all other
indemnification payments shall have exceeded, in the aggregate, the Triarc
Basket Amount.

         (d)    The maximum amount of indemnification payments under Section
11.02(a) and (if applicable) Section 11.02(c) to which the RTMRG Indemnified

$60 million. Triarc shall not be liable for indemnification under this Agreement
in an amount in excess of $60 million.

         (e)    For purposes of determining whether a representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement has been breached or is inaccurate, limitations or
qualifications as to dollar amount, materiality, Triarc Material Adverse Effect
or ARG Material Adverse Effect (or similar concept) set forth in such
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement shall not be disregarded, but if
a breach or inaccuracy is so determined, then the amount of any Loss arising
from such breach or inaccuracy of such representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement shall be determined without regard to any limitation or qualification
as to dollar amount, materiality, Triarc Material Adverse Effect or ARG Material
Adverse Effect (or similar concept) set forth in such representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement.

         (f)    Indemnification of an RTMRG Indemnified Party by Triarc shall
be limited to the amount of any Loss that remains after deducting therefrom (and
the cumulative amount of all Losses for purposes of determining the Triarc
Basket Amount shall be reduced by the amount of) any insurance proceeds or any
indemnity, contribution or other similar payment actually recovered (net of
out-of-pocket costs incurred in connection with such recovery) by an RTMRG
Indemnified Party from any insurer or third party with respect thereto;
PROVIDED, that no RTMRG Indemnified Party shall be obligated to seek any such
recovery.

         (g)    To the extent that an RTMRG Indemnified Party has recovered all
or any portion of its Losses with respect to any matter arising under one
provision of this Agreement, such RTMRG Indemnified Party shall not be entitled
to recover such portion of such Losses pursuant to other provisions of this
Agreement. Without limiting the


                                      -98-
<PAGE>

generality of the foregoing, to the extent any Losses were taken into account
and had the effect of increasing the ARG Estimated Net Liabilities or ARG
Closing Net Liabilities determined pursuant to Section 2.08 and Section 2.09,
respectively, the amount by which such Losses resulted in an increase of the ARG
Estimated Net Liabilities or ARG Closing Net Liabilities, as the case may be,
shall reduce on a dollar-for-dollar basis the amount of such Loss for which the
RTMRG Indemnified Parties are entitled to indemnification under Section 11.02.

         (h)    In no event shall any RTMRG Indemnified Party be entitled to
be indemnified for or make a claim against Triarc for (i) lost profits or other
consequential, incidental, special or punitive damages resulting hereunder
(other than such damages payable to a Governmental Entity or other Person in
respect of a third party claim as to which such damages were assessed), (ii) any
Losses based upon or arising from any Legal Action threatened or commenced
against Triarc or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective directors ,

Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements, (iii) any Taxes payable by such
RTMRG Shareholder in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements or (iv) if (x) the Triarc B-1
Election shall have been made or (y) the Triarc B-2 Election shall have been
made and the shares of Triarc Class B-2 Common Stock are converted into shares

has not occurred or prior to January 3, 2006 because an Adverse Board
Determination shall have been made, any Liability described in Section 11.02(c).

claims paid by such RTMRG Principal Shareholder under the RTMAC Purchase
Agreement or the RTMMC Purchase Agreement.

         (d)    In seeking indemnification hereunder, the Triarc Indemnified
Parties shall first exercise their remedies with respect to the RTM Escrow Fund
pursuant to the Escrow Agreement and, if the RTM Escrow Fund has been exhausted
in full, with respect to the RTM Principal Shareholders (individually or
jointly) directly pursuant to the Transaction Support Agreement.

         (e)    For purposes of determining whether a representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement has been breached or is inaccurate, limitations or
qualifications as to dollar amount, materiality or RTMRG Material Adverse Effect
(or similar concept) set forth in such representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement shall not be disregarded but if a breach or inaccuracy is so
determined, the amount of any Loss arising from such breach or inaccuracy of
such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement shall be determined without
regard to any limitation or qualification as to dollar amount, materiality or
RTMRG Material Adverse Effect (or similar concept) set forth in such
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement.

         (f)    Indemnification of a Triarc Indemnified Party by the RTMRG
Shareholders shall be limited to the amount of any Loss that remains after
deducting therefrom (and the cumulative amount of all Losses for purposes of
determining the RTM Basket Amount shall be reduced by the amount of) any
insurance proceeds or any indemnity, contribution or other similar payment
actually recovered (net of out-of-pocket costs incurred in connection with such
recovery) by a Triarc Indemnified Party from any insurer or third party with
respect thereto; PROVIDED, that no Triarc Indemnified Party shall be obligated
to seek any such recovery.

         (g)    To the extent that a Triarc Indemnified Party has recovered all
or any portion of its Losses with respect to any matter arising under one
provision of this Agreement, such Triarc Indemnified Party shall not be entitled
to recover such portion of such Losses pursuant to other provisions of this
Agreement, the RTMAC Purchase Agreement or the RTMMC Purchase Agreement. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, to the extent any Losses were taken
into account and had the effect of increasing the RTM Estimated Net Liabilities
or RTM Closing Net Liabilities determined pursuant to Section 2.08 and Section
2.09, respectively, the amount by which such Losses resulted in an increase of
the RTM Estimated Net Liabilities or RTM Closing Net Liabilities, as the case
may be, shall reduce on a dollar-for-dollar basis the amount of such Loss for
which the Triarc Indemnified Parties are entitled to indemnification under
Section 11.04.

         (h)    In no event shall any Triarc Indemnified Party be entitled to
be indemnified for or make a claim against the RTMRG Shareholders for lost
profits or other consequential, incidental, special or punitive damages
resulting hereunder (other than such damages payable to a Governmental Entity or
other Person in respect of a third party claim as to which such damages were
assessed).

         Section 11.06  PROCEDURE FOR INDEMNIFICATION. The party making a claim
under this Article XI is referred to as the "INDEMNIFIED PARTY," and the party
against whom such claims are asserted under this Article XI is referred to as
the "INDEMNIFYING PARTY." If the Indemnifying Party is an RTMRG Shareholder, the
RTM Representatives shall exercise, in accordance with Section 12.17, all rights
of such RTMRG Shareholder as an Indemnifying Party in this Section 11.06, and
for procedural purposes only, all references to the Indemnifying Party in this
Section 11.06 shall be deemed to refer to the RTM Representatives. All claims by
any Indemnified Party under this Article XI shall be asserted and resolved as
follows:

         (a)    NOTICE OF ASSERTED LIABILITY. Promptly after receipt by the
Indemnified Party of notice of the commencement of any action or proceeding, the
assertion of any claim by a third party, the imposition of any penalty or
assessment or a claim not involving a third party for which the Indemnified
Party seeks to be indemnified that may result in a Loss (each, an "ASSERTED
LIABILITY"), the Indemnified Party shall give written notice of such Asserted
Liability (the "CLAIMS NOTICE") to the Indemnifying Party. The failure to give
such prompt written notice shall not, however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of
its indemnification obligations, except and only to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party forfeits rights or defenses by reason of such failure or
actually incurs an incremental out-of-pocket expense by reason of such failure.
The Claims Notice shall describe the Asserted Liability in reasonable detail,
including (i) the representation, warranty, covenant or agreement that is
alleged to have been inaccurate or to have been breached, (ii) the basis for
such allegation, including the provision of supporting documentation and (iii)
if known, the aggregate amount of the Losses for which a claim is being made
under this Article XI or, to the extent that such Losses are not known or have
not been incurred at the time such claim is made, an estimate, to be prepared in
good faith and accompanied by supporting documentation, of the aggregate
potential amount of such Losses.

         (b)    NON-THIRD PARTY CLAIMS. If the Claims Notice from the
Indemnified Party pertains to an Asserted Liability other than a claim or demand
from a third party, then the Indemnifying Party shall have 30 days following
receipt of the Claims Notice to make such investigation at the expense of the
Indemnifying Party of the Asserted Liability as the Indemnifying Party deems
necessary or desirable. For the purposes of such investigation, the Indemnified
Party agrees to make available to the Indemnifying Party the information relied
upon by the Indemnified Party to substantiate the Asserted Liability and such
other information in its possession that the Indemnifying Party may reasonably
request for purposes of such investigation. If the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party agree at or prior to the expiration of said 30 day period (or
any mutually agreed upon extension thereof) on the validity and amount of such
Asserted Liability, the Indemnifying Party shall promptly pay to the Indemnified
Party the full amount of the claim by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account designated by the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnified
Party and the Indemnifying Party do not agree at or prior to the expiration of
said 30 day period (as such period may be extended by mutual agreement) on the
validity and amount of such Asserted Liability, then each of the Indemnified
Party and the Indemnifying Party may pursue the remedies available under this
Agreement.

<PAGE>

         (c)    OPPORTUNITY TO DEFEND THIRD PARTY CLAIMS.

                (i)     If the Claims Notice pertains to an Asserted Liability
that relates to a claim or demand from a third party, the Indemnifying Party may
elect to compromise or defend, at its own expense and by its own counsel, such
Asserted Liability; PROVIDED, that if the Indemnifying Party is an RTMRG
Shareholder, such Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to defend or
direct the defense of any such Asserted Liability that is asserted directly or
indirectly by or on behalf of a Person that is a current or prospective supplier
or franchisee of Triarc or any of its Subsidiaries if in the reasonable judgment
of the Indemnified Party (which may be asserted at any time) the Indemnifying
Party's defense of such Asserted Liability could reasonably be expected to have
a material adverse effect on the Indemnified Party's existing or prospective
relationship with such current or prospective supplier or franchisee.

                (ii)    If the Indemnifying Party elects to compromise or
defend such Asserted Liability, it shall promptly notify the Indemnified Party
and any other Indemnifying Parties in writing of its intent to do so, and the
Indemnified Party, at the expense of the applicable Indemnifying Party or
Indemnifying Parties, shall cooperate in the compromise of, or defense against,
such Asserted Liability.

                (iii)   If the Indemnifying Party elects not to compromise or
defend such Asserted Liability, fails to promptly notify the Indemnified Party
in writing of its election as provided in this Agreement, or otherwise abandons
the defense of such Asserted Liability, the Indemnified Party may pay,
compromise or defend such Asserted Liability and seek indemnification for any
and all Losses based upon, arising from or relating to such Asserted Liability.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Indemnifying Party nor the
Indemnified Party shall settle or compromise any Asserted Liability without the
prior written consent of the other (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed);

                (iv)    The Indemnified Party shall have the right to
participate in the defense of any Asserted Liability with counsel selected by it
and reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnifying Party subject to the
Indemnifying Party's right to control the defense. The fees and disbursements of
such counsel shall be at the expense of the Indemnified Party; PROVIDED, that if
in the reasonable opinion of counsel to the Indemnified Party, (I) there are
legal defenses available to an Indemnified Party that are different from or
additional to those available to the Indemnifying Party or (II) there exists a
conflict of interest between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party
that cannot be waived, the Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the reasonable
legal fees and expenses of one separate counsel to all of the applicable
Indemnified Parties in addition to one local counsel in each jurisdiction that
may be necessary or appropriate; PROVIDED, that the Indemnified Parties shall
use commercially reasonable efforts (to the extent the Indemnified Parties
reasonably believe it appropriate to do so) to minimize the need for local
counsel. If the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend any Asserted Liability, the
Indemnified Party shall make available to the Indemnifying Party any personnel,
books, records or other documents within its control that are necessary or
appropriate for such defense.

                (v)     The rights of the RTMRG Shareholders under this Section
11.06(c) with respect to any Asserted Liability for which all of the RTMRG
Shareholders or RTMRG Principal Shareholders, as the case may be, are
Indemnifying Parties may be exercised solely by the RTM Representatives and, if
the RTM Representatives elect to defend such Asserted Liability, the RTM
Representatives shall have sole and exclusive control over such defense as
between the RTMRG Shareholders.

                (vi)    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
the provisions of this Section 11.06(c) shall not apply to any Asserted
Liability for Taxes.

         Section 11.07  SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY. Except as otherwise provided
in Section 12.14, from and after the Closing, the remedies provided in Article
VIII and this Article XI and the Escrow Agreement shall be the sole recourse of
all parties hereto for all Losses based upon, arising from or relating to any
breach of any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement
or in any certificate delivered pursuant to Section 9.02(d) or Section 9.03(d);
PROVIDED, that the remedies provided in Article VIII shall be the sole remedy of
the Triarc Indemnified Parties for all Tax Losses. Nothing in this Section 11.07
shall limit any Person's right to seek and obtain any equitable relief to which
any Person shall be entitled or to seek any remedy on account of any Person's
fraud.

         Section 11.08  MISCELLANEOUS. It is the intention of the parties to
treat any indemnity payment made under this Agreement with respect to the Merger
as an adjustment to the Aggregate Merger Consideration for all federal, state,
local and foreign Tax purposes and the parties agree to file their Tax Returns
accordingly, except as otherwise required by a change in law or a good faith
resolution of a contest.

         Section 12.05  GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement and any claim or
controversy relating hereto shall be governed by and construed in accordance
with the law of the State of New York, without regard to the conflicts of law
rules of such state that would result in the application of the law of another
jurisdiction, except to the extent that provisions of the GBCC or the DLLCA are
mandatorily applicable.

         Section 12.06  JURISDICTION. Except as otherwise expressly provided in
this Agreement, the parties hereto agree that any suit, action or proceeding
seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in
connection with, this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby shall be brought in the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York or any New York State court sitting
in New York City, so long as one of such courts shall have subject matter
jurisdiction over such suit, action or proceeding, and that any cause of action
arising out of this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby shall be deemed to have arisen from a transaction
of business in the State of New York, and each of the parties hereby irrevocably
consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate
courts therefrom) in any such suit, action or proceeding and irrevocably waives,
to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection that it may now or
hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding
in any such court or that any such suit, action or proceeding which is brought
in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Process in any such
suit, action or proceeding may be served on any party anywhere in the world,
whether within or without the jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting
the foregoing, each party agrees that service of process on such party as
provided in Section 12.04 shall be deemed effective service of process on such
party.

         Section 12.07  WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ANCILLARY AGREEMENTS OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY.

         Section 12.08  EXHIBITS AND DISCLOSURE LETTERS. Any matter, information
or item disclosed in the Triarc Disclosure Letter or the RTMRG Disclosure under
any specific representation or warranty or schedule number hereof, shall be
deemed to have been disclosed for all purposes of this Agreement in response to
every representation or warranty in this Agreement in respect of which such
disclosure is reasonably apparent on its face. The inclusion of any matter,
information or item in the Triarc Disclosure Letter or the RTMRG Disclosure
shall not be deemed to constitute an admission of any Liability by Triarc or
RTMRG or any other Person to any third party or otherwise imply, that any such
matter, information or item is material or creates a measure for materiality for
the purposes of this Agreement. Nothing in the RTMRG Disclosure Letter or the
Triarc Disclosure Letter is intended or shall be deemed to broaden the scope of
any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement.

Agreement.

         Section 12.10  SEVERABILITY. The provisions of this Agreement shall
be deemed severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision
shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions of this
Agreement. If any provision of this Agreement, or the application of that
provision to any Person or any circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a
suitable and equitable provision shall be substituted for that provision in
order to carry out, so far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and
purpose of the invalid or unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this
Agreement and the application of that provision to other Persons or
circumstances shall not be affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor

of that provision, or the application of that provision, in any other
jurisdiction.

         Section 12.11  RULES OF CONSTRUCTION. The parties to this Agreement
have been represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this

         Section 12.13  REMEDIES. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, any and all remedies expressly conferred upon a party to this
Agreement shall be cumulative with, and not exclusive of, any other remedy

this Agreement of any one remedy shall not preclude the exercise by it of any
other remedy.

         Section 12.15  COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed and
delivered (including by facsimile transmission) in any number of counterparts,

         Section 12.17  RTM REPRESENTATIVES.

         (a)    Effective as of the date hereof each RTMRG Principal
Shareholder, by such RTMRG Principal Shareholder's execution and delivery of the
Transaction Support Agreement, hereby irrevocably constitutes and appoints, and
effective as of the Effective Time, each other RTMRG Shareholder, by such RTMRG
Shareholder's acceptance of the Per Share Merger Consideration, will be
conclusively deemed to have irrevocably constituted and appointed, Russell V.
Umphenour, Jr., Dennis E. Cooper and J. Russell Welch, acting by a majority, to
act as his, her or its representatives under this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements (the "RTM REPRESENTATIVES"), with full power of substitution, to
exercise the powers and to perform:

                (i)     the duties required or permitted to be performed by the
RTM Representatives on behalf of the RTMRG Shareholders under and pursuant to
this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements;

                (ii)    such other duties as are delegated to the RTM
Representatives under this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, to be
performed by the RTM Representatives on behalf of the RTMRG Shareholders in
their capacities as RTMRG Shareholders; and

                (iii)   such actions as are reasonably incident to any of the
duties referred to in the preceding clauses (i) and (ii) above, including the
taking of any action and the execution and delivery of any agreement or
instrument by or on behalf of each RTMRG Shareholder which the RTM
Representatives deem necessary or reasonably required to accomplish the purposes
of the foregoing. The appointment set forth in this Section 12.17 shall be
coupled with an interest.

         (b)    Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the RTM
Representatives, acting by a majority, shall have the right and power to do or
cause to be done any of the following things on behalf of each of the RTMRG
Shareholders and all of them collectively:

                (i)     act as the sole representatives of the RTMRG
Shareholders and exercise all rights of the RTMRG Shareholders under this
Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements, including the prosecution, defense and
settlement of all claims


                                     -132-
<PAGE>

and actions under, and to resolve all matters relating to, indemnification
hereunder or under any related agreement;

                (ii)    (A) authorize delivery to any Triarc Indemnified Party
of all or a portion of the RTM Escrow Fund in accordance with the Escrow
Agreement, (B) receive any payments made to the RTMRG Shareholders or to the RTM
Representatives on such RTMRG Shareholders behalf pursuant to this Agreement or
the Ancillary Agreements, (C) invest such funds pending their disbursement in
such manner as the RTM Representatives in their sole discretion, acting by a
majority, deem appropriate, and (D) disburse to the RTMRG Shareholders payments
made to the RTM Representatives under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or
the Ancillary Agreements; and

                (iii)   otherwise take all actions and do all things reasonably
required or advisable to accomplish any of the matters referred to in this
Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements, including the execution and delivery of
any documents and instruments, and generally to act for and in the name of the
RTMRG Shareholders as fully as each RTMRG Shareholder could if then personally
present and acting. The RTM Representatives, acting by a majority, are hereby
empowered to determine, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or the
Ancillary Agreements, the time or times when, the purposes for which, and the
manner in which, the power herein conferred upon the RTM Representatives shall
be exercised.

         (c)    The Triarc Parties and all other persons dealing with the RTM
Representatives may rely and act upon any writing believed in good faith to be
signed by a majority of the RTM Representatives or an authorized representative
of the RTM Representatives, and may assume that all actions of the RTM
Representatives, acting by a majority, and any authorized representative of the
RTM Representatives have been duly authorized by the RTMRG Shareholders. The
actions, decisions and instructions of the RTM Representatives taken, made or
given pursuant to the authority granted to the RTM Representatives pursuant to
this Section 12.17 shall be conclusive and binding upon each RTMRG Shareholder
and each RTMRG Shareholder's heirs, representatives, successors and assigns, as
applicable, and such Persons shall not have the right to object, dissent,
protest or otherwise contest the same.

         (d)    The RTM Representatives shall promptly deliver to each RTMRG
Shareholder copies of all statements, notices, letters of direction or other
material communications given or received by any of them in his capacity as one
of the RTM Representatives under this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement. The
RTM Representatives, acting by a majority, shall have the sole power and
authority, without prior notice to or consultation with any of the RTMRG
Shareholders, to take all actions required or permitted to be taken by the RTM
Representatives, the RTMRG Shareholders or any of them under this Agreement or
any Ancillary Agreement.

         (e)    The RTM Representatives may execute any of their duties under
this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement by or through agents and shall be
entitled to rely upon the advice of counsel concerning all matters pertaining to
the RTM


                                     -133-
<PAGE>

Representatives' duties, as the case may be, hereunder and thereunder. The RTM
Representatives shall be entitled to rely on any notice, consent, certificate,
affidavit, letter, telegram, statement or other document believed by the RTM
Representatives to be genuine and correct and to have been signed and sent by
the proper person or persons and, in respect to legal matters, upon the opinion
of counsel selected by the RTM Representatives. The RTM Representative may
invest the Expenses Fund and other funds advanced to them for their expenses in
such interest or non-interest bearing accounts or investments as they deem
appropriate. Any remaining amounts in the Expenses Fund after payment of all of
the RTM Representative's expenses for acting as such, or after making adequate
provision therefor, shall be distributed to RTMRG Shareholders pro rata based on
shares of RTMRG Common Stock owned immediately prior to the First Effective
Time.

         (f)    The RTM Representatives shall be entitled to reimbursement for
all out-of-pocket expenses, including reasonable attorneys' and accountants'
fees and expenses, incurred by the RTM Representatives in connection with the
administration or enforcement of, or the preservation of any rights of the RTMRG
Shareholders under, this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, first out of the
Expenses Fund to the extent thereof and then from the RTMRG Principal
Shareholders, who shall reimburse the RTM Representatives for expenses. Each of
the RTMRG Principal Shareholders shall be responsible for such out-of-pocket
expenses pro rata in proportion to the percentage of the total number of shares
of RTMRG Common Stock held by the RTMRG Principal Shareholders immediately prior
to the Merger.

         (g)    Actions by the RTM Representatives will be effective only if
taken by a majority of the RTM Representatives. In carrying out their duties and
responsibilities in their capacity as RTM Representatives under this Agreement
or the Ancillary Agreements, neither the RTM Representatives nor any of their
agents shall be liable to any RTMRG Shareholder for any action lawfully taken or
omitted to be taken by him, her, it or them in good faith under this Agreement,
the Merger Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements, except for the RTM
Representatives' or their agents' willful misconduct or fraud.

         (h)    The RTMRG Principal Shareholders, severally, hereby agree to
indemnify and hold harmless each of the RTM Representatives, his agents,
successors and assigns with respect to any act or omission of or by any of them
absent willful misconduct or fraud in connection with any and all matters
contemplated by this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements.

         (i)    If any of the RTM Representatives should die, become disabled
or otherwise become unable to fulfill his responsibilities as one of the RTM
Representatives or shall resign, then the RTMRG Shareholders, the RTMAC Sellers
and the RTMMC Members, by a majority vote based on their respective pro rata
interests in the Aggregate Merger Consideration, shall promptly appoint a
successor representative and shall promptly notify Triarc of such successor. The
authorizations of the RTM Representatives will be effective until their rights
and obligations under this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements terminate by
virtue of the termination of any and all


                                     -134-
<PAGE>

obligations of the RTMRG Shareholders to the Triarc Parties under this Agreement
and the Ancillary Agreements.

         Section 12.18  NEUTRAL TREATMENT FOR PRE-APPROVED MATTER.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, with
respect to the transaction identified in Section 6.02 of the RTMRG Disclosure
Letter as the one being subject to Section 12.18, PROVIDED, that RTMRG shall
have afforded Triarc a reasonable opportunity to review the definitive
agreements related to such transaction prior to their execution and delivery and
such definitive agreements are reasonably satisfactory to Triarc: (a) any
current assets and current Liabilities related to the business, assets and
Liabilities acquired or assumed thereby, and any Indebtedness incurred in
connection therewith, shall be excluded from the calculation of RTM Estimated
Net Liabilities and RTM Closing Net Liabilities, (b) other than Section 6.02, no
representations, warranties or covenants whatsoever shall apply in respect of
such transaction or the business, assets and Liabilities acquired thereby, and
(c) the Triarc Indemnified Parties will not have any rights under Article VIII
or Article XI in respect of such transaction or the business, assets and
Liabilities acquired thereby, other than for any breach of any covenant or
agreement of RTMRG contained in Section 6.02 in respect thereof.
