shall have the respective meanings ascribed thereto in Annex A.

W I T N E S S E T H:

 

WHEREAS, the boards of directors of each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company

upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and
in accordance with the applicable provisions of Delaware Law, and in
furtherance thereof, have approved this Agreement and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Related Agreements (the
"Transactions").

 

WHEREAS, prior to the Closing, (i) each Key Employee listed on Schedule A-1
will accept an employment offer letter (or, if otherwise agreed to by Parent,
a consulting agreement) from Parent (collectively, the "Key Employee Offer
Letters"); (ii) at least twelve of the twenty-two Other Employees (the
"Additional Employees") listed on Schedule A-2 will accept an employment offer
letter (or, if otherwise agreed to by Parent, a consulting agreement) from

Person listed on Schedule A-3 (the "Non-Compete Signatories") will execute a
Non-Competition Agreement in the form set forth as Exhibit A (a "Non-

forth in Exhibit B-1 (a "Joinder") and (ii) an accredited investor

WHEREAS, concurrent with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, as a
material inducement to Parents willingness to enter into this Agreement,
each Company Note Holder has completed, executed and delivered to Parent the
Noteholder Consent.

WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements, as more fully set forth
herein, in connection with the Transactions.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements, covenants and other

(2) Business Days following satisfaction or waiver (if permissible hereunder)
of the conditions set forth in Section 1.2(b) (other than those conditions
that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to
satisfaction or waiver (if permissible hereunder) of those conditions), at the

extent that the facts and circumstances causing or resulting in any
such representations and warranties not to be true and correct have not had
and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the

against any claim that may be made against Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or the Exchange Agent with respect to the certificates alleged to have been
lost, stolen or destroyed.

 

(f) _Shares of Parent Common Stock_. The shares of Parent Common Stock
issued by Parent to the Company Holders pursuant to Section 1.6(b), and this

(g) _Exchange Agent to Return Merger Consideration_. At any time
following the last day of the twelfth (12th) month following the Effective
Time, Parent shall be entitled to require the Exchange Agent to deliver to
Parent or its designated successor or assign all cash amounts that have been
deposited with the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 1.7(b)(i), and any and
all interest thereon or other income or proceeds thereof, not disbursed to the
Stockholders pursuant to Section 1.7(d), and thereafter the Stockholders
shall be entitled to look only to Parent and/or the Surviving Corporation
(subject to the terms of Section 1.7(h)) only as general creditors
thereof with respect to any and all cash amounts and stock that may be
payable to such Stockholders pursuant to Section 1.7(d) upon the due surrender
of Company Stock Certificates, if any, and duly executed Exchange Documents
in the manner set forth in Section 1.7(d). No interest shall be payable for
the cash amounts and stock delivered to Parent pursuant to the provisions of
this Section 1.7(g) and which are subsequently delivered to the Stockholders.

(h) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Capital Stock_. Following the
consummation of the Merger, the cash amounts and stock paid in respect of the
surrender for exchange of shares of Company Capital Stock in accordance with
the terms hereof shall be deemed to be full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such shares of Company Capital Stock, and there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation
of shares of Company Capital Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to

(j) _Statement of Expenses_. Without limitation to any other provision of
this Agreement, in making any payment in respect of any Indebtedness or Third
Party Expenses at the Closing and in calculating the Total Cash Consideration,
Parent shall be entitled to rely on the Payment Spreadsheet, which sets forth
the Companys statement of (i) outstanding Indebtedness of the Company or any
Subsidiary as of the Closing Date, (ii) all paid and unpaid Third Party
Expenses incurred by or on behalf of, and anticipated to be incurred by or on
behalf of, the Company or any Subsidiary as of the Closing Date and (iii)
wire instructions relating to each such item of outstanding Indebtedness and
unpaid Third Party Expenses to be made at Closing (the "Statement of
Expenses").

 

 _1.8_ _Post-Closing Adjustments_.

 

(a) _Estimated Closing Statement_. At least five (5) Business Days prior
to the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Parent a statement prepared
on a consistent basis with the Sample Working Capital Statement and that is
reasonably acceptable to Parent (the "Estimated Closing Statement") setting
forth in reasonable detail the Companys good faith estimate of Closing
Working Capital and the Closing Working Capital Adjustment Amount, in each
case including all components thereof, Closing Cash, the Closing Cash
Adjustment Amount and Pre-Closing Taxes (other than Taxes that are solely
Liabilities of Restructuring Sub or any of the Remainderco Subsidiaries) (such
estimates, the "Estimated Closing Working Capital," "Estimated Closing
Working Capital Adjustment Amount," "Estimated Closing Cash," "Estimated
Closing Cash Adjustment Amount," and "Estimated Pre-Closing Taxes,"
respectively), accompanied by reasonably detailed back-up documentation for
such calculations. The Company shall prepare the Estimated Closing Statement
in accordance with GAAP as consistently applied by the Company for pre-Closing
periods and, to the extent consistent with GAAP, using the same accounting
principles, practices, procedures, policies and methods, with consistent
classifications, judgments, inclusions, exclusions and valuation and
estimation methodologies that were employed in the preparation of the Sample
Working Capital Statement. The Company shall make available to Parent and its
Representatives the work papers (subject to the execution of customary work
paper access letters, if requested) and other books and records used in
preparing the Estimated Closing Statement and reasonable access to employees
of the Company as Parent may reasonably request in connection with its review

 



-13- 

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 of such statements, and will otherwise cooperate in good faith with Parents
and its Representatives review of such statements and shall take into
consideration in good faith any comments of Parent on the Estimated Closing
Statement, as applicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will any
of Parents rights be considered waived, impaired or otherwise limited as a
result of Parent not making an objection prior to the Closing or its making
an objection that is not fully implemented in a revised Estimated Closing
Statement, as applicable.

 

(b) _Post-Closing Statement_. As promptly as practicable, but in no event
later than sixty (60) calendar days after the Closing Date, Parent may
prepare and deliver, or may cause to be prepared and delivered, to the
Stockholder Representative, a statement (the "Post-Closing Statement") setting
forth in reasonable detail Parents calculations of the Closing Working
Capital (including all components thereof), Closing Cash, the Post-Closing
Working Capital Adjustment Amount, the Post-Closing Cash Adjustment
Amount, Pre-Closing Taxes (other than Taxes that are solely Liabilities of
Restructuring Sub or any of the Remainderco Subsidiaries) and the Tax
Adjustment Amount, in each case accompanied by reasonably detailed back-up
documentation for such calculations. Parent shall prepare such Post-Closing
Statement in accordance with GAAP as consistently applied by the Company for
pre-Closing periods, and to the extent consistent with GAAP, using the same
accounting principles, practices, procedures, policies and methods, with
consistent classifications, judgments, inclusions, exclusions and valuation
and estimation methodologies that were employed in the preparation of the
Sample Working Capital Statement. Any component of the Estimated Closing
Statement that is not disputed in the Post-Closing Statement shall be final
and binding on the parties hereto and not subject to appeal. If Parent does
not prepare a Post-Closing Statement within sixty (60) calendar days after the
Closing Date, the Estimated Closing Statement shall be deemed to be the final
statement.

 

(c) _Review of Post-Closing Statement_. The Stockholder Representative
shall have thirty (30) days following its receipt of any Post-Closing
Statement (the "Review Period") to review the Post-Closing Statement. During
the Review Period, the Resolution Period and any additional period until all
items in the Dispute Statement are finally resolved as provided in Section
1.8(d), Parent and the Company shall make available to the Stockholder
Representative and its Representatives the work papers (subject to the
execution of customary work paper access letters, if requested) and other
books and records used in preparing the Post-Closing Statement and reasonable
access (on prior notice and during business hours) to employees of the Company
as the Stockholder Representative (or its Representatives) may reasonably
request in connection with its review of such statements. On or before the
expiration of the Review Period, the Stockholder Representative shall deliver
to Parent a written statement accepting or disputing each item set forth on
the Post-Closing Statement. In the event that the Stockholder Representative
disputes an item on the Post-Closing Statement, the Stockholder Representative
shall deliver to Parent a statement (a "Dispute Statement") that includes (i)
a reasonably detailed itemization of the Stockholder Representatives
objections and the reasons therefore, together, if applicable, with any
available supporting documentation, information and calculations and (ii)
the Stockholder Representatives alternative calculation of each disputed
item. Any component of the Post-Closing Statement that is not disputed in a
Dispute Statement shall be final and binding and not subject to appeal. If the
Stockholder Representative does not deliver a Dispute Statement to Parent
within the Review Period or delivers a statement accepting all items detailed
on the Post-Closing Statement, such Post-Closing Statement shall be final and
binding and not subject to appeal.

(d) _Dispute Resolution_. If the Stockholder Representative delivers a
Dispute Statement during the Review Period, Parent and the Stockholder
Representative shall promptly meet and attempt in good faith to resolve their
differences with respect to the disputed items set forth in the Dispute
Statement during the thirty (30) calendar days immediately following the
Parents receipt of the Dispute Statement, or such longer period as Parent and
the Stockholder Representative may mutually agree (the "Resolution Period").
Any such disputed items that are resolved by Parent and the Stockholder
Representative during the Resolution Period shall be final and binding on the
parties hereto and not subject to appeal. If Parent and the Stockholder
Representative do not resolve all such disputed items by the end of the
Resolution Period, Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall submit all
items remaining in dispute set forth in the Dispute Statement to BDO USA, LLP
(the "Accounting Firm") for review and resolution. The Accounting Firm shall
act as an expert and not an arbitrator. The Accounting Firm shall make all
calculations in accordance with GAAP as consistently applied by the

 



-14- 

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 Company for pre-Closing periods, and to the extent consistent with GAAP, the
practices used in preparation of the Sample Working Capital Statement,
shall determine only those items remaining in dispute between Parent and the
Stockholder Representative, and shall not be permitted or authorized to assign
a dollar amount to any item in dispute greater than the greatest value for
such item claimed by either party or less than the smallest value for such
item claimed by either party. Each of Parent and the Stockholder
Representative shall (i) enter into a customary engagement letter with the
Accounting Firm at the time such dispute is submitted to the Accounting Firm
and otherwise reasonably cooperate with the Accounting Firm, (ii) have the
opportunity to submit a written statement in support of their respective
positions with respect to such disputed items in the Dispute Statement, to
provide supporting material to the Accounting Firm in defense of their
respective positions with respect to such disputed items and to submit a
written statement responding to the other partys position with respect to
such disputed items and (iii) subject to customary confidentiality and
indemnity agreements, provide the Accounting Firm with access to their
respective books, records, personnel and representatives and such other
information as the Accounting Firm may require in order to render its
determination. The Accounting Firm shall be instructed to deliver to Parent
and the Stockholder Representative a written determination (such determination
to include a worksheet setting forth all material calculations used in
arriving at such determination and to be based solely on information provided
to the Accounting Firm by Parent and the Stockholder Representative) of the
disputed items within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt of the disputed
items, which determination shall be final and binding and not subject to
appeal, absent manifest error or fraud. The fees and expenses of the
Accounting Firm shall be borne by the Parent, on the one hand, and the
Stockholder Representative (solely on behalf of the Company Holders, first
out of the Representative Expense Fund, and only after the Representative
Expense Fund is exhausted, then from the Tail Fund), on the other hand, based
on a percentage equal to (x) the portion of the total amounts disputed not
awarded to each such party _divided by_ (y) the total amounts disputed. For
example, if the Stockholder Representative challenges the calculation of the
Closing Working Capital by an amount of $100,000, but the Accounting Firm
determines that the Stockholder Representative has a valid claim for only
$60,000, the Stockholder Representative will bear (solely on behalf of the
Company Holders, first out of the Representative Expense Fund, and only
after the Representative Expense Fund is exhausted, then from the Tail Fund)
forty percent (40%) of the fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm and Parent
will bear the remaining sixty percent (60%) of such fees and expenses.

 

(e) _Post-Closing Payments_.

 

(i) If the Final Adjustment Amount, as finally determined pursuant to this
Section 1.8, is negative (the absolute value of such amount, the "Post-
Closing Deficit"), then the Company Holders shall owe Parent the full amount
of the Post-Closing Deficit. Payment of any Post-Closing Deficit shall come:
(x) first from the Tail Fund, to the extent there are funds remaining in the
Tail Fund, and the Stockholder Representative shall promptly (no later than
the Tail Fund Release Date and in any event within two (2) Business Days
following the final determination of the Final Adjustment Amount) take all
actions to cause an amount in cash equal to the amount of the Post-Closing
Deficit from the Tail Fund to be paid to Parent, including the execution by
the Stockholder Representative of joint written instructions to the Escrow
Agent and (y) second, to the extent the Post-Closing Deficit exceeds the funds
then held in the Tail Fund, then (in addition to the payment to Parent from
the Tail Fund pursuant to subclause (x) hereof (which shall equal the total
amount of funds then held in the Tail Fund)) the Stockholder Representative
shall also take all actions to cause an amount in cash equal to the amount of
Post-Closing Deficit not paid pursuant to subclause (x) hereof to be paid to
Parent from the Escrow Fund, and shall include such necessary instructions to
facilitate the same in the joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent. For
the avoidance of doubt, any recovery of any such Post-Closing Deficit shall
not be subject to any of the limitations on indemnification set forth in
Article VII.

(ii) If the Final Adjustment Amount, as finally determined pursuant to
this Section 1.8, is positive (the absolute value of such amount, the "Post-
Closing Increase"), then the Parent shall, no later than five (5) Business
Days after the final determination of the Final Adjustment Amount pursuant to
this Section 1.8, pay the Post-Closing Increase to the Exchange Agent for
further distribution to the Stockholders in accordance with the Charter
Allocation.

(iii) To the extent that there exist any Liabilities and/or
Losses relating to (A) severance and termination payments for employees of
the Company incurred as of or after the Effective Time until the Tail Fund
Release Date, not to exceed the amount(s) set forth on Schedule 1.8(e)(iii),
(B) severance and termination payments for employees of Dataxu Ltd., a United
Kingdom private limited company ("Dataxu UK"), incurred as of or after the
Effective Time until the six month anniversary of the Effective Time, not to
exceed the amount(s) set forth on Schedule 1.8(e)(iii) or (C) bonuses,
commissions and other similar payments payable to any employee for services
rendered in the Companys 2019 fiscal year, whether or not earned, vested or
accrued as of immediately prior to the Effective Time but that become earned,
vested or accrued by the Company or any Subsidiary as of or after the
Effective Time, in each case that are not deemed Indebtedness or Third Party
Expenses (together, the "Tail Costs"), the Indemnifying Parties shall
indemnify, and hold harmless the Indemnified Parties, from and against such
the Tail Costs pursuant to Article VII.

 

(A) If an Indemnified Party wishes to make an claim for Tail Costs under
this Section 1.8(e), such Indemnified Party shall deliver a written notice to
the Stockholder Representative (with a copy to the Escrow Agent) (i) stating
that an Indemnified Party has paid, incurred, suffered or sustained, or
reasonably anticipates that it may pay, incur, suffer or sustain Losses and
(ii) specifying in reasonable detail the individual items of such Losses, the
date each such item was paid, incurred, suffered or sustained, or the basis
for such anticipated liability (a "Tail Notice"). The Indemnified Party may
update a Tail Notice from time to time to reflect any new information
discovered with respect to the claim set forth in such Tail Notice.

 

(B) If the Stockholder Representative shall not object in writing within
the 30-day period after receipt of a Tail Notice by delivery of a written
notice of objection containing a reasonably detailed description of the facts
and circumstances supporting an objection to the applicable indemnification
claim (an "Tail Objection Notice"), such failure to so object shall be an
irrevocable acknowledgment by the Stockholder Representative on behalf of the
Indemnifying Parties (or the applicable Indemnifying Party) that the
Indemnified Party is entitled to the full amount of the claim for Losses set
forth in such Tail Notice. In such event, the Escrow Agent shall promptly
release cash equal to the Losses set forth in such Tail Notice to Parent
first, from the Tail Fund and second, to the extent such Losses exceed the
funds then held in the Tail Fund, from the Escrow Fund.

 

(C) In the event that the Stockholder Representative shall deliver an Tail
Objection Notice within 30 days after delivery of such Tail Notice to the
Stockholder Representative, the Stockholder Representative and Parent shall
attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of the respective parties with
respect to each of such claims. If the Stockholder Representative and Parent
should so agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be prepared
and signed by both parties and furnished to the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent
shall be entitled to rely on any such memorandum and make distributions from
the Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms thereof. In such event, the
Escrow Agent shall promptly release an amount of cash equal to the Losses set
forth in such Tail Notice first, from the Tail Fund and second, to the
extent such Losses exceed the funds then held in the Tail Fund, from the
Escrow Fund.

(D) If no such agreement can be reached after good faith negotiation and
prior to thirty (30) days after delivery of a Tail Objection Notice, Parent
may file suit with respect to the matter in a court pursuant to Section 8.14.

 

(iv) For the avoidance of doubt, additional Tail Costs may be realized
after the date such joint delivery instruction is delivered, and the Company
Holders shall be held responsible for such additional expenses or costs, and
further, any recovery of any such Tail Costs shall be subject to the
limitations on indemnification set forth in Article VII;  _provided_ that for
the avoidance of doubt, Parent and the other Indemnifying Parties may not
recover for the same Tail Costs pursuant to Article VII to the extent such
Tail Costs are paid to Parent pursuant to this Section 1.8(e).

(v) On the ninety-fifth (95th) day after the Closing Date (the "Tail Fund
Release Date"), if any cash amounts are remaining in the Tail Fund, Parent and
the Stockholder Representative shall provide a joint

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 written instruction to the Escrow Agent to deliver such remaining amounts to
the Exchange Agent or the Surviving Corporation (as applicable) for further
distribution to the Company Holders in accordance with their Indemnity
Portions; _provided_ that if there are any Post-Closing Deficit or Tail Costs
subject to outstanding joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent, then
such amounts shall be promptly delivered to Parent instead; _provided_
further that if there are any Post-Closing Deficit or Tail Costs subject to
good faith dispute between Parent or the Stockholder Representative (each an
"Outstanding Disputed Amount"), such Outstanding Disputed Amounts will not be
delivered to the Exchange Agent or the Surviving Corporation (as applicable)
for distribution to the Company Holders or Parent at that time. Upon final
resolution of the Outstanding Disputed Amounts, Parent and the Stockholder
Representative shall provide a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent
to release (1) the portion of the Outstanding Disputed Amounts that are
determined to belong to the Company Holders to the Exchange Agent or the
Surviving Corporation (as applicable) for further distribution to the Company
Holders in accordance with their Indemnity Portions and (2) the portion of the
Outstanding Disputed Amounts that are determined to belong to Parent to
Parent. Delivery of a Post-Closing Statement pursuant to Section 1.8(b) shall
constitute a good faith dispute hereunder, and the amounts in dispute with
respect to such Post-Closing Statement shall constitute an Outstanding
Disputed Amount until finally resolved pursuant to the procedures set forth
in Section 1.8(c) and (d). Cash amounts from the Tail Fund shall be
distributed in the same proportion as the Tail Amount was deposited in the
Tail Fund with respect to each Company Holder.

subsection or sub-clause of this Agreement, where it is reasonably apparent on
the face of such disclosure that such information applies to such other

and Merger Sub as follows:

 

 _2.1_ _Organization and Good Standin_ _g_. The Company is a corporation
duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
State of Delaware. The Company has the corporate power to own, lease and
operate its assets and properties and to carry on its business as currently

qualified or licensed to do business and in good standing as a foreign
corporation in each jurisdiction in which the character or location of its
assets or properties (whether owned, leased or licensed) or the nature of its
business make such qualification or license necessary to the Companys
business as currently conducted, except for those jurisdictions in which the
failure to be so qualified or in good standing has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company
has Made Available true, correct and complete copies of its certificate of
incorporation, as amended to date (the "Certificate of Incorporation"), and
bylaws, as amended to date, each in full force and effect on the date hereof
(collectively, the "Charter Documents"). Since the date of the Charter
Documents Made Available, the Company Board has not approved or proposed any
amendment to any of the Charter Documents. Section 2.1 of the Disclosure
Schedule lists the directors and board appointed officers of the Company.

 

 _2.2_ _Authority and Enforceability_.

subject to receipt of the Requisite Stockholder Approval, to consummate the
Transactions. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and any Related
Agreements to which the Company is a party and the consummation of
the Transactions have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action
on the part of the Company (including the unanimous approval of the Company
Board) and no further corporate or other action is required on the part of the
Company to authorize this Agreement and any Related Agreements to which the
Company is a party or to consummate the Transactions, other than the adoption
of this Agreement and approval of the Merger by the Stockholders of the
Company who hold (a) a majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares

Stockholders required under applicable Legal Requirements, Delaware Law, the
Charter Documents and all Contracts to which the Company or any Subsidiary is
a party to legally adopt this Agreement and approve the Transactions.

(b) The Company Board has validly determined that this Agreement, the
Related Agreements and the Transactions are advisable, fair to, and in the
best interests of, the Company and its Stockholders, approved this Agreement,
the Related Agreements and the Transactions, and recommended to the
Stockholders to vote in favor of adoption of this Agreement and approval of
the Transactions. The Company Board has taken all necessary actions so that
the restrictions on business combinations set forth in Section 203 of Delaware
Law are not applicable to this Agreement and the Transactions. No other
"control share acquisition," "fair price," "moratorium" or other antitakeover
Legal Requirement (such Legal Requirement, including Section 203 of Delaware
Law, "Takeover Law") applies to this Agreement or the Transactions.

(c) This Agreement and each of the Related Agreements to which the Company
is a party have been duly executed and delivered by the Company and assuming
the due authorization, execution and delivery by the other parties hereto and

creditors rights in general, and (y) rules of law governing specific
performance, injunctive relief, other equitable remedies and other general
principles of equity (clauses (x) and (y) collectively, the "Enforceability
Limitations"). As of the date hereof, neither the Company nor any of the
Subsidiaries has terminated, amended or waived any rights under (or failed to
enforce by seeking an injunction or by seeking to specifically enforce the
terms of) any "standstill" or other similar agreement between the Company or
any of the Subsidiaries and any other Person. 

_2.3_ _Governmental Approvals and Consents_. No consent, notice, waiver,
approval, Order or authorization of, or registration, declaration or filing
with any Governmental Entity, is required by, or with respect to, the Company
or any Subsidiary in connection with the execution and delivery of

that are sufficient to fully and irrevocably deliver the Requisite Stockholder
Approval. Promptly upon obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval, the

the Company determines (in a manner satisfactory to Parent) may separately or
in the aggregate, constitute "parachute payments" (within the meaning of
Section 280G of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder), such
that such payments and benefits shall not be deemed to be "parachute payments"
under Section 280G of the Code. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall
deliver to Parent evidence satisfactory to Parent that such Stockholder vote
was solicited in conformance with Section 280G and the regulations promulgated
thereunder and that (i) the requisite Stockholder approval was obtained with
respect to any payments and/or benefits that were subject to the Stockholder
vote (the "280G Approval"), or (ii) that the 280G Approval was not obtained
and as a consequence, that such "parachute payments" shall not be made or
retained.

the imposition of any limitation on the ability of Parent, its subsidiaries or
Affiliates or the Company or the Subsidiaries to conduct their respective

Parent, the businesses of the Company and the Subsidiaries, or (iii) the
imposition of any impediment on Parent, its subsidiaries or Affiliates or the
Company or the Subsidiaries under any Legal Requirement governing competition,
monopolies or restrictive trade practices (any such action described in (i),
(ii) or (iii), an "Action of Divestiture"). Nothing set forth in this
Agreement shall require Parent to litigate with any Governmental Entity.

 

(d) Parent shall, in consultation with the Company and subject to Section
5.3(a), determine strategy, lead all proceedings and coordinate all
activities with respect to seeking any actions, consents, approvals or waivers
of any Governmental Entity as contemplated hereby, and the Company and the
Subsidiaries will take such actions as reasonably requested by Parent in
connection with obtaining such consents, approvals or waivers, provided that
any action by the Company or its Affiliates of the nature described in Section
5.3(c)(i)-(iii) shall be conditioned upon closing of the Transactions.

Stockholders or any other Person for any costs, claims, liabilities or damages
resulting from the Company seeking to obtain such consents, modifications,
waivers and approvals.

 

(b) _Terminated and Amended Agreements_. The Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to terminate each of the agreements listed on
Schedule 5.7(b)(1) (the "Terminated Agreements") effective as of and
contingent upon the Closing, including sending all required notices, such that
each Terminated Agreement shall be of no further force or effect immediately
following the Closing. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
amend each of the agreements listed on Schedule 5.7(b)(2) (the
"Amended Agreements") to provide for the applicable changes as set forth on
such Schedule for each such agreement, in all cases effective as of and
contingent upon the Closing. The form and substance of each termination letter
and/or amendment agreement shall be subject to prior review and approval by
Parent. Upon the Closing, the Company shall have paid all amounts owed under
the Terminated Agreements (as a result of the termination of the Terminated
Agreements or otherwise), and the Company will not incur any claim, liability
or obligation (absolute, accrued, asserted or unasserted, contingent or
otherwise) under any Terminated Agreement following the Closing Date. The
Company shall be responsible for making any payments required to terminate
the

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 Terminated Agreements or amend the Amended Agreements and shall reflect such
payment or other consideration incurred by the Company as of the Closing Date
or anticipated to be incurred or payable after the Closing in the Statement
of Expenses. In the event the Merger does not close for any reason, neither
Parent nor Merger Sub shall have any liability to the Company, the
Stockholders or any other Person for any costs, claims, liabilities
or damages resulting from the Company seeking to obtain such terminations or
amendments.

(c) _Insurance_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall purchase
(and pay in full all premiums on) runoff insurance on terms reasonably
acceptable to Parent covering (a) employment practices liability insurance
with coverage for six (6) years following the Effective Time; (b) fiduciary
liability insurance with coverage for six (6) years following the Effective
Time; (c) errors and omissions insurance with coverage for three (3) years
following the Effective Time and (d) cyber liability insurance with coverage
for three (3) years following the Effective Time and, in each case, any
premiums with respect to such policy shall be Third Party Expenses hereunder.
After the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall maintain
such policy in full force and effect, and continue to honor the obligations
thereunder; _provided, however_ , that Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall have no obligation to pay premiums or any other amounts with respect to
such policy.

_5.8_ _Taxes_.

 

(a) _Transfer Taxes_. Parent, on the one hand, and the Stockholders, on
the other hand, shall each be responsible for one-half of all transfer,
stamp, documentary, registration, sales, use, value-added and other similar
Taxes (including, without limitation, applicable real estate transfer Taxes
and charges for or in connection with the recording of any instrument or
document as provided in this Agreement) payable in connection with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, the consummation of the Closing and
the Merger ("Transfer Taxes"). Parent and the Stockholders shall cooperate in
filing any necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to
Transfer Taxes and, if required by an applicable Legal Requirement,
Stockholders, the Company or Parent, as the case may be, shall join in the
execution of such Tax Returns and documentation.

(b) _Cooperation_. Parent, the Company and the Stockholder Representative
(to the extent the Stockholder Representative has access to such information
using commercially reasonable efforts) agree to furnish or cause to be
furnished to each other, upon request, as promptly as practicable, such
information and assistance relating to Taxes, including, without limitation,
access to books and records, as is reasonably necessary for the filing of all
Tax Returns by Parent or the Company, the making of any election relating to
Taxes, the preparation for any audit by any taxing authority and the
prosecution or defense of any claim, suit or proceeding relating to any Tax.

 

(c) _Tax Contests_. Parent, the Company and its Subsidiaries, on the one
hand, and the Indemnifying Parties, the Stockholder Representative and their
Affiliates, on the other hand, shall promptly notify each other upon receipt
by such party of written notice of any Action with respect to Taxes relating
to a Pre-Closing Tax Period (any such inquiry, claim, assessment, audit or
similar event, a "Tax Contest"). Any failure to so notify the other party of
any Tax Contest shall not relieve such other party of any liability with
respect to such Tax Contest except to the extent such party was actually
prejudiced as a result thereof. Parent shall have sole control of the conduct
of all Tax Contests, including any settlement or compromise
thereof, provided, however, that Parent shall keep the Stockholder
Representative reasonably apprised of any Tax Contest that may cause the
Company Holders to become obligated to make any payment pursuant to Article
VII and shall consult with the Stockholder Representative with respect to the
resolution of any such Tax Contest. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, the provisions of this Section 5.8(c) shall control with
respect to any Actions related to Taxes.

(d) _Tax Returns_.

 

(i) The Company shall prepare and timely file, or shall cause to be
prepared and timely filed, all Tax Returns in respect of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries that are required to be filed (taking into account

 



-58- 

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 any extension) on or before the Closing Date, and shall pay, or cause to be
paid, all Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries due on or before the
Closing Date. Such Tax Returns shall be prepared by treating items on such
Tax Returns in a manner consistent with the past practices of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, as applicable, with respect to such items, except as
required by applicable Legal Requirements. At least fifteen (15) days
prior to filing any such Tax Return, in the case of income Tax Returns, and in
such period of time prior to filing as the Company shall reasonably determine
to be practicable in the case of other Tax Returns, the Company shall submit
a copy of such Tax Return to Parent for Parents review and approval, which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 

(ii) Parent shall prepare and timely file or cause to be prepared and
timely filed (taking into account all extensions properly obtained), at the
Indemnifying Parties expense, all Tax Returns of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, other than a Subsidiary that constitutes the Restructuring Sub
or any of the Remainderco Subsidiaries, relating to any Pre-Closing Tax Period
first due after the Closing Date (such Tax Returns, "Parent Prepared
Returns"). At least fifteen (15) days prior to the due date (taking into
account any extension) for any Parent Prepared Return that is an income Tax
Return and in such period of time prior to filing as Parent shall reasonably
determine to be practicable in the case of any other material Tax Return, in
each case that shows a material amount of Pre-Closing Taxes, Parent shall
provide the Stockholder Representative with a draft copy of such Parent
Prepared Return for review and comment; _provided,_ that no delay or failure
on the part of Parent in delivering any such Parent Prepared Return shall
cause any Indemnified Party to forfeit any indemnification rights under
Article VII except to the extent that the Indemnifying Parties are materially
prejudiced by such delay or failure. Parent shall, in good faith, consider
any reasonable changes to any such Parent Prepared Return timely made in
writing by the Stockholder Representative.

 

(e) _Refunds_. The Stockholders shall be entitled to any refunds
(including any interest paid thereon) of Taxes of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries attributable to taxable periods (or portions thereof) ending on
or before the Closing Date to the extent such Taxes were paid by the Company
or its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing or by an Indemnifying Party after
the Closing which refund is actually recognized by Parent or its Subsidiaries
(including the Company and its Subsidiaries) after the Closing, net of any
cost to Parent and its Affiliates attributable to the obtaining and receipt
of such refund, except to the extent such refund arises as the result of a
carryback of a loss or other tax benefit from a Tax period (or portion
thereof) beginning after the Closing Date or such refund was included as an
asset in the calculation of the Closing Working Capital, as finally
determined. Parent shall promptly forward to or reimburse the Stockholders for
any such refunds (including any interest paid thereon) due to the Stockholders
after receipt thereof (or credit of such refund against Taxes which are other
than Pre-Closing Taxes). To the extent such refund is subsequently disallowed
or required to be returned to the applicable Governmental Entity, the
Stockholders agree promptly to repay the amount of such refund, together with
any interest, penalties or other additional amounts imposed by such
Governmental Entity, to Parent.

 

(f) _Post-Closing Actions_. Parent shall not (and shall not cause or
permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to) file, amend, re-file or
otherwise modify any Tax Return or Tax election, initiate any voluntary
disclosure, or agree to the waiver or any extension of the statute of
limitations, in each case, for the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with
respect to any taxable period (or portion thereof) ending on or before the
Closing Date, without providing at least fifteen (15) days prior written
notice to the Stockholder Representative and considering in good faith the
Stockholder Representatives reasonable comments received within seven (7)
days thereafter.

 

(g) _Tax Sharing Agreements_. All Tax sharing agreements or similar
agreements with respect to or involving the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (other than any such agreements entered into in the ordinary
course of business the primary purpose of which is unrelated to Taxes) shall
be terminated prior to the Closing Date, and, after the Closing Date, neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be bound thereby or have any
liability thereunder.

_5.9_ _Employee Matters_.

(a) _Proprietary Information and Inventions Assignment Agreements_. Prior
to the Closing, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
each current employee of the Company and the Subsidiaries to execute (if not
already executed), and each person who becomes an employee of the Company or
any subsidiary after the date hereof and prior to Closing shall be required
by the Company to execute, an Employee Proprietary Information Agreement on a
form that has been provided to Parent with the Company prior to the Effective
Date, or, as applicable, the Subsidiary, which provides coverage from such
employees first date of employment and which the Company reasonably believes
to be enforceable. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause each current consultant or contractor of the Company and the
Subsidiaries to execute (if not already executed), and each Person who becomes
a consultant or contractor of the Company or any Subsidiary after the date
hereof and prior to the Closing shall be required by the Company to execute,
a Consultant Proprietary Information Agreement (or a consultant agreement
containing confidentiality, non-disclosure, and invention assignment
provisions) with the Company or, as applicable, the Subsidiary, which
provides coverage from such consultant or contractors first date of service
and that the Company reasonably believes to be enforceable.

 

(b) _Termination of Employee Plans_. Unless instructed otherwise by
Parent, effective as of no later than the day immediately preceding the
Closing Date, the Company shall terminate any and all Company Employee Plans
intended to include any arrangement pursuant to Section 401(k) of the Code
(each, a "401(k) Plan") (unless Parent provides written notice to the Company
that such 401(k) plans shall not be terminated, as applicable). The Company
shall provide Parent with evidence that any such 401(k) Plan have been
terminated pursuant to resolutions of the board of directors (or similar
body) of the Company or its ERISA Affiliates, if applicable. The form and
substance of such resolutions shall be subject to the review and approval of
Parent. Any liquidation charges or surrender charges incurred by the Company
prior to the Closing Date shall be Third Party Expenses.

(c) _Termination of Company Employment Arrangements_. Prior to the
Closing and subject to applicable law, the Company shall terminate, and/or
shall cause each Subsidiary to terminate, the employment or consulting
services of each individual who Parent timely advises the Company in writing
that it expects to not be a Continuing Employee, effective, subject to
applicable law, as of no later than immediately prior to the Closing, and the
Company shall, and/or shall cause each Subsidiary to, as applicable, pay, any
severance pay or benefits (including to any acceleration of vesting) owed to
such employees prior to the Closing (subject to applicable law) and use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a valid and enforceable general
release of claims in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent from each
individual whom Parent timely advises the Company in writing that it expects
not to be a Continuing Employee; provided, however, that in no event shall the
Company or any Subsidiary be required to pay or provide to any such
employee any severance pay or benefit beyond that to which such employee may
have otherwise received pursuant to DataXu Severance Pay Policy dated January
1, 2015. The costs of any severance pay or benefits (including acceleration of
vesting) due to any individual whom Parent expects to not be a Continuing
Employee are to be borne solely by the Company.

(d) _No Employment Commitment or Plan Amendments_. No provision of this
Agreement is intended, or shall be interpreted, to provide nor create any
third party beneficiary rights or any other rights of any kind or nature
whatsoever in any stockholder, Key Employee, other Employee, consultant,
contractor or any other Person, including any rights of employment for any
specified period and/or any employee benefits, in favor of any Person, union,
association, continuing employee, Key Employee, other Employee, consultant or
contractor or any other Person, other than the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns, and all provisions hereof will be
personal solely among the parties to this Agreement. In addition,
no provision of this Agreement is intended, or shall be interpreted, to amend
any term or condition of the Plans or any other employee related plan, program
or policy of Parent, any subsidiary or Parent, the Company or any Subsidiary.

 _5.10_ _Directors  and Officers Indemnification_. 

(a) For a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation or its successor shall (and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation or its successor to) fulfill and honor in all respects
the obligations of the Company with respect to all rights to indemnification
(including advancement of expenses) or exculpation existing in favor of, and
all limitations on the personal liability of, any Person who is now, or has
been at any time prior to the date hereof, or who becomes prior to the
Effective Time, a director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent of the
Company or any of the Subsidiaries under the Charter Documents or in any
indemnification agreements in effect as of the date hereof and set forth in
Section 5.10(a) of the Disclosure Schedule to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable Legal Requirements (each, a "DandO Indemnified Party" and
collectively, the "DandO Indemnified Parties"). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the obligations of the Surviving Corporation or its successor (i) shall be
subject to any limitation imposed by Legal Requirements and (ii) shall not be
deemed to release any DandO Indemnified Party who is also an officer or director
of the Company from his or her obligations pursuant to this Agreement or any
Related Agreement, nor shall such DandO Indemnified Party have any right of
contribution, indemnification or right of advancement from the Surviving
Corporation or its successor with respect with any Loss claimed by any of
the Indemnified Parties against such DandO Indemnified Party in his or her
capacity as a Stockholder pursuant to this Agreement or any Related Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall have no obligation to maintain the
existence of the Surviving Corporation for any specified period following the
Effective Time. The Company hereby represents to Parent that no claim for
indemnification has been made as of the date hereof by any director or officer
of the Company.

 

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall purchase (and pay in
full all premiums on) an extended reporting period endorsement under the
Companys existing directors and officers liability insurance coverage (the
"DandO Tail Policy") for the Companys directors and officers on terms
reasonably acceptable to Parent that shall provide such directors and
officers with coverage for six (6) years following the Effective Time of not
less than the existing coverage and have other terms not materially less
favorable to the insured Persons than the directors and officers liability
insurance coverage presently maintained by the Company, and any premiums with
respect to such policy shall be Third Party Expenses hereunder. After the
Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall maintain such
policy in full force and effect and shall continue to honor the obligations
thereunder; _provided, however_ , that Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall have no obligation to pay premiums or any other amounts with respect to
such policy.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
obligations under this Section 5.10 shall not be terminated or modified in
such a manner as to adversely affect any DandO Indemnified Party to whom this
Section 5.10 applies without the consent of such affected DandO Indemnified
Party (it being expressly agreed that the DandO Indemnified Parties to whom this
Section 5.10 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section 5.10
and shall be entitled to enforce the covenants contained herein).

(d) In the event that, following the Effective Time, Parent or
the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger,
(ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person or (iii) commences a dissolution, liquidation, assignment
for the benefit of creditors or similar action, then, and in each such case,
to the extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that either the
successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may
be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.10.

 

 _5.11_ _Resale Registration Statement_.

 

(a) Each of Parent and the Company shall cooperate with respect to the
preparation and filing with the SEC of a registration statement of Parent
registering the resale by the Stockholders and the Company Note Holders of
Parent Common Stock issued hereunder following Closing, and in any event
following Parents filing 

 



-61- 

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 of the Required Company Financials with the SEC (the "Resale Registration
Statement"). If Parent is eligible to file a Resale Registration Statement on
Form S-3 pursuant to Rule 462(e) under the Securities Act (an "Automatic
Resale Registration Statement") registering the resale by the Stockholders and
the Company Note Holders of Parent Common Stock issued hereunder, Parent
shall prepare such Automatic Resale Registration Statement and the Form 8-K/A
attaching the Required Company Financials (the "Form 8-K/A"), with the
cooperation of the Company, and, subject to Parents timely receipt of the
Reporting Information and the Companys performance and compliance with its
covenants set forth in this Section 5.11, Parent shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to have such Form 8-K/A and Automatic Resale Registration
Statement ready for filing with the SEC promptly following the Closing,
provided that Parent shall only be obligated to file the Resale Registration
Statement (x) during an "open trading window" as determined by Parents
insider trading policies (an "Open Window Exception") and (y) a reasonable
period of time after Parents receipt of the Reporting Information. Each of
Parent and the Company will cause the Resale Registration Statement to comply
as to form in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the
Securities Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. The Company shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to: (a) upon Parents request, assist
Parent and its Representatives in the preparation of any audited historical
and pro forma financial statements of the Company that may be required in
connection with Parents SEC reporting obligations related to this Agreement
or any of the Transactions ("Required Company Financials") or the filing of
the Resale Registration Statement, (b) promptly furnish such information as
Parent may reasonably request in connection with such financial statements,
the Resale Registration Statement, or the performance of Parents SEC
reporting obligations relating to this Agreement or any of the Transactions;
and (c) complete, execute, acknowledge and deliver, or use their commercially
reasonable efforts to cause to be completed, executed, acknowledged and
delivered by the appropriate representatives of the Company, Stockholders or
Company Note Holders, in each case, such questionnaires and other documents,
certificates and instruments as may be reasonably requested by the Parent in
connection with the filing of the Resale Registration Statement or the
financial statements or the performance of Parents SEC reporting obligations
relating to this Agreement or any of the Transactions (the Required Company
Financials, together with the information in (b) and (c), the "Reporting
Information"). Subject to Parents timely receipt of the Reporting Information
and the Companys performance and compliance with its covenants set forth in
this Section 5.11, Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
file the Form 8-K/A with the SEC as soon as reasonably practicable following
its preparation.

 

(b) If the Resale Registration Statement is not an Automatic Resale
Registration Statement, each of Parent and the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to have the Resale Registration Statement declared
effective under the Securities Act as soon as practicable after such Resale
Registration Statement is filed. Parent will advise the Company,
promptly after Parent receives notice thereof, of any request by the SEC for
amendment of the Resale Registration Statement or any SEC comments thereon.
Once declared effective, Parent shall, subject to the other applicable
provisions of this Agreement, use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the Resale Registration Statement to be continuously effective and usable
until the date that is the two-year anniversary of the Closing Date, or such
earlier time as all shares of Parent Common Stock covered by such Resale
Registration Statement (i) have been sold pursuant to such Registration
Statement or otherwise, (ii) may be transferred under Rule 144 or another
similar exemption under the Securities Act without manner of sale or volume
restrictions, or (iii) cease to be outstanding; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Parent shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations hereunder if
Parent shall fail to fulfill its obligations under this Section 5.11 at a
time when trading of Parent Common Stock has been suspended under Parents
insider trading policies, including if Parent reasonably believes that there
is or may be in existence material nonpublic information or events involving
the Company, the failure of which to be disclosed in the prospectus included
in the Resale Registration Statement could result in a violation of applicable
law.

 

(c) Subject to __ this Section 5.11 and the Companys performance
and compliance with its covenants set forth in this Section 5.11, Parent
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the shares of Parent Common
Stock being issued in the Merger to be approved for listing (subject
to notice of issuance) on NASDAQ promptly following Parents filing of the
Form 8-K/A.

 _5.12_ _Restructuring_. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall, and
shall cause its applicable Subsidiaries to, perform each of the restructuring
actions set forth set forth on Schedule C (such actions, collectively, the
"Restructuring"). Any Contracts necessary to perform the Restructuring shall
be subject to the prior review and written approval of Parent (such approval
not to be unreasonably withheld, condition or delayed) if such Contracts are
to be entered into prior to the Closing. The Company shall
periodically update Parent regarding the status of the Restructuring and
shall, and shall cause its applicable Subsidiaries to, cooperate with Parent
as may be reasonably requested for the purpose of completing the
Restructuring. Any changes to Schedule C proposed by Company or Parent after
the date hereof and prior to the Closing shall be respectively subject to the
prior written consent of Parent or the Company (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), as applicable, with such
changes that are approved in writing by Parent or the Company, as applicable,
to be incorporated into a revised, amended and restated Schedule C.

 

 _5.13_ _Suitability Documentation_. The Company shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to cause each Stockholder and Company
Note Holder to deliver all documentation, in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to Parent, necessary to determine whether or not such Stockholder
or Company Note Holder is an Accredited Holder, including the AIQs, prior to
the Companys delivery of the Payment Spreadsheet. Notwithstanding the
delivery of any AIQs to Parent, any Stockholder or Company Note Holder may, in
the reasonable discretion of Parent, be deemed an "Accredited Holder" for
purposes of this Agreement.

 

 _5.14_ _No Outstanding Securities_. There shall be no outstanding
securities, warrants, options, commitments or agreements of the Company as of
the Effective Time that purport to obligate the Company to issue any shares of
Company Capital Stock, Company Options, Company RSUs, Company Warrants or
any other securities under any circumstances.

indemnification claims in respect thereof under this Agreement, shall survive

Closing Date (the date of expiration of such period, the "Expiration Date");
_provided_ , _however_ , (a) the Specified Representations shall survive
until the ten (10) year anniversary of the Closing Date, and (b) the
representations and warranties of the Company set forth in Section 2.10 ( _Tax
Matters_ ) (the "Tax Representations"), and the right to make indemnification
claims in respect thereof under this Agreement, shall survive until thirty
(30) days after the expiration of all applicable statutes of limitations in

(including all periods of extension, whether automatic or permissive); and
_provided_ , _further_ , that all representations and warranties of the
Company, and the right to make indemnification claims in respect thereof

accordance therewith;

Company) shall not have any right of contribution, indemnification or right of
advancement from the Surviving Corporation, Parent or any of their respective
Affiliates with respect to any Loss claimed by and/or paid to an Indemnified
Party pursuant to the indemnification provisions hereof, except in each case
to the extent such Loss is covered by the DandO Tail Policy.

 

(c) Any payments made to an Indemnified Party pursuant to any
indemnification obligations under this Article VII will be treated as
adjustments to the Merger Consideration for Tax purposes and such agreed
treatment will govern for purposes of this Agreement, unless otherwise
required by applicable Legal Requirements.

 

(d) The indemnification rights set forth in this Article VII shall be the
sole and exclusive remedy of the Indemnified Parties from and after the
Effective Time for any claims arising under this Agreement, including claims
of any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation, warranty or covenant in
this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) this Section 7.2(d) shall
not be deemed a waiver by any party of any right to specific performance or
injunctive relief and (ii) nothing in this Agreement shall limit the liability
of an Indemnifying Party (and this Article VII shall not be the sole and
exclusive remedy in respect of such Indemnifying Party) in connection with a
claim based on fraud, Intentional Breach or Intentional Misrepresentation
committed by such Indemnifying Party.

 

(e) Nothing in this Agreement shall limit the right of any party to a
Related Agreement to pursue remedies under such Related Agreement against the
other parties thereto. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, no breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or

contemplated hereby.

 

 _7.3_ _Limitations on Indemnification_.

 

(a) _Threshold_. Except in the case of fraud, Intentional

and until the Indemnified Parties, as a group, shall have paid, incurred,
suffered or sustained at least $500,000 in Losses in the aggregate
(the "Threshold Amount"), in which case the Indemnified Parties shall be
entitled to recover only such Losses in excess of the Threshold Amount. For
the avoidance of doubt, the limitations set forth in this Section 7.3(a)
shall not apply to indemnification claims under clauses (iii)(xiv) of Section
7.2(a), inclusive.

(b) _Maximum Liability_.

 

(i) Except in the case of fraud, Intentional Breach or Intentional
Misrepresentation, and indemnification claims for breaches of or inaccuracies
in the Specified Representations or the Tax Representations or indemnification
claims under Section 7.2(a)(ii) that are predicated on assumed breaches of or
inaccuracies in the Specified Representations and the Tax Representations,
the Indemnified Parties sole and exclusive source of recovery for
indemnification claims under clauses (i), (ii) and (viii)(xi) of Section
7.2(a), inclusive, shall be recourse against the Escrow Fund. For the
avoidance of doubt, the limitations set forth in this Section 7.3(b)(i) shall
not apply to any indemnification claim under clauses (iii)(vii) and
(xii)(xiv) of Section 7.2(a), inclusive. Following the Expiration Date, the
Indemnified Parties may not recover against the Escrow Fund for claims
against Section 7.2(a)(viii)(x).

(ii) The Indemnified Parties first source of recovery for indemnification
claims under Section 7.2(a) shall be recourse against the Escrow Fund. If the
Escrow Fund is insufficient to satisfy any portion of a Loss for which an
indemnification claim has been made under Section 7.2(a)(i) or Section
7.2(a)(ii) for breaches of or inaccuracies in the Specified Representations or
Tax Representations, or for which an indemnification claim has been made
under clauses (iii)(vii) and (xii)(xiv) of Section 7.2(a), inclusive, the
Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to recover such excess portion of such
Losses in respect of such indemnification claims (the portion of any such
excess Loss for which such indemnification is not satisfied by the Escrow Fund
is referred to as an "Excess Loss") directly from the Indemnifying Parties and
each Indemnifying Party shall, subject to the limitations set forth in this
Article VII, be liable, severally (in accordance with each such Indemnifying
Partys Indemnity Portion) and not jointly, solely for its, his or her
Indemnity Portion of the Excess Losses in respect of such indemnification
claim, in each case subject to the limitations set forth in this Article VII.

 

(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the liability of
each Indemnifying Party for indemnification claims under this Section 7.2(a)
shall be limited, in the aggregate, to a dollar amount equal to the aggregate
portion of the Merger Consideration actually received by such Indemnifying
Party pursuant to this Agreement (without regard to any withholding, vesting
or other similar limitation applicable to such payments); provided, however
that the limitation in this Section 7.2(b)(iii) shall not apply to
indemnification claims made under Section 7.2(a)(xiv) in connection with a
claim based on fraud, Intentional Breach or Intentional Misrepresentation (i)
committed by such Indemnifying Party or (ii) of the Company or another
Indemnifying Party committed prior to Closing as to which such Indemnifying
Party has actual knowledge (without any duty to investigate) that the specific
fraud, Intentional Breach or Intentional Misrepresentation at issue has
occurred or is occurring prior to Closing (and not merely knowledge of the
underlying facts that are alleged to be a fraud, Intentional Breach or
Intentional Misrepresentation) and does not inform Parent of such information
to which such Indemnifying Party has such knowledge as promptly as
reasonably practicable; and, provided further, that, for the avoidance of
doubt, the Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to recover against all
proceeds available in the Escrow Fund on a joint and several basis for claims
under Section 7.2(a)(xiv), regardless of the amount of such Indemnifying
Partys contribution thereto.

 

(c) The rights of the Indemnified Parties to indemnification, compensation
or reimbursement, payment of Losses or any other remedy under this Agreement
shall not be affected by any investigation conducted with respect to, or any
knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) at any time, whether before
or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing Date,
with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with, any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by the Company or any
other matter. The waiver of any condition based on the accuracy of any such
representation or warranty, or on the performance of or compliance with any
such covenant or agreement, will not affect the right to indemnification,
compensation or reimbursement, payment of Losses, or any other remedy based on
any such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement. No Indemnified
Party shall be required to show reliance on any representation, warranty,
certificate or other agreement in order for such Indemnified Party to be
entitled to indemnification, compensation or reimbursement hereunder.

(d) Nothing in this Agreement (including Section 7.3(b)(iii) or Section
7.3(g)) shall limit the liability of an Indemnifying Party (i) in connection
with a claim based on fraud, Intentional Breach or Intentional
Misrepresentation committed by such Indemnifying Party or (ii) in connection
with a claim based on fraud, Intentional Breach or Intentional
Misrepresentation of the Company or another Indemnifying Party committed prior
to Closing as to which such Indemnifying Party has actual knowledge (without
any duty to investigate) that the specific fraud, Intentional Breach or
Intentional Misrepresentation at issue has occurred or is occurring prior to
Closing (and not merely knowledge of the underlying facts that are alleged to
be a fraud, Intentional Breach or Intentional Misrepresentation) and does not
inform Parent of such information to which such Indemnifying Party has such
knowledge as promptly as reasonably practicable.

 

(e) For the purpose of this Article VII, the amount of any Losses shall be
reduced by (i) any insurance proceeds actually received by an Indemnified
Party with respect to such Losses and (ii) any amounts actually recovered by
an Indemnified Party from another Person in respect of such Losses.

 

(f) Each Indemnified Party shall make commercially reasonable efforts to
mitigate any claim or liability that such Indemnified Party asserts under
this Article VII as required by applicable Legal Requirements.

(g) Under no circumstances shall any Indemnified Party be entitled to be
indemnified for special, multiple of earnings or other business or financial
metric or punitive damages, except with respect to a claim for such damages by
a third party, in which case only to the extent of the amount of such damages
payable to such third party as determined by a final, non-appealable award of
a court of competent jurisdiction. No party hereto shall be obligated to
indemnify any other Person with respect to (i) any representation, warranty,
covenant, agreement or condition specifically waived in writing by the other
party at the Closing or (ii) any Losses included in the calculation of the
Estimated Adjustment Amount of the Final Adjustment Amount (to the extent so
included).

(h) The Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to recover the same
Losses more than once in respect of any one liability of the Indemnifying
Parties.

  _7.4_ _Indemnification Claim Procedures_.

(a) Subject to the limitations set forth in Section 7.1, if an Indemnified
Party wishes to make an indemnification claim under this Article VII, such
Indemnified Party shall, prior to 11:59 p.m. California time of the last day
of the survival period applicable to such indemnification claim, deliver a
written notice (an "Indemnification Claim Notice") to the Stockholder
Representative (with a copy to the Escrow Agent) (or in the event an
Indemnified Party elects to pursue such indemnification claim directly
against a Stockholder, to such Stockholder directly) (i) stating that an
Indemnified Party has paid, incurred, suffered or sustained, or reasonably
anticipates that it may pay, incur, suffer or sustain Losses, (ii) specifying
in reasonable detail the individual items of such Losses, the date each such
item was paid, incurred, suffered or sustained, or the basis for
such anticipated liability, and the nature of the misrepresentation, breach
of warranty or covenant to which such item is related and (iii) specifying
whether the Indemnification Claim Notice applies to the Escrow Fund. Parent
may update an Indemnification Claim Notice from time to time to reflect any
new information discovered with respect to the claim set forth in such
Indemnification Claim Notice.

 

(b) If the Stockholder Representative (or in the event that indemnification
is permitted to be sought hereunder directly from a Stockholder, such
Stockholder) shall not object in writing within the 30-day period after
receipt of an Indemnification Claim Notice by delivery of a written notice of
objection containing a reasonably detailed description of the facts and
circumstances supporting an objection to the applicable indemnification claim
(an "Indemnification Claim Objection Notice"), such failure to so object shall
be an irrevocable acknowledgment by the Stockholder Representative on behalf
of the Indemnifying Parties (or the applicable Indemnifying Party) that the
Indemnified Party is entitled to the full amount of the claim for Losses set
forth in such Indemnification Claim Notice. In such event, the Escrow Agent
shall promptly release from the Escrow Fund cash equal to the Losses set forth
in such Indemnification Claim Notice to Parent.

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

(c) In the event that the Stockholder Representative (or in the event that
indemnification is permitted to be sought hereunder directly from a
Stockholder, such Stockholder) shall deliver an Indemnification Claim
Objection Notice in accordance with Section 7.4(b) within 30 days after
delivery of such Indemnification Claim Notice to the Stockholder
Representative, the Stockholder Representative (or such objecting Stockholder)
and Parent shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of the
respective parties with respect to each of such claims. If the Stockholder
Representative (or such objecting Stockholder) and Parent should so agree, a
memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be prepared and signed by both
parties and, in the case of an indemnification claim to be recovered from the
Escrow Fund, shall be furnished to the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall be
entitled to rely on any such memorandum and make distributions from the Escrow
Fund in accordance with the terms thereof. In such event, the Escrow Agent
shall promptly release from the Escrow Fund an amount of cash equal to the
Losses set forth in such Indemnification Claim Notice. Should the amount held
in the Escrow Fund, if any, be insufficient to satisfy in whole the amount
owed to an Indemnified Party in accordance with such memorandum and this
Agreement, then each Stockholder shall, within ten (10) Business Days
following the date of such memorandum, pay to the Indemnified Party such
Stockholders Indemnity Portion of such shortfall in cash.

(d) If no such agreement can be reached after good faith negotiation and
prior to thirty (30) days after delivery of an Indemnification Claim
Objection Notice, Parent may file suit with respect to the matter in a court
pursuant to Section 8.14.

 

(e) On the Expiration Date, if cash amounts remaining in the Escrow Fund
exceed the Extended Escrow Amount (the amount of such excess, "Expiration
Escrow Surplus"), Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall provide a
joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent to deliver such Expiration
Escrow Surplus to the Exchange Agent or the Surviving Corporation (as
applicable) for further distribution to the Company Holders in accordance with
their Indemnity Portions, less the portion of the Expiration Escrow Surplus
remaining in the Escrow Fund equal to the amounts set forth in a
validly delivered Indemnification Claim Notice (which, with respect to any
third party Action, shall be no less than the amount claimed by the third
party claimant in the third party Action) for any then unresolved claims
specified in any such Indemnification Claim Notice ("Unresolved Claims")
delivered in good faith to the Escrow Agent and Stockholder Representative
prior to the Expiration Date, with respect to facts and circumstances existing
prior to the Expiration Date, and any such amounts for Unresolved Claims
shall not be distributed to the Company Holders at such time. Instead, upon
final resolution of such Unresolved Claims, Parent and the Stockholder
Representative shall provide a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent
to release (1) the portion of the Unresolved Claim amount that is determined
in accordance with this Article VII to belong to the Company Holders to the
Exchange Agent or the Surviving Corporation (as applicable) for further
distribution to the Company Holders in accordance with their Indemnity
Portions and (2) the portion of the Unresolved Claim amount that is determined
in accordance with this Article VII to belong to Parent to Parent.

(f) On the two (2) year anniversary of the Expiration Date (the "Extended
Date"), if any cash amounts are remaining in the Escrow Fund, Parent and the
Stockholder Representative shall provide a joint written instruction to the
Escrow Agent to deliver such remaining amounts to the Exchange Agent or the
Surviving Corporation (as applicable) for further distribution to the Company
Holders in accordance with their Indemnity Portions, less the portion of the
Escrow Amount remaining in the Escrow Fund equal to the amounts set forth in a
validly delivered Indemnification Claim Notice (which, with respect to any
third party Action, shall be no less than the amount claimed by the third
party claimant in the third party Action) for any Unresolved Claims specified
in any such Indemnification Claim Notice delivered in good faith to the
Escrow Agent and Stockholder Representative prior to the Extended Date, with
respect to facts and circumstances existing prior to the Extended Date, and
any such amounts shall not be distributed to the Company Holders at such
time. Instead, upon final resolution of such Unresolved Claims, Parent and
the Stockholder Representative shall provide a joint written instruction to
the Escrow Agent to release (1) the portion of the Unresolved Claim amount
that is determined in accordance with this Article VII to belong to the
Company Holders to the Exchange Agent or the Surviving Corporation (as
applicable) for further distribution to the Company Holders in accordance with
their

 Indemnity Portions and (2) the portion of the Unresolved Claim amount that
is determined in accordance with this Article VII to belong to Parent to
Parent.

 

(g) Cash amounts from the Escrow Fund shall be distributed in the same
proportion as the Escrow Amount was deposited in the Escrow Fund with respect
to each Indemnifying Party.

 

 _7.5_ _Third Party Claims_. In the event Parent receives notice of a
third party claim (a "Third Party Claim") which Parent reasonably believes may
result in a claim for indemnification pursuant to this Article VII, Parent
shall, within thirty (30) days following Parents receipt of written notice
of the Third Party Claim, notify the Stockholders Representative of such
claim with an Indemnification Claim Notice (a "Third Party Notice"), and shall
provide a copy of such Third Party Notice to the Escrow Agent, if the
Extended Date has not been reached and funds remain in the Escrow Fund, and
the Third Party Notice shall be accompanied by copies of any documentation
submitted by the third party making such Third Party Claim, if any;
provided, that no delay or failure on the part of Parent in delivering a
Third Party Notice shall cause any Indemnified Party to forfeit any
indemnification rights under this Article VII except to the extent that the
Indemnifying Parties are materially prejudiced by such delay or failure. Upon
receipt of a Third Party Notice, the Stockholders Representative shall be
entitled (on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties and at their expense), or, in
the event indemnification is being sought hereunder from fewer than all the
Indemnifying Parties, the applicable Indemnifying Parties shall be entitled,
at their expense, to participate in, but not to control, determine or conduct,
the defense of such Third Party Claim. Parent shall have the right in its
sole discretion to conduct the defense of, and to settle, any such claim and
the Stockholders Representative (or, in the event indemnification is being
sought hereunder from fewer than all the Indemnifying Parties,
such applicable Indemnifying Parties) shall not be entitled to control any
negotiation of settlement, adjustment or compromise with respect to any such
Third Party Claim; provided, however, that except with the consent of the
Stockholders Representative (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), no settlement of any such Third Party Claim with
third party claimants shall (i) be determinative of the amount of Losses
relating to such matter or (ii) preclude the right of the Indemnifying
Parties to dispute the Indemnified Partys entitled to indemnification
hereunder; provided further, however, that the consent of the Stockholders
Representative with respect to any settlement of any such Third Party Claim
shall be deemed to have been given unless the Stockholders Representative
shall have objected within thirty (30) days after a written request for such
consent by Parent. In the event that the Stockholders Representative has
consented to any such settlement, adjustment or compromise, the Indemnifying
Parties or the consenting Indemnifying Parties, as applicable, shall have no
power or authority to object under any provision of this Article VII to the
amount of such settlement, adjustment or compromise.

 

 _7.6_ _Stockholder Representative_.

 

(a) By virtue of the execution and delivery of a Joinder, and the adoption
of this Agreement and approval of the Merger by the Stockholders or
participating in the Merger and receiving the benefits thereof, including the
right to receive the consideration payable in connection with the Merger, each
of the Indemnifying Parties shall be deemed to have agreed to
appoint Shareholder Representative Services LLC as its representative, agent
and attorney-in-fact, as the Stockholder Representative for and on behalf of
the Indemnifying Parties to, after the Closing, give and receive notices and
communications in respect of indemnification claims under this Agreement to be
recovered against the Escrow Fund or the Tail Fund, to authorize payment to
any Indemnified Party from the Escrow Fund and/or the Tail Fund in
satisfaction of any indemnification claims hereunder by any Indemnified Party,
to object to such payments, to agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and
compromises of, and demand arbitration and comply with orders of courts and
awards of arbitrators with respect to any such indemnification claims, to
assert, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and demand
arbitration and comply with orders of courts and awards of arbitrators
with respect to, any such indemnification claim by any Indemnified Party
hereunder against any Indemnifying Party or by any such Indemnifying Party
against any Indemnified Party or any dispute between any Indemnified Party and
any such Indemnifying Party, in each case relating to this Agreement or the
Transactions, and to take all other actions that are either (i) necessary or
appropriate in the judgment of the Stockholder Representative for the
accomplishment of the foregoing or

 (ii) specifically mandated by the terms of this Agreement. The Stockholder
Representative may resign at any time. Such agency may be changed by the
Stockholders from time to time upon not less than 30 days prior written
notice to Parent; _provided, however_ , that the Stockholder Representative
may not be removed unless holders of a two-thirds (2/3) interest of the Escrow
Fund agree to such removal and to the identity of the substituted agent.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a resignation of the
Stockholder Representative or other vacancy in the position of Stockholder
Representative, such vacancy may be filled by the holders of a majority in
interest of the Escrow Fund. No bond shall be required of the Stockholder
Representative, and the Stockholder Representative shall not receive any
compensation for its services other than pursuant to the terms of
that certain Engagement Letter to be entered into by and among Shareholder
Representative Services LLC, the Company and certain of the Indemnifying
Parties. Notices or communications after the Closing to or from the
Stockholder Representative shall constitute notice to or from the
Indemnifying Parties.

(b) The Stockholder Representative will incur no liability of any kind
with respect to any action or omission by the Stockholder Representative in
connection with the Stockholder Representatives services pursuant to this
Agreement and any agreements ancillary hereto, except in the event of
liability directly resulting from the Stockholder Representatives gross
negligence or willful misconduct. The Stockholder Representative shall not be
liable for any action or omission pursuant to the advice of counsel. The
Indemnifying Parties will, severally and not jointly, in accordance with
their Indemnity Portions indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Stockholder
Representative from and against any and all losses, liabilities, damages,
claims, penalties, fines, forfeitures, actions, fees, costs and expenses
(including the fees and expenses of counsel and experts and their staffs and
all expense of document location, duplication and shipment) (collectively,
"Stockholder Representative Expenses") arising out of or in connection with
the Stockholder Representatives execution and performance of this Agreement
and any agreements ancillary hereto, in each case as such Stockholder
Representative Expense is suffered or incurred; provided, that in the
event that any such Stockholder Representative Expense is finally adjudicated
to have been directly caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of
the Stockholder Representative, the Stockholder Representative will reimburse
the Indemnifying Parties the amount of such indemnified Stockholder
Representative Expense to the extent attributable to such gross negligence or
willful misconduct. If not paid directly to the Stockholder Representative by
the Indemnifying Parties, any such Stockholder Representative Expenses may be
recovered by the Stockholder Representative from (i) the funds in the
Representative Expense Fund, (ii) the amounts in the Escrow Fund at such time
as remaining amounts would otherwise be distributable to the Indemnifying
Parties, and (iii) the amounts in the Tail Fund at such time as remaining
amounts would otherwise be distributable to the Indemnifying Parties;
provided, that while this section allows the Stockholder Representative to be
paid from the aforementioned sources of funds, this does not relieve the
Indemnifying Parties from their obligation to promptly pay such Stockholder
Representative Expenses as they are suffered or incurred, nor does it
prevent the Stockholder Representative from seeking any remedies available to
it at law or otherwise. In no event will the Stockholder Representative be
required to advance its own funds on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties or
otherwise. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any
restrictions or limitations on liability or indemnification obligations of, or
provisions limiting the recourse against non-parties otherwise applicable to,
the Indemnifying Parties set forth elsewhere in this Agreement are not
intended to be applicable to the indemnities provided to the Stockholder
Representative under this section. The foregoing indemnities will survive the
Closing, the resignation or removal of the Stockholder Representative or the
termination of this Agreement. As soon as practicable following the completion
of the Stockholder Representatives responsibilities, the Stockholder
Representative will deliver any remaining balance of the Representative
Expense Fund, if any, to the Escrow Agent, who will promptly distribute such
funds to Company Holders in accordance with their Indemnity Portions. A
decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder Representative,
including an amendment, extension or waiver of this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.2 or Section 8.3, shall constitute a decision of the Indemnifying
Parties and shall be final, conclusive and binding upon the Indemnifying
Parties; and the Escrow Agent and Parent may rely upon any such decision, act,
consent or instruction of the Stockholder Representative as being the
decision, act, consent or instruction of the Indemnifying Parties. The Escrow
Agent and Parent are hereby relieved from any liability to any person for any
acts done by them in accordance with such decision, act, consent or
instruction of the Stockholder Representative.

Closing WilmerHale may represent the Stockholder Representative, the
Indemnifying Parties and/or their Affiliates in all matters related to the
Transaction Agreements, including without limitation in respect of any
indemnification claims pursuant to the Transaction Agreements. Each of Parent
and the Company hereby acknowledges, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates,

Indemnifying Parties. To the extent that Parent or the Company receives or
takes physical possession of any privileged or protected material covered by
this Section 7.6(d) after the Closing, such physical possession or receipt
shall not, in any way, be deemed a waiver by the Indemnifying Parties of the
privileges or protections described in this Section 7.6.

traded, and other than with respect to information that is approved for public
disclosure by Parent, none of the Company, any of its Representatives or the

the reasons therefor, without the consent of Parent.

 

 _8.8_ _Third Party Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, each party shall be responsible for its own expenses and costs that

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 other agreement set forth in this Agreement, (i) each party shall be
entitled, without any proof of actual damages (and in addition to any other
remedy that may be available to it), to a decree or order of specific
performance or mandamus to enforce the observance and performance of such
covenant, obligation or other agreement and an injunction preventing or
restraining such breach or threatened breach, and (ii) no party hereto shall
be required to provide or post any bond or other security or collateral in
connection with any such decree, order or injunction or in connection with any
related action or legal proceeding.

 

(b) Any and all remedies herein expressly conferred herein upon a party
hereto shall be deemed to be cumulative with, and not exclusive of, any other
remedy conferred hereby, or by law or in equity upon such party, and the
exercise by a party hereto of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of
any other remedy.

 

(c) The liability of any Person under Article VII will be in addition to,
and not exclusive of, any other liability that such Person may have at law or
in equity based on such Persons fraudulent acts or omissions, or Intentional
Breach or Intentional Misrepresentation. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, none of the provisions set forth in
this Agreement, including the provisions set forth in Article VII, shall be
deemed a waiver by any party to this Agreement of any right or remedy which
such party may have at law or in equity based on any other Persons
fraudulent acts or omissions or Intentional Breach or Intentional
Misrepresentation, nor will any such provisions limit, or be deemed to limit
(i) the amounts of recovery sought or awarded in any such claim for fraud,
Intentional Breach or Intentional Misrepresentation, (ii) the time period
during which a claim for fraud, Intentional Breach or Intentional
Misrepresentation may be brought or (iii) the recourse which any such party
may seek against another Person with respect to a claim for fraud,

 _8.12_ _Severability_. In the event that any provision of
this Agreement or the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court
of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder
of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application
of such provision to other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further
agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a
valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible,
the economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable
provision.

  _8.13_ _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of
the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts
of laws thereof.

consents to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state courts of the
State of Delaware in connection with any matter based upon or arising out of
this Agreement and the Transactions or any other matters contemplated herein
(or, only if the state courts of the State of Delaware decline to accept
jurisdiction over a particular matter, any federal court within the State of
Delaware). Each party agrees not to commence any legal proceedings related
hereto except in such state courts of the State of Delaware (or, only if the
state courts of the State of Delaware decline to accept jurisdiction over a
particular matter, in any federal court within the State of Delaware).
By execution and delivery of this Agreement, each party hereto and the
Company Holders irrevocably and unconditionally submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of such courts and to the appellate courts therefrom solely for
the purposes of disputes arising under this Agreement and not as a general
submission to such jurisdiction or with respect to any other dispute, matter
or claim whatsoever. The parties hereto and the Company Holders irrevocably
consent to the service of process out of any of the aforementioned courts in
any such action or proceeding by the delivery of copies thereof by overnight
courier to the address for such party to which notices are deliverable
hereunder. Any such service of process shall be effective upon delivery.
Nothing herein shall affect the right to serve process in any other manner
permitted by applicable law. The parties hereto and the Company Holders hereby
waive any right to stay or dismiss any action or proceeding under or in
connection with this Agreement brought before the foregoing courts on the
basis of (i) any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction
of the above-named courts

 for any reason, or that it or any of its property is immune from the above-
described legal process, (ii) that such action or proceeding is brought in an
inconvenient forum, that venue for the action or proceeding is improper or
that this Agreement may not be enforced in or by such courts, or (iii) any
other defense that would hinder or delay the levy, execution or collection of
any amount to which any party hereto is entitled pursuant to any final
judgment of any court having jurisdiction.

 

 _8.15_ _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY AND ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR
COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY HERETO IN
NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE OR ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.

of the parties and delivered to the other party, it being understood that all
