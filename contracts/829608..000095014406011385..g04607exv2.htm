Claim by a third party, the Indemnitee must give the Indemnifying Party a reasonable opportunity to
defend the same or prosecute such action to conclusion or settlement satisfactory to the
Indemnifying Party at the Indemnifying Party&#146;s sole cost and expense and with counsel of its own
selection, and the Indemnifying Party shall pay any resulting settlements (including all associated
Damages), satisfy any judgments or comply with any decrees; provided, further, however, that the
Indemnitee shall at all times also have the right fully to participate in the defense at
Indemnitee&#146;s sole cost and expense so long as such participation occurs without hindering or
impairing the defense of the Indemnifying Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the prior
written consent of the Indemnitee, the Indemnifying Party shall not compromise or settle any Claim
if (i)&nbsp;the terms thereof impose any liability or obligations on the Indemnitee or (ii)&nbsp;the terms
thereof fail to include an unconditional general release of the Indemnitee with respect to all
liabilities and obligations in respect of such Claim. If the Indemnifying Party shall, within a
reasonable time after said notice, fail to defend a Claim, the Indemnitee shall have the right, but
not the obligation, and without waiving any rights against the Indemnifying Party, to undertake the
defense of, and with the consent of the Indemnifying Party (such consent not to be withheld
unreasonably), to compromise or settle the Claim on behalf, for the account, and at the risk and
expense, of the Indemnifying Party and shall be entitled to collect the amount of any settlement or
judgment or decree and all costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys&#146;
fees) in connection therewith from the Indemnifying Party. Except as provided in the preceding
sentence, the Indemnitee shall not compromise or settle any Claim.

Damages back to the first dollar of Damages; provided, however, that with respect to Claims for
indemnification pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;9.1(a)</U>, <U>9.1(b)</U>, <U>9.2(a)</U>, <U>9.2(b)</U>
or <U>9.2(c)</U>, the aggregate amount of Seller&#146;s and Purchaser&#146;s liability under Article&nbsp;IX

relating to the matter for which indemnification has been made.
