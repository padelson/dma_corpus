 6.1 _Notice of Certain Occurrences_. Seller shall give prompt notice to Purchaser (except with respect to clause (d) of this _Section 6.1_ only), and (in the case of clauses (a) and (d) of this _Section 6.1_ only) Purchaser shall give prompt notice to Seller, of (a) the occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event, which occurrence or failure to occur has caused or is reasonably likely to cause any representation or warranty of such party contained in this Agreement or the other agreements contemplated hereby to be untrue at any time from the date of this Agreement to the Closing Date, (b) any Material Adverse Effect with respect to the Acquired Entities or any event, change, occurrence, effect, fact, condition, development or circumstance or series of events, changes, occurrences, effects, facts, conditions, developments or circumstances that would reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, (c) any material claims, actions, proceedings, litigation or governmental investigations commenced or, to Sellers Knowledge, threatened, involving or affecting the Acquired Entities or any of their material property or assets or the transactions contemplated hereby which would reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect or (d) any failure of Purchaser or of any officer, director, employee or agent thereof to comply in all material respects with or satisfy any material covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder.

Each of Seller and Purchaser shall give prompt notice to the other party of any notice or other communication from any third party or Governmental Authority alleging that the consent of such third party or Governmental Authority is or may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 6.3 _Public Announcements_. The parties hereto shall issue the joint press release announcing the execution of this Agreement substantially in the form attached hereto as  _Schedule 6.3_. On or before the Closing, the parties hereto will each consult with one another prior to making or issuing public statements or announcements with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and will use good faith efforts to agree on the text of a joint public statement or announcement and/or will use good faith efforts to obtain the other partys approval of the text of any public statement or announcement to be made solely on behalf of a party. If the parties hereto are unable to agree on or approve such a public statement or announcement and a party, in its reasonable discretion, is of the opinion that such statement or announcement is required by, or advisable under, Law or the regulations of any national securities exchange on which a partys securities are traded, then such party may make or issue the public statement or announcement. 

   ##### 

  

  

 6.4 _Closing Conditions_. Purchaser will use its best efforts to cause the conditions set forth in Article VIII hereof (except for _Sections 8.1_ with respect to all representations and warranties contained in Article IV (other than the representations and warranties contained in _Section 4.5_ which Purchaser will cause to be true and correct) and  _8.3_ (to the extent that _Section 8.3_ relates to _Section 8.1_ with respect to all representations and warranties contained in Article IV (other than the representations and warranties contained in _Section 4.5_)) to be satisfied as soon as practicable and will provide reasonable cooperation to Seller to obtain all consents to the transactions contemplated hereby from third parties to the Material Contracts listed on _Schedule 6.4_ as soon as practicable. 

  

 6.5 _Employee Matters_. As of the Effective Time, and subject to the sole discretion of Purchaser, the employees of the Acquired Entities shall continue employment with the Acquired Entities, in each case in substantially similar positions and at a substantially similar level of wages and/or salary and without having incurred a termination of employment or separation from service; provided, however, such employees meet the pre-employment screening requirements of Purchaser. All employees are employees at-will. Except as may be specifically required by applicable Law or any Contract, the Acquired Entities shall not be obligated to continue any employment relationship with any employee for any specific period of time. 

  

 6.6 _WARN Act Compliance; COBRA_. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Seller shall be solely responsible for any and all liability arising directly or indirectly under the WARN Act, as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Seller acknowledges and agrees that Purchaser does not assume or agree to discharge any liability of Seller under COBRA with respect to any current or former employees (and their beneficiaries) of the Acquired Entities. Seller agrees that it will not take any voluntary action, including, without limitation, the termination of its Company Plans, the effect of which would be, or might reasonably be expected to be, the imposition upon Purchaser of COBRA liability for current or former employees (and their beneficiaries) of the Acquired Entities not hired by Purchaser. Additionally, Seller shall retain any and all liabilities under Section 4980B of the Code and Sections 601 through 608 of ERISA with respect to all current and former employees (and their beneficiaries) of Seller. 

  

 6.7 _Tax Matters_. 

  

 (a) _Preparation and Filing of Tax Returns; Payment of Taxes_. 

    

 (i) Seller shall prepare (or cause to be prepared) all Tax Returns required to be filed by the Acquired Entities for all taxable periods that end on or prior to the Closing Date (a " _Pre-Closing Period_ ") (such Tax Returns being the " _Pre-Closing Period Tax Returns_ ") (provided that Seller shall submit a draft of any such Tax Return required to be filed by the Acquired Entities to Purchaser for its review and comment at least twenty (20) days prior to the due date of such Tax Return). Seller shall timely file all such Pre-Closing Period Tax Returns, provided, however, if any Pre-Closing Period Tax Return is due after the Closing and Seller is not authorized to file such Pre-Closing Period Tax Return by Law, Purchaser shall file (or cause to be filed) such Pre-Closing Period Tax Return as prepared by Seller with the appropriate Governmental Authorities. Seller shall pay all Taxes due and payable in respect of all Pre-Closing Periods; provided, however, that if any Pre-Closing Period Tax Return is due after the Closing and is to be filed (or caused to be filed) by Purchaser, Seller shall pay (in immediately available funds) all Taxes due and payable in respect of such Tax Return to Purchaser no later than five (5) days prior to the due date of such Tax Return. 

   

 (ii) Purchaser shall prepare and file (or cause to be prepared and filed) all Tax Returns required to be filed by the Acquired Entities for all taxable periods beginning before the Closing Date and ending after the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ ") (such Tax Returns, the " _Straddle Period Tax Returns_ "). Purchaser shall deliver or cause to be delivered drafts of all Straddle Period Tax Returns to Seller at least twenty (20) days prior to the due date of any such Straddle Period Tax Return (taking into account valid extensions) and notify Seller of Purchasers calculation of Sellers share of the Taxes of the Acquired Entities for any such Straddle Periods. If Seller disputes any item on such Straddle Period Tax Return, it shall notify Purchaser (by written 

   ##### 

  

    

notice within fifteen (15) days of receipt of Purchasers calculation) of
such disputed item (or items) and the basis for its objection. If Seller does
not object by written notice within such period, Purchasers calculation of
Sellers share of the Taxes for such Straddle Period shall be deemed to have
been accepted and agreed upon, and final and conclusive, for all purposes
hereof. Purchaser and Seller shall act in good faith to resolve any such
dispute prior to the date on which the Straddle Period Tax Return is
required to be filed. No later than three (3) days prior to the filing of
such Straddle Period Tax Return, Seller shall pay to Purchaser (in
immediately available funds) the amount of Sellers share of the Tax
liability for the Straddle Period determined pursuant to this _Section
6.7(a)_. 

   

 (iii) In order to apportion appropriately any Taxes relating to a Straddle Period, the parties hereto shall, to the extent required or permitted under applicable Law, treat the Closing Date as the last day of the taxable year or period of the Acquired Entities for all Tax purposes. In any case where applicable Law does not permit the Acquired Entities to treat the Closing Date as the last day of the taxable year or period, such Taxes (including all real and personal property taxes) shall be prorated as of the Effective Time. With respect to such prorated Taxes, the portion of any Taxes that are allocable to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall be: (A) in the case of Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis (such as real property Taxes), deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the Straddle Period ending on (and including) the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire relevant Straddle Period; and (B) in the case of Taxes not described in (A) (such as (x) Taxes that are based upon or measured by income or receipts or imposed in connection with any sale or other transfer or assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or intangible) and (y) payroll and similar Taxes), deemed equal to the amount that would be payable if the taxable year or period ended on the Closing Date. 

  

 (b) _Transfer Taxes_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Seller shall pay all sales, value added, use, privilege, transfer, documentary, gains, stamp, duties and recording taxes and fees (including, without limitation, any penalties, interest or additions) (collectively, the " _Transfer Taxes_ ") imposed upon any party incurred as a result of the sale of the ABS Shares. Seller shall prepare and timely file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to any Transfer Taxes. If required by applicable Law, ABS and/or the ABS Subsidiaries shall join in the execution of any such Tax Returns or other documentation. 

   

 (c) _Post-Closing Audits and Other Procedures_. 

    

 (i) If a notice of deficiency, proposed adjustment, adjustment, assessment, audit, examination or other administrative or court proceeding, suit, dispute or other claim (a " _Tax Proceeding_ ") shall be delivered or sent to or commenced or initiated against any of the Acquired Entities by any Governmental Authority with respect to Taxes for which Purchaser is entitled to indemnification from Seller, Purchaser shall notify Seller in writing of the Tax Proceeding and shall include a copy of the relevant Tax Proceeding notice; provided that the failure by Purchaser to notify Seller of any such notice shall not release Seller from its obligations under this _Section 6.7_ and _Section 6.8_, except to the extent Purchasers failure to give the required notice materially and adversely impairs Sellers ability to indemnify, defend or mitigate its Damages, in which case Seller shall have no obligation to indemnify Purchaser to the extent of Damages, if any, caused by such failure to give the required notice. 

   

 (ii) With respect to Tax Proceedings of or relating to Taxes of any of the Acquired Entities for any Pre-Closing Period, Seller may, upon written notice to Purchaser (such written notice to be provided within thirty (30) days after notice of the Tax Proceeding has been given to Seller), assume and control the defense of such Tax Proceeding at its own cost and expense and with its own counsel. If Seller elects to assume the defense of any such Tax Proceeding, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein: (A) Seller shall not enter into any 

   ##### 

  

    

settlement with respect to any such Tax Proceeding without Purchasers prior
written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; (B) Seller
shall keep Purchaser informed of all material developments and events
relating to such Tax Proceeding (including promptly forwarding copies to
Purchaser of any related correspondence and providing Purchaser with an
opportunity to review and comment on any material correspondence before
Seller sends such correspondence to any Governmental Authority); and (C)
at its own cost and expense, Purchaser shall have the right to participate in
the defense of such Tax Proceeding. 

   

 (iii) In connection with the contest of any Tax Proceeding that relates to (A) any Straddle Period, (B) any taxable period beginning on or after the Closing Date and (C) any Tax Proceeding that Seller has the ability to control but does not timely elect to control pursuant to _Section 6.7(c)(ii)_, such Tax Proceeding shall be controlled by Purchaser (and Seller shall reimburse Purchaser for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Purchaser or its Affiliates relating to a Tax Proceeding described in clause (C)), and Seller agrees to cooperate fully with Purchaser and its Affiliates in pursuing such contest (other than in connection with a Tax Proceeding described in clause (B)). Nothing contained herein shall be construed as limiting Purchasers right to indemnification under _Section 6.8_. 

   

 (iv) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the procedure for indemnification Claims with regard to Taxes of or relating to the Acquired Entities shall be governed exclusively by this _Section 6.7_ and _Section 6.8_. 

  

 (d) _Cooperation_. Following the Closing, Seller, on the one hand, and Purchaser and the Acquired Entities, on the other hand, agree to furnish or cause to be furnished to each other or their respective representatives, upon request, as promptly as practicable, such information and assistance (including access to Books and Records) relating to the Acquired Entities as is reasonably necessary for the preparation of any Tax Return, claim for refund, audit or similar matter, or the prosecution or defense of any Tax Proceeding relating to any proposed adjustment of Taxes. Purchaser, Seller, the Acquired Entities and their Affiliates shall retain (or cause to be retained) all Books and Records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Acquired Entities relating to any Pre- Closing Period, Straddle Period or any taxable period beginning on the Closing Date until the expiration of the relevant statutory period of limitations for the assessment of Tax. 

   

 (e) _Termination of Tax Indemnification Agreements_. Seller hereby agrees and covenants that any and all Tax Indemnification Agreements that may have been entered into by the Acquired Entities shall be terminated on or before the Closing Date, and no payments to or from the Acquired Entities pursuant to any such Tax Indemnification Agreement shall be made after such termination. 

   

 (f) _Consolidated Return Principles_. For all taxable periods of the Acquired Entities ending on or before the Closing Date, Seller shall cause the Acquired Entities to join in Sellers consolidated federal income Tax Return. Seller shall include the income of the Acquired Entities (including any deferred items triggered into income by Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-13 and any excess loss account taken into income under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-19) on Sellers consolidated federal income Tax Returns for all periods through the Closing Date and pay any Taxes attributable to such income. Such Tax Returns shall be prepared and filed in a manner consistent with prior practice, except as required by a change in applicable Laws. The federal income Tax Returns that include the Acquired Entities for the taxable year that ends on the Closing Date and the taxable year that begins the day after the Closing Date shall be prepared in accordance with Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(A). Purchaser and Seller further agree that the Acquired Entities shall become members of the federal income consolidated tax group of which Purchaser is the common parent on the day after the Closing Date. To the extent applicable, any state or local income Tax Returns shall be prepared in accordance with provisions comparable to Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(A) under state or local Law. 

   

 (g) _Survival_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, each of the provisions set forth in this _Section 6.7_ and _Section 6.8_ shall survive ninety (90) days after the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (taking into account all valid extensions) for the applicable Taxes or Tax Return to   ##### 

  

  

  

which the provision relates; provided, however, in the event notice of any
claim for indemnification under this Agreement shall have been given within
the applicable survival period, the provisions that are the subject of
the indemnification claim shall survive with respect to such claims until
such time as such claim is finally resolved. 

   

 6.8 _Tax Indemnification_. Seller shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Purchaser from and against any and all Damages for: (i) Taxes of or imposed on Seller; (ii) Transfer Taxes required to be paid by Seller pursuant to this Agreement; (iii) Taxes of or imposed upon the Acquired Entities with respect to any Pre-Closing Periods, and for any Straddle Periods but only with respect to the portion of such Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and as determined in the manner provided in _Section 6.7_ of this Agreement; (iv) Taxes imposed on the Acquired Entities under Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6 (and corresponding provisions of state, local, or foreign Law) as a result of having been a member of any federal, state, local or foreign consolidated, unitary, combined or similar group for any taxable period ending on or before, or that includes, the Closing Date, or as a transferee or successor, pursuant to any Tax Indemnification Agreement, or similar contract or arrangement, or otherwise; (v) any breach by Seller of any of the covenants and obligations contained in _Section 6.7_ of this Agreement; (vi) the breach or inaccuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in _Section 3.14_ of this Agreement and (vii) Taxes imposed on or related or attributable to the Excluded Assets or the transfer of the Excluded Assets as contemplated by _Section 2.1_. All amounts payable or to be paid under this _Section 6.8_ shall be paid in immediately available funds within five (5) Business Days after the receipt of a written request from the indemnified party entitled to such payment. The parties hereto agree to treat any payment made pursuant to this  _Section 6.8_ and Article IX as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for all Tax purposes, except as required under applicable Law. In no event shall the indemnities provided for in this  _Section 6.8_ be subject to the provisions of Article IX of this Agreement. 

  

 6.9 _Consents Not Obtained by Closing_. Without prejudice to _Section 5.1_,  _Section 7.6_ or _Section 8.6_, if any consent, approval, release or waiver identified on _Schedule 3.5_ has not been given or made, then, to the extent reasonably practicable, the parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to enter into an alternative, lawful arrangement under which Purchaser shall have the benefit of such Material Contracts (and assume the related obligations) from and after the Effective Time and/or shall work cooperatively after the Closing to secure such consent, approval, release or waiver, in either case as Purchaser may reasonably request. 

  

 6.10 _Consultative Process_. From and after the date hereof and until the Closing, Purchaser shall designate an individual or individuals whom Seller may contact during normal business hours for the purpose of approving actions or transactions for which the consent of Purchaser is required under this Agreement. The written approval of a designated individual as contemplated in this _Section 6.10_ shall constitute the consent of Purchaser to the transaction or action so approved. 

  

 6.11 _Confidentiality_. Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the parties hereto until the Closing shall have occurred and that all information provided to Purchaser or its " _Representatives_ " (as such term is defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) in accordance with this Agreement, including any information provided to PWC in connection with the SAS 100 Review, shall be considered "Confidential Information" (as such term is defined in the Confidentiality Agreement), except as otherwise provided in the Confidentiality Agreement. 

  

 6.12 _Books and Records_. Until six (6) months after the later to occur of (a) the final adjudication of any dispute or investigation involving Taxes arising out of the business, operations or affairs of the Acquired Entities before the Effective Time, (b) the final adjudication of any matter for which Seller may be required to indemnify or hold harmless any Purchaser Indemnitee pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, or (c) the running of applicable statutes of limitations, Purchaser will maintain all Books and Records of the Acquired Entities that relate to the pre-Closing business, operations, assets and properties of the Acquired Entities, and shall give Seller access to all such Books and Records for legitimate business purposes, following reasonable notice and during regular business hours.

materially impairs the Indemnifying Partys ability to indemnify, defend or
mitigate its Damages, in which case the Indemnifying Party shall have no
obligation to indemnify the Indemnitee to the extent of Damages, if any,
caused by such failure to give or delay in giving the required notice. If
such Damages arise out of a Claim by a third party, the Indemnitee must give
the Indemnifying Party a reasonable opportunity to defend the same or
prosecute such action to conclusion or settlement satisfactory to
the Indemnifying Party at the Indemnifying Partys sole cost and expense and
with counsel of its own selection, and the Indemnifying Party shall pay any
resulting settlements (including all associated Damages), satisfy any
judgments or comply with any decrees; provided, further, however, that
the Indemnitee shall at all times also have the right fully to participate in
the defense at Indemnitees sole cost and expense so long as such
participation occurs without hindering or impairing the defense of the
Indemnifying Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the prior written
consent of the Indemnitee, the Indemnifying Party shall not compromise or
settle any Claim if (i) the terms thereof impose any liability or obligations
on the Indemnitee or (ii) the terms thereof fail to include an unconditional
general release of the Indemnitee with respect to all liabilities and
obligations in respect of such Claim. If the Indemnifying Party shall, within
a reasonable time after said notice, fail to defend a Claim, the Indemnitee
shall have the right, but not the obligation, and without waiving any rights
against the Indemnifying Party, to undertake the defense of, and with the
consent of the Indemnifying Party (such consent not to be
withheld unreasonably), to compromise or settle the Claim on behalf, for the
account, and at the risk and expense, of the Indemnifying Party and shall be
entitled to collect the amount of any settlement or judgment or decree and
all costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable
attorneys fees) in connection therewith from the Indemnifying Party. Except
as provided in the preceding sentence, the Indemnitee shall not compromise or
settle any Claim. 

  

 9.4 _Limitations on Claims_. 

  

 (a) _Liability Thresholds_. Except as otherwise set forth in this _Section 9.4(a)_ , no Damages with respect to Claims arising out of this Article IX shall be payable pursuant to this Article IX unless and until the aggregate amount of Damages incurred by the Indemnitee under this Article IX with respect to such Claims equals or exceeds an amount equal to $250,000.00 (the " _Liability Threshold_ "). Once the Liability Threshold for such Claims has been reached, the Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnity under this Article IX for any and all Damages back to the first dollar of Damages; provided, however, that with respect to Claims for indemnification pursuant to _Section 9.1(a)_, _9.1(b)_ , _9.2(a)_ , _9.2(b)_  or _9.2(c)_ , the aggregate amount of Sellers and Purchasers liability under Article IX shall not exceed $40,000,000.00. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Sellers or Purchasers liability for Claims for indemnification pursuant to _Sections 6.8_,  _9.1(c)_ , _9.1(d)_ and _9.2(d)_ shall not be subject to any Liability Threshold or liability cap. 

   

 (b) _Subrogation_. Following full indemnification as provided for hereunder, the Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated to all rights of the Indemnitee with respect to all Persons relating to the matter for which indemnification has been made. 

   

 (c) _Survival of Representations and Warranties; Limitation of Time to Bring Claims_. The representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement shall survive the Closing and shall expire twenty-four (24) months after the Effective Time, other than (x) those set forth in  _Sections 3.1_, _3.2_ , _3.3_ , _3.4_ , _3.11(a)_ , _3.11(b)_ ,  _4.1_ and _4.2_ hereof, which shall survive in perpetuity, and (y) those set forth in  _Sections 3.12_, _3.14_ , _3.18_ , _3.22_ , _3.26_ , _3.27_ ,  _3.28_ , _3.29_ , _3.30_ and _3.32_ hereof insofar as any Damages relate to Claims made against Purchaser or its Affiliates by third parties, which shall survive until ninety (90) days after the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (taking into account all valid extensions). No Claim for indemnification arising out of a breach of representations and warranties in this Agreement may be brought after the applicable time provided for in this  _Section 9.4(c)_. 

   

 9.5 _Miscellaneous_. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (a) The amount of any Damages for which indemnification is provided under this Article IX shall be net of any duplicative amounts recovered by the Indemnitee under insurance policies or from unaffiliated third Persons with respect to such Damages. 

   

 (b) Subject to _Section 6.19_, the obligations to indemnify under this Article IX shall be without regard to whether the Indemnitee(s) had any knowledge of the facts or circumstances giving rise to such indemnification. 

   

 (c) For purposes of the calculating the amount of Damages to which an Indemnitee is entitled under this _Article IX_ (but not for purposes of determining whether a representation or warranty has been breached), the terms "material," "materiality," "Material Adverse Effect" and other qualifiers, modifiers or limitations (including monetary values and qualifiers as to "knowledge") shall be disregarded.

 (c) by Purchaser, if Seller shall have breached or failed to perform in any material respect any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (a) would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Article VII, except _Section 7.7_, and (b) cannot be or has not been cured within ten (10) days after Purchasers giving written notice to Seller of such breach (a " _Seller Material Breach_ ") (provided that Purchaser is not then in Purchaser Material Breach);

In the event of termination of this Agreement by Purchaser pursuant to _Sections 10.1(c)_ or _10.1(g)_ , then, except as set forth in the proviso to this sentence, Seller shall pay Purchaser the Liquidated Damages and shall pay Purchasers Termination Expenses in immediately available funds within two (2) Business Days following termination of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that if Sellers breach of, or failure to perform its obligations under, any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement giving rise to the termination by Purchaser pursuant to  _Section 10.1(c)_ was willful or intentional, Purchaser shall be entitled to any and all remedies available at law in connection with such breach or failure to perform, which remedies shall not be limited to Liquidated Damages.

If any provision of this Agreement is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable under any present or future Law, (a) such provisions will be fully severable; (b) this Agreement will be construed and enforced as if such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part hereof; (c) the remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect and will not be affected by the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision or by its severance herefrom; and (d) in lieu of such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision, there will be added automatically as a part of this Agreement a legal, valid and enforceable provision as similar in terms to such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision as may be possible.
