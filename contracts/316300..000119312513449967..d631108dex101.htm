the Contribution Agreement, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the
Parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

MINIMUM VOLUME COMMITMENT

1.1 _Minimum Volume Commitment_. Subject to _Section 2.1_, Producers commit
to deliver to Gatherers systems a combined total minimum volume of 600,000
MMBtu/day of natural gas production from the Holly and Shelby fields, with
such total minimum volume to be calculated on an annual basis based upon the
daily average of such volumes delivered during the applicable Subject Year
(the " _Minimum Volume Commitment_ "). " _Subject Year_ " shall mean a
12-month period beginning at 12:01 A.M. (Central Time) on December 1 of any
year and ending at 11:59 P.M. (Central Time) on November 30 of the following
year. The Minimum Volume Commitment shall be satisfied to the extent any of
the following types of natural gas production from the Holly and Shelby fields
are delivered to Gatherers systems (the " _Subject Production_ "): (1)
natural gas production of a Producer or any Affiliate of a Producer; (2)
natural gas production of any joint venture partner of a Producer or joint
venture partner of any Affiliate of a Producer (a " _JV Partner_ "); and (3)
natural gas production of any non-operating working interest owner over which
a Producer, an Affiliate of a Producer or a JV Partner has control
or otherwise directs the delivery of such production to a gathering system. In the event of a transfer or assignment by a Producer (or any of its
Affiliates) of oil and gas interests to either a non-Credit-Worthy Assignee
or a Credit-Worthy Assignee that is not conveyed and does not assume all or
any portion of the Minimum Volume Commitment in each case in accordance with
_Section 2.7_, all natural gas production attributable to such oil and gas
interests that would otherwise qualify as Subject Production under the terms
of this Agreement had such oil and gas interests continued to be held by such
Producer (or such Affiliate) shall continue to qualify as Subject Production.

In the event of a transfer or assignment by a JV Partner of oil and gas
interests, all natural gas production attributable to such oil and gas
interests that would otherwise qualify as Subject Production under the terms
of this Agreement had such oil and gas interests continued to be held by such
JV Partner shall continue to qualify as Subject Production.

In the event of a transfer or assignment by a Producer (or any of its
Affiliates) of oil and gas interests to a Credit-Worthy Assignee that is
conveyed and assumes all or any portion of the Minimum Volume Commitment in
accordance with _Section 2.7_, all natural gas production attributable to
such oil and gas interests after such assignment becomes effective under 
_Section 2.7_ shall be credited to the Credit-Worthy Assignee that was
conveyed and assumed the conveyed Minimum Volume Commitment, or portion
thereof, in accordance with _Section 2.7_ and the Minimum Volume Commitment
shall be reduced by the amount of the Minimum Volume Commitment, or portion
thereof, that was assigned or sold with such interests.

By way of example, _Exhibit A_ hereto sets forth an example of how the
Minimum Volume Commitment and the Shortfall Payments (defined below) will be
calculated.

 

1.2 _Adjustments to Minimum Volume Commitment_.

 

(a) In the event volumes of the Subject Production are delivered in excess of
the Minimum Volume Commitment during any Subject Year (without giving effect
to any adjustments to such Subject Years Minimum Volume Commitment pursuant
to this _Section 1.2(a)_), the Minimum Volume Commitment in the immediately
subsequent Subject Year shall be reduced by 25% of such excess delivered
volumes.

(b) In the event Gatherer is unable or unwilling to receive any Subject
Production which is available for delivery to Gatherers systems, including
(without limitation) in the event Gatherer is rendered unable as a result of
Force Majeure (as defined in the applicable Gathering Agreement), a breach by
Gatherer of the Gathering Agreements or Gatherers failure to connect wells
to Gatherers systems in accordance with the applicable Gathering Agreement,
Producers will be entitled to a reduction to the Minimum Volume Commitment for
the Subject Year in which Gatherer is unable or unwilling to receive such
production. Such reduction in the Minimum Volume Commitment shall be equal to
the average daily amount of such production available for delivery to
Gatherers systems that Gatherer was unable or unwilling to receive for
such Subject Year. Failure by Gatherer to receive any Subject Production
pursuant to the second to last sentence of Section 2.03 or Section 7.04 of the
Gathering Agreements will not result in a reduction of the Minimum Volume
Commitment. In the event Gatherer releases quantities of gas from the
Gathering Agreements pursuant to Section 2.06 of the Gathering Agreements, the
Minimum Volume Commitment will be proportionately reduced by such amount.

 



2 (c) As used herein, (i) the term " _Gathering Agreements_ " means
the existing gas gathering agreements in place between Gatherer, Producers,
their Affiliates, or the JV Partners with respect to the Holly and Shelby
fields, as such gas gathering agreements may be amended, supplemented, or
modified from time to time, (ii) the term " _BG Gathering Agreements_ " means
the Gathering Agreements in place between Gatherer and BG, as such Gathering
Agreements may be amended, supplemented, or modified from time to time and
(iii) the term " _EXCO Gathering Agreements_ " means the Gathering Agreements
in place between Gatherer and EXCO, as such Gathering Agreements may be
amended, supplemented, or modified from time to time.

 

1.3 _Shortfall_. To the extent there is a shortfall of the Minimum Volume
Commitment, such shortfall to be calculated on an annual basis based upon the
daily average of such volumes delivered during the applicable Subject Year and
subject to any adjustments to the Minimum Volume Commitment pursuant to
_Section 1.2_ (the total amount of such shortfall, the " _Shortfall Amount_
"), then Gatherer shall charge and each Producer shall pay $0.40 per MMBtu
times one-half of the Shortfall Amount (the " _Shortfall Payments_ "). Any
Shortfall Payments will be due within three months following the end of the
Subject Year in which the shortfall occurs (the " _Shortfall Year_ "). In the
event of assignment of all or a portion of a Producers Minimum Volume
Commitment to a Credit-Worthy Assignee during a Subject Year pursuant to
_Section 2.7_, the Minimum Volume Commitment shall be reduced by the amount
assigned for the remaining portion of the Subject Year and the Credit-Worthy
Assignee shall have assumed and be responsible for its Shortfall Amount, if
any, calculated during the remaining portion of the Subject Year.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each Producer
shall be severally liable to Gatherer for its Shortfall Payment and shall not
have any liability to the Gatherer for any Shortfall Payment of the other
Producer.

1.4 _Bossier Shale Discount_. For three Subject Years from the date hereof,
there shall be a $0.10 per MMBtu discount to any applicable gathering fees
owed by Producers, their Affiliates, or the JV Partners to Gatherer under any
applicable Gathering Agreement on natural gas production delivered from new
wells completed by or on behalf of Producers, their Affiliates, or the JV
Partners in the Bossier Shale that are connected to Gatherers systems in the
Holly field (it being understood and agreed that such production shall not be
Subject Production), such discount to be conditioned upon the volume of
production delivered to Gatherers systems from such wells and field
development plan ( _i.e._ , wells turned to sales) in the Bossier Shale
(excluding the Bossier Shale in the Shelby field) being incremental to
Producers, their Affiliates, or the JV Partners aggregate volumes from the
Haynesville Shale in the Holly and Shelby fields, from the Cotton Valley in
the Holly field and from the Bossier Shale in the Shelby field as set forth
below:

(a) 850,000 MMBtu/d in the first Subject Year following the date hereof;

 

(b) 951,000 MMBtu/d in the second Subject Year following the date hereof; and

 

(c) 1,100,000 MMBtu/d in the third Subject Year following the date hereof.

 



3 This discount is a personal right in favor of Producers, their Affiliates and
the JV Partners and is not assignable to any third party.

1.5 _Recordkeeping and Audit Rights_. At all times during the Term of this
Agreement, Gatherer shall keep (or cause to be kept) true and complete books
of account. Each Producer or its designated representatives shall have the
right, at its own expense, at all reasonable times and during normal business
hours, to examine the books and records of the Gatherer to the extent
necessary to verify the accuracy of any statement, charge, computation, or
demand made under or pursuant to this Agreement. Gatherer agrees to keep
records and books of the account in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles and practices in the industry. Each statement
shall be final as to both Parties unless questioned within twenty-four (24)
Months following receipt of invoice.

shall not alter, amend or supplement the corresponding provisions of the
BG Gathering Agreements or the EXCO Gathering Agreements, as applicable, and
the provisions of _Article II_ of this Agreement shall continue to apply to

sentence of this _Section 2.3(a)_.

 



5 (b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the terms and
conditions of this Agreement are personal to BG and EXCO, respectively, and
no Person that subsequently acquires an interest in the oil and gas interests
that are subject to the Gathering Agreements will in any way be subject to, or
bound by, the provisions contained in this Agreement unless the provisions of
this Agreement are assigned to, and assumed by, such Person in accordance with
_Section 2.7_. For the avoidance of doubt, (i) this Agreement shall not alter
the terms and conditions of the BG Gathering Agreements or the EXCO Gathering
Agreements, as applicable, with respect to the provisions on transfer and
assignment and the BG Gathering Agreements or the EXCO Gathering Agreements,
as applicable, may be transferred and/or assigned without regard to this

Agreement) and (ii) the BG Gathering Agreements or the EXCO
Gathering Agreements, as applicable, shall not alter the terms and conditions
of this Agreement with respect to the provisions on transfer and assignment
and this Agreement may be transferred and/or assigned as is provided for in

or the EXCO Gathering Agreements, as applicable). To the extent that (i) all
or any part of either this Agreement, a BG Gathering Agreement or an EXCO
Gathering Agreement is transferred or assigned to a third Person (the "
_Transferred Interest_ ") and (ii) the portion of either this Agreement (in
the case of a transfer or assignment of all or any part of a BG Gathering
Agreement or an EXCO Gathering Agreement, as applicable) or the BG Gathering
Agreements or the EXCO Gathering Agreements, as applicable (in the case of a
transfer or assignment of all or any part of this Agreement), in each case,
that constitutes an amendment to or is amended by, as applicable, the
Transferred Interest is not also transferred or assigned to such third Person
(the " _Non-Transferred Interest_ "), then from and after the effective time
of such transfer or assignment, the Transferred Interest and the Non-
Transferred Interest shall be separate agreements and shall no longer
constitute amendments or supplements to each other. For the avoidance of
doubt, the portion of this Agreement, a BG Gathering Agreement or an EXCO

amendment to or be amended by, as applicable, the Non-Transferred Interest.

 

(c) This Agreement and the BG Gathering Agreements and/or the EXCO Gathering
Agreements, as applicable, supersede all prior discussions, representations
and agreements between the Parties and/or their Affiliates with respect to the
subject matter hereof and thereof and contain the sole and entire agreement
between the Parties and their Affiliates with respect to the subject
matter hereof and thereof. Except as provided herein, the Gathering
Agreements shall remain in full force and effect.

2.4 _Waiver_. Any term or condition of this Agreement may be waived at any
time by the Party that is entitled to the benefit thereof, but no such waiver

beneficiary rights upon any other Person.

2.7 _Assignment; Binding Effect_. Neither this Agreement nor any right,
interest or obligation hereunder may be assigned by any Party without the
prior written consent of the other Party, and any attempt to do so will be
void, except for assignments and transfers by operation of Law;  _provided_ ,
however, Gatherer shall be permitted to assign all or part of its obligation
hereunder to an Affiliate and each Producer shall be permitted to assign all
or part of its rights (excluding the Bossier Shale discount in  _Section
1.4_ which is not assignable) or obligations hereunder (i) to an Affiliate
that is a Credit-Worthy Assignee or (ii) to a purchaser who is a Credit-Worthy
Assignee of all or any portion of such Producers oil and natural gas
interests located in a "Dedicated Area" (as defined in the applicable
Gathering Agreements) provided that such purchaser assumes in all respects the
terms, conditions and obligations of such Producer set forth in this
Agreement (to the extent related to the rights and obligations assigned
hereunder) and the applicable Gathering Agreements (to the extent related to
the portion of such Producers oil and natural gas interests being assigned).
From and after any assignment permitted by this _Section 2.7_, the assignor
shall have no further liability under this Agreement except for liabilities
accruing before the time of such assignment, including the Shortfall Payments
attributable to such Producers time of ownership. Subject to this _Section
2.7_, this Agreement is binding upon, inures to the benefit of and is
enforceable by the Parties and their respective successors and permitted
assigns. As used herein the term " _Credit-Worthy Assignee_ " means a Person
that, or whose obligations are guaranteed by a Person that, has (a) if such

is equivalent to a Person that possesses such rating.

2.8 _Headings_. The headings used in this Agreement have been inserted for
convenience of reference only and do not define or limit the provisions
hereof.

2.9 _Invalid Provisions_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic and
legal substance of the Transactions is not affected in any adverse manner to
any of the Parties. Upon such determination that any term or other provision
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the
end that the Transactions are fulfilled to the extent possible.
