Section 2.2 of the Towers Perrin Disclosure Letter (each, a " _Potential
Class R Participant_") shall be eligible to make a Class R Election (as
defined below) with respect to the Merger Consideration that he or she will
receive in connection with the Towers Perrin Merger. The proxy card
accompanying the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus (as defined below) to be
mailed or otherwise delivered to the Potential Class R Participants will
include a designated section (the " _Class R Election Form_") wherein each
Potential Class R Participant may, but shall not be obligated to, elect to

inclusive) of the Towers Perrin Shares owned by such Potential Class R
Participant as Towers Perrin Class R Election Shares.

  

### 

  

### (b) Each Potential Class R Participant may irrevocably elect, with

" _Class R Election_"). A Class R Election will constitute a Valid Class R
Election only if it satisfies each of the following conditions: (i)
such election is made by a Potential Class R Participant pursuant to a Class
R Election Form that is properly completed and signed (or otherwise in
form acceptable for transfer on the books of Towers Perrin) and received by
the Exchange Agent at its office, by 11:00 p.m., New York City time on
the Business Day designated by Towers Perrin (and reasonably acceptable to
Watson Wyatt) in the Class R Election Form as the deadline for making a Class
R Election (the " _Class R Election Deadline_"), which deadline shall

must irrevocably commit (pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in
the Class R Election Form) to terminate his or her employment with Towers
Perrin as of the Effective Time (and, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not
be employed with Holding Company or either Surviving Corporation following
the Effective Time), or such other date as agreed by such Potential Class R
Participant, Towers Perrin and Watson Wyatt, and otherwise on such terms as
may be agreed by such Potential Class R Participant, Towers Perrin and Watson
Wyatt; and (iv) the Exchange Agent receives joint written instructions from
Towers Perrin and Watson Wyatt indicating that the foregoing conditions have
been satisfied with respect to such Class R Election.  Any Potential Class R
Participant who makes a Class R Election will be entitled to revoke such

Election Deadline, after which all Class R Elections will be final and
irrevocable.  The form and contents of the Class R Election Form shall
be subject to approval by Watson Wyatt, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. Potential Class R Participants who fail to
make a Valid Class R Election will not receive any Class R Shares and will
only receive Towers Perrin Stock Consideration as Towers Perrin Merger
Consideration.

  

###

R Election Shareholders_" ) constitutes ordinary compensation income to the
Class R Election Shareholders. In the event that Towers Perrin and Watson
Wyatt agree to treat a portion of such Towers Perrin Merger Consideration as
ordinary compensation income, Towers Perrin may in its sole discretion pay,
or elect to cause Holding Company to pay, an additional amount of cash to the
Class R Election Shareholders to cover some or all of the incremental tax
cost of such ordinary compensation income to the Class R Election
Shareholders, subject to Watson Wyatts consent which shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

Shares owned by such Class S Offeree as Towers Perrin Class S Election Shares
and the remainder of his or her Towers Perrin Shares will continue to be
Towers Perrin Stock Election Shares. The form and contents of the Class S

by the Exchange Agent at its office, by 11:00 p.m., New York City time on the
Business Day designated by Towers Perrin in the Class S Election Form (the "

### (d) _Further Rights in Towers Perrin and Watson Wyatt Capital Stock_.
The Merger Consideration issued or delivered upon conversion of any Towers
Perrin Shares or (as applicable) any Watson Wyatt Shares in accordance with

satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares. At and following the
Effective Time, (i) there shall be no further registration, on the stock
transfer books of Surviving Towers Perrin, of transfers of the Towers Perrin
Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii)

case of Dissenting Towers Perrin Shares.

  

### 

  

### (e) _Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, fractional shares of Restricted Holding
Company Stock shall be issued upon the delivery of a properly completed and
duly executed Towers Perrin Letter of Transmittal with respect to Towers
Perrin Book-Entry Shares, and fractional shares of Restricted Class A
Holding Company Stock shall be issued with respect to the Towers Perrin RSUs

of any dividend or distribution with respect to Restricted Holding Company
Stock or Restricted Class A Holding Company Stock, as applicable, shall be
payable on or with respect to any fractional share thereof, and
such fractional share interests shall entitle the owner thereof to such
voting and other rights as are set forth in the Amended and Restated Holding
Company Charter with respect to such shares. No certificates or scrip
representing fractional shares of Class A Holding Company Stock will be
issued upon the automatic conversion of shares of Class B Restricted Holding
Company Stock into shares of Class A Holding Company Stock, the exchange of
shares of Class B Restricted Holding Company Stock for shares of Class A
Holding Company Stock, or the vesting of shares of Restricted Class A Holding
Company Stock, but in lieu thereof each holder of such shares who would
otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share upon such event shall receive
from Holding Company (after aggregating all fractional shares of Restricted
Holding Company Stock or Class A Holding Company Stock to be received by such
holder in such event) an amount of cash (rounded down to the nearest whole
cent), without interest, equal to the product of such fraction multiplied by
the average per-share trading price of Class A Holding Company Stock for the
ten (10) consecutive trading days ending on the second trading day
immediately prior to the date of such conversion, exchange or vesting (as
reported in the New York City edition of The Wall Street Journal for each
such trading day, or, if not reported therein, any other authoritative source
to be selected by Holding Company). Such payment shall occur as soon
as reasonably practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if
any, to be paid to each person entitled to receive cash pursuant to the
immediately preceding sentence, and upon such payment, all of the fractional
shares to which such payment relates shall be cancelled.

  

### 

  

### (f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(and any interest or other income earned thereon) that remains undistributed
to the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares twelve (12) months after
the Effective Time shall be delivered to Holding Company, upon demand, and
any holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares who

  



        
   

  



  

### have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look
only to Holding Company (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other
similar laws), as general creditors thereof, for payment of the Merger
Consideration with respect to Towers Perrin Shares or (as applicable) Watson
Wyatt Shares formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share,
without interest (except for interest on Notes as set forth in Section
2.5(b)(viii)). Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the
Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 2.5(a) to pay for Dissenting Towers Perrin
Shares for which appraisal rights have been perfected as described in Section
2.7 shall be returned to Holding Company, upon demand.

  

### 

  

### (g) _No Liability_. None of the Parties, the Exchange Agent, or the
Surviving Corporations shall be liable to any Towers Perrin Shareholder or
Watson Wyatt Stockholder for any such shares of Restricted Holding Company
Stock (or any Notes or cash issued upon the automatic conversion of any Class
R Restricted Holding Company Stock or Class S Restricted Holding Company
Stock), Class A Holding Company Stock or Restricted Class A Holding Company
Stock, as the case may be (or dividends or distributions with respect
thereto) or cash from the Exchange Fund properly delivered to a public
official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If
any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall not have been exchanged prior to
two (2) years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier
date on which the related Merger Consideration would escheat to or become the
property of any Governmental Entity (as defined below)), any such Merger
Consideration in respect thereof shall, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, become the property of Holding Company, free and clear of all claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

  

### 

  

### (h) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Holding Company, the posting by such person of a bond, in such
reasonable amount as Holding Company may direct, as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Exchange Agent shall pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the Watson Wyatt Merger Consideration payable in respect of the
Watson Wyatt Shares formerly represented by such Certificate and any interest
payments, dividends or other distributions to which the holders thereof are
entitled pursuant to _Section 2.5(c)_, in each case, without any interest
thereon.

  

### 

  

### (i) _Investment_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in
the Exchange Fund as directed by Holding Company, on a daily basis, and any
interest or other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to
Holding Company, upon demand.

  

### 

  

Section 2.6 _Withholding Rights_. Holding Company, Surviving Towers Perrin,
the Custodian, the Trustee and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any holder of Towers
Perrin Shares or otherwise pursuant to this Agreement, such amounts as
Holding Company, Surviving Towers Perrin, the Custodian, the Trustee and the
Exchange Agent are required to deduct and withhold with respect to
such Person pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under
any applicable provision of U.S. federal, state, local or foreign Law;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that no withholding with respect to U.S. federal,
state or local Taxes shall be permitted of or from any non-cash consideration
payable with respect to Towers Perrin Shares unless (i) such amounts are
mutually determined to be compensation income pursuant to Section 2.2(c), or
(ii) the Watson Wyatt

  



        
   

  



  

Board determines in good faith (based on advice of counsel) that as a result
of a change in U.S. Law occurring after the date hereof, U.S. federal, state
or local taxes are required to be withheld from any such non-
cash consideration and (iii) Watson Wyatt delivers a written notice to
Towers Perrin promptly upon becoming aware of such change in U.S. Law and in
no event later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date (a "
_Withholding Notice_ "), signed by an officer of Watson Wyatt including a
certification that the Watson Wyatt Board has made such determination, and
including a good faith estimate of the aggregate dollar amount of such
withholding and, if such withholding obligation applies with respect to less
than all holders of Towers Perrin Shares, identifying, if available, the
specific holders and the estimated amounts to be withheld with respect
thereto. In the event that Watson Wyatt delivers a Withholding Notice to
Towers Perrin, Towers Perrin shall have the right to terminate this Agreement
at any time, and upon such termination this Agreement shall forthwith become
void and have no further effect and the Mergers may be abandoned with no
liability or obligation on the part of Towers Perrin or Pennsylvania Merger
Sub for any fees and expenses.  Holding Company, Surviving Watson Wyatt, the
Custodian, the Trustee and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any holder of Watson
Wyatt Shares or otherwise pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as Holding
Company, Surviving Watson Wyatt, the Custodian, the Trustee and the Exchange
Agent are required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under any applicable provision of U.S. federal, state, local or
foreign Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the
appropriate taxing authority by Holding Company, Surviving Towers Perrin,
Surviving Watson Wyatt, the Custodian, the Trustee or the Exchange Agent,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made.

  



  

Section 2.7 _Dissenters  Rights_.

  



  

### (a) In accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL, no appraisal rights shall
be available to holders of Watson Wyatt Shares in connection with the Watson
Wyatt Merger.

  

### 

  

### (b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
Towers Perrin Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time that are held by any holder who has not voted in favor of the
Towers Perrin Merger and who has complied with all of the relevant provisions
of Section 1574 of the PBCL (each, a " _Dissenting Towers Perrin Shareholder_
") shall not be converted into the right to receive Towers Perrin Merger
Consideration, and such Towers Perrin Shares (the " _Dissenting Towers Perrin
Shares_ ") shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the payments
set forth in this Section 2.7, unless and until such Dissenting Towers Perrin
Shareholder shall have failed to perfect, or shall have effectively withdrawn
or lost, his or her rights to appraisal under the PBCL (any of the foregoing,
a " _Dissent Failure_ "). Towers Perrin shall give Holding Company and Watson
Wyatt prompt notice of any demands for appraisal of Towers Perrin Shares,
attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments
served pursuant to the PBCL relating to rights to appraisal, and Holding
Company and Watson Wyatt shall have the right to participate in and direct,
together with Towers Perrin, all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
such demands for appraisal under the PBCL. Towers Perrin shall not, without
the prior written consent of Watson Wyatt (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed), make any payment with respect to, settle
or offer to settle, or approve any withdrawal of any such demands.

  



        
   

  



  

### (c) The shares of Restricted Holding Company Stock that each Dissenting
Towers Perrin Shareholder would, in the absence of his or her dissent, have
been entitled to receive under Section 2.1(a) (collectively, the "
_Dissenting Share Merger Consideration_ ") shall be held by the Exchange
Agent pending a final resolution of the underlying dissent, and released as
follows:

  

### 

  

#### (i) upon a Dissent Failure with respect to such Dissenting Towers Perrin
Shares, all such Dissenting Towers Perrin Shares shall thereupon be converted
into and become exchangeable only for the right to receive the Dissenting
Share Merger Consideration held by the Exchange Agent with respect thereto;
and

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) upon payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Towers Perrin
Shares, as determined in the underlying dissent proceeding pursuant to
Section 1579 of the PBCL, or as agreed between Towers Perrin and such
Dissenting Towers Perrin Shareholder with respect to such Dissenting Towers
Perrin Shares (subject to Watson Wyatts consent, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed), the Dissenting Share Merger Consideration
held by the Exchange Agent with respect to such Dissenting Towers Perrin
Shares shall be returned to Holding Company.

execution of this Agreement (the " _Towers Perrin Disclosure Letter_ ") (it
being agreed that disclosure of any information in a particular section or
subsection of the Towers Perrin Disclosure Letter shall be deemed disclosure
with respect to any other section or subsection of this Agreement to which
the relevance of such information is readily apparent on its face), Towers
Perrin represents and warrants to Watson Wyatt as follows:

  



  

Section 3.1 _Organization, Standing and Power_.

  



  

### (a) Each of Towers Perrin and its Significant Subsidiaries (as defined
below) (i) is an entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
(with respect to jurisdictions that recognize such concept) under the Laws of
the jurisdiction of its organization, (ii) has all requisite corporate or
similar power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to
carry on its business as now being conducted and (iii) is duly qualified or
licensed to do business

  



        
   

  



  

### and is in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize
such concept) in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the
ownership, leasing or operation of its properties makes such qualification or
licensing necessary, except in the case of clause (iii), where the failure to
be so qualified or licensed or in good standing, individually or in the
aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Towers
Perrin Material Adverse Effect. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Towers
Perrin Material Adverse Effect_ " means any event, change, circumstance,
occurrence, effect or state of facts that (A) is or would reasonably be
expected to be materially adverse to the business, assets, liabilities,
condition (financial or otherwise) or results of operations of Towers Perrin
and its Subsidiaries (as defined below), taken as a whole or (B) prevents the
performance by Towers Perrin of its obligations under this Agreement or
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that a Towers Perrin Material Adverse Effect shall not include
any event, change, circumstance, occurrence, effect or state of facts
reflecting or resulting from (1) any event, change, circumstance, occurrence,
effect or state of facts generally affecting the human capital, risk and
financial services, reinsurance or insurance consulting services industries,
(2) any event, change, circumstance, occurrence, effect or state of facts
generally affecting the economy or the financial, securities or credit
markets, interest rates or political or regulatory conditions, in the United
States or any other jurisdiction in which Towers Perrin and its Subsidiaries
have substantial business operations, (3) any outbreak or escalation of
hostilities or acts of war or terrorism, (4) changes in Law or GAAP, (5) any
change attributable to the negotiation, execution, announcement or pendency
of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, including any
litigation resulting therefrom, and (6) any failure by Towers Perrin to meet
internal projections, forecasts or revenue or earnings predictions, in and of
itself; _provided_ , that, with respect to clauses (1), (2), (3) and (4), the
impact of such event, change, circumstances, occurrence, effect or state of
facts is not disproportionately adverse to Towers Perrin and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, relative to the adverse impact on Watson
Wyatt and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

  

### 

  

### (b) Towers Perrin has previously made available to Watson Wyatt true and
complete copies of Towers Perrins articles of incorporation (the " _Towers

documents) of each of its Significant Subsidiaries, in each case as amended
through the date of this Agreement, and each as so delivered is in full force
and effect. Towers Perrin is not in violation of any provision of the Towers
Perrin Charter or the Towers Perrin Bylaws. Towers Perrin has made available

Perrin in accordance with its terms, except to the extent that enforceability

### (b) The Towers Perrin Board, at a meeting duly called and held, duly

services or products to any client), except in the case of clauses (ii)
and (iii) above for any such conflict, breach, violation, default, loss,

Section 3.6 _Financial Statements_.

  



  

### (a) True and complete copies of the audited consolidated balance sheet

the reports thereon of Towers Perrins independent auditors (collectively
referred to as the " _Towers Perrin Financial Statements_ ") are attached

Towers Perrin Financial Statements (i) are correct and complete in all
material respects and have been prepared in accordance with the books and
records of Towers Perrin and its Subsidiaries; (ii) have been prepared in
accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ("
_GAAP_ ") applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods indicated

in all material respects, the consolidated financial position, results of
operations and cash flows of Towers Perrin and its Subsidiaries as at
the respective dates thereof and for the respective periods indicated
therein, except as otherwise noted therein. The unaudited condensed

the audited consolidated balance sheet of Towers Perrin and its Subsidiaries
as at December 31, 2008 (such balance sheet, together with all related notes
and schedules thereto, the " _Towers Perrin Balance Sheet_ "), neither Towers
Perrin nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability or obligation of any
nature, whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise, whether known or
unknown, whether due or to become due and whether or not required by GAAP to
be recorded or reflected in a consolidated balance sheet of Towers Perrin and
its Subsidiaries or disclosed in the notes thereto, except for liabilities
and obligations (i) arising out of or in connection with this Agreement and

Perrin Material Adverse Effect.

  

### 

  

### (c) The books of account and financial records of Towers Perrin and its

performed for the year ended December 31, 2008) there are no
significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the design or operation of
the internal controls over financial reporting of Towers Perrin or any of its
Subsidiaries which are reasonably likely to adversely affect in any material
respect Towers Perrins ability to record, process, summarize, and report
financial information. The officers of Towers Perrin have identified for
Towers Perrins auditors and the Towers Perrin Board any fraud, whether or
not material, which is known to the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial

other employees who have a significant role in Towers Perrins internal
controls over financial reporting.

Towers Perrin, been revoked.

the amount or validity of which is being contested in good faith by
appropriate proceedings, (b) mechanics, workmens, repairmens,
warehousemens and carriers Liens arising in the ordinary course of business
of Towers Perrin or such Subsidiary consistent with past practice and (c) any
such matters of record, Liens and other imperfections of title that do not,
individually or in the aggregate, materially impair the continued ownership,
use and operation of the assets to which

  



        
   

  



  

they relate in the business of Towers Perrin and its Subsidiaries
as currently conducted (" _Permitted Liens_ ").  This Section 3.7 does not

the Registration Statement or (ii) the Class S Election Offer (if any) will,
at the time of mailing to stockholders of Watson Wyatt and/or Towers Perrin
(as applicable), at the Class R Election Deadline, at the Class S Election
Deadline (if applicable), and at the time of the Towers Perrin Shareholder

arbitration, investigation, inquiry, grievance or other proceeding (each, an
" _Action_ ") pending or, to the knowledge of Towers Perrin, threatened in

respective properties or assets, or any present or former officer, director
or employee of Towers Perrin or any of its Subsidiaries (in such individuals
capacity as such)

  



        
   

  



  

that (a) was commenced by a Governmental Entity, (b) seeks material
injunctive or other non-monetary relief or (c) if determined adversely to
Towers Perrin or any of its Subsidiaries would reasonably be expected to have
a Towers Perrin Material Adverse Effect; provided, that solely for purposes
of this Section 3.10, "Action" shall not include any individual employment
claim in which the total damages asserted against Towers Perrin and its
Subsidiaries do not exceed $500,000. Neither Towers Perrin nor any of
its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective properties or assets is subject
to any outstanding judgment, order, injunction, rule or decree of
any Governmental Entity that would, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Towers Perrin Material Adverse Effect. To
the knowledge of Towers Perrin, there is no Action pending or threatened
against Towers Perrin or any of its Subsidiaries that seeks to prevent,

Perrin Material Adverse Effect. None of Towers Perrin or any of its
Significant Subsidiaries has received, since December 31, 2008, a notice or
other written communication alleging or relating to a possible material
violation of any Law applicable to their businesses, operations, properties

operating certificates, franchises, orders and approvals of all Governmental
Entities (collectively, " _Towers Perrin Permits_ ") necessary for them to
own, lease or operate their properties and assets and to carry on their
businesses and operations as now conducted, except for any Towers Perrin
Permits the absence of which would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Towers Perrin Material Adverse Effect.
All Towers Perrin Permits are in full force and effect, except where the
failure to be in full force and effect would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Towers Perrin Material Adverse
Effect.

## 

  

### (a) Section 3.12(a) of the Towers Perrin Disclosure Letter sets forth a
true and complete list of each material "employee benefit plan" (within the

### 

  

### respect to any Acquisition Proposal and (B) not terminate, waive, amend,

agreement to which it or any of its Subsidiaries or Representatives is a
party with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, and to enforce the provisions

each Person, if any, that has heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement
within the six months prior to the date of this Agreement in connection with
its consideration of any Acquisition Proposal to return or destroy all
confidential information or data heretofore furnished to any Person by or on
behalf of it or any of its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
at any time following the date of this Agreement and prior to obtaining the
Towers Perrin Shareholder Approval (with respect to Towers Perrin) or the
Watson Wyatt Stockholder Approval (with respect to Watson Wyatt), (1) Towers
Perrin or Watson Wyatt, as applicable, receives a written Acquisition
Proposal that its respective board of directors believes in good faith to be
bona fide, (2) such Acquisition Proposal was unsolicited and did not
otherwise result from a breach of this Section 5.2, (3) the Towers Perrin
Board or the Watson Wyatt Board, as applicable, determines in good faith
(after consultation with its outside counsel and its financial advisor) that
such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a
Superior Proposal and (4) the Towers Perrin Board or the Watson Wyatt Board,
as applicable, determines in good faith (after consultation with outside
counsel) that the failure to take the actions referred to in the following
clause (x) or (y) would constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law (provided, that in making such determination Towers Perrin may
consider the factors set forth in Section 1715 of the PBCL), then Towers
Perrin or Watson Wyatt, as applicable, may (x) furnish information with
respect to itself and its Subsidiaries to the Person making such Acquisition
Proposal pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement containing terms
substantially similar to, and no less favorable to Towers Perrin or Watson
Wyatt, as applicable, than, those set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement;
_provided_ , that any non-public information provided to any Person given
such access shall have been previously provided to Watson Wyatt or Towers
Perrin, as applicable, or shall be provided to Watson Wyatt or Towers Perrin,
as applicable, prior to or concurrently with the time it is provided to such
Person and (y) participate in discussions or negotiations with the Person
making such Acquisition Proposal regarding such Acquisition Proposal;
provided, further, that solely for purposes of this sentence, all references
to "15%" in the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be replaced by

advisability by the Towers Perrin Board, the Watson Wyatt Board or any
committee thereof of this Agreement, the Mergers, the Amended and Restated
Holding Company Charter or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby,
(B) adopt, approve, recommend, endorse or otherwise declare advisable the
adoption of any Acquisition Proposal or (C) resolve, agree or propose to take
any such actions (each such action set forth in this Section 5.2(b)(i)
being referred to herein as an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") or (ii)
cause or permit Towers Perrin or Watson Wyatt, as applicable, to enter into
any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle,
acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option agreement, joint venture
agreement, partnership agreement or other similar agreement (each, an "
_Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ") constituting or related to, or which
is intended to or is reasonably likely to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal
or (iii) resolve, agree or

  



        
   

  

### 

  

### propose to take any such actions.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any
time prior to obtaining the Towers Perrin Shareholder Approval or the Watson
Wyatt Stockholder Approval, as applicable, the Towers Perrin Board or the
Watson Wyatt Board, as applicable, may make an Adverse Recommendation Change
in response to a Superior Proposal if the Towers Perrin Board or the Watson
Wyatt Board, as applicable, determines in good faith (after consultation with
outside counsel) that the failure to do so would result in a breach of its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law (provided, that in making such
determination Towers Perrin may consider the factors set forth in Section
1715 of the PBCL), taking into account all adjustments to the terms of this
Agreement that may be offered by Watson Wyatt or Towers Perrin, as
applicable, pursuant to this _Section 5.2(b)_;  _provided_ , _however_ ,
that (1) no Adverse Recommendation Change may be made until after the third
(3rd) Business Day following Watson Wyatts or Towers Perrins, as
applicable, receipt of written notice from Towers Perrin or Watson Wyatt, as
applicable, advising Watson Wyatt or Towers Perrin, as applicable, that the
Towers Perrin Board or the Watson Wyatt Board, as applicable, intends to make
an Adverse Recommendation Change and specifying the reasons therefor,
including the terms and conditions of, and the identity of any Person making,
the Superior Proposal that is the basis of the proposed action by the Towers
Perrin Board or the Watson Wyatt Board, as applicable, and contemporaneously
furnishing a copy of the applicable Alternative Acquisition Agreement and any
other relevant transaction documents (it being understood and agreed that any
amendment to the financial terms or any other material term of such Superior
Proposal shall require a new written notice by Towers Perrin or Watson Wyatt,
as applicable, and a new three (3) Business Day period), (2) during such
three (3) Business Day period, Towers Perrin or Watson Wyatt, as applicable,
shall, and shall cause its financial and legal advisors to, negotiate with
Watson Wyatt or Towers Perrin, as applicable, in good faith (to the extent
Watson Wyatt or Towers Perrin, as applicable, seeks to negotiate) to make
such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as
would enable the Towers Perrin Board or the Watson Wyatt Board, as
applicable, to proceed with its recommendation of this Agreement and not make
an Adverse Recommendation Change and (3) neither Towers Perrin nor Watson
Wyatt shall make an Adverse Recommendation Change if, prior to the expiration
of such three (3) Business Day period, the other party agrees to adjust the
terms and conditions of this Agreement such that the Towers Perrin Board or
the Watson Wyatt Board, as applicable, determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside counsel and its financial advisor) that its
fiduciary duties do not require it to make an Adverse Recommendation Change.

  

### 

  

### (c) In addition to the obligations of the Parties set forth in Sections
5.2(a) and (b), each of Watson Wyatt and Towers Perrin promptly, and in any
event within twenty-four (24) hours) after receipt, shall advise the other
party in writing in the event Towers Perrin or Watson Wyatt, as applicable,
or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Representatives receives (i) any
Acquisition Proposal or indication by any Person that it is considering
making an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) any request for information, discussion
or negotiation that could reasonably be expected to lead to or that
contemplates an Acquisition Proposal or (iii) any inquiry, proposal or offer
that is reasonably likely to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, in each case
together with the terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, request,
inquiry, proposal or offer and the identity of the Person making any such
Acquisition Proposal, request, inquiry, proposal or offer, and shall furnish
such other party with a copy of such Acquisition Proposal (or, where such
Acquisition Proposal is not in writing, with a description of the material
terms and conditions thereof) and any related available documentation
or correspondence. Each of Watson Wyatt and

  



        
   

  

### 

  

### Towers Perrin shall keep the other party informed (orally and in writing)
in all material respects on a timely basis of the status and details
(including, within twenty-four (24) hours after the occurrence of any
amendment, modification, development, discussion or negotiation) of any such
Acquisition Proposal, request, inquiry, proposal or offer, including
furnishing copies of any written inquiries, correspondence and draft
documentation, and written summaries of any material oral inquiries or
discussions. Without limiting any of the foregoing, each of Watson Wyatt and
Towers Perrin shall promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours)
notify the other party orally and in writing if it determines to begin
providing information or to engage in discussions or negotiations concerning
an Acquisition Proposal pursuant to Section 5.2(a) or (b) and shall in no
event begin providing such information or engaging in such discussions or
negotiations prior to providing such notice.

  

### 

  

### (d) Each of Watson Wyatt and Towers Perrin shall use its reasonable best
efforts to promptly inform its and its Significant Subsidiaries respective
Representatives of the obligations undertaken in this Section 5.2. Each of
Watson Wyatt and Towers Perrin agrees that any material violation of the
restrictions set forth in this Section 5.2 by any Representative of Towers
Perrin, Watson Wyatt or any of their respective Significant Subsidiaries,
whether or not such Person is purporting to act on behalf of such party or
any of its Subsidiaries or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a material breach
of this Agreement by Towers Perrin or Watson Wyatt, as the case may be.

  

### 

  

### (e) Neither Watson Wyatt nor Towers Perrin shall, and shall cause its
respective Subsidiaries not to, enter into any confidentiality or other
agreement with any Person subsequent to the date of this Agreement that would
restrict such partys ability to comply with any of the terms of this Section
5.2, and represents that neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to
any such agreement.

business in any jurisdiction(s), which assets and businesses, in the
aggregate, generated more than $150,000,000 of the combined consolidated
revenues of Towers Perrin and its Subsidiaries and Watson Wyatt and its

reorganization" within the meaning of section 1.368-2(g) of the income tax
regulations promulgated under the Code. From and after the date of this

action or failure to act could prevent the Mergers from qualifying as an
exchange under Section 351 of the Code or as reorganizations within the
meaning of Section 368 of the Code other than, in the case of the Towers
Perrin Merger, as a result of the failure to satisfy the Control Test.
 Following the Effective Time, neither the Surviving Corporations nor any of
their respective Affiliates knowingly shall take any action, cause any action
to be taken, fail to take any action, or cause any action to fail to
be taken, which action or failure to act could prevent the Mergers from
qualifying as an exchange under Section 351 of the Code or as reorganizations
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code other than, in the case
of the Towers Perrin Merger, as a result of the failure to satisfy the
Control Test.

### (b) As of the date hereof, Towers Perrin does not know of any reason (i)
why it would not be able to deliver to counsel to Towers Perrin and Watson
Wyatt, at the date of the legal opinions referred to below, certificates

date of such opinions or (ii) why counsel to Watson Wyatt would not be able
to deliver the opinion required by Section 6.2(f). Watson Wyatt will deliver

### 

  

### (d) The Parties agree that, for tax purposes, the payment of the Class R
Cash Consideration, Class R Note Consideration and Class S
Cash Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_ shall be treated as having
been made in exchange for Towers Perrin Shares pursuant to and as part of the
Towers Perrin Merger in a single integrated transaction, and not as separate
transactions. The Parties agree to take no position contrary thereto unless
required by applicable Law.

  

###

Agreement shall give Towers Perrin, directly or indirectly, the right to
control or direct the operations of Watson Wyatt or shall give Watson Wyatt,

### (a) Towers Perrin shall, during the period following the date hereof and
prior to the Effective Time, issue Towers Perrin RSUs to such of its and its
Subsidiaries employees as Towers Perrin determines in its sole discretion.
Each Towers Perrin RSU will entitle the holder thereof to the
consideration specified in the underlying Towers Perrin RSU award agreement
(each, a " _Towers Perrin RSU Award Agreement_ "), upon a merger or "change
of control" transaction involving Towers Perrin (a " _Towers Perrin
RSU Triggering Event_ ").  The Towers Perrin Merger will constitute a Towers
Perrin RSU Triggering Event. The Towers Perrin RSUs will be non-
transferable, and the Towers Perrin RSUs of any holder whose employment with
Towers Perrin or its Subsidiaries terminates for any reason prior to a Towers
Perrin RSU Triggering Event shall be automatically forfeited and cancelled
upon such termination.

  

### 

  

### (b) The Guaranteed Towers Perrin Awards provide for the payment of
consideration, upon a Towers Perrin RSU Triggering Event, with a fair market
value equal to the guaranteed dollar amount set forth in the underlying award
letter (the " _Guaranteed RSU Amount_ "). None of the Guaranteed Towers
Perrin Awards outstanding on the date hereof shall be paid in
cash, notwithstanding that such award agreements may allow for the payment
of consideration in the form of cash. On or after the second trading day
prior to the Closing Date, at any time prior to the Effective Time, Towers
Perrin shall issue to each Guaranteed Towers Perrin Award Holder a number of
Guaranteed Towers Perrin RSUs equal to (A) the Guaranteed RSU Amount set
forth in the award letter for his or her Guaranteed Towers Perrin Award,
divided by (B) the product of (x) the Final Watson Wyatt Stock Price
multiplied by (y) the Final Exchange Ratio.

  

### 

  

### (c) Concurrently with its issuance of the Towers Perrin RSUs, Towers
Perrin shall furnish to each Towers Perrin RSU Holder a Transaction Award
Agreement (the " _Transaction Award Agreement_ ").  Each Towers Perrin RSU
Holder shall, as a condition to receiving any shares of Restricted Class A
Holding Company Stock pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(iv) or Section 2.1(a)(v),
deliver to Towers Perrin, at any time prior to the Effective Time, a properly
executed Transaction Award Agreement, together with such additional
documentation and information as Towers Perrin may request in its sole
discretion. At or before the Effective Time, Holding Company shall
countersign each Transaction Award Agreement that is submitted in accordance
with the immediately preceding sentence and deliver a countersigned original
of each to the applicable Towers Perrin RSU Holder.

  

### 

  

### (d) All shares of Restricted Class A Holding Company Stock received by
Towers Perrin RSU Holders as Towers Perrin Merger Consideration will be
subject to the same terms and conditions, including the vesting, forfeiture
and reallocation provisions described in Section 5.15, except that none of
the shares received with respect to any Guaranteed Towers Perrin RSU will be
forfeited if such holder is terminated without "Cause" before the first
anniversary of the Effective Time, as described more fully in Section 5.15(f).

  

### 

  

### (e) The number of shares of Restricted Class A Holding Company Stock to
be issued as Towers Perrin Merger Consideration with respect to each Towers

rata adjustment, as set forth in

  



        
   

  

### 

  

### Section 2.1(a)(iv), to ensure that the total number of shares of
Restricted Class A Holding Company Stock issued as Towers Perrin Merger
Consideration with respect to the Towers Perrin RSUs (including all
Guaranteed Towers Perrin RSUs) will equal 10% of the total shares of
Holding Company stock that comprise the Towers Perrin Merger Consideration.

  

### 

  

### (f) The documentation used to effect the issuance of Towers Perrin RSUs,
including the Towers Perrin RSU Award Agreements and the Transaction Award
Agreements, shall be prepared by Towers Perrin in its discretion, subject to
Watson Wyatts consent which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

  

### 

  

### (g) Subject to Watson Wyatts consent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed, Towers Perrin shall (i) designate the
Custodian at any time prior to the Effective Time and (ii) enter into such
documentation with the Custodian and Holding Company as Towers Perrin deems
necessary or appropriate for the Custodian to hold the shares of Restricted
Class A Holding Company Stock and carry out the intent of this Section 5.14
(all such documentation, collectively, the " _Custodian Agreement_ ").

  

### 

  

### (h) Promptly following the third (3rd) anniversary of the Effective Time,
Holding Company shall prepare and cause to be filed with the SEC a
registration statement on Form S-3 or, if at such time Holding Company is not
permitted for any reason to register such shares on a Form S-3, a Form S-1
(such registration statement, including any necessary amendments or
supplements thereto, the " _Forfeited Share Registration Statement_ ") to
register under the Securities Act the reallocation of all of the Forfeited
Towers Perrin RSU Shares (as defined below) by the Custodian pursuant to
Section 5.15(d). Holding Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
respond to any comments of the SEC, cause the Forfeited Share
Registration Statement to be declared effective under the Securities Act as
soon as reasonably practicable after filing, and cause the Forfeited Share
Registration Statement to continue to be effective until the Custodian
completes such reallocation of all Forfeited Towers Perrin RSU Shares.
 Holding Company shall cooperate with the Custodian to achieve the intent of
the Parties as set forth in this Section 5.14, consistent with applicable
Laws.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.14(h), if
the reallocation contemplated by Section 5.14(d) can be accomplished in a
timely manner pursuant to a transaction that Holding Company reasonably
determines is exempt from, or not subject to, the registration requirements
of the Securities Act, then Holding Company shall not be required to file a
Forfeited Share Registration Statement.

  

### 

  

### (i) Upon and at all times following the Effective Time, Holding Company
shall assume and perform all of Towers Perrins obligations under the
Transaction Award Agreements, in each case in accordance with the terms and
conditions thereof.

### Section 5.15 _Vesting, Forfeiture and Reallocation of Restricted Class A
Holding Company Stock_.

provide that all shares of Restricted Class A Holding Company Stock shall be
subject to vesting and forfeiture in accordance with this Section 5.15.

  



        
   

  

### 

  

### (b) The shares of Restricted Class A Holding Company Stock shall be
subject to vesting, and shall automatically vest with respect to one-third of
the shares of Restricted Class A Holding Company Stock issued to each Towers
Perrin RSU Holder on each of the first three (3) anniversaries of the
Effective Time, in each case provided that such Towers Perrin RSU Holder is
then employed by Holding Company or a Subsidiary thereof.

  

### 

  

### (c) With respect to any Towers Perrin RSU Holder whose employment with
Holding Company or a Subsidiary of Holding Company is terminated, all of his
or her shares of Restricted Class A Holding Company Stock that have not
vested (or with respect to which the vesting does not then accelerate) as of
the date of such termination shall be, subject to Section 5.15(e),
automatically forfeited to the Custodian upon such termination, without any
action by such Towers Perrin RSU Holder (such shares, the " _Forfeited Towers
Perrin RSU Shares_ ").

  

### 

  

### (d) Promptly following the effectiveness of the Forfeited Share
Registration Statement (if required), the Custodian will reallocate all of
the Forfeited Towers Perrin RSU Shares then held by it, together with all
dividends (without interest) that it has received with respect to such
shares, to all of the record holders of Towers Perrin Shares who received
Towers Perrin Merger Consideration, to each such holder pro rata
in accordance with his or her respective ownership of the Towers Perrin
Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. During the period
from the Effective Time to such reallocation, all of the Forfeited Shares
shall be voted by the Custodian, on all matters submitted to a vote of the
holders of Class A Holding Company Stock, proportionally with the votes cast
by holders of the issued and outstanding shares of Class B Restricted Holding
Company Stock.

  

### 

  

### (e) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.15:

  

### 

  

#### (i) With respect to any Person who receives shares of Restricted Class A
Holding Company Stock with respect to Guaranteed Towers Perrin RSUs, in the
event that such Persons employment with Holding Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is terminated without Cause (as defined below), none of the
shares of Restricted Class A Holding Company Stock then held by such Person
will be forfeited, and all such shares of Restricted Class A Holding Company
Stock will automatically become fully vested upon such termination, and

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) With respect to any Person who receives shares of Restricted Class
A Holding Company Stock with respect to Towers Perrin RSUs that are not

be forfeited, and all such shares of Restricted Class A Holding Company
Stock will automatically become fully vested upon such termination and (B)
in the event that such Persons employment with Holding Company or any of

employment with, or a termination for Cause of any Person by Holding Company
or any of its Subsidiaries.

  

#### 

  

### (f) Solely for purposes of this Section 5.15, the term " _Cause_ " shall
mean, with respect to any Person, any of the following, _provided_ , that

any Person with respect to the termination of his or her employment with
Holding Company or any of its Subsidiaries:

  

### 

  

#### (i) Such Persons commission of theft, embezzlement, any other act of

of such violation;

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) Such Persons conviction of, or pleading guilty or
_nolo contendere_ to, a felony or to any lesser crime having as

his duties amounting to willful misconduct; or

  

####

 _Re: Voting Agreement_

  



  

Dear Towers Perrin Shareholders,

  



  

As you know, we are finalizing an agreement (the "Merger Agreement") under
which Watson Wyatt Worldwide, Inc. ("Watson Wyatt") and Towers, Perrin,
Forster and Crosby, Inc. ("Towers Perrin") will combine their businesses to
form a new holding company (the "Holding Company", and such transaction the
"Transaction"). As a precursor to both parties executing the Merger
Agreement, directors and executive officers of both companies are being asked
to agree to support the Transaction in their capacities as shareholders. We
ask each of you to sign a copy of this letter where indicated, agreeing
with the understanding that Watson Wyatt will rely on these covenants in
agreeing to enter into the Merger Agreement:

  



  

1. You will vote (or cause to be voted) any Towers Perrin shares you now own, and any additional shares you own at the time you cast your vote, in favor of the Transaction and adoption of the Merger Agreement at any meeting or written consent of Towers Perrins shareholders at which approval is proposed, and will vote against any proposal to approve a competing transaction or any other action which could reasonably be expected to impede, interfere with, delay, postpone or adversely affect the Transaction. Until this letter terminates pursuant to paragraph 4 below and except as contemplated hereby or in accordance with Article VI of the Amended and Restated Bylaws of Towers Perrin, you will not transfer any shares of Towers Perrin stock you currently own, either beneficially or of record.

  



  

2. You will not solicit, knowingly encourage or facilitate any inquiry, proposal or offer with respect to a transaction which competes with the Transaction or could reasonably be expected to lead to a competing transaction or impede, interfere with, delay or adversely affect the Transaction.

  



  

3. You are agreeing to the terms of this letter solely in your capacity as a Towers Perrin shareholder, and nothing in this letter restricts or limits your ability to take any action in your capacity as a director or executive officer of Towers Perrin to the extent specifically permitted by the Merger Agreement.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, we agree that you are a director and/or an executive officer of Towers Perrin, and that in your capacity as a director and/or an executive officer you may, in the exercise of your legal duties, take actions that would violate this letter if such actions were taken in your capacity as a Towers Perrin shareholder. We agree that no such action taken in your capacity as a director and/or an executive officer of Towers Perrin will be deemed to violate this letter.

  



  

4. This letter shall terminate on the earliest of (a) the effective time of the Transaction, (b) the termination of the Merger Agreement, (c) written notice of termination of this letter by Watson Wyatt to you and (d) with respect to particular shareholder and its Truman Shares (as defined in the Merger Agreement), the date, if any, on which Towers Perrin repurchases such shares pursuant to Article VI of the Amended and Restated Bylaws of Towers Perrin; provided, that (1) paragraph 6 shall survive the termination of this letter and (2) any liability incurred by any party to this letter arising from a breach of this letter prior to such termination shall survive termination of this letter.

  



  

5. You authorize the Holding Company, Watson Wyatt and Towers Perrin to publish and disclose in any disclosure required by the Securities and Exchange Commission and in the joint proxy statement/prospectus or registration 

        
   

  



  

statement your identity and ownership of the Towers Perrin shares and the
nature of your obligations under this letter agreement.

  



  

6. This letter agreement and all disputes or controversies arising out of or relating to this letter agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the internal laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, without regard to the laws of any other jurisdiction that might be applied because of the conflicts of laws principles of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

  



  

We look forward to this exciting opportunity for our two firms, and
appreciate if you could sign and return a copy of this letter to acknowledge
your agreement with its terms.

 _Re: Voting Agreement_

  



  

Dear Watson Wyatt Stockholder,

  



  

As you know, we are finalizing an agreement (the "Merger Agreement") under
which Watson Wyatt Worldwide, Inc. ("Watson Wyatt") and Towers, Perrin,
Forster and Crosby, Inc. ("Towers Perrin") will combine their businesses to
form a new holding company (the "Transaction"). As a precursor to both

both companies are being asked to agree to support the Transaction in their
capacities as stockholders. We ask you to sign a copy of this letter where
indicated, agreeing with the understanding that Towers Perrin will rely on

You will vote (or cause to be voted) any Watson Wyatt shares you now own, and any additional shares you own at the time you cast your vote in favor of the Transaction and adoption of the Merger Agreement at any meeting or written consent of Watson Wyatts stockholders at which approval is proposed, and will vote against any proposal to approve a competing transaction or any other action which could reasonably be expected to impede, interfere with, delay, postpone or adversely affect the Transaction. Until this letter terminates pursuant to paragraph 4 below, you will not transfer any shares of Watson Wyatt stock you currently own, either beneficially or of record. This prohibition does not apply to the transfer of shares that you acquire after the date of this letter (other than shares acquired as a result of a stock split, stock dividend or similar transaction), including any shares issued after the date of this letter under outstanding equity compensation awards.  You may transfer any Watson Wyatt shares you currently own or acquire after the date of this letter to members of your immediate family, trusts for the benefit of immediate family members, or to your executors, administrators, testamentary trustees, legatees and beneficiaries in the event of your death, as long as the transferees agree to the terms of this letter.

  



  

2. You will not solicit, knowingly encourage or facilitate any inquiry, proposal or offer with respect to a transaction which competes with the Transaction or could reasonably be expected to lead to a competing transaction or impede, interfere with, delay or adversely affect the Transaction.

  



  

3. You are agreeing to the terms of this letter solely in your capacity as a Watson Wyatt stockholder, and nothing in this letter restricts or limits your ability to take any action in your capacity as a director or executive officer of Watson Wyatt to the extent specifically permitted by the Merger Agreement.

We agree that no such action taken in your capacity as a director and/or an executive officer of Watson Wyatt will be deemed to violate this letter.

  



  

4. This letter shall terminate on the earliest of (a) the effective time of the Transaction, (b) the termination of the Merger Agreement and (c) written notice of termination of this letter by Towers Perrin to you; provided, that (1) paragraphs 6 and 7 shall survive the termination of this letter and (2) any liability incurred by any party to this letter arising from a breach of this letter prior to such termination shall survive termination of this letter.

        
   

  



  

5. You authorize Towers Watson and Co., Watson Wyatt and Towers Perrin to publish and disclose in any disclosure required by the SEC and in the joint proxy statement/prospectus or registration statement your identity and ownership of the Watson Wyatt shares and the nature of your obligations under this letter agreement.

  



  

6. This letter agreement and all disputes or controversies arising out of or relating to this letter agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the internal laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to the laws of any other jurisdiction that might be applied because of the conflicts of laws principles of the State of Delaware.

# **ARTICLE VIII 
 INDEMNIFICATION**

  

# ** **

  

### (a) The Corporation shall indemnify, to the fullest extent permitted by
Delaware law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the
case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits
the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than such law
permitted the Corporation to provide prior to such amendment), any person who
was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened,
pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative (including, without limitation, an action by
or in the right of the Corporation), by reason of the fact that he or she is
or was a director or an officer of the Corporation or is or was serving at
the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, or trustee of another
corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise,
including service with respect to an employee benefit plan (hereinafter an
"indemnitee"), against all expense, liability and loss (including attorneys
fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid in
settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by such indemnitee in connection
therewith and such indemnification shall

  



        
   

  

### 

  

continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director or officer and shall
inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors and administrators;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that, except with respect to proceedings to enforce
rights to indemnification, the Corporation shall indemnify any such
indemnitee in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by
such indemnitee only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by
the Board of Directors of the Corporation.

  

### 

  

### (b) In addition to the right to indemnification conferred in this ARTICLE
VIII, an indemnitee shall also have the right to be paid by the Corporation
the expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred in defending any such
proceeding in advance of its final disposition (hereinafter an "advancement
of expenses"); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that, if the Delaware General
Corporation Law requires, an advancement of expenses incurred by an
indemnitee in his or her capacity as a director or officer (and not in any
other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such indemnitee,
including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) shall be
made only upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking (hereinafter an
"undertaking"), by or on behalf of such indemnitee, to repay all amounts so
advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from
which there is no further right to appeal (hereinafter a "final
adjudication") that such indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified for
such expenses under this ARTICLE VIII or otherwise.

  

### 

  

### (c) The rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses
conferred in this ARTICLE VIII shall not be exclusive of any other right
which any person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, the
Corporations Certificate of Incorporation, By-laws, agreement, vote of
stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.

  

### 

  

# **ARTICLE IX 
 CORPORATE POWER**

  

# ** **

provision contained in this Certificate of Incorporation, in the manner now
or hereafter prescribed by statute, and all rights conferred on stockholders
herein are granted subject to this reservation.

Indenture.

  



  

The Trustee shall authenticate and make available for delivery upon a written
order of the Issuer signed by two of its Officers, Notes for original issue
on the date hereof in an aggregate principal amount of $[
]. Such order shall specify the amount of the Notes to be authenticated and
the date on which the original issue of Notes is to be authenticated. The
aggregate principal amount of Notes outstanding at any time may not exceed $[
] except as provided in Section 2.07.

  



        
   

  



  

The Trustee may appoint an authenticating agent reasonably acceptable to the
Issuer to authenticate the Notes. Any such appointment shall be evidenced by
an instrument signed by a Trust Officer of the Trustee, a copy of which shall
be furnished to the Issuer. Unless limited by the terms of such appointment,
an authenticating agent may authenticate Notes whenever the Trustee may do
so. After any such appointment, each reference in this Indenture to
authentication by the Trustee includes authentication by such agent.  An
authenticating agent has the same rights as any Registrar (as defined below),
Paying Agent (as defined below) or agent for service of notices and demands.

  



  

The Issuer shall retain possession of the Notes as custodian for the Holders.
Holders of the Notes will be entitled to physical delivery of their
respective Note upon written request to the Issuer. Except for any Notes
delivered to Holders pursuant to written request by such Holders to the
Issuer, the Notes will at all times be held by the Issuer.

  



  

SECTION 2.03 _Registrar and Paying Agent_. The Issuer shall maintain an office
or agency where Notes may be presented for registration of transfer or for
exchange (the " _Registrar_ ") and an office or agency where Notes may be
presented for payment (the " _Paying Agent_ "). The Registrar shall keep
a register of the Notes for the recordation of the names and addresses of
the Holders of the Notes, the principal amount of each of the Notes, the date
and amount of each payment in respect of the Notes and any transfer or
exchange of the Notes (the " _Register_ "). The Issuer may appoint one or
more co-registrars and one or more additional paying agents. The term
"Registrar" includes any co-registrar and the term "Paying Agent" includes
any additional paying agent.

  



  

The Issuer shall give prompt written notice to the Trustee of the location,
and any change in the location, of such office or agency. If at any time the
Issuer shall fail to maintain any such required office or agency or shall
fail to furnish the Trustee with the address thereof, such presentations,
surrenders, notices and demands may be made or served at the address of the
Trustee set forth in Section 11.02.

  



  

The Issuer may also from time to time designate one or more other offices
or agencies where the Notes may be presented or surrendered for any or all
such purposes and may from time to time rescind such designations. The Issuer
will give prompt notice to the Trustee of any such designation or rescission
and of any change in the location of any such other office or agency.

  



  

The Issuer initially designates the [Corporate Trust Office] of the
Trustee specified in Section 11.02 as such office of the Issuer in accordance
with this Section 2.03.

  



  

The Issuer shall enter into an appropriate agency agreement with any
Registrar or Paying Agent not a party to this Indenture, which shall
incorporate any applicable terms of the TIA and implement the provisions of
this Indenture that relate to such agent. The Issuer shall notify the
Trustee of the name and address of any such agent. If the Issuer fails to
maintain a Registrar or Paying Agent, the Trustee shall act as such and shall
be entitled to appropriate compensation therefor pursuant to Section 7.07.
Either the Issuer or any domestically organized Wholly Owned Subsidiary of
the Issuer may act as Paying Agent or Registrar.

  



        
   

  



  

The Issuer initially appoints the Trustee as Registrar and Paying Agent
in connection with the Notes.

  



  

The Issuer may remove any Registrar or Paying Agent upon written notice to
such Registrar or Paying Agent and to the Trustee, _provided_ that no
such removal shall become effective until payment to such Registrar or Paying
Agent of any fees due to such Person from the Issuer, other than fees which
are currently being contested in good faith, and acceptance of an appointment
by a successor as evidenced by an appropriate agreement entered into by the
Issuer and such successor Registrar or Paying Agent, as the case may be, and
delivered to the Trustee to the extent that such successor is not currently a
party to this Indenture. The Registrar or Paying Agent may resign at any
time upon not less than three Business Days prior written notice to the
Issuer; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Trustee may resign as Paying Agent
or Registrar only if the Trustee also resigns as Trustee in accordance with
Section 7.08.

  



         
 

  



  

SECTION 2.04 _Paying Agent To Hold Money in Trust_. Prior to 10:00 a.m., New
York City time, on each due date of the principal and interest on any Note,
the Issuer shall deposit with the Paying Agent (or if the Issuer or its
Wholly Owned Subsidiary is acting as Paying Agent, segregate and hold in
trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto) a sum sufficient to
pay such principal and interest when so becoming due. The Issuer
shall require each Paying Agent (other than the Trustee) to agree in writing
that the Paying Agent shall hold in trust for the benefit of Noteholders or
the Trustee all money held by the Paying Agent for the payment of principal
of or interest on the Notes and shall notify the Trustee in writing of any
default by the Issuer in making any such payment within one Business Day
thereof. If the Issuer or its Wholly Owned Subsidiary acts as Paying Agent,
it shall segregate the money held by it as Paying Agent and hold it as a
separate trust fund.  The Issuer at any time may require a Paying Agent to
pay all money held by it to the Trustee and to account for any funds
disbursed by the Paying Agent. Upon complying with this Section, the Paying
Agent shall have no further liability for the money delivered to the Trustee.
Any money deposited with any Paying Agent, or then held by the Issuer or its
Wholly Owned Subsidiary in trust for the payment of principal or interest on
any Note and remaining unclaimed for two years after such principal and
interest has become due and payable shall be paid to the Issuer at its
request, or, if then held by the Issuer or a Wholly Owned Subsidiary, shall
be discharged from such trust; and the Noteholders shall thereafter, as
general unsecured creditors, look only to the Issuer for payment thereof, and
all liability of the Paying Agent with respect to such money, and all
liability of the Issuer or such Wholly Owned Subsidiary as trustee thereof,
shall thereupon cease.

  



  

SECTION 2.05 _Noteholder Lists_. The Trustee shall preserve in as current
a form as is reasonably practicable the most recent list available to it of
the names and addresses of Noteholders and shall otherwise comply with
Section 312(a) of the TIA. If the Trustee is not the Registrar, the Issuer
shall furnish, or cause the Registrar (if other than the Issuer) to furnish,
to the Trustee, in writing at least five Business Days before the Interest
Payment Date and at such other times as the Trustee may request in writing, a
list in such form and as of such date as the Trustee may reasonably require
of the names and addresses of Noteholders.

  



  

SECTION 2.06 _Transfer and Exchange of Notes_.

  



  

(a) _Restrictions on Transfer of Notes_. Notes may not be transferred to any
Person other than (i) the Issuer, (ii) a Permitted Family Member of
the transferor, (iii) any trust organized for the benefit of a
Permitted Family Member of the transferor or (iv) upon the death of a Holder,
such Holders executors, administrators, testamentary trustees, legatees and
beneficiaries. In connection with any Transfer permitted hereunder, (x) a
Holder (or, in the case of a Transfer pursuant to clause (iv), such Holders
executors, administrators, testamentary trustees, legatees and beneficiaries)
shall provide [ten] Business Days prior written notice to the Registrar of
any such Transfer, (y) any transferor must deliver a Certificate of Transfer
in the form of _Exhibit B_ hereto to the Registrar and (z) any transferor
and any transferee must deliver any additional certifications, documents and
information, as may be reasonably requested by the Trustee. In addition,
prior to any registration of a Transfer, the requesting Holder shall present
or surrender to the Registrar or shall instruct the custodian of the Notes to
present or surrender to the Registrar, the Notes duly endorsed or
accompanied by a written instruction of transfer in form satisfactory to the
Registrar duly executed by such Holder or its attorney, duly authorized in
writing. Each Holder, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed to agree to the
transfer restrictions

  



        
   

  



  

set forth in this Section 2.06. No Transfer of Notes in violation of the
terms of this Section 2.06 shall be made or recorded on the books of the
Registrar, and any such Transfer shall be void and of no effect. No transfer
of Notes shall be effective unless and until it has been recorded in the
Register. Only the registered Holder of a Note will be treated as its owner.

  



  

(b) _General Provisions Relating to Transfers and Exchanges._

  



  

(i) To permit registrations of transfers and exchanges, the Issuer shall
execute and the Trustee shall authenticate Notes upon the Issuers order or
at the Registrars request.

  



  

(ii) No service charge shall be made to a Holder for any registration of
transfer or exchange, but the Issuer may require payment of a sum sufficient
to cover any transfer tax or similar governmental charge payable in
connection therewith (other than any such transfer taxes or similar
governmental charge payable upon exchange or transfer pursuant to Section
9.05).

  



  

(iii) The Registrar shall not be required to register the transfer of or
exchange any Note selected for redemption in whole or in part, except for the
unredeemed portion of any Note being redeemed in part.

  



  

(iv) The Registrar shall retain copies of all certificates, notices and other
written communications received pursuant to this Section 2.06. The Issuer
shall have the right to inspect and make copies of all such certificates,
notices or other written communications at any reasonable time upon the
giving of reasonable notice to the Registrar. All Notes issued upon any
registration of transfer or exchange of Notes shall be the valid obligations
of the Issuer, evidencing the same indebtedness, and entitled to the same
benefits under this Indenture, as the Notes surrendered upon such
registration of transfer or exchange.

  



  

(v) The Issuer, Trustee and Registrar shall not be required (A) to issue, to
register the transfer of or to exchange any Notes during a period beginning
at the opening of business on a Business Day 15 days before the day of any
selection of Notes for redemption under Section 3.03 and ending at the close
of business on the day of selection, (B) to register the transfer of or to
exchange any Note so selected for redemption in whole or in part, except the
unredeemed portion of any Note being redeemed in part or (C) to register the
transfer of or to exchange a Note between the opening of business on a
Business Day 15 days before the Maturity Date and the Maturity Date.

  



  

(vi) Prior to the due presentation for registration of transfer of any Note,
the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent or the Registrar may deem and treat
the Person in whose name a Note is registered as the absolute owner of such
Note for the purpose of receiving payment of principal of and accrued and
unpaid interest, if any, on such Note and for all other purposes whatsoever,
whether or not such Note is overdue, and none of the Issuer, the Trustee, the
Paying Agent or the Registrar shall be affected by notice to the contrary.

  



  

(vii) The Trustee shall authenticate Notes in accordance with the provisions
of Section 2.02.

  



        
   

  



  

(viii) All certifications and certificates required to be submitted to the
Registrar pursuant to this Section 2.06 to effect a registration of transfer
or exchange may be submitted by facsimile.

  



  

(ix) All Notes issued upon any transfer pursuant to this Section 2.06 will
evidence the same Debt and will be entitled to the same benefits under this
Indenture as the Notes surrendered upon such transfer.

  



  

(x) The Trustee shall have no obligation or duty to monitor, determine or
inquire as to compliance with any restrictions on transfer imposed under this
Indenture or under applicable Law with respect to any transfer of any
interest in any Note other than to require delivery of such certificates and
other documentation or evidence as are expressly required by, and to do so if
and when expressly required by the terms of, this Indenture, and to examine
the same to determine substantial compliance as to form with the express
requirements hereof.

  



  

SECTION 2.07 _Replacement Notes_. If a mutilated Note is surrendered to
the Registrar or if the Holder claims that the Note has been lost, destroyed
or wrongfully taken, the Issuer shall issue and the Trustee shall
authenticate a replacement Note if the Holder (i) satisfies the Issuer or the
Trustee within a reasonable time after he has notice of such loss,
destruction or wrongful taking and the Registrar does not register a transfer
prior to receiving such notification, (ii) makes such request to the Issuer
or the Trustee prior to the Note being acquired by a "protected purchaser" as
defined in Section 8-303 of the UCC and (iii) satisfies any other
reasonable requirements of the Trustee and the Issuer including evidence of
the destruction, loss or theft of the Note.  Such Holder shall furnish an
indemnity bond sufficient in the judgment of the Trustee to protect the
Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent and the Registrar from any loss that
any of them may suffer if a Note is replaced, including any loss or liability
which any of them may suffer if a Note is replaced and subsequently presented
or claimed for payment. The Issuer and the Trustee may charge the Holder for
their expenses in replacing a Note including the payment of a sum sufficient
to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be required. In the
event any such mutilated, lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken Note has become
or is about to become due and payable, the Issuer in its discretion may pay
such Note instead of issuing a new Note in replacement thereof.  Every
replacement Note is an additional obligation of the Issuer and shall be
entitled to all of the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionally
with all other Notes duly issued hereunder.

  



  

The provisions of this Section 2.07 are exclusive and shall preclude (to
the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the
replacement or payment of mutilated, lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken
Notes.

  



  

SECTION 2.08 _Outstanding Notes_. Notes outstanding at any time are all
Notes authenticated by the Trustee except:

  



  

(a) Notes theretofore cancelled by the Trustee or delivered to the Trustee
for cancellation, including Notes tendered and exchanged for other securities
of the Issuer;

  



  

(b) Notes for which payment or redemption money in the necessary amount has
been theretofore deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent (other than
the Issuer) in trust or set

  



        
   

  



  

aside and segregated in trust by the Issuer (if the Issuer shall act as its
own Paying Agent) for the Holders of such Notes; _provided_ , _however_
, that if such Notes are to be redeemed, then notice of such redemption has
been duly given pursuant to this Indenture or provision therefor satisfactory
to the Trustee has been made and the date for such redemption has passed; and

  



  

(c) Notes paid pursuant to Section 2.07 and Notes in exchange for or in lieu
of which other Notes have been authenticated and delivered pursuant to this
Indenture, other than any such Notes in respect of which there shall have
been presented to the Trustee proof satisfactory to it that such Notes are
held by a bona fide purchaser in whose hands such Notes are valid obligations
of the Issuer.

  



  

SECTION 2.09 _[Omitted.]_

  



  

SECTION 2.10 _Cancellation_. All Notes surrendered for payment, redemption,
transfer or exchange shall, if surrendered to any Person other than the
Trustee, be delivered to the Trustee at its Corporate Trust Office. All Notes
so delivered shall be promptly cancelled by the Trustee. The Issuer may at
any time deliver to the Trustee for cancellation any Notes
previously authenticated and delivered hereunder which the Issuer may have
acquired in any manner whatsoever, and may deliver to the Trustee (or to any
other Person for delivery to the Trustee) for cancellation any Notes
previously authenticated hereunder which the Issuer has not issued, and all
Notes so delivered shall be promptly cancelled by the Trustee. No Notes
shall be authenticated in lieu of or in exchange for any Notes cancelled as
provided in this Section 2.10, except as permitted by this Indenture. All
cancelled Notes held by the Trustee shall be delivered to the Issuer upon the
written request of the Issuer. The acquisition of any Notes by the Issuer
shall not operate as a redemption or satisfaction of the indebtedness
represented thereby unless and until such Notes are surrendered to the
Trustee for cancellation. The Notes shall not be disposed of until payment
thereon is made in full.

  



  

SECTION 2.11 _Defaulted Interest_. If the Issuer defaults in a payment
of interest on the Notes, the Issuer shall pay the defaulted interest
(plus interest on such defaulted interest to the extent lawful) in any lawful
manner in each case at the rate specified in the Notes. The Issuer may pay
the defaulted interest to the persons who are Noteholders on a subsequent
special record date. The Issuer shall fix or cause to be fixed any such
special record date and payment date to the reasonable satisfaction of
the Trustee and shall promptly mail or cause to be mailed to each Noteholder
a notice that states the special record date, the payment date and the amount
of defaulted interest to be paid.

# **REDEMPTION**

  

# 

  

SECTION 3.01 _Optional Redemption_. The Issuer may redeem at any time all or
a part of the Notes, in accordance with the provisions of this Article
III, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of Notes
redeemed (the " _Redemption Price_ ") plus the accrued and unpaid interest to
the date of redemption (the " _Redemption Date_ ").

  



        
   

  



  

SECTION 3.02 _Notices to Trustee_. If the Issuer elects to redeem Notes
pursuant to this Article III, it shall notify the Trustee not less than 30
days, but not more than 60 days, prior to the Redemption Date of the
Redemption Date, the Redemption Price and the principal amount of Notes to be
redeemed.

  



  

SECTION 3.03 _Selection_. If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at
any time, selection of Notes for redemption will be made by such method as
the Trustee shall reasonably deem fair and appropriate, including, without
limitation, on a pro rata basis or by lot. If any Note is to be redeemed in
part only, the notice of redemption that relates to such Note shall state the
portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed.  On and after the
Redemption Date, unless the Issuer shall default in the payment of the
Redemption Price, interest will cease to accrue on Notes or portions of them
called for redemption.

  



  

The portions of the principal amount of Notes so selected for partial
redemption shall be equal to the minimum authorized denominations for Notes
pursuant to Section 2.01(a) or any integral multiple thereof. In any case
when more than one Note is registered in the same name, the Trustee, in its
discretion, may treat the aggregate principal amount so registered as if
it were represented by one Note.

  



  

The Trustee shall promptly notify the Issuer in writing of the Notes selected
for redemption and, in the case of any Notes selected for partial redemption,
the principal amount thereof to be redeemed.

  



  

For all purposes of this Indenture, unless the context otherwise requires,
all provisions relating to the redemption of Notes shall relate, in the case
of any Note redeemed or to be redeemed only in part, to the portion of the
principal amount of such Note which has been or is to be redeemed.

  



  

SECTION 3.04 _Notice_. Notice of redemption shall be given by the Issuer, or
at the Issuers written request, by the Trustee in the name and at
the expense of the Issuer, not less than 20 days and not more than 60 days
prior to the Redemption Date (which date may be extended in accordance with
applicable law) to each Holder at such Holders registered address;
_provided_ that a notice of redemption may be mailed more than 60 days prior
to a Redemption Date if such notice is issued in connection with the
satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture pursuant to Section 8.01.
 Notices of redemption shall be mailed by first class mail to each Holder of
Notes to be redeemed at its registered address. Notices of redemption may
state that consummation of the redemption is conditional upon the occurrence
of certain events described in reasonable detail therein.

  



  

The notice shall identify the Notes to be redeemed and shall state:

  



  

(1) the Redemption Date;

  



  

(2) the Redemption Price and the amount of accrued interest to the Redemption
Date;

  



  

(3) the name and address of the Paying Agent;

  



        
   

  



  

(4) that Notes called for redemption must be surrendered to the Paying Agent
to collect the Redemption Price plus accrued interest;

  



  

(5) that the Notes are being redeemed by the Issuer pursuant to provisions
contained in this Indenture or the terms of such Notes, together with a brief
statement of the facts permitting such redemption;

  



  

(6) that (i) all outstanding Notes are to be redeemed, or (ii) if fewer than
all the outstanding Notes are to be redeemed, the certificate numbers and
principal amounts of the particular Notes to be redeemed;

after the Redemption Date, upon surrender of such Notes, the Holders of such
Notes will receive, without charge, new Notes in authorized denominations for
the principal amount thereof remaining unredeemed;

  



  

(8) that, unless the Issuer defaults in making payment of the Redemption
Price or the Paying Agent is prohibited from making such payment pursuant to
the terms of this Indenture, interest on Notes (or portion thereof) called
for redemption ceases to accrue on and after the Redemption Date;

  



  

(9) the place or places of payment where such Notes are to be surrendered for
payment of the Redemption Price; and

  



  

(10) in reasonable detail any condition that must be satisfied before the
Issuer will be required to redeem the Notes.

  



  

SECTION 3.05 _Effect of Notice of Redemption_. Once notice of redemption is
mailed, Notes called for redemption shall become due and payable on the
Redemption Date and at the Redemption Price, subject to any conditions that
must be satisfied before the Issuer will be required to redeem the Notes.
Upon surrender to the Paying Agent, such Notes shall be paid at the
Redemption Price, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the Redemption Date. If
mailed in the manner herein, the notice shall be conclusively presumed to
have been given whether or not the Holder receives such notice.  Failure to
give notice or any defect in the notice to any Holder shall not affect the
validity of the notice to any other Holder.

  



  

SECTION 3.06 _Deposit of Redemption Price_. At or prior to 10:00 a.m., New
York City time, on the Redemption Date, the Issuer shall deposit with the
Paying Agent (or, if the Issuer or its Wholly Owned Subsidiary is the Paying
Agent, shall segregate and hold in trust) money sufficient to pay the
Redemption Price of and accrued and unpaid interest on all Notes to be
redeemed on the Redemption Date. The Paying Agent shall then pay
the Redemption Price to the Holders of Notes being redeemed; _provided_
that the Holder of a Note being redeemed must surrender all
certificates representing such elected Notes to the Paying Agent in
accordance with the notice of redemption before it shall be entitled to
receive such payment.

  



  

SECTION 3.07 _Notes Redeemed in Part_. Any Note which is to be redeemed only
in part shall be surrendered at the Corporate Trust Office with, if the
Issuer or the Trustee so requires, due endorsement by, or a written
instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the

  



        
   

  



  

Issuer and the Trustee duly executed by, the Holder thereof or such Holders
attorney duly authorized in writing, and the Issuer shall execute, and the
Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder of such Note without
service charge, a new Note or Notes, of like tenor and form, of any
authorized denomination as requested by such Holder in aggregate principal
amount equal to and in exchange for the unredeemed portion of the principal
of the Note so surrendered.

  



  

SECTION 3.08 _No Sinking Fund_. There shall be no sinking fund for
the payment of principal on Notes to the Noteholders.

SECTION 4.01 _Payment of Notes_. The Issuer shall promptly pay the
principal of and interest on the Notes on the dates and in the manner
provided in the Notes and in this Indenture. Principal and interest shall be
considered paid on the date due if on such date the Trustee or the Paying
Agent (if other than the Issuer or a Wholly Owned Subsidiary) holds by 10:00
a.m., New York City time (or, if the Issuer or its Wholly Owned Subsidiary is
the Paying Agent, shall segregate and hold in trust by that time), in

Issuer may be required to file with the SEC pursuant to Section 13 or Section
15(d) of the Exchange Act; or, if the Issuer is not required to file

it shall file with the Trustee and the SEC, in accordance with rules and
regulations prescribed from time to time by the SEC, such of the
supplementary and periodic information, documents and reports which may be

The Issuer shall give prompt written notice to the Trustee of the location,
and any change in the location, of such office or agency. If at any time the
Issuer shall fail to maintain any such required office or agency or shall
fail to furnish the Trustee with the address thereof, such presentations,
surrenders, notices and demands may be made or served at the Corporate Trust
Office of the Trustee and the Issuer hereby appoints the Trustee as its agent
to receive all presentations, surrenders, notices and demands.

  



  

The Issuer may also from time to time designate different or additional
offices or agencies to be maintained for such purposes, and may from time to
time rescind any such designations; _provided_ , _however_ , that no
such designation or rescission shall in any manner relieve the Issuer of
its obligations described in the preceding paragraph. The Issuer shall give
prompt written notice to the Trustee of any such additional designation or
rescission of designation and any change in the location of any such
different or additional office or agency.

knowledge of any Default and whether or not the signers know of any Default
then in existence. If they do have such knowledge, the certificate shall
describe the Default, the status of such Default and what action the Issuer
is taking or proposes to take with respect thereto. The Issuer shall deliver
to the Trustee, as soon as possible and in any event within 30 days after the
Issuer becomes aware of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default, an

SECTION 5.01 _Merger, Consolidation or Sale of All or Substantially All
Assets of the Issuer_.  The Issuer shall not consolidate or merge with or
into (whether or not the Issuer is the surviving entity), or sell, assign,
transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of
its properties or assets (determined on a consolidated basis for the Issuer
and its Subsidiaries) in one or more related transactions, to another Person

Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, (a) any Subsidiary of
the Issuer may consolidate with, merge into or transfer all or part of its
properties and assets to the Issuer; and (b) the Issuer may merge or
consolidate with an Affiliate organized solely for the purpose of
reorganizing the Issuer in another jurisdiction.

  



  

Upon any consolidation or merger in which the Issuer is not the surviving
entity, or any transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Issuer in each case in accordance with the foregoing, the Successor Entity
shall succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and
power of, the Issuer under the Notes and this Indenture, with the same effect
as if the Successor Entity had been named as the Issuer.

(1) default for 30 days in the payment when due of interest on the Notes;

  



        
   

  



  

(2) default for five days in payment when due of the principal of the Notes;

or takes any comparable action under any foreign laws relating to insolvency;

  



  

(4) a court of competent jurisdiction enters an order or decree under any
Bankruptcy Law that:

  



  

(A) is for relief against the Issuer in an involuntary case;

  



  

(B) appoints a Bankruptcy Custodian of the Issuer or for any substantial part
of its property; or

  



  

(C) orders the winding up or liquidation of the Issuer;

  



  

or any similar relief is granted under any foreign laws and the order or
decree relating thereto remains unstayed and in effect for 60 days; or

  



  

(5) the Issuer fails to comply with any covenant or agreement in the Notes or
in this Indenture (other than a failure that is the subject of the foregoing
clauses (a)(1) or (2)) and such failure continues for 60 days after written
notice is given to the Issuer by the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25%
in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes.

  



  

(b) The foregoing shall constitute Events of Default whatever the reason for
any such Event of Default and whether it is voluntary or involuntary or is
effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of
any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or
governmental body.

  



  

(c) For purposes of this Indenture, the term "Bankruptcy Custodian" means any
receiver, trustee, assignee, liquidator, custodian or similar official under
any Bankruptcy Law.

  



  

## SECTION 6.02 _Acceleration_.

  

## 

  

(a) If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default specified in
Section 6.01(a)(3) or (4)) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee by notice to
the Issuer in writing, or the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal
amount of the outstanding Notes by notice in writing to the Issuer, may
declare the principal of and accrued but unpaid interest on all the

  



        
   

  



  

Notes to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal and
interest shall be due and payable immediately. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(a)(3) or (4)
occurs, the principal of and interest on all the Notes shall ipso facto
become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other
act on the part of the Trustee or any Noteholders.

  



  

(b) At any time after a declaration of acceleration with respect to the Notes
as described in Section 6.02(a), the Holders of a majority in aggregate
principal amount of the outstanding Notes may rescind and cancel such
declaration and its consequences: (i) if the rescission would not
conflict with any judgment or decree; (ii) if all existing Events of Default
have been cured or waived except nonpayment of principal or interest that has
become due solely because of the acceleration; (iii) to the extent the
payment of such interest is lawful, interest on overdue installments of
interest and overdue principal, which has become due otherwise than by such
declaration of acceleration, has been paid; and (iv) if the Issuer has paid
the Trustee its reasonable compensation and reimbursed the Trustee for its
expenses, disbursements and advances. No such rescission shall affect any
subsequent Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereto.

  



         
 

  



  

SECTION 6.03 _Other Remedies_. If an Event of Default occurs and
is continuing, the Trustee may pursue any available remedy to collect the
payment of principal of or interest on the Notes or to enforce the
performance of any provision of the Notes or this Indenture.  The Trustee
may maintain a proceeding even if it does not possess any of the Notes or
does not produce any of them in the proceeding. A delay or omission by the
Trustee or any Noteholder in exercising any right or remedy accruing upon an
Event of Default shall not impair the right or remedy or constitute a waiver
of or acquiescence in the Event of Default. No remedy is exclusive of any
other remedy. All available remedies are cumulative (to the extent permitted
by law).

  



  

SECTION 6.04 _Waiver of Existing Defaults_. The Holders of a majority in
aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes by written notice to the
Trustee may on behalf of the Holders of all of the Notes waive any Event of
Default and its consequences hereunder. When an Event of Default is waived,
it is deemed cured and ceases to exist and any Event of Default arising
therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured and waived for every purpose
under this Indenture, but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or
other Event of Default or impair any consequent right thereon.

  



  

SECTION 6.05 _Control by Majority_. The Holders of a majority in
aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding may direct the time,
method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the
Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee by this
Indenture; _provided_  that such direction shall not be in conflict with any
rule of law or with this Indenture. However, the Trustee may refuse to
follow any direction that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the
rights of other Noteholders or would involve the Trustee in personal
liability; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Trustee may take any other
action deemed proper by the Trustee that is not inconsistent with such
direction. Prior to taking any action hereunder, the Trustee shall be
entitled to indemnification satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against
all losses and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action.

  



  

SECTION 6.06 _Limitation on Suits_. Except to enforce the right to
receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Noteholder may pursue
any remedy with respect to this Indenture or the Notes unless:

  



  

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of
Default is continuing;

  



  

(2) Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding
Notes have made a written request to the Trustee to pursue the remedy;

  



  

(3) such Holders have offered the Trustee security or indemnity reasonably
satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense;

  



  

(4) the Trustee has not complied with the request within 60 days after the
receipt of the request and the offer of security or indemnity; and

  



  

(5) the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then
outstanding have not given the Trustee a direction inconsistent with such
request within such 60-day period.

  



        
   

  



  

A Noteholder may not use this Indenture to prejudice the rights of another
Noteholder or to obtain a preference or priority over another Noteholder.

  



  

SECTION 6.07 _Rights of Holders To Receive Payment_. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Indenture, the right of any Holder to receive payment of
principal of and interest on the Notes held by such Holder, on or after the
respective due dates expressed in the Notes, or to bring suit for the
enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective dates, shall not
be impaired or affected without the consent of such Holder.

  



  

SECTION 6.08 _Collection Suit by Trustee_. If an Event of Default occurs and
is continuing under Section 6.01(a)(1) and (2), the Trustee may
recover judgment in its own name and as trustee of an express trust against
the Issuer for the whole amount then due and owing (together with interest on
any overdue principal and on any unpaid interest to the extent lawful) and
the amounts provided for in Section 7.07.

  



  

SECTION 6.09 _Trustee May File Proofs of Claim_. The Trustee may file such
proofs of claim and other papers or documents as may be necessary or
advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee and the Noteholders
allowed in any judicial proceedings relative to the Issuer, its creditors or
its property and, unless prohibited by law or applicable regulations, may
vote on behalf of the Holders in any election of a trustee in bankruptcy or
other Person performing similar functions, and any Bankruptcy Custodian in
any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder to make
payments to the Trustee and, in the event that the Trustee shall consent to
the making of such payments directly to the Holders, to pay to the Trustee
any amount due it for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements
and advances of the Trustee, its agents and its counsel, and any other
amounts due the Trustee under Section 7.07.

  



  

SECTION 6.10 _Application of Money or Property Collected_. If the Trustee
collects any money or property pursuant to this Article VI, it shall pay out
the money or property in the following order:

  



  

FIRST: to the Trustee for amounts due under Section 7.07;

  



  

SECOND: to Noteholders for amounts due and unpaid on the Notes for principal
and interest, ratably, according to the amounts due and payable on the Notes
for principal and interest, respectively; and

  



  

THIRD: to the Issuer.

  



  

The Trustee may fix a record date and payment date for any payment to
Noteholders pursuant to this Section. At least fifteen days before such
record date, the Trustee shall mail to each Noteholder and the Issuer a
notice that states the record date, the payment date and amount to be paid.

  



  

SECTION 6.11 _Undertaking for Costs_. In any suit for the enforcement of any
right or remedy under this Indenture or in any suit against the Trustee for
any action taken or omitted by it as Trustee, a court in its discretion may
require the filing by any party litigant in the suit of an undertaking to pay
the costs of the suit, and the court in its discretion may assess reasonable

  



        
   

  



  

costs, including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses, against any party
litigant in the suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the
claims or defenses made by the party litigant.  This Section does not apply
to a suit by the Trustee, a suit by a Holder pursuant to Section 6.07 or a
suit by Holders of more than 10% in principal amount of the outstanding
Notes.

  



  

SECTION 6.12 _Waiver of Stay or Extension Laws_. The Issuer (to the extent it
may lawfully do so) shall not at any time insist upon, or plead, or in any
manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any stay or
extension law wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, which
may affect the covenants or the performance of this Indenture; and the Issuer
(to the extent that it may lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives all
benefit or advantage of any such law, and shall not hinder, delay or impede
the execution of any power herein granted to the Trustee, but shall suffer
and permit the execution of every such power as though no such law had been
enacted.

# 

  

## SECTION 7.01 _Duties of Trustee_.

  

## 

  

(a) If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee shall
exercise the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture and use the
same degree of care and skill in its exercise as a prudent Person would
exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of such Persons own
affairs.

  



  

(b) Except during the continuance of an Event of Default:

  



  

(1) the Trustee undertakes to perform such duties and only such duties as are
specifically set forth in this Indenture and no implied covenants or
obligations shall be read into this Indenture against the Trustee; and

  



  

(2) in the absence of bad faith on its part, the Trustee may conclusively
rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions
expressed therein, upon certificates or opinions furnished to the Trustee and
conforming to the requirements of this Indenture. However, in the case of
any such certificates or opinions which by any provision hereof are
specifically required to be furnished to the Trustee, the Trustee
shall examine the certificates and opinions to determine whether or not they
conform to the requirements of this Indenture.

  



  

(c) The Trustee may not be relieved from liability for its own negligent
action, its own negligent failure to act or its own willful misconduct,
except that:

  



  

(1) this paragraph does not limit the effect of Section 7.01(b);

  



  

(2) the Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in good
faith by a Trust Officer unless it is proved that the Trustee was negligent
in ascertaining the pertinent facts; and

  



        
   

  



  

(3) the Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action it takes or
omits to take in good faith in accordance with a direction received by it
pursuant to Section 6.05.

  



  

(d) Every provision of this Indenture that in any way relates to the Trustee
is subject to paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this Section.

(f) No provision of this Indenture shall require the Trustee to expend or
risk its own funds or otherwise incur financial liability in the performance
of any of its duties hereunder or thereunder or in the exercise of any of its
rights or powers, if it shall have reasonable grounds to believe that
repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability
is not reasonably assured to it.

  



  

(g) Every provision of this Indenture relating to the conduct or affecting
the liability of or affording protection to the Trustee shall be subject to
the provisions of this Section and to the provisions of the TIA.

  



  

SECTION 7.02 _Rights of Trustee_. Subject to Section 7.01:

  



  

(a) The Trustee may conclusively rely, and shall be protected in acting or
refraining from acting, upon any document believed by it to be genuine and to
have been signed or presented by the proper person. The Trustee need not
investigate any fact or matter stated in any such document.

  



  

(b) Before the Trustee acts or refrains from acting, it may require an
Officers Certificate or an Opinion of Counsel. The Trustee shall not be
liable for any action it takes or omits to take in good faith in reliance on
such Officers Certificate or Opinion of Counsel.

  



  

(c) The Trustee may act through agents and shall not be responsible for the
misconduct or negligence of any agent appointed with due care.

  



  

(d) The Trustee shall not be liable for any action it takes or omits to take
in good faith which it believes to be authorized or within its rights or
powers; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Trustees conduct does not
constitute willful misconduct or negligence.

  



  

(e) The Trustee may consult with counsel of its selection, and the advice or
opinion of such counsel with respect to legal matters relating to this
Indenture and the Notes shall be full and complete authorization and
protection from liability in respect to any action taken, omitted or suffered
by it hereunder in good faith and in accordance with the advice or opinion of
such counsel.

  



  

(f) The Trustee shall not be bound to make any investigation into the facts
or matters stated in any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument,
opinion, report, notice, request, consent, order, approval, bond, debenture,
note or other paper or document unless requested in writing to do so by the
Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Notes at the

  



        
   

  



  

time outstanding, but the Trustee, in its discretion, may make such further
inquiry or investigation into such facts or matters as it may see fit, and,
if the Trustee shall determine to make such further inquiry or investigation,
it shall be entitled to examine the books, records and premises of the
Issuer, personally or by agent or attorney at the sole cost of the Issuer and
shall incur no liability or additional liability of any kind by reason of
such inquiry or investigation.

  



  

(g) The Trustee shall not be required to give any note, bond or surety in
respect of the execution of the trusts and powers under this Indenture.

(i) The Trustee shall not be deemed to have notice of any Default or Event of
Default under Section 6.01(a)(3), (4) or (5) unless a Trust Officer has
actual knowledge thereof or unless a Trust Officer receives written notice
thereof at its Corporate Trust Office specified in Section 11.02, from the
Issuer or a Holder that such Default or Event of Default has occurred, and
such notice references the Notes and this Indenture.

  



  

(j) The rights, privileges, protections, immunities and benefits given to the
Trustee, including its right to be indemnified, are extended to, and shall be
enforceable by, the Trustee in each of its capacities hereunder, and to each
agent, custodian and other Person employed to act hereunder.

  



  

(k) The Trustee may request that the Issuer deliver an Officers Certificate
setting forth the names of individuals and/or titles of officers authorized
at such time to take specified actions pursuant to this Indenture, which
Officers Certificate may be signed by any person authorized to sign an
Officers Certificate, including any person specified as so authorized in any
such certificate previously delivered and not superseded.

  



  

## SECTION 7.03 _Reserved_.

  

## 

  

SECTION 7.04 _Trustee s Disclaimer_. The Trustee shall not be responsible for
and makes no representation as to the validity or adequacy of this Indenture
or the Notes, it shall not be accountable for the Issuers use of the
proceeds from the Notes, and it shall not be responsible for any statement of
the Issuer in this Indenture or in any document issued in connection with the
sale of the Notes or in the Notes other than the Trustees certificate of
authentication.

  



  

SECTION 7.05 _Notice of Defaults_. If a Default occurs and is continuing and
is known to the Trustee, the Trustee shall mail to each Holder notice of
the Default within the earlier of 90 days after it occurs or 30 days after it
is known to a Trust Officer or written notice of it is received by
the Trustee. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of
or interest on any Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as a
committee of its Trust Officers in good faith determines that withholding
notice is in the interests of Noteholders. If a Default occurs and
is continuing and a Senior Officer of the Issuer has actual knowledge of
such Default, the Issuer shall deliver to the Trustee written notice of
such Default, which notice shall include the status of such Default and any
action being taken or proposed to be taken by the Issuer with respect
thereto.

  



        
   

  



  

SECTION 7.06 _Reports by Trustee to Holders_. The Trustee shall transmit to
the Holders such reports concerning the Trustee and its actions under this
Indenture as may be required pursuant to the TIA at the times and in the
manner provided pursuant thereto. To the extent that any such report is
required by the TIA with respect to any 12-month period, such report shall
cover the 12-month period ending [ ](1) and shall be
transmitted by the next succeeding [ ].(2)

  



  

A copy of each report at the time of its mailing to Noteholders shall be
filed with the SEC and each stock exchange (if any) on which the Notes
are listed. The Issuer agrees to notify promptly the Trustee whenever the
Notes become listed on any stock exchange and of any delisting thereof.

  



  

SECTION 7.07 _Compensation and Indemnity_. The Issuer shall pay to the Trustee
from time to time such compensation as is agreed to in writing by the Trustee
and the Issuer for the Trustees services hereunder.  The Trustees
compensation shall not be limited by any law on compensation of a trustee of
an express trust.  The Issuer shall reimburse the Trustee upon request for
all reasonable out-of-pocket disbursements, advances and expenses incurred or
made by it, including costs of collection, in addition to the compensation
for its services. Such expenses shall include the reasonable compensation
and expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustees agents, counsel,
accountants and experts. The Issuer shall indemnify the Trustee and its
officers, directors, shareholders, agents and employees (each, an "
_Indemnified Party_ ") for and hold each Indemnified Party harmless against
any and all loss, damage, claims, liability or expense (including reasonable
attorneys fees and expenses) including taxes (other than taxes based upon,
measured by or determined by the income of the Trustee) incurred by them
without negligence or bad faith on their part arising out of or in connection
with the acceptance or administration of this Indenture or the Notes and the
performance of their duties hereunder, including the cost and expense of
enforcing this Indenture against the Issuer (including this Section 7.07),
and defending itself against any claim (whether asserted by a Holder or any
other Person). The Trustee and its officers, directors, shareholders, agents
and employees in its capacity as Paying Agent and Registrar and agent for
service of notice and demands shall have the full benefit of the foregoing
indemnity as well as all other benefits, rights and privileges accorded to
the Trustee in this Indenture when acting in such other capacity. The Trustee
shall notify the Issuer of any claim for which it may seek indemnity promptly
upon obtaining actual knowledge thereof; _provided_ that any failure so to
notify the Issuer shall not relieve the Issuer of its indemnity
obligations hereunder. The Issuer shall defend the claim and the Indemnified
Party shall provide reasonable cooperation at the Issuers expense in the
defense. Such Indemnified Parties may have separate counsel and the Issuer
shall pay the fees and expenses of such counsel; _provided_ that the Issuer
shall not be required to pay such fees and expenses if it assumes such
Indemnified Parties defense and, in such Indemnified Parties reasonable
judgment, there is no conflict of interest between the Issuer and such
parties in connection with such defense. The Issuer need not reimburse any
expense or indemnify against any loss, liability or expense incurred by an
Indemnified Party through such partys own willful misconduct, negligence or
bad

(2) NTD:  Period end plus 2 months.

  



        
   

  



  

faith. The Issuer need not pay any settlement made without its consent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld). To secure the Issuers payment
obligations in this Section and all other obligations to the Trustee pursuant
to this Indenture, including all fees, expenses, and rights to
indemnification, the Trustee shall have a lien on all money or property held
or collected by the Trustee other than money or property held in trust to pay
principal of and interest on particular Notes. Such lien shall survive the
satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture and the resignation or removal
of the Trustee.

  



  

The Issuers payment obligations pursuant to this Section shall survive
the satisfaction or discharge of this Indenture, any rejection or termination
of this Indenture under any Bankruptcy Law or the resignation or removal of
the Trustee. When the Trustee incurs expenses after the occurrence of an
Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(a)(3) or (4) with respect to the
Issuer, the expenses are intended to constitute expenses of administration
under the Bankruptcy Law.

  



  

SECTION 7.08 _Replacement of Trustee_. The Trustee may resign at any time by
so notifying the Issuer in writing. The Holders of a majority in principal
amount of the Notes may remove the Trustee by so notifying the Trustee and
the Issuer in writing and may appoint a successor Trustee. The Issuer may
remove the Trustee if:

  



  

(1) the Trustee fails to comply with Section 7.10;

  



  

(2) the Trustee is adjudged bankrupt or insolvent;

  



  

(3) a receiver or other public officer takes charge of the Trustee or its
property; or

  



  

(4) the Trustee otherwise becomes incapable of acting.

  



  

If the Trustee resigns, is removed by the Issuer or by the Holders of a
majority in principal amount of the Notes and such Holders do not reasonably
promptly appoint a successor Trustee, or if a vacancy exists in the office of
Trustee for any reason (the Trustee in such event being referred to herein as
the retiring Trustee), the Issuer shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee.

  



  

A successor Trustee shall deliver a written acceptance of its appointment to
the retiring Trustee and to the Issuer.  Thereupon the resignation or
removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective, and the successor
Trustee shall have all the rights, powers and duties of the Trustee under
this Indenture.  The successor Trustee shall mail a notice of its succession
to Noteholders. The retiring Trustee shall promptly transfer all property
held by it as Trustee to the successor Trustee, subject to the lien provided
for in Section 7.07.

  



  

If a successor Trustee does not take office within 60 days after the
retiring Trustee resigns or is removed, the retiring Trustee or the Holders
of at least 10% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes may petition any
court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee at
the expense of the Issuer.

  



  

If the Trustee fails to comply with Section 7.10, any Noteholder may
petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee
and the appointment of a successor Trustee.

  



        
   

  



  

Notwithstanding the replacement of the Trustee pursuant to this Section, the
Issuers obligations under Section 7.07 shall continue for the benefit of
the retiring Trustee.

  



  

SECTION 7.09 _Successor Trustee by Merger_. If the Trustee consolidates with,
merges or converts into, or transfers all or substantially all its corporate
trust business or assets to, another corporation or banking association,
the resulting, surviving or transferee corporation without any further act
shall be the successor Trustee, _provided_ that such Person shall be
qualified and eligible under this Article VII.

  



  

In case at the time such successor or successors by merger, conversion
or consolidation to the Trustee shall succeed to the trusts created by
this Indenture any of the Notes shall have been authenticated but not
delivered, any such successor to the Trustee may adopt the certificate of
authentication of any predecessor trustee, and deliver such Notes so
authenticated; and in case at that time any of the Notes shall not have been
authenticated, any successor to the Trustee may authenticate such Notes
either in the name of any predecessor hereunder or in the name of the
successor to the Trustee; and in all such cases such certificates shall have
the same force under the Notes or this Indenture as if such certificates were
delivered by the Trustee.

  



        
   

  



  

SECTION 7.10 _Eligibility; Disqualification_. The Trustee shall at all times
satisfy the requirements of TIA § 310(a). The Trustee shall have a combined
capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000 as set forth in its most recent
published annual report of condition. The Trustee shall comply with TIA §
310(b); _provided_ , _however_ , that there shall be excluded from the
operation of TIA § 310(b)(1) any indenture or indentures under which other
securities or certificates of interest or participation in other securities
of the Issuer are outstanding if the requirements for such exclusion set
forth in TIA § 310(b)(1) are met.

  



  

SECTION 7.11 _Preferential Collection of Claims Against the Issuer_. The
Trustee shall comply with TIA § 311(a), excluding any creditor relationship
listed in TIA § 311(b). A Trustee who has resigned or been removed shall be
subject to TIA § 311(a) to the extent indicated therein.

  



  

SECTION 7.12 _Individual Rights of Trustee_. The Trustee in its individual or
any other capacity may deal with the Issuer or its Affiliates with the same
rights it would have if it were not Trustee. Any Paying Agent or Registrar
may do the same with like rights. However, the Trustee must comply with
Sections 7.10 and 7.11.

SECTION 8.01 _Satisfaction and Discharge of Indenture_. Upon the request of
the Issuer, this Indenture will cease to be of further effect (except as
to surviving rights of registration of transfer or exchange of the Notes,
as expressly provided for herein or pursuant hereto), the Issuer will
be discharged from its obligations under the Notes, and the Trustee, at
the expense of the Issuer, will execute proper instruments
acknowledging satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture and the Notes
when:

  



  

(a) either (i) all the Notes theretofore authenticated and delivered (other
than mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes that have been replaced or
paid) have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation or (ii) all Notes
not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation have become due
and payable or an irrevocable notice of redemption with respect to all Notes
has been sent by the Issuer in accordance with the terms of this Indenture
and the Issuer has irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited in trust
with the Trustee solely for the benefit of the Holders money, Government
Notes or a combination thereof, in an amount sufficient to pay and discharge
the entire Debt on such Notes not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for
cancellation, for principal and interest on the Notes to the date of such
deposit (in the case of Notes that have become due and payable) or the date
of redemption, as applicable;

  



  

(b) the Issuer has paid or caused to be paid all sums payable under this
Indenture by the Issuer; and

  



  

(c) the Issuer has delivered to the Trustee an Officers Certificate and an
Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent provided in
this Indenture relating to the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture
and the Notes have been complied with.

  



         
 

  



  

The Trustee shall hold in trust money or Government Notes (including
proceeds thereof) deposited with it pursuant to this Section 8.01. It shall
apply the deposited money and the money from Government Notes through each
Paying Agent and in accordance with this Indenture to the payment of
principal of and interest on the Notes so discharged.

  



  

Notwithstanding the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture, the
obligations of the Issuer to the Trustee under Section 7.07 and, if money
shall have been deposited with the Trustee pursuant to clause (a)(ii) of this
Section, the obligations of the Trustee under this Article VIII and Section
2.04 shall survive.

  



  

SECTION 8.02 _Reinstatement_. If the Trustee or Paying Agent is unable
to apply any United States dollars or Government Notes in accordance with
this Article VIII by reason of any order or judgment of any court or
Governmental Authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting such
application, then the Issuers obligations under this Indenture and the Notes
shall be revived and reinstated as though no deposit had occurred pursuant to
this Article VIII until such time as the Trustee or Paying Agent is permitted
to apply all such money in accordance with this Article VIII; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, if the Issuer makes any payment of principal of or interest
on any Note following the reinstatement of its obligations, the Issuer shall
be subrogated to the rights of the Holders of such Notes to receive such
payment from the money held by the Trustee or Paying Agent.

  



  

SECTION 8.03 _Repayment to the Issuer_. Any money deposited with the Trustee
or any Paying Agent, or then held by the Issuer or its Wholly Owned
Subsidiary, in trust for the payment of the principal of or interest on any
Note and remaining unclaimed for two years after such principal or
interest has become due and payable shall be paid to the Issuer on its
request or (if then held by the Issuer or its Wholly Owned Subsidiary) shall
be discharged from such trust; and the Holder of such Note shall thereafter,
as an unsecured general creditor, look only to the Issuer for payment
thereof, and all liability of the Trustee or such Paying Agent with respect
to such trust money, and all liability of the Issuer as trustee thereof,
shall thereupon cease; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Trustee or such
Paying Agent, before being required to make any such repayment, may at the
expense of the Issuer, cause to be published once, in the New York Times
(national edition) and the Wall Street Journal (national edition), notice
that such money remains unclaimed and that, after a date specified therein,
which shall not be less than 30 days from the date of such notification or
publication, any unclaimed balance of such money then remaining will be
repaid to the Issuer.

# **AMENDMENTS**

SECTION 9.01 _Without Consent of Holders_. The Issuer and the Trustee may
amend or supplement this Indenture or the Notes by the execution of a
supplemental indenture without notice to or consent of any Noteholder:

  



  

(1) to cure any ambiguity, omission, mistake, defect or inconsistency;

  



        
   

  



  

(2) to provide for the assumption of the Issuers obligations to Holders in
the case of a merger, consolidation or sale of assets in accordance with
Article V of this Indenture;

  



  

(3) to make any change that would provide any additional rights or benefits
to the Holders (including additional covenants, events of default, guarantees
or security) or that, as determined by the Board of Directors of the Issuer
in good faith, does not materially adversely affect the legal rights of any
such Holder under this Indenture or the Notes;

  



  

(4) to comply with requirements of the SEC in order to effect or maintain the
qualification of this Indenture under the TIA; and

  



  

(5) to evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under this
Indenture of a successor Trustee pursuant to the terms of this Indenture.

  



  

After a supplemental indenture under this Section becomes effective, the
Issuer shall mail to Noteholders a notice briefly describing such
supplemental indenture. The failure to give such notice to all Noteholders,
or any defect therein, shall not impair or affect the validity of a
supplemental indenture under this Section.

  



  

SECTION 9.02 _With Consent of Holders_. The Issuer and the Trustee may amend
or supplement this Indenture or the Notes by the execution of a supplemental
indenture without notice to any Noteholder but with the written consent of
the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes
then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase
of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes), and any existing default
or compliance with any provisions of this Indenture or the Notes may be
waived in accordance with Section 6.04 of this Indenture. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, without the consent of each Holder affected, a
supplemental indenture or waiver shall not (with respect to any Notes held by
a non-consenting Holder):

  



  

(1) reduce the principal amount of Notes whose Holders must consent to an
amendment, supplement or waiver;

  



  

(2) reduce the principal of or change the fixed maturity of any Note;

  



  

(3) reduce the rate of or change the time for payment of interest on any
Note;

  



  

(4) waive a Default in the payment of principal or interest on the Notes
(except a rescission of acceleration of the Notes by the Holders of at least
a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding and a
waiver of the payment default that resulted from such acceleration) or make
any change to Section 6.07;

  



  

(5) make any Note payable in money other than United States dollars;

  



  

(6) impair the rights of Holders to receive payments of principal or interest
on the Notes on or after the due dates therefor or to institute suit for the
enforcement of any payment on or with respect to any Notes; or

  



        
   

  



  

(7) make any change to this Section 9.02.

  



  

It shall not be necessary for the consent of the Holders under this Section
9.02 to approve the particular form of any proposed supplemental indenture,
but it shall be sufficient if such consent approves the substance thereof.

  



  

After a supplemental indenture under this Section becomes effective, the
Issuer shall mail to Noteholders a notice briefly describing such
supplemental indenture. The failure to give such notice to all Noteholders,
or any defect therein, shall not impair or affect the validity of a
supplemental indenture under this Section.

  



  

No amendment may be made to Article X of this Indenture that
adversely affects the rights of any holder of Senior Debt of the Issuer then
outstanding unless the holders of such Senior Debt (or any group or
Representative thereof authorized to give a consent) consent to such change.

  



        
   

  



  

SECTION 9.03 _Compliance with Trust Indenture Act_.  Notwithstanding any
other provision herein to the contrary, every supplemental indenture to this
Indenture or the Notes shall comply with the TIA as then in effect.

  



  

SECTION 9.04 _Revocation and Effect of Consents and Waivers_.  A consent to
a supplemental indenture or a waiver by a Holder shall bind such Holder and
every subsequent Holder of such Note or portion of the Note that evidences
the same debt as the consenting Holders Note, even if notation of the
consent or waiver is not made on the Note. However, any such Holder or
subsequent Holder may revoke the consent or waiver as to such Holders Note
or portion of the Note if the Trustee receives written notice of revocation
before the date the supplemental indenture or waiver becomes effective. After
a supplemental indenture or waiver becomes effective, it shall bind every
Noteholder. Except if otherwise specified in such supplemental indenture or
waiver, a supplemental indenture or waiver becomes effective once the
requisite number of consents are received by the Issuer or the Trustee. The
Issuer may, but shall not be obligated to, fix a record date for the purpose
of determining the Holders entitled to give their consent or take any other
action described above or required or permitted to be taken pursuant to this
Indenture. If a record date is fixed, then notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Section 9.04, those Persons who were Holders at such record
date (or their duly designated proxies), and only those Persons, shall be
entitled to give such consent or to revoke any consent previously given or to
take any such action, whether or not such Persons continue to be Holders
after such record date.

  



  

SECTION 9.05 _Notation on or Exchange of Notes_. If a supplemental indenture
changes the terms of a Note, the Trustee may require the Holder of the Note
to deliver such Note to the Trustee. The Trustee may place an appropriate
notation on the Note regarding the changed terms and return it to the Holder.
Alternatively, if the Issuer or the Trustee so determines, the Issuer in
exchange for the Note shall issue and the Trustee shall authenticate a new
Note that reflects the changed terms. Failure to make the appropriate notation
or to issue a new Note shall not affect the validity of such
supplemental indenture.

  



  

SECTION 9.06 _Trustee To Sign Supplemental Indentures_. The Trustee shall
sign any supplemental indenture authorized pursuant to this Article IX if
such supplemental indenture does not adversely affect the rights,
duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee.  If it does, the Trustee
may but need not sign it. In signing such supplemental indenture the Trustee
shall be entitled to receive indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it and to
receive, and (subject to Section 7.01) shall be fully protected in relying
upon, an Officers Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel stating that such
supplemental indenture is authorized or permitted by this Indenture,
that such supplemental indenture is the legal, valid and binding obligation
of the Issuer, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, subject
to customary exceptions, and complies with the provisions hereof (including
Section 9.03).

  



  

SECTION 9.07 _Payment for Consent_. Neither the Issuer nor any Affiliate of
the Issuer shall, directly or indirectly, pay or cause to be paid any
consideration, whether by way of interest, fee or otherwise, to any Holder
for or as an inducement to any consent, waiver or amendment of any of the
terms or provisions of this Indenture or the Notes unless such consideration
is offered to be paid to all Holders that so consent, waive or agree to amend
in the time frame set forth in solicitation documents relating to such
consent, waiver or agreement.

  



        
   

  



  

# **ARTICLE X**

  

# 

  

# **SUBORDINATION**

  

# 

  

SECTION 10.01 _Subordination_. The Issuer agrees, and each Holder
by accepting a Note agrees, that the Obligations with respect to the
Notes (including principal of, interest on and all other amounts with respect
to the Notes) are subordinated and junior in right of payment, to the extent
and in the manner provided in this Article X, to the prior payment in full
in cash of all Senior Debt (whether outstanding on the date hereof or
hereafter created, incurred, assumed or guaranteed); that the subordination
is for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable directly by, the holders of
Senior Debt, and that each holder of Senior Debt whether now outstanding or
hereafter created, incurred, assumed or guaranteed shall be deemed to have
acquired Senior Debt in reliance upon the covenants and provisions contained
in this Indenture and the Notes.

  



  

SECTION 10.02 _No Payment on Notes in Certain Circumstances_.  If any
default occurs and is continuing in the payment when due, whether at
maturity, upon redemption, by declaration or otherwise, of any principal
of, interest on, unpaid drawings for letters of credit issued in respect of,
or regularly accruing fees with respect to, any Designated Senior Debt, no
payment of any kind or character shall be made by, or on behalf of, the
Issuer or any other Person on its or their behalf with respect to any
Obligations on the Notes, or to acquire any of the Notes for cash or property
or otherwise. In addition, if any other event of default occurs and is
continuing with respect to any Designated Senior Debt, as such event of
default is defined in the instrument creating or evidencing such Designated
Senior Debt, permitting the holders of such Designated Senior Debt then
outstanding to accelerate the maturity thereof and if the Representative for
the respective issue of Designated Senior Debt gives written notice of such
event of default to the Trustee (a " _Default Notice_ "), then, unless and
until all such events of default have been cured or waived or have ceased to
exist or the Trustee receives notice thereof from the Representative for the
respective issue of Designated Senior Debt terminating the Blockage Period
(as defined below), during the 179 days after the delivery of such Default
Notice (the " _Blockage Period_ "), neither the Issuer nor any other Person
on its behalf shall (x) make any payment of any kind or character with
respect to any Obligations on the Notes (other than payment of amounts
already deposited in accordance with the satisfaction and discharge
provisions of this Indenture) or (y) acquire any of the Notes for cash or
property or otherwise. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no
event will a Blockage Period extend beyond 180 days from the date the payment
on the Notes was due and only one such Blockage Period may be commenced
within any 360 consecutive days. No event of default which existed or was
continuing on the date of the commencement of any Blockage Period with
respect to the Designated Senior Debt shall be, or be made, the basis for the
commencement of a second Blockage Period by the Representative of such
Designated Senior Debt whether or not within a period of 360
consecutive days, unless such event of default shall have been cured or
waived for a period of not less than 90 consecutive days (it being
acknowledged that any subsequent action or any breach of any financial
covenants for a period commencing after the date of commencement of such
Blockage Period that, in either case, would give rise to an event of default
pursuant to any provisions under which an event of default previously existed
or was continuing shall constitute a new event of default for this purpose).

  



        
   

  



  

SECTION 10.03 _Distributions in Liquidation or Bankruptcy_. Upon any
distribution to creditors of the Issuer in a liquidation or dissolution
of the Issuer or in a bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, receivership
or similar proceeding relating to the Issuer or its property, in an
assignment for the benefit of creditors or any marshaling of the Issuers
assets and liabilities:

  



  

(a) holders of Senior Debt will be entitled to receive payment in full in
cash of all Obligations due in respect of such Senior Debt (including
interest after the commencement of any bankruptcy proceeding at the rate
specified in the applicable Senior Debt) before Holders will be entitled to
receive any payment with respect to the Notes; and

  



  

(b) until all Obligations with respect to Senior Debt (as provided in the
preceding clause (a) above) are paid in full in cash, any distribution to
which Holders would be entitled but for this Article X will be made to
holders of Senior Debt, as their interests may appear.

  



  

SECTION 10.04 _Notice of Event of Default and Acceleration_.  The Issuer
shall deliver to the holders of Senior Debt or their Representative, as soon
as possible and in any event within 30 days after the Issuer becomes aware of
the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default, notice of such Default or
Event of Default.

  



  

If payment of the Notes is accelerated because of an Event of Default, the
Issuer will promptly notify holders of Senior Debt or their Representative of
such acceleration.

  



  

SECTION 10.05 _When Distribution Must be Paid Over_. In the event that the
Trustee or any Holder receives any payment of any Obligations with respect to
the Notes at a time when the Trustee or such Holder, as applicable, has
actual knowledge that such payment is prohibited by this Article X, such
payment will be held by the Trustee or such Holder, in trust for the benefit
of, and will be paid forthwith over and delivered, upon written request, to,
the holders of Senior Debt as their interests may appear or their
Representative under the agreement, indenture or other document (if any)
pursuant to which Senior Debt may have been issued, as their respective
interests may appear, for application to the payment of all Obligations with
respect to Senior Debt remaining unpaid to the extent necessary to pay such
Obligations in full in accordance with their terms, after giving effect to
any concurrent payment or distribution to or for the holders of Senior Debt.

  



  

SECTION 10.06 _Duties of Trustee_. With respect to the holders of Senior
Debt, the Trustee undertakes to perform only those obligations on the part of
the Trustee as are specifically set forth in this Article X, and no implied
covenants or obligations with respect to the holders of Senior Debt will be
read into this Indenture against the Trustee. The Trustee will not be deemed
to owe any fiduciary duty to the holders of Senior Debt, and will not be
liable to any such holders if the Trustee pays over or distributes to or
on behalf of Holders or the Issuer or any other Person money or assets to
which any holders of Senior Debt are then entitled by virtue of this Article
X, except if such payment is made as a result of the willful misconduct or
gross negligence of the Trustee.

  



  

SECTION 10.07 _Notice of Violations_. The Issuer will promptly notify the
Trustee and the Paying Agent of any facts known to the Issuer that would
cause a payment of any

  



        
   

  



  

Obligations with respect to the Notes to violate this Article X, but failure
to give such notice will not affect the subordination of the Notes to the
Senior Debt as provided in this Article X.

  



  

SECTION 10.08 _Subrogation_. After all Senior Debt is paid in full and until
the Notes are paid in full, Holders will be subrogated (equally and ratably
with all other Debt _pari passu_  with the Notes) to the rights of holders of
Senior Debt to receive distributions applicable to Senior Debt to the extent
that distributions otherwise payable to the Holders have been applied to the
payment of Senior Debt. A distribution made under this Article X to holders
of Senior Debt that otherwise would have been made to Holders is not, as
between the Issuer and Holders, a payment by the Issuer on the Notes.

  



  

SECTION 10.09 _No Impairment_. This Article X defines the relative rights of
Holders and holders of Senior Debt. Nothing in this Indenture will:

  



  

(a) impair, as between the Issuer and Holders, the obligation of the Issuer,
which is absolute and unconditional, to pay principal of and interest on the
Notes in accordance with their terms;

  



  

(b) affect the relative rights of Holders and creditors of the Issuer other
than their rights in relation to holders of Senior Debt; or

  



  

(c) prevent the Trustee or any Holder of Notes from exercising its available
remedies upon a Default or Event of Default, subject to the rights of holders
and owners of Senior Debt to receive distributions and payments otherwise
payable to Holders.

  



  

SECTION 10.10 _Right of Senior Debt to Enforce_. No right of any holder of
Senior Debt to enforce the subordination of the Debt evidenced by the Notes
may be impaired by any act or failure to act by the Issuer or any Holder or
by the failure of the Issuer or any Holder to comply with this Indenture.

  



  

SECTION 10.11 _Notice to Senior Debt_. Whenever a distribution is to be made
or a notice given to holders of Senior Debt, the distribution may be made and
the notice given to such holders or their Representative.

  



  

Upon any payment or distribution of assets of the Issuer referred to in this
Article X, the Trustee and the Holders will be entitled to rely upon any
order or decree made by any court of competent jurisdiction or upon any
certificate of such Representative or of the liquidating trustee or agent or
other Person making any distribution to the Trustee or to the Holders for the
purpose of ascertaining the Persons entitled to participate in such
distribution, the holders of the Senior Debt and other Debt of the Issuer,
the amount thereof or payable thereon, the amount or amounts paid or
distributed thereon and all other facts pertinent thereto or to this Article
X.

  



  

SECTION 10.12 _Knowledge of Trustee_. The provisions of this Article X or
any other provision of this Indenture notwithstanding, the Trustee will
not be charged with knowledge of the existence of any facts that would
prohibit the making of any payment or distribution by the Trustee, and the
Trustee and the Paying Agent may continue to make payments on the Notes,
unless the Trustee has received at its Corporate Trust Office at least five
Business Days prior to the date of such payment written notice of facts that
would cause the

  



        
   

  



  

payment of any Obligations with respect to the Notes to violate this Article
X. Only the Issuer or a Representative may give the notice. Nothing in this
Article X will impair the claims of, or payments to, the Trustee under or
pursuant to Section 7.07.

  



  

SECTION 10.13 _Authorization to Effect Subordination; Power of Attorney_.
 Each Holder of Notes, by the Holders acceptance thereof, authorizes
and directs the Trustee on such Holders behalf to take such action as may
be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the subordination as provided in
this Article X, and appoints the Trustee to act as such Holders attorney-in-
fact for any and all such purposes. If the Trustee does not file a proper
proof of claim or proof of debt in the form required in any proceeding
referred to in Section 6.09 of this Indenture at least 30 days before the
expiration of the time to file such claim, the Representatives are hereby
authorized to file an appropriate claim on behalf of the Holders.

  



  

SECTION 10.14 _Modification_. The provisions of this Article X may only be
amended or modified in accordance with the provisions of Section 9.02 of this
Indenture.

  



  

SECTION 10.15 _This Article X Not to Prevent Events of Default_. The
provisions of this Article X shall not be construed as preventing the
occurrence of an Event of Default due to the failure to make a payment on
account of principal of or interest on the Notes by reason of any provision
of this Article X.

Any notice or communication mailed to a Noteholder shall be made in
compliance with Section 313(c) of the TIA and mailed, first-class mail, to
the Noteholder at the Noteholders address as it appears on the registration
books of the Registrar and shall be sufficiently given if so mailed within
the time prescribed.

  



  

Failure to mail a notice or communication to a Noteholder or any defect in it
shall not affect its sufficiency with respect to other Noteholders. If a
notice or communication is mailed in the manner provided above, it is duly
given, whether or not the addressee receives it.

  



  

SECTION 11.03 _Communication by Holders with Other Holders_.  Noteholders
may communicate pursuant to Section 312(b) of the TIA with other Noteholders
with respect to their rights under this Indenture or the Notes. The Issuer,
the Trustee, the Registrar and anyone else shall have the protection of
Section 312(c) of the TIA.

  



  

SECTION 11.04 _Certificate and Opinion as to Conditions Precedent_.  Upon
any request or application by the Issuer to the Trustee to take or refrain
from taking any action under this Indenture, at the request of the Trustee
the Issuer shall furnish to the Trustee:

  



  

(1) an Officers Certificate in form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee
(which shall include the statements set forth in Section 11.05 hereof)
stating that, in the opinion of the signers, all conditions precedent, if
any, provided for in this Indenture relating to the proposed action have been
complied with; and

  



  

(2) an Opinion of Counsel in form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee
(which shall include the statements set forth in Section 11.05 hereof)
stating that, in the opinion of such counsel, all such conditions precedent
have been complied with.

  



  

To the extent applicable, the Issuer shall comply with Section 314(c)(3)
of the TIA.

  



  

SECTION 11.05 _Statements Required in Certificate or Opinion_.  Each
certificate or opinion with respect to compliance with a covenant or
condition provided for in this Indenture (other than pursuant to Section
4.04) shall include:

  



  

(1) a statement that the individual making such certificate or opinion has
read such covenant or condition;

  



        
   

  



  

(2) a brief statement as to the nature and scope of the examination or
investigation upon which the statements or opinions contained in such
certificate or opinion are based;

  



  

(3) a statement that, in the opinion of such individual, he has made such
examination or investigation as is necessary to enable him to express an
informed opinion as to whether or not such covenant or condition has been
complied with; and

  



  

(4) a statement as to whether or not, in the opinion of such individual, such
covenant or condition has been complied with; _provided_ , _however_ , that
with respect to matters of fact an Opinion of Counsel may rely on an
Officers Certificate or certificates of public officials.

  



  

SECTION 11.06 _When Notes Disregarded_. In determining whether the Holders
of the required principal amount of Notes have concurred in any direction,
waiver or consent, Notes owned by the Issuer or by any Person directly or
indirectly controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common
control with the Issuer shall be disregarded and deemed not to
be outstanding, except that, for the purpose of determining whether the
Trustee shall be protected in relying on any such direction, waiver or
consent, only Notes which the Trustee actually knows are so owned shall be
so disregarded. Also, subject to the foregoing, only Notes outstanding at
the time shall be considered in any such determination.

  



         
 

  



  

SECTION 11.07 _Rules by Trustee, Paying Agent and Registrar_.  The Trustee
may make reasonable rules for action by or a meeting of Noteholders. The
Registrar and the Paying Agent may make reasonable rules for their functions.

Business Day, payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and
no interest shall accrue for the intervening period.

  



  

SECTION 11.09 _GOVERNING LAW_. THIS INDENTURE AND THE NOTES SHALL BE
GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW
YORK BUT WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO APPLICABLE PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW

BE REQUIRED THEREBY.

  



  

SECTION 11.10 _No Recourse Against Others_. A director, officer,
incorporator, employee, stockholder or Affiliate of the Issuer shall not have
any liability for any obligations of the Issuer under the Notes,
this Indenture, or for any claim based on, in respect of or by reason of
such obligations or its creation. By accepting a Note, each Noteholder
waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release shall be part
of the consideration for the issue of the Notes.  Such waiver may not be
effective to waive liabilities under the federal securities laws and it is
the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.

  



  

SECTION 11.11 _Successor_. All agreements of the Issuer in this Indenture and
the Notes shall bind its successors. All agreements of the Trustee in
this Indenture shall bind its successors.

  



  

SECTION 11.12 _Multiple Originals_. The parties may sign any number of
copies of this Indenture. Each signed copy shall be an original, but all of

 **[** FORM OF REVERSE SIDE OF NOTE **]**

  



  

[ ]% Subordinated Notes due [2010]

  



  

 **1. _Interest; Calculation of Interest Rate_**

  



  

[HOLDING COMPANY], a [Delaware] corporation (the " _Issuer_ "), promises to
pay interest on the principal amount of this Note at the rate per annum
shown above.

  



  

The Issuer shall pay interest in arrears on [MATURITY DATE] (the " _Maturity
Date_ "). Interest on this Note will accrue from the Issue Date. Interest
shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day
months. The Issuer shall pay interest on overdue principal at the rate borne
by this Note, and it shall pay interest on overdue installments of interest
at the same rate to the extent lawful.

  



  

 **2. _Method of Payment_**

  



  

The Issuer shall pay interest (except defaulted interest) on the Notes to
the Persons who are registered Holders on the Maturity Date. Holders must
surrender Notes to a Paying Agent to collect principal payments. The Issuer
will pay principal and interest in money of the United States of America that
at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private
debts.  However, the Issuer may pay principal and interest by check payable
in such money or by wire transfer of federal funds.

  



  

 **3. _Paying Agent and Registrar_**

  



  

Initially,  **[** Name of Trustee **]** (the " _Trustee_ ") will act as
Paying Agent and Registrar. The Issuer may appoint and change any Paying
Agent or Registrar without notice to the Holders. The Issuer or any
domestically organized Wholly Owned Subsidiary of the Issuer may act as
Paying Agent or Registrar.

  



  

The Issuer shall retain possession of the Notes as custodian for the Holders.
Holders of the Notes will be entitled to physical delivery of their
respective Note upon written request to the Issuer. Except for any Notes
delivered to Holders pursuant to written request by such Holders to the
Issuer, the Notes will at all times be held by the Issuer.

  



  

 **4. _Indenture_**

  



  

The Issuer issued the Notes under the Indenture dated as of [ ], 2009
(the " _Indenture_ ") between the Issuer and the Trustee. The terms of the
Notes include those stated in the Indenture and those made part of the
Indenture by reference to the TIA. The Notes are subject to all such terms,
and Noteholders are referred to the Indenture and the TIA for a statement of
those terms. Defined terms used but not defined herein have the meanings
ascribed thereto in the Indenture.

  



        
   

  



  

The Notes are subordinated obligations of the Issuer and are limited to $[
] in aggregate principal amount outstanding.  This Note is one of the Notes
referred to in the Indenture.

  



  

 **5. _Redemption_**

  



  

This Note will be subject to redemption at any time at the option of the
Issuer, in whole or in part, at 100% of principal amount plus accrued and
unpaid interest thereon, if any, to the Redemption Date.  Notice of
redemption shall be given by the Issuer, or at the Issuers written request,
by the Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Issuer, not less than 20
days and not more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date (which date may
be extended in accordance with applicable law) to each Holder at such
Holders registered address; _provided_ that a notice of redemption may be
mailed more than 60 days prior to a Redemption Date if such notice is issued
in connection with the satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture pursuant
to Section 8.01 of the Indenture. Notices of redemption shall be mailed
by first-class mail to each Holder of Notes to be redeemed at its
registered address. If the Issuer is redeeming less than all of the
outstanding Notes, selection of Notes for redemption will be made by such
method as the Trustee shall reasonably deem fair and appropriate, including,
without limitation, on a pro rata basis or by lot. If the Notes are to be
redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to such Note
shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed.  On
and after the Redemption Date, interest ceases to accrue on Notes or portions
of them called for redemption.

  



  

 **6. _Subordination_**

  



  

The Notes are subordinated to Senior Debt of the Issuer upon the terms
and conditions set forth in the Indenture.  To the extent provided in the
Indenture, Senior Debt of the Issuer must be paid before the Notes may be
paid. Each Holder of Notes, by the Holders acceptance hereof, authorizes and
directs the Trustee on such Holders behalf to take such action as may be
necessary or appropriate to effectuate the subordination as provided in the
Indenture, and appoints the Trustee to act as such Holders attorney-in-fact
for any and all such purposes.

  



  

 **7. _Denominations; Transfer; Exchange_**

  



  

The Notes may be issued in denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples
of $1,000, or in any such smaller denominations as is necessary to allow the
issuance of Notes with an original principal amount as the Issuer would be
required to deliver upon redemption of the Issuers Class R Common Stock in
accordance with the terms thereof and the Merger Agreement. A Holder may
transfer or exchange Notes only in accordance with the Indenture. Upon
any registration of transfer or exchange, the Registrar and the Trustee may
require a Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements or
transfer documents and to pay any taxes required by law or permitted by
the Indenture. The Registrar shall not be required to register the transfer
of or exchange any Note selected for redemption in whole or in part, except
for the unredeemed portion of any Note being redeemed in part.

  



  

 **8. _Persons Deemed Owners_**

  



  

The registered Holder of this Note may be treated as the owner of it for
all purposes.

  



        
   

  



  

 **9. _Unclaimed Money_**

  



  

Any money deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent, or then held by
the Issuer or its Wholly Owned Subsidiary, in trust for the payment of
the principal of or interest on any Note and remaining unclaimed for two
years after such principal or interest has become due and payable shall be
paid to the Issuer on its request or (if then held by the Issuer or its
Wholly Owned Subsidiary) shall be discharged from such trust; and the Holder
of such Note shall thereafter, as an unsecured general creditor, look only to
the Issuer for payment thereof, and all liability of the Trustee or such
Paying Agent with respect to such trust money, and all liability of the
Issuer as trustee thereof, shall thereupon cease; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Trustee or such Paying Agent, before being required to make any such
repayment, may at the expense of the Issuer, cause to be published once, in
the New York Times (national edition) and the Wall Street Journal (national
edition), notice that such money remains unclaimed and that, after a date
specified therein, which shall not be less than 30 days from the date of such
notification or publication, any unclaimed balance of such money then
remaining will be repaid to the Issuer.

  



  

 **10. _Discharge_**

  



  

Subject to certain conditions set forth in the Indenture, the Issuer at any
time may terminate some or all of its obligations under the Indenture and the
Notes if the Issuer deposits with the Trustee cash in United States dollars
or Government Notes for the payment of principal and interest on the Notes
to maturity.

  



  

 **11. _Amendment, Waiver_**

  



  

Subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Indenture, (i) the Indenture
and the Notes may be amended or supplemented with the written consent of
the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes
then outstanding and (ii) any existing default or noncompliance with
any provision of the Indenture and the Notes may be waived with the consent
of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes
then outstanding.

  



  

Subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Indenture, without the consent
of any Noteholder, the Issuer and the Trustee may amend or supplement the
Indenture and the Notes (i) to cure any ambiguity, omission, mistake, defect
or inconsistency, (ii) to provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to
or in place of certificated Notes ( _provided_ that the uncertificated
Notes are issued in registered form for purposes of Section 163(f) of
the Code, or in a manner such that the uncertificated Notes are described in
Section 163(f)(2)(B) of the Code), (iii) to provide for the assumption of the
Issuers obligations to Holders in the case of a merger, consolidation or
sale of assets in accordance with Article V of the Indenture, (iv) to make
any change that would provide any additional rights or benefits to the
Holders (including additional covenants, events of default, guarantees or
security) or that, as determined by the Board of Directors of the Issuer in
good faith, does not materially adversely affect the legal rights of any such
Holder under the Indenture or the Notes, (v) to comply with requirements of
the SEC in order to effect or maintain the qualification of this Indenture
under the TIA and (vi) to evidence and provide for the acceptance and
appointment under this Indenture of a successor Trustee pursuant to the terms
of this Indenture.

  



     

      
 

  



  

 **12. _Defaults and Remedies_**

  



  

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default specified in Section
6.01(a)(3) or (4) of the Indenture) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee by
notice to the Issuer in writing, or the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate
principal amount of the outstanding Notes by notice in writing to the Issuer,
may declare the principal of and accrued but unpaid interest on all the Notes
to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal and interest
shall be due and payable immediately. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an
Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(a)(3) or (4) of the
Indenture occurs, the principal of and interest on all the Notes shall _ipso
facto_ become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or
other act on the part of the Trustee or any Noteholders.

  



  

 **13. _Trustee Dealings with the Issuer_**

  



  

Subject to certain limitations imposed by the TIA, the Trustee under the
Indenture, in its individual or any other capacity may deal with and collect
obligations owed to it by the Issuer or its Affiliates and may otherwise deal
with the Issuer or its Affiliates with the same rights it would have if it
were not Trustee.

  



  

 **14. _No Recourse Against Others_**

  



  

A director, officer, incorporator, employee, stockholder or Affiliate of
the Issuer shall not have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer
under the Notes, this Indenture, or for any claim based on, in respect of or
by reason of such obligations or its creation. By accepting a Note, each
Noteholder waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release
shall be part of the consideration for the issue of the Notes.

  



  

Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the federal
securities laws and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against
public policy.

  



  

 **15. _Governing Law_**

  



  

 **THE NOTES SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS
OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK BUT WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO APPLICABLE PRINCIPLES
OF CONFLICTS OF LAW TO THE EXTENT THAT THE APPLICATION OF THE LAWS OF ANOTHER
JURISDICTION WOULD BE REQUIRED THEREBY.**

  



  

 **16. _Authentication_**

  



  

This Note shall not be valid until an authorized signatory of the Trustee (or
an authenticating agent) manually signs the certificate of authentication on
the other side of this Note.

  



  

 **17. _Abbreviations_**

  



  

Customary abbreviations may be used in the name of a Noteholder or an
assignee, such as TEN COM (=tenants in common), TEN ENT (=tenants by the
entireties), JT TEN (=joint

  



        
   

  



  

tenants with rights of survivorship and not as tenants in common), CUST
(=custodian), and U/G/M/A (=Uniform Gift to Minors Act).

  



  

 **The Issuer will furnish to any Noteholder upon written request and without
charge to the Noteholder a copy of the Indenture which has in it the text of
this Note in larger type.  Requests may be made to:**
