WHEREAS the Board of Directors of each of the Company and Sub deems it in the
best interests of their respective corporations to consummate the merger (the
"Merger"), on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, of Sub with and into the Company in which the Company would become

Agreement, declared its advisability and recommended that this Agreement be
adopted by the shareholders of the Company or Sub, as the case may be;

  

  

WHEREAS Parent, Sub and the Company desire to make certain representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to
prescribe various conditions to the Merger;

  

  

WHEREAS concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and as
a condition to the willingness of Parent and Sub to enter into this Agreement,
certain shareholders of the Company are entering into Shareholder Agreements
with Parent in the form of Exhibit A hereto (the "Shareholder Agreements"),
pursuant to which such shareholders shall agree, among other things, to take
certain actions in furtherance of the Merger;

  

  

WHEREAS concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and as
a condition to the willingness of Parent to enter into this Agreement, certain
employees of the Company are entering into agreements with Parent pursuant to
which such employees shall agree, among other things, to certain non-

WHEREAS concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and as
a condition to the willingness of Parent to enter into this Agreement, certain
employees of the Company have executed offer letters regarding the employment

corporation (the "Surviving Corporation").

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

1  

  

 

 

 

  

SECTION 1.02. Closing. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will take
place at 10:00 a.m., New York time, on a date to be specified by the parties,
which shall be not later than the fifth business day after satisfaction or (to
the extent permitted by law) waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI
(other than those that by their terms are to be satisfied or waived at the
Closing, it being understood that the occurrence of the Closing shall remain
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the Closing), at
the offices of Cravath, Swaine and Moore LLP, 825 Eighth Avenue, New York, New
York 10019, unless another time, date or place is agreed to in writing by
Parent and the Company; provided, however, that if all the conditions set
forth in Article VI shall not have been satisfied or (to the extent permitted
by law) waived on such fifth business day, then the Closing shall take place
on the first business day on which all such conditions shall have been
satisfied or (to the extent permitted by law) waived. The date on which the
Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the "Closing Date".

  

  

SECTION 1.03. Effective Time of the Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, as soon as practicable on or after the
Closing Date, the parties shall properly file with the Department of State of
the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania articles of merger (the "Articles of Merger")
in such form as is required by, and executed and acknowledged in accordance
with, the relevant provisions of the PBCL. The Merger shall become effective
at such date and time as the Articles of Merger are duly filed with the
Department of State of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, at such subsequent date and time as Parent and
the Company shall agree and specify in the Articles of Merger. The date and
time at which the Merger becomes effective is referred to in this Agreement as
the "Effective Time".

  

  

SECTION 1.04. Effects of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in Section 1929 of the PBCL.

  

  

SECTION 1.05. Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws. (a)The articles of
incorporation of the Company as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be amended by virtue of the Merger at the Effective Time to be
identical to the articles of incorporation of Sub as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, except that Article I of such articles of
incorporation shall be amended to read as follows: "The name of the
corporation (hereinafter called the "Corporation") is Kenexa Corporation."

  

  

(b) The bylaws of Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or
amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

  

  

SECTION 1.06. Directors. The directors of Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation until the
earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors

ARTICLE II

  

  

Conversion of Securities

  

  

SECTION 2.01. Conversion of Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of
Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the "Company Common
Stock"), or the holder of any shares of capital stock of Sub:

  

  

(a) Capital Stock of Sub. Each issued and outstanding share of common stock of
Sub shall be converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share
of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

  

  

(b) Cancelation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock. All shares of
Company Common Stock that are owned as treasury stock by the Company or owned
by Parent or Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically
be canceled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered
or deliverable in exchange therefor.

  

  

(c) Conversion of Company Common Stock. Each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 2.01(b)) shall be converted
into the right to receive $46.00 in cash, without interest (the "Merger
Consideration"). At the Effective Time such shares shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and
each holder of a certificate or evidence of shares in book-entry form that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares (a
"Certificate") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement. The right of any holder of any share of Company Common Stock to
receive the Merger Consideration shall be subject to and reduced by the amount
of any withholding that is required under applicable tax Law, such withholding
to be pursuant to the terms of Section 2.02(f) and any applicable tax Law.

  

  

SECTION 2.02. Exchange of Certificates. (a)Paying Agent. Prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably
acceptable to the Company to act as agent for the payment of the Merger
Consideration upon surrender of Certificates (the "Paying Agent"), and, from
time to time after the Effective Time, Parent shall make available, or cause
the Surviving Corporation to make available, to the Paying Agent funds in
amounts and at the times necessary for the payment of the Merger Consideration
pursuant to Section 2.01(c) upon surrender of Certificates, it being
understood that all such funds shall be invested as directed by Parent and
that any and all interest or other amounts earned with respect to funds made
available to the Paying Agent pursuant to this Agreement shall be turned over
to Parent.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

3  

  

 

 

 

  

(b) Exchange Procedure. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation or Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail
to each holder of record of a Certificate (i) a form of letter of transmittal
(which shall include an accompanying substitute IRS Form W-9 or the applicable
IRS Form W-8, shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss
and title to the Certificates held by such person shall pass, only upon proper
delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in a form and
have such other provisions (including customary provisions regarding delivery
of an "agent's message" with respect to shares held in book-entry form) as
Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon
surrender of a Certificate for cancelation to the Paying Agent or to such
other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter
of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed, and such other documents
as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of
cash equal to the Merger Consideration that such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to Section 2.01(c), and the Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company
Common Stock that is not registered in the stock transfer books of the
Company, payment of the Merger Consideration in exchange therefor may be made
to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered
is registered if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be
in proper form for transfer and the person requesting such payment shall pay
any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment to a person
other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the
satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such tax has been paid or is
not applicable. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on the cash payable
upon surrender of any Certificate.

  

  

(c) No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. All Merger
Consideration paid upon the surrender of a Certificate in accordance with the
terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock
formerly represented by such Certificate. At the close of business on the day
on which the Effective Time occurs, the stock transfer books of the Company
shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on
the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the close of
business on the day on which the Effective Time occurs, Certificates are
presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for transfer or any
other reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article
II.

  

  

(d) No Liability. None of Parent, Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation
or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any Merger
Consideration that would otherwise have been payable in respect of any
Certificate which is delivered to a public official in accordance with any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificates
shall not have been surrendered prior to two years after the Effective Time
(or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any Merger Consideration
would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity),
any Merger Consideration payable in accordance with this Article II in respect
thereof shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property
of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any
person previously entitled thereto.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

4  

  

 

 

 

  

(e) Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen,
defaced or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed and,
if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond
in such amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Paying Agent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall pay the
Merger Consideration in respect of such lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed
Certificate.

  

  

(f) Withholding Rights. Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration and any
other amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
shares of Company Common Stock, Stock Options, Restricted Shares or RSUs such
amounts as Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent is required
to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or any provision of
state, local or foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld
and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares
of Company Common Stock, Stock Options, Restricted Shares or RSUs in respect
of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent.

  

  

(g) Termination of Fund. At any time following the six-month anniversary of
the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the
Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received with
respect thereto) that had been made available to the Paying Agent pursuant to
Section 2.02(a) and that have not been disbursed to holders of Certificates,
and thereafter, subject to time limitations in Section 2.02(d), such holders
shall be entitled to look only to Parent and the Surviving Corporation
(subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) as general
creditors thereof with respect to the payment of any Merger Consideration that
may be payable upon surrender of any Certificates held by such holders, as
determined pursuant to this Agreement, without any interest thereon.

Representations and Warranties

  

  

SECTION 3.01. Representations and Warranties of the Company. Except as set
forth in the letter (with specific reference to the Section of this Agreement
to which the information stated in such disclosure relates; provided, that
disclosure contained in any section of the Company Letter shall be deemed to
be disclosed with respect to any other Section of this Agreement to the extent
that it is readily apparent from the face of such disclosure that such
disclosure is applicable to such other Section of this Agreement) delivered by
the Company to Parent prior to the execution of this Agreement (the "Company
Letter"), the Company represents and warrants to Parent and Sub as follows:

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

5  

  

 

 

 

  

(a) Organization, Standing and Corporate Power. Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (i) is a corporation or other legal entity duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of
its organization (except, in the case of good standing, for entities organized
under the Laws of any jurisdiction that does not recognize such concept), (ii)
has all requisite corporate, company, partnership or other organizational
power and authority to carry on its business as currently conducted and (iii)
is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction (except, in the case of good standing, any jurisdiction that does
not recognize such concept) in which the nature of its business or the
ownership, leasing or operation of its properties makes such qualification or
licensing necessary, other than where the failure to be so organized,
existing, qualified or licensed or in good standing (except, in the case of
clause (i) above, with respect to the Company), individually or in the
aggregate, is not reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. The
Company has made available to Parent complete and correct copies of the
articles of incorporation of the Company, as amended to the date of this
Agreement (the "Company Articles"), and the bylaws of the Company, as amended
to the date of this Agreement (the "Company Bylaws"), and the articles of
incorporation and bylaws (or similar organizational documents) of each of its
Subsidiaries, in each case as amended to the date of this Agreement. The
Company has made available to Parent complete and correct copies of the
minutes (or, in the case of draft minutes, the most recent drafts thereof) of
all meetings of the shareholders, the Board of Directors and each committee of
the Board of Directors of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries held since
January 1, 2009 (other than portions of any minutes (or drafts thereof)
related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any Takeover
Proposal). The Company has made available to Parent complete and correct
copies of all resolutions of the Board of Directors of the Company, and each
committee thereof, in respect of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby.

and correct list of each Subsidiary of the Company, its place and form of
organization, its address and each jurisdiction in which it is authorized to

or by the Company and one or more wholly owned Subsidiaries of the Company,

interests or other encumbrances of any kind or nature whatsoever
(collectively, "Liens"), except for transfer restrictions imposed by
applicable securities Laws, and are duly authorized, validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable. Except for the capital stock of, or other equity or
voting interests in, its Subsidiaries, the Company does not own, directly or
indirectly, any capital stock of, or other equity or voting interests in, any
person.

  

  

(c) Capital Structure. (i)The authorized capital stock of the Company consists
of 100,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock and 10,000,000 shares of

As of the close of business on August 23, 2012, there were outstanding rights

Consideration). As of the last day of the most recent payroll period ending
prior to the date of this Agreement, the aggregate amount credited to the
accounts of participants in the ESPP was $176,914.14 and the aggregate amount
credited to such accounts for such payroll period was $37,822.76.

 

  

  

(ii) Except for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, Stock Options,
Restricted Shares and RSUs set forth in Section 3.01(c)(i), as of the close of
business on August 23, 2012, no shares of capital stock of, or other equity or
voting interests in, the Company, or securities convertible into, or
exchangeable or exercisable for, or options, warrants, shares of deferred
stock, restricted stock awards, stock appreciation rights, phantom stock
awards or other rights to acquire any such capital stock of, or other equity
or voting interests in, the Company, or other rights that are linked to the
value of Company Common Stock or the value of the Company or any part thereof,
were issued, reserved for issuance or outstanding. From the close of business
on August 23, 2012 to the date of this Agreement, (A) there have been no
issuances by the Company of shares of capital stock of, or other equity or
voting interests in, the Company, other than issuances of shares of Company

other rights that are linked to the value of Company Common Stock or the value
of the Company or any part thereof, other than rights under the ESPP.

  

  

(iii) All outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company are, and all
shares that may be issued pursuant to the Company Stock Plans will be, when
issued in accordance with the terms thereof, duly authorized, validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable and not subject to preemptive rights. Except as
set forth in this Section 3.01(c), there are no (A) bonds, debentures, notes
or other indebtedness of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and (B)
securities or other instruments or rights (including stock appreciation
rights, phantom stock awards or other similar rights) issued by, or other
obligations of, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case,

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

8  

  

 

 

  

  

that are linked to, or the value of which is in any way based upon or derived
from, the value of any class of capital stock of, or other equity or voting
interests in, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the value of the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any part thereof, or any dividends or
other distributions declared or paid on any shares of capital stock of, or
other equity or voting interests in, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
or which have or which by their terms may have at any time (whether actual or
contingent) the right to vote (or which are convertible into, or exchangeable
for, securities having the right to vote) on any matters on which shareholders
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries may vote (the items referred to in
clauses (A) and (B) collectively, "Equity Equivalents"). Except as set forth
in this Section 3.01(c), there are no securities, options, warrants, calls,
rights or Contracts of any kind to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party, or by which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
bound, obligating the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, deliver or
sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or sold, additional shares of capital
stock of, or other equity or voting interests in, or securities convertible
into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, shares of capital stock of, or other
equity or voting interests in, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
obligating the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, grant, extend or
enter into any such security, option, warrant, call, right or Contract. With
respect to the Stock Options, (1) each Stock Option intended to qualify as an
"incentive stock option" under Section 422 of the Code so qualifies, (2) each
grant of a Stock Option was duly authorized no later than the date on which
the grant of such Stock Option was by its terms to be effective (the "Grant
Date") by all necessary corporate action, including, as applicable, approval
by the Board of Directors of the Company (or a duly constituted and authorized
committee thereof) and any required shareholder approval by the necessary
number of votes or written consents, and the award agreement governing such
grant (if any) was duly executed and delivered by each party thereto, (3) each
such grant was made in accordance with the terms of the applicable Company
Stock Plan, the Exchange Act and all other applicable Laws and regulatory
rules or requirements, including the rules of The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC and
The New York Stock Exchange, as applicable, and any other exchange on which
Company securities are traded, (4) the per share exercise price of each Stock
Option was not less than the fair market value (within the meaning of Section
422 of the Code, in the case of each Stock Option intended to qualify as an
"incentive stock option" and within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code,
in the case of each other Stock Option) of a share of Company Common Stock on
the applicable Grant Date and (5) each such grant was properly accounted for
in accordance with GAAP in the financial statements (including the related
notes) of the Company and disclosed in the Company's SEC Documents in
accordance with the Exchange Act and all other applicable Laws. The ESPP
qualifies as an "employee stock purchase plan" within the meaning of Section
423(b) of the Code and Treasury Regulation Section 1.423-2. Each election
pursuant to Section 83(b) of the Code that has been made with respect to a
Restricted Share has been validly made in accordance with Section 83(b) of the
Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder, including with respect to
correctly reporting the fair market value of such Restricted Share on the
applicable Section 83(b) election form. Except pursuant to the forfeiture
conditions of the Stock Options, Restricted Shares and RSUs outstanding as of
the date of this Agreement and except pursuant to the cashless exercise or tax
withholding

provisions of such Stock Options, Restricted Shares and RSUs, in each case as
in effect on the date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding contractual
or other obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to (I)
repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of capital stock of, or
other equity or voting interests in, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
(II) vote or dispose of any shares of capital stock of, or other equity or
voting interests in, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The Company is
not a party to any voting agreement with respect to any shares of capital
stock of, or other equity or voting interests in, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and, other than the Shareholder Agreements, to the knowledge of
the Company, as of the date of this Agreement there are no irrevocable proxies
and no voting agreements with respect to any shares of capital stock of, or
other equity or voting interests in, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.
The Company has not knowingly granted, and there is no and has been no Company
policy or practice to grant, Stock Options prior to, or otherwise coordinate
the grant of Stock Options with, the release or other public announcement of
material information regarding the Company or its Subsidiaries or their
financial results or prospects.

 

  

  

(iv) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any (A) indebtedness
for borrowed money, (B) indebtedness evidenced by any bond, debenture, note,
mortgage, indenture or other debt instrument or debt security, (C) accounts
payable to trade creditors and accrued expenses not arising in the ordinary
course of business, (D) amounts owing as deferred purchase price for the
purchase of any property, (E) capital lease obligations or (F) guarantees with
respect to any indebtedness or obligation of a type described in clauses (A)
through (E) above of any other person (other than, in the case of clauses (A),
(B) and (D), accounts payable to trade creditors and accrued expenses, in each
case arising in the ordinary course of business) (collectively,
"indebtedness").

  

  

(v) All Stock Options, Restricted Shares and RSUs may, by their terms, be
treated in accordance with Section 5.04(a), and all rights to purchase shares
of Company Common Stock under the ESPP may, by their terms, be treated in
accordance with Section 5.04(b). No holder of any Stock Option, Restricted
Share, RSU or right under the ESPP is entitled to any treatment of such Stock
Option, Restricted Share, RSU or right under the ESPP other than as provided
with respect to such Stock Option, Restricted Share, RSU or right under the
ESPP in Section 5.04(a) or Section 5.04(b), as applicable, and after the
Closing no holder of a Stock Option, Restricted Share, RSU or right under the
ESPP (or former holder of a Stock Option, Restricted Share, RSU or right under
the ESPP) or any current or former participant in the Company Stock Plans or
any other Benefit Plan or Benefit Agreement shall have the right thereunder to
acquire any capital stock of the Company or any other equity interest therein
(including phantom stock or stock appreciation rights). All outstanding Stock
Options are evidenced by individual written stock option agreements (the
"Stock Option Agreements"), all outstanding Restricted Shares are evidenced by
individual written restricted share agreements (the "Restricted Share
Agreements") and all outstanding RSUs are evidenced by individual written
restricted stock unit agreements (the "RSU Agreements"), in each case
substantially identical to the applicable forms that have previously been made
available to Parent.

(d) Authority; Noncontravention. The Company has the requisite corporate power
and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to consummate the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to comply with
the provisions of this Agreement, subject, in the case of the consummation of
the Merger, to obtaining the Shareholder Approval. The execution and delivery
of this Agreement by the Company, the consummation by the Company of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
compliance by the Company with the provisions of this Agreement have been duly
authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company, and
no other corporate proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to
authorize this Agreement, to comply with the terms of this Agreement or to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, subject, in the case of the consummation of the Merger, to
obtaining the Shareholder Approval. This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by the Company and, assuming the due execution and delivery of this
Agreement by Parent and Sub, constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the
Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms except
as enforceability thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
conveyance, reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws relating to the
enforcement of creditors' rights generally and by general principles of equity
(the "Bankruptcy Exceptions"). The Board of Directors of the Company, at a

advisable this Agreement, the Shareholder Agreements, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including transactions under the

be submitted to a vote at a meeting of the Company's shareholders to be held
as set forth in Section 5.01(c) and (v) recommending that the Company's
shareholders adopt this Agreement, which resolutions, except to the extent
expressly permitted by Section 4.02, have not been rescinded, modified or
withdrawn in any way. The execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and compliance by the Company with the provisions of this Agreement
do not and will not conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of, or
default (with or without notice or lapse of time or both) under, or give rise
to a right of, or result in, termination, cancelation or acceleration of any
obligation or to a loss of a benefit under, or result in the creation of any
Lien in or upon any of the properties or assets of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries under, or give rise to any increased, additional, accelerated or
guaranteed rights or entitlements under (including any right of a holder of a
security of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to require the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to acquire such security), any provision of (A) the
Company Articles or the Company Bylaws or the articles of incorporation or
bylaws (or similar organizational documents) of any of its Subsidiaries,

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

11  

  

 

 

  

  

(B) any loan or credit agreement, bond, debenture, note, mortgage, indenture,
guarantee, lease or other contract, commitment, agreement, instrument,
arrangement, understanding, obligation, undertaking or license, whether oral
or written (each, including all amendments thereto, a "Contract"), or Permit
to or by which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or bound or
to or by which any of their respective properties or assets are subject or
bound or (C) subject to the governmental filings and other matters referred to
in the following sentence, any (1) Federal, state or local, domestic or
foreign, statute, law, code, ordinance, rule or regulation of any Governmental
Entity (each, a "Law"), assuming receipt of the Shareholder Approval and the
adoption of this Agreement by Parent, as the sole shareholder of Sub, or (2)
Federal, state or local, domestic or foreign, judgment, injunction, order,
writ or decree of any Governmental Entity (each, a "Judgment"), in each case,
applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective
properties or assets, other than, in the case of clauses (B) and (C), any such
conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults, terminations, cancelations,
accelerations, losses, Liens, rights or entitlements that, individually or in
the aggregate, are not reasonably likely to (x) have a Material Adverse Effect
or (y) impair in any material respect the ability of the Company to perform
its obligations under this Agreement. No consent, approval, order or

The Contracts of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of the type referred
to in clauses (A) through (V) of this subsection (i) are collectively referred
to in this Agreement as "Specified Contracts". The Company has made available
to Parent a complete and correct copy of each of the Specified Contracts and
the JV Agreements, including all amendments thereto. Each Contract of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is material to the Company and its
Subsidiaries (a "Material Contract"), as well as each Specified Contract and
JV Agreement, is in full force and effect (except for those Contracts that
have expired in accordance with their terms) and is a legal, valid and binding
agreement of the Company or such Subsidiary, as the case may be, and, to the
knowledge of the Company, of each other party thereto, enforceable against the
Company or such Subsidiary, as the case may be, and, to the knowledge of the
Company, against the other party or parties thereto, in each case, in

obligations required to be performed by it under the Material Contracts, the

consistent with past practice), and, to the knowledge of the Company, no other
party to any of the Material Contracts, Specified Contracts or JV Agreements
is (with or without notice or lapse of time or both) in breach in any material
respect or default thereunder. To the knowledge of the Company, as of the date
of this Agreement, there has occurred no event giving (with or without notice
or lapse of time or both) to others any right of termination, material
amendment or cancelation of any Material Contract, Specified Contract or JV
Agreement. To the knowledge of the Company, there are no circumstances that

the ability of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to perform its material
obligations under any Material Contract, Specified Contract or JV Agreement.

renew or requested any material amendment to any of its Major Customer

material respect to the Company or its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole), with
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

authorizations from any Governmental Entity (collectively, "Permits") that are
necessary for the Company and its Subsidiaries to own, lease or operate their
properties and assets and to carry on their businesses in all material
respects as currently conducted. Section 3.01(j) of the Company Letter sets

Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is, and since January 1, 2009 has
been, in compliance in all material respects with all applicable Laws and
Judgments, and no condition or state of facts exists that could reasonably be
expected to give rise to a material violation of, or a material liability or
default under, any applicable Law or Judgment. The execution and delivery of
this Agreement by the Company does not, and the consummation of the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and compliance with the
terms hereof could not reasonably be expected to, cause the revocation or
cancelation of any material Permit. As of the date of this Agreement, (i)
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any written
communication during the past three years from any person that alleges that
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is not in compliance in all material
respects with, or is subject to liability under, any Permit, Law or Judgment
or relating to the revocation or modification of any material Permit, and (ii)
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any notice that
any investigation or review by any Governmental Entity is pending with respect
to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of the material assets or
operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or that any such
investigation or review is contemplated.

into, established, terminated, amended or modified or agreed to adopt, enter
into, establish, terminate, amend or modify (or announced an intention to
adopt, enter into, establish, terminate, amend or modify) any collective
bargaining agreement or any employment, bonus, pension, profit sharing,

medical or other welfare benefit or other similar plan, program, policy,
arrangement or understanding (whether oral or written, formal or informal,
funded or unfunded and whether or not legally binding or subject to the Laws
of the United States) sponsored, maintained, contributed to or required to be
sponsored, maintained or contributed to by the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any other person or entity that, together with the Company, is
treated as a single employer under Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code
or with respect to which the Company is otherwise jointly or severally liable
under applicable Law (each, a "Commonly Controlled Entity"), in each case,
providing compensation or benefits to any Company Personnel, including the
Company Stock Plans, but not including the Benefit Agreements (all such plans,
programs, policies, arrangements and understandings, including any such plan,
program, policy, arrangement or understanding entered into, adopted or
established on or after the date of this Agreement, collectively, "Benefit
Plans"), or has made any change in any actuarial or other assumption used to

(ii) There are no collective bargaining or other labor union agreements to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of
them is bound. Since January 1, 2009 neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has encountered any labor union organizing activity, or had any
actual or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened employee strikes, work
stoppages, slowdowns or lockouts and, to the knowledge of the Company, no
labor union organizing activity, strike, work stoppage, slowdown or lockout is
threatened. None of the employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
represented by any labor union, works council or similar organization with
respect to his or her employment by the Company or such Subsidiary. The
Company and its Subsidiaries do not have any obligation (including to inform
or consult with any such employees or their representatives in respect of the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement) with respect
to any such organization. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is, and
since January 1, 2009 has been, in compliance in all material respects with
all applicable Laws and Judgments relating to labor relations, employment and
employment practices, occupational safety and health standards, terms and
conditions of employment, payment of wages, classification of employees,
immigration, visa, work status, human rights, pay equity and workers'
compensation, and is not, and since January 1, 2009 has not, engaged in any
unfair labor practice. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
received notice of any unfair labor practice charge or complaint against the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is pending or, to the knowledge of the
Company, threatened, in each case before the National Labor Relations Board or
any comparable Governmental Entity. No question concerning representation has
been raised or is, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened respecting the
employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. No grievance or
arbitration proceeding arising out of a collective bargaining agreement is
pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries.

and has been, in compliance in all material respects with all Environmental
Laws, and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any (A)

Environmental Claims pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened
against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; (iv) there has been no Release
of or exposure to any Hazardous Material that is reasonably likely to form the
basis of any Environmental Claim against the Company or any of its

obligations that are reasonably likely to form the basis of any Environmental
Claim against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries;

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

23  

  

 

 

  

  

(vi) there are no underground or aboveground storage tanks, generators or

Company nor any of its Subsidiaries stores, generates or disposes of Hazardous
Materials (excluding office, cleaning or similar supplies used in the ordinary

about or from property owned or leased by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries; and (viii) there are no past or present events, conditions,
circumstances, activities, practices, incidents, actions or plans that are
reasonably likely to form the basis of a material Environmental Claim against
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

all administrative, regulatory or judicial actions, suits, Judgments, demands,
directives, claims, Liens, investigations, proceedings or written or oral
notices of noncompliance or violation by or from any person alleging liability
of any kind or nature (including liability or responsibility for the costs of

removal or remediation, natural resource damages, property damages, personal
injuries, medical monitoring, penalties, contribution, indemnification and
injunctive relief) arising out of, based on or resulting from (x) the presence
or Release of, or exposure to, any Hazardous Material at any location, or (y)
the failure to comply with any Environmental Law; (2) "Environmental Law"
means any Law, Judgment, legally binding agreement or Permit issued,
promulgated or entered into by or with any Governmental Entity relating to

land surface or subsurface strata), natural resources, the climate, human
health and safety or the protection of endangered or threatened species; (3)
"Hazardous Materials" means any petroleum or petroleum products, radioactive
materials or wastes, asbestos in any form, polychlorinated biphenyls,

(m) Employee Benefits Matters. (i) Section 3.01(m)(i) of the Company Letter
sets forth a complete and correct list of all "employee welfare benefit plans"
(as defined in Section 3(1) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974, as amended ("ERISA")), all "employee pension benefit plans" (as defined
in Section 3(2) of ERISA) (each, a "Pension Plan") and all other Benefit Plans
and Benefit Agreements that, in each case, are in effect as of the date of
this Agreement. The Company has delivered or made available to Parent complete
and correct copies of (A) each Benefit Plan and each Benefit Agreement (or, in
the case of any unwritten Benefit Plans or Benefit Agreements, written
descriptions thereof), including any amendments thereto, (B) the two most
recent annual reports, or such similar reports, statements, information
returns or material correspondence required to be filed with or delivered to
any Governmental Entity, if any, with respect to each Benefit Plan (including
reports filed on Form 5500 with accompanying schedules and attachments),

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

24  

  

 

 

  

  

(C) the most recent summary plan description (if any), and any summary of
material modifications, prepared for each Benefit Plan for which a summary
plan description is required under applicable Law, (D) each trust agreement
and group annuity or insurance Contract and other documents relating to the
funding or payment of compensation or benefits under each Benefit Plan and
Benefit Agreement (if any) and (E) the two most recent actuarial valuations
for each Benefit Plan (if any). Each Benefit Plan and Benefit Agreement has
been administered, funded and, to the extent applicable, the assets of such
Benefit Plan or Benefit Agreement have been invested in all material respects
in accordance with its terms. The Company and its Subsidiaries and each
Benefit Plan and Benefit Agreement are in compliance in all material respects
with applicable Law, including ERISA and the Code, and the terms of any
collective bargaining agreements or other labor union Contracts.

 

  

  

(ii) Each Pension Plan intended to be tax qualified under the Code has been
the subject of a favorable determination, qualification or opinion letter from
the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") with respect to all tax Law
changes with respect to which the IRS is currently willing to provide a
determination letter to the effect that such Pension Plan is qualified and
exempt from United States Federal income taxes under Sections 401(a) and
501(a), respectively, of the Code, and no such letter has been revoked (nor,
as of the date of this Agreement, has revocation been threatened) and no event
has occurred since the date of the most recent such letter or application
therefor relating to any such Pension Plan that could reasonably be expected
to adversely affect the qualification of such Pension Plan or increase the
costs relating thereto or require security under Section 307 of ERISA. Each
Benefit Plan required to have been approved by any non-United States
Governmental Entity (or permitted to have been approved to obtain any
beneficial tax or other status) has been so approved or timely submitted for
approval, no such approval has been revoked (nor, as of the date of this
Agreement, has revocation been threatened) and no event has occurred since the
date of the most recent approval or application therefor relating to any such
Pension Plan that could reasonably be expected to affect any such approval
relating thereto or increase the costs relating thereto. The Company has
delivered or made available to Parent a complete and correct copy of the most
recent determination, qualification, opinion or approval letter or similar
document received from a Governmental Entity with respect to each Benefit Plan
intended to qualify for favorable tax treatment or other status, as well as a
complete and correct copy of each pending application for a determination,
qualification, opinion or approval letter or similar document, if any, and a
complete and correct list of all amendments to any such Benefit Plans as to
which a favorable determination, qualification, opinion or approval letter has
not yet been received.

  

  

(iii) Neither the Company nor any Commonly Controlled Entity has sponsored,
maintained, contributed to or been obligated to sponsor, maintain or
contribute to, or has any actual or contingent liability under, any Benefit
Plan that is a "defined benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(35) of ERISA)
or a "multiemployer plan" (within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA),
or that is subject to Section 302 or Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the
Code or that is otherwise a defined benefit pension plan or that provides for
the payment of termination indemnities, and neither the Company nor any
Commonly Controlled Entity could incur any liability with respect to any such
plan (under Title IV of ERISA or otherwise).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

25  

  

 

 

 

  

(iv) No Benefit Plan or Benefit Agreement that provides welfare benefits,
whether or not subject to ERISA (each, a "Welfare Plan"), is funded through a
"welfare benefits fund" (as such term is defined in Section 419(e) of the
Code), or is unfunded or self-insured. There are no understandings, agreements
or undertakings, written or oral, that would prevent any Welfare Plan
(including any Welfare Plan covering retirees or other former employees) from
being amended or terminated without material liability to the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries at or at any time after the Effective Time. No Welfare
Plan provides benefits, and there are no understandings, written or oral, with
respect to the provision of welfare benefits, after termination of employment,
except where the cost thereof is borne entirely by the former employee (or his
or her eligible dependents or beneficiaries) or as required by Section
4980B(f) of the Code or any similar state statute or foreign Law. The Company
and its Subsidiaries have complied in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of Section 4980B(f) of the Code, Sections 601-609 of
ERISA and any similar state statute or foreign Law with respect to each
Benefit Plan that is a "group health plan" (as defined in Section 5000(b)(1)
of the Code or any similar state statute).

  

  

(v) Section 3.01(m)(v) of the Company Letter sets forth, as of the date of
this Agreement, a complete and correct list of (A) each Benefit Plan and each
Benefit Agreement pursuant to which any Company Personnel could become
entitled to any additional compensation, severance or other benefits or any
acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any compensation, severance
or other benefits as a result of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (alone or in combination with any other event,
including any termination of employment on or following the Closing), or any
compensation or benefits the value of which would be calculated on the basis
of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (alone
or in combination with any other event, including any termination of
employment on or following the Closing), (B) the names of all Company
Personnel entitled to any such compensation or benefits actually payable as of
the Closing Date or upon termination of employment after the Closing Date, (C)
the category or type of each such form of compensation or benefit to which
such Company Personnel is entitled, (D) the aggregate value of each such form
of compensation or benefit actually payable as of the Closing Date and each
such form of compensation or benefit that would be payable upon termination of
employment or otherwise after the Closing Date, in each case, to all Company
Personnel, and (E) the aggregate value of any such compensation or benefits
that would be paid to each individual set forth in Section 3.01(m)(v) of the
Company Letter as of the Closing Date and upon termination of employment.
Except as expressly set forth in Section 5.04, no Company Personnel will be
entitled to any severance, separation, change in control, termination, bonus,
retention or other additional compensation or benefits or any acceleration of
the time of payment or vesting of any compensation or benefits as a result of
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (alone or
in combination with any other event, including any termination of employment
on or following the Closing)

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

26  

  

 

 

  

  

or any compensation or benefits related to or contingent upon, or the value of
which will be calculated on the basis of, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (alone or in combination with any
other event, including any termination of employment on or following the
Closing). The execution and delivery of this Agreement, the consummation of
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (alone or
in combination with any other event, including any termination of employment
on or following the Closing) and compliance by the Company with the provisions
of this Agreement do not and will not (1) trigger any funding (through a
grantor trust or otherwise) of, or increase the cost of, or give rise to any
other obligation under, any Benefit Plan, Benefit Agreement or any other
employment arrangement, (2) trigger the forgiveness of indebtedness owed by
any Company Personnel to the Company or any of its affiliates or (3) result in
any violation or breach of, or a default (with or without notice or lapse of
time or both) under, or limit to the Company's or any of its Subsidiaries'
ability to amend, modify or terminate, any Benefit Plan or Benefit Agreement.

 

  

  

(vi) No deduction of any amount payable pursuant to the terms of the Benefit
Plans or Benefit Agreements has been disallowed or is subject to disallowance
under Section 162(m) of the Code.

  

  

(vii) All reports, returns and similar documents with respect to each Benefit
Plan required to be filed with any Governmental Entity or distributed to any
Benefit Plan participant have been duly and timely filed or distributed. All
participant data necessary to administer each Benefit Plan and Benefit
Agreement is in the possession of the Company or its Subsidiaries and is in a
form that is sufficient for the proper administration of the Benefit Plans and
Benefit Agreements in accordance with their terms and all applicable Laws and
such data is complete and correct in all material respects. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received notice of any, and, to the
knowledge of the Company, there are no, pending investigations by any
Governmental Entity with respect to, or pending termination proceedings or
other material claims (except claims for benefits payable in the normal
operation of the Benefit Plans and Benefit Agreements), suits or proceedings
against or involving or asserting any rights or claims to benefits under, any
Benefit Plan or Benefit Agreement.

  

  

(viii) All contributions, premiums and benefit payments under or in connection
with each Benefit Plan and Benefit Agreement that are required to have been
made by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in accordance with the terms of
such Benefit Plan and Benefit Agreement and applicable Laws have been timely
made. No Benefit Plan, or any insurance Contract related thereto, requires or
permits a retroactive increase in premiums or payments on termination of such
Benefit Plan or such insurance Contract. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has incurred, or could reasonably be expected to incur, any
unfunded liabilities in relation to any Benefit Plan or Benefit Agreement.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

27  

  

 

 

 

  

(ix) With respect to each Benefit Plan, (A) there has not occurred any
prohibited transaction in which the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of
their respective directors, officers or employees or, to the knowledge of the
Company, any trustee, administrator or other fiduciary of such Benefit Plan or
trust created thereunder, in each case, who is not a director, officer or
employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (a "Non-Affiliate Plan
Fiduciary"), has engaged that could subject the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective directors, officers or employees or
any Non-Affiliate Plan Fiduciary to the tax or penalty on prohibited
transactions imposed by Section 4975 of the Code or the sanctions imposed
under Title I of ERISA or any other applicable Law and (B) none of the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective directors,
officers or employees or, to the knowledge of the Company, any Non-Affiliate
Plan Fiduciary, or any agent of any of the foregoing, has engaged in any
transaction or acted in a manner, or failed to act in a manner, that could
subject the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
directors, officers or employees or any Non-Affiliate Plan Fiduciary to any
liability for breach of fiduciary duty under ERISA or any other applicable
Law. No Benefit Plan or related trust has been terminated, nor has there been
any "reportable event" (as such term is defined in Section 4043 of ERISA) for
which the 30-day reporting requirement has not been waived with respect to any
Benefit Plan during the last five years, and no notice of a reportable event
will be required to be filed in connection with the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

(x) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability or
obligations, including under or on account of a Benefit Plan or Benefit
Agreement, arising out of the hiring of persons to provide services to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries and treating such persons as consultants or
independent contractors and not as employees of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

  

  

(xi) Each Benefit Plan and each Benefit Agreement that is a "nonqualified
deferred compensation plan" within the meaning of Treas. Reg. Section
1.409A-1(a)(1)(a) (a "Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan") (A) was
operated in compliance with Section 409A of the Code between January 1, 2005
and December 31, 2008, based upon a good faith, reasonable interpretation of
(1) Section 409A of the Code and (2) the final Treasury Regulations and other
guidance issued by the IRS thereunder, to the extent applicable (clauses (1)
and (2), together, the "409A Authorities") and (B) has been operated in
compliance with the 409A Authorities since January 1, 2009. Each Nonqualified
Deferred Compensation Plan has been in documentary compliance with the 409A
Authorities since January 1, 2009.

  

  

(n) Taxes. (i) For the purposes of this Agreement, (A) "taxes" shall include
all (1) Federal, state and local (in each case, whether domestic or foreign)
taxes, assessments, duties or similar charges of any kind whatsoever,
including all corporate franchise, income, sales, use, ad valorem, receipts,
value-added, profits, license, withholding, employment, excise, property, net
worth, capital gains, transfer, stamp, documentary, social security, payroll,
environmental, alternative minimum, occupation,

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

28  

  

 

 

  

  

recapture and other taxes, and including any interest, penalties or additions
imposed with respect thereto, and, (2) liability for the payment of any
amounts of the types described in clause (1) as a result of being a member of
an affiliated, consolidated, combined, unitary or aggregate group; (B) "taxing
authority" means any Governmental Entity exercising regulatory authority in
respect of the assessment or collection of any taxes; and (C) "tax return"
means any Federal, state and local (in each case, whether domestic or foreign)
return, declaration, report, estimate, form, information return, statement
(including any statement pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4(a))
or other document in each case filed or required to be filed with a taxing
authority relating to taxes (including any related or supporting information
with respect thereto, any certificate, schedule or attachment thereto and
including any amendment thereof).

 

  

  

(ii) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has timely filed (taking into
account all extensions) all tax returns required to be filed in the manner
prescribed by applicable Law. All such tax returns are complete and correct in
all material respects. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has timely
paid all material taxes due from it or them with respect to the taxable
periods covered by such tax returns and all other material taxes due for which
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is liable (including as a transferee or
successor), and the most recent financial statements contained in the SEC
Documents reflect an adequate reserve in accordance with GAAP for potential
amounts of all taxes payable by the Company and its Subsidiaries for all
taxable periods and portions thereof through the date of such financial
statements. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has requested any
extension of time within which to file any tax return which tax return has not
yet been filed.

  

  

(iii) No tax return of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is or has been
under, or, has been threatened in writing with, audit or examination by any
taxing authority which audit or examination has not been closed, and no
written or, to the Company's knowledge, unwritten notice of such an audit or
examination has been received by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries which
audit or examination has not been closed. Each deficiency resulting from any
audit or examination relating to taxes by any taxing authority has been timely
paid and there is no deficiency, refund litigation, proposed adjustment or
matter in controversy with respect to any taxes due and owing by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries (including as a transferee or successor). No issues
relating to taxes were raised by the relevant taxing authority during any
presently pending audit or examination, and no issues relating to taxes were
raised by the relevant taxing authority in any completed audit or examination
that could reasonably be expected to recur in a later taxable period. The tax
returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries for taxes based on income, profits
or gross receipts have been examined by the relevant taxing authority for all
years through December 31, 2009. The relevant statute of limitations is closed
with respect to all tax returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries for taxes
based on income, profits or gross receipts for all years through December 31,
2007.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

29  

  

 

 

 

  

(iv) There is no currently effective agreement or other document extending the
period of assessment or collection of any taxes, and no power of attorney
(other than a power of attorney authorizing an employee of the Company or its
Subsidiaries to act on their behalf) with respect to any taxes has been filed
with any taxing authority by or on behalf of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that is still in effect.

  

  

(v) No Liens for taxes exist with respect to any assets or properties of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except for statutory Liens for taxes not
yet due and payable or being contested in good faith through appropriate
proceedings and for which the most recent financial statements contained in
the SEC Documents reflected that adequate reserves in accordance with GAAP
have been established.

  

  

(vi) Neither of the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, bound
by or currently has any liability under any tax sharing agreement, tax
indemnity obligation or similar agreement, arrangement or practice with
respect to taxes (including any advance pricing agreement, closing agreement
pursuant to Section 7121 of the Code or similar closing agreement, other
material agreement relating to taxes with any taxing authority, or as a
transferee or successor).

  

  

(vii) Neither of the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries will be required to
include in a taxable period ending after the Effective Time (A) taxable income
attributable to income that accrued (for purposes of the financial statements
of the Company included in the SEC Documents) in a taxable period prior to the
Effective Time but was not recognized for tax purposes in such prior taxable
period as a result of the installment method of accounting, the completed
contract method of accounting, the long-term contract method of accounting,
the cash method of accounting or Section 481 of the Code, or any comparable
provision of any tax Law as a result of prepaid amounts or deferred revenue
received on or prior to the Effective Time or (B) income deferred under
Section 108(i) of the Code in a taxable period beginning prior to the
Effective Time.

  

  

(viii) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has complied in all respects
with all applicable Laws relating to the collection, payment and withholding
of taxes (including withholding of taxes pursuant to Sections 1441, 1442, 3102
and 3402 of the Code or comparable provisions of any other tax Law) and has,
within the time and the manner prescribed by Law, collected, withheld from and
paid over to the proper taxing authorities all amounts required to be so
collected, withheld and paid under applicable Laws.

  

  

(ix) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has been a United States
real property holding corporation within the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of
the Code during the applicable period specified in Section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii) of
the Code or made an election under Section 897(i) of the Code to be treated as
a domestic corporation for purposes of Sections 897, 1445 and 6039C of the
Code.

  

  

(x) No property owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (A) is
property that is required to be treated as being owned by any other person
pursuant to the provisions of former Section 168(f)(8) of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1954, (B) constitutes "tax exempt use property" within the meaning of
Section 168(h)(1) of the Code or

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

30  

  

 

 

  

  

(C) is tax exempt bond financed property within the meaning of Section 168(g)

and none of the assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is subject to

meaning of Section 1297(a) of the Code with respect to the Company or such
Subsidiary.

  

  

(xii) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries (A) is classified as a

Proposal; provided, however, that at any time prior to obtaining the
Shareholder Approval, in response to a bona fide written unsolicited Takeover
Proposal that the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith
constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal, and which
Takeover Proposal did not result from a breach of this Section 4.02 or any
other provision of this Agreement, the Company may, and may permit and
authorize its Subsidiaries and its representatives and its Subsidiaries'
representatives to, in each case subject to compliance with Section 4.02(c)
and the other provisions of this Agreement, (A) furnish information with
respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the person making such Takeover
Proposal (and its representatives) pursuant to a confidentiality agreement
which contains terms that are no less restrictive than those contained in the
Amended and Restated Agreement for Exchange of Confidential Information, dated
as of June 29, 2012 between Parent and KTI (as it may be amended from time to
time, the "Confidentiality Agreement");

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

52  

  

 

 

  

  

provided that all such information had been provided, or is concurrently
provided, to Parent, and (B) participate in discussions or negotiations with,
and only with, the person making such Takeover Proposal (and its
representatives) regarding such Takeover Proposal. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the
restrictions set forth in the preceding sentence by any director, officer or
employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any investment banker,
attorney, accountant or other advisor or representative of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section 4.02(a) by
the Company.

 

  

  

For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Takeover Proposal" means any
inquiry, proposal or offer from any person or group (other than Parent or Sub
or any of their affiliates) relating to, or that could reasonably be expected
to lead to, in one transaction or a series of transactions, any merger,
consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation or
dissolution involving the Company or any direct or indirect acquisition,
including by way of any merger, consolidation, tender offer, exchange offer,
stock acquisition, asset acquisition, binding share exchange, business
combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, joint venture,
license agreement or similar transaction, of (1) assets or businesses that
constitute or represent 15% or more of the total revenue, net income, EBITDA
or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (2) 15% or
more of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or of any class of
capital stock of, or other equity or voting interests in, one or more of the
Subsidiaries of the Company which, in the aggregate, directly or indirectly
hold the assets or businesses referred to in clause (1) above.

  

  

For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Superior Proposal" means any binding
bona fide unsolicited written offer which did not result from a breach of
Section 4.02(a) made by any person (other than Parent or Sub or any of their
affiliates) that, if consummated, would result in such person (or, in the case
of a direct merger between such person and the Company, the shareholders of
such person) acquiring, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the voting
power of the Company Common Stock or all or substantially all the assets of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and which offer, in the
reasonable good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company (after
consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and
outside legal counsel), (x) provides a higher value to the shareholders of the
Company than the consideration payable in the Merger (taking into account all
of the terms and conditions of such proposal and this Agreement (including any
changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in response to such
Superior Proposal or otherwise)), (y) is not subject to any financing
condition or contingency and (z) is reasonably capable of being completed,
taking into account all financial, legal, regulatory and other aspects of such
proposal.

  

  

(b) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof
shall (or shall agree or resolve to) (i) withdraw or modify in a manner
adverse to Parent or Sub, or propose publicly to withdraw or modify in a
manner adverse to Parent or Sub, the recommendation or declaration of
advisability by such Board of Directors or any such committee of this
Agreement or the Merger (any such action, resolution or agreement to take such
action being referred to herein as an "Adverse Recommendation Change"), (ii)
recommend, declare advisable or propose to recommend or declare advisable, the
approval or adoption of any Takeover Proposal or resolve or agree to take any
such action, or adopt or approve any Takeover Proposal, or

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

53  

  

 

 

  

  

(iii) cause or permit the Company to enter into any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement,
merger agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership
agreement or other agreement (each, an "Acquisition Agreement") constituting
or related to, or which is intended to or is reasonably likely to lead to, any
Takeover Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in
Section 4.02(a)), or resolve or agree to take any such action. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, at any time prior to the Shareholder Approval, the Board of
Directors of the Company may, in response to a Superior Proposal, effect an
Adverse Recommendation Change; provided that the Board of Directors of the
Company determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, that the
failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law; and provided further, that the Board of Directors of the
Company may not effect such an Adverse Recommendation Change unless (A) the
Board of Directors of the Company shall have first provided prior written
notice to Parent (an "Adverse Recommendation Change Notice") that it is
prepared to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a Superior
Proposal, which notice shall attach the most current version of any written
agreement relating to the transaction that constitutes such Superior Proposal,
and (B) Parent does not make, within five business days after the receipt of
such notice, a proposal that would, in the reasonable good faith judgment of
the Board of Directors of the Company (after consultation with a financial
advisor of national reputation and outside legal counsel), cause the offer
previously constituting a Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior
Proposal (it being understood and agreed that any amendment or modification of
such Superior Proposal shall require a new Adverse Recommendation Change
Notice and a new five business day period). The Company agrees that, during
the five business day period prior to its effecting an Adverse Recommendation
Change, the Company and its officers, directors and representatives shall
negotiate in good faith with Parent and its officers, directors and
representatives regarding any revisions to the terms of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement proposed by Parent.

 

  

  

(c) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in paragraphs (a)
and (b) of this Section 4.02, the Company shall, as promptly as possible and
in any event within 24 hours after the receipt thereof, advise Parent orally
and in writing of (i) any Takeover Proposal or any request for information or
inquiry that the Company reasonably believes could lead to or contemplates a
Takeover Proposal and (ii) the terms and conditions of such Takeover Proposal,
request or inquiry (including any subsequent amendment or other modification
to such terms and conditions) and the identity of the person making any such
Takeover Proposal, request or inquiry. Commencing upon the provision of any
notice referred to above, the Company (or its outside counsel) shall (A) on a
daily basis at mutually agreeable times, advise and confer with Parent (or its
outside counsel) regarding the progress of negotiations concerning any
Takeover Proposal, the material resolved and unresolved issues related thereto
and any other matters identified with reasonable specificity by Parent (or its
outside counsel) and the material details (including material amendments or
proposed amendments as to price and other material terms) of any such Takeover
Proposal, request or inquiry and (B) promptly upon receipt or delivery
thereof, provide Parent (or its outside counsel) with copies of all documents
and written or electronic communications relating to any such Takeover
Proposal (including the financing thereof), request or inquiry exchanged
between the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective officers,
directors, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants or other
advisors or representatives, on the one hand, and the person making a Takeover
Proposal or any of its affiliates, or their respective officers, directors,
employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants or other advisors or
representatives, on the other hand; provided that in the case of subclause

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

54  

  

 

  (A) above only, in connection with any Superior Proposal with respect to
which (1) the Board of Directors of the Company has effected an Adverse
Recommendation Change in accordance with this Section 4.02 and (2) Parent did
not make, within five business days after the receipt of the related Adverse
Recommendation Change Notice, a proposal that would, in the reasonable good
faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company (after consultation
with a financial advisor of national reputation and outside legal counsel),
cause the offer previously constituting such Superior Proposal to no longer
constitute a Superior Proposal, the Company (and its outside counsel) shall
only be required to so advise and confer at times reasonably requested by
Parent (rather than on a daily basis).

 

  

  

(d) Nothing contained in this Section 4.02 or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prohibit the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to its shareholders
a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to its shareholders if, in the good
faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company, failure so to
disclose would be inconsistent with applicable Law; provided, however, that in
no event shall the Company or its Board of Directors or any committee thereof
take, agree or resolve to take any action prohibited by Section 4.02(b).

  

  

SECTION 4.03. Conduct by Parent. During the period from the date of this
Agreement to the Effective Time, except as consented to in writing by the
Company prior to such action or as specifically contemplated by this
Agreement, Parent shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to,
take any action that could reasonably be expected to result in (a) any
representation and warranty of Parent or Sub set forth in this Agreement that
is qualified as to materiality becoming untrue (as so qualified) or (b) any
such representation and warranty that is not so qualified becoming untrue in
any material respect.

  

  

ARTICLE V

  

  

Additional Agreements

  

  

SECTION 5.01. Preparation of the Proxy Statement; Shareholders Meeting. (a)As
promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company
shall prepare and file with the SEC the preliminary Proxy Statement. Each of
the Company and Parent shall furnish all information concerning such person to
the other as may be reasonably requested in connection with the preparation,
filing and distribution of the Proxy Statement. The Company shall promptly
notify Parent upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff or
any request from the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to the
Proxy Statement and shall provide Parent with copies of all correspondence
between it and its representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other
hand. Each of the Company and Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to respond as promptly as practicable to any comments of the SEC with respect
to the Proxy Statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to filing or
mailing the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or
responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, the Company (i)
shall provide Parent an opportunity to review and comment on such document or
response, (ii) shall include in such document or response all comments
reasonably proposed by Parent and

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

55  

  

 

  (iii) shall not file or mail such document, or respond to the SEC, prior
to receiving the approval of Parent, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed. If, at any time prior to the Shareholders Meeting, any
information relating to the Company, Parent or any of their respective
affiliates, officers or directors should be discovered by the Company or
Parent which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement, so that the Proxy Statement shall not contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party that
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto, and
an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be
filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable Law, disseminated
to the shareholders of the Company.

 

  

  

(b) The Company agrees that the Proxy Statement will comply as to form in all
material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and that none of
the information included or incorporated by reference in the Proxy Statement
will, at the date the Proxy Statement is filed with the SEC or mailed to the
shareholders of the Company or at the time of the Shareholders Meeting, or at
the time of any amendment or supplement thereof, contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, except that no
covenant is made by the Company with respect to statements made in the Proxy
Statement based on information supplied in writing by or on behalf of Parent
specifically for inclusion or incorporation for reference therein. Parent
agrees that none of such information will, at the date the Proxy Statement is
filed with the SEC or mailed to the shareholders of the Company or at the time
of the Shareholders Meeting, or at the time of any amendment or supplement
thereof, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading.

  

  

(c) Each of the Company and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to cause
the mailing of the Proxy Statement to the shareholders of the Company to occur
during the week beginning October 22, 2012. The Company shall, as promptly as
practicable after the filing of the preliminary Proxy Statement with the SEC,
establish a record date (which will be as promptly as reasonably practicable
following the date of this Agreement) for, duly call, give notice of, convene
and hold a meeting of its shareholders (the "Shareholders Meeting"), which
meeting the Company shall, absent any Legal Restraint that has the effect of
preventing such action, cause to occur on the date that is 35 calendar days
immediately following the date of mailing of the Proxy Statement, for the
purpose of obtaining the Shareholder Approval, regardless of whether the Board
of Directors of the Company determines at any time that this Agreement is no
longer advisable or recommends that the shareholders of the Company reject it
or any other Adverse Recommendation Change has occurred at any time; provided,
however, that (i) if the Company is unable to obtain a quorum of its
shareholders at such time, the Company may extend the date of the Shareholders
Meeting to the extent (and only to the extent) necessary in order to obtain a
quorum of its shareholders and the Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain such a quorum as promptly as practicable, (ii)
the Company may delay the Shareholders Meeting to the extent (and only to the
extent) the Company reasonably determines that such delay is required by
applicable Law to comply with comments made by the SEC with respect to the
Proxy Statement and

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

56  

  

 

  (iii) the Company may delay the Shareholders Meeting to the extent (and
only to the extent) required by a court of competent jurisdiction in
connection with any proceedings in connection with this Agreement, the Merger
or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The notice of such
Shareholders Meeting shall state that a resolution to adopt this Agreement
will be considered at the Shareholders Meeting. Subject to Section 4.02(b),
(A) the Board of Directors of the Company shall recommend to holders of
Company Common Stock that they adopt this Agreement and shall include such
recommendation in the Proxy Statement and (B) the Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to solicit the Shareholders Approval. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company agrees that its
obligations pursuant to this Section 5.01(c) shall not be affected by the
commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the
Company or any other person of any Takeover Proposal. The Company shall
provide updates to Parent with respect to the proxy solicitation for the
Shareholders Meeting (including interim results) as reasonably requested by
Parent.

 

  

  

SECTION 5.02. Access to Information; Confidentiality. (a)The Company shall,
and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent and to Parent's
officers, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, consultants
and other representatives and advisors full access upon reasonable advance
notice and during normal business hours during the period prior to the
Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement to all their respective
properties, assets, books, records, Contracts, Permits, documents,
information, directors, officers and employees, and during such period the
Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, furnish to Parent
any information concerning its business as Parent may reasonably request
(including, to the extent the Company is able, the work papers of Grant
Thornton LLP). Following the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective
Time, Parent may (but shall not be required to), following reasonable notice
to the Company, contact and interview any Company Personnel and review the
personnel records and such other information concerning the Company Personnel
as Parent may reasonably request. No investigation by Parent or any of its
officers, directors, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants or
other advisors or representatives and no other receipt of information by
Parent or any of its officers, directors, employees, investment bankers,
attorneys, accountants or other advisors or representatives shall operate as a
waiver or otherwise affect any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement
or other provision of this Agreement, or the obligations of the parties (or
remedies with respect thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of the
parties under the Agreement. Except as required by any applicable Law or
Judgment, Parent will hold, and will direct its officers, employees,
investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other advisors and
representatives to hold, any and all information received from the Company
confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement.

  

  

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, during the period from
the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries to, as and to the extent requested by Parent,
provide Parent with (i) a complete and correct list of all licenses issued by
the Federal Communications Commission (the "FCC") and held by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries (the "FCC Licenses"), (ii) complete and correct copies
of each FCC License, (iii) the address and physical location of the device(s)
covered by each FCC License, (iv) a written description of the purpose of the
device(s) covered by each FCC License, (v) complete and correct copies of any
Notices of Apparent Liability for Forfeiture issued by the FCC against the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries and

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

57  

  

 

  (vi) all information reasonably necessary for Parent to make an
independent determination that the Company and its Subsidiaries have complied
with FCC rules regarding changes of ownership control of the FCC Licenses
(including descriptions of any transactions that effected a change of
ownership or control of the FCC Licenses (including any intracompany
reorganizations) and corporate organizational charts depicting the ownership
structure of the holder of the FCC Licenses before and after any such change
of ownership or control).

 

  

  

(c) Subject to applicable law, the Company and Parent shall, and shall cause
each of their respective Subsidiaries to, cooperate to ensure an orderly
transition and integration process in connection with the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in order to minimize the
disruption to, and preserve the value of, the business of the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries.

  

  

SECTION 5.03. Commercially Reasonable Efforts; Consultation and Notice.
(a)Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of the parties hereto agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, all actions that are necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and make effective the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including transactions under the
Shareholder Agreements), including using its commercially reasonable efforts
to accomplish the following: (i) the satisfaction of the conditions precedent
set forth in Article VI, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary actions or
nonactions, waivers, consents, approvals, orders and authorizations from, and
the giving of any necessary notices to, Governmental Entities and other
persons and the making of all necessary registrations, declarations and
filings (including filings under the HSR Act and other registrations,
declarations and filings with, or notices to, Governmental Entities, if any),
(iii) the taking of all reasonable steps to provide any supplemental
information requested by a Governmental Entity, including participating in
meetings with officials of such entity in the course of its review of this
Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (iv) the taking of all reasonable steps as may be necessary to
avoid any suit, claim, action, investigation or proceeding by any Governmental
Entity or third party and (v) the obtaining of all necessary consents,
approvals or waivers from any third party. In connection with and without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of the Company and its Board of
Directors shall, if any state takeover statute or similar statute or
regulation, including the Pennsylvania Takeover Disclosure Law or Subchapters
E, G, H, I or J of Chapter 25 of the PBCL, is or becomes applicable to this
Agreement, the Shareholder Agreements or any of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including transactions under the
Shareholder Agreements, take all actions necessary to ensure that the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
transactions under the Shareholder Agreements, may be consummated as promptly
as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to
minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on this Agreement, the
Shareholder Agreements, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including transactions under the Shareholder Agreements.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, in no event shall Parent or Sub be obligated to, and the Company and
its Subsidiaries shall not without the prior written consent of Parent, agree
or proffer to divest or hold separate, or enter into any licensing, business
restriction or similar arrangement with respect to, any assets (whether
tangible or intangible) or any portion of any business of Parent, the Company
or any of their respective Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any
other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries be obligated to litigate or participate in the
litigation of any suit, claim, action, investigation or proceeding, whether
judicial or administrative, brought by any Governmental Entity

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

58  

  

 

  (A) challenging or seeking to restrain or prohibit the consummation of the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
transactions under the Shareholder Agreements, or seeking to obtain from
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries any damages in relation therewith; (B)
seeking to prohibit or limit in any respect, or place any conditions on, the
ownership or operation by the Company, Parent or any of their respective
affiliates of all or any portion of the business or assets or any product of
the Company or its Subsidiaries or Parent or its Subsidiaries or to require
any such person to dispose of, license (whether pursuant to an exclusive or
nonexclusive license) or hold separate all or any portion of the business or
assets or any product of the Company or its Subsidiaries or Parent or its
Subsidiaries, in each case as a result of or in connection with the Merger or
any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (C) seeking to
directly or indirectly impose limitations on the ability of Parent or any of
its affiliates to acquire or hold, or exercise full rights of ownership of,
any shares of Company Common Stock or any shares of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation or any of Parent's Subsidiaries, including the right to
vote Company Common Stock or the shares of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation or any of Parent's Subsidiaries on all matters properly presented
to the shareholders of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of
Parent's Subsidiaries, respectively; or (D) seeking to (1) directly or
indirectly prohibit Parent or any of its affiliates from effectively
controlling in any respect any of the business or operations of the Company or
its or Parent's Subsidiaries or (2) directly or indirectly prevent the Company
or its or Parent's Subsidiaries from operating any of their respective
businesses in substantially the same manner as operated by the Company and its
or Parent's Subsidiaries immediately prior to the date of this Agreement. The
Company and Parent shall provide such assistance, information and cooperation
to each other as is reasonably required to obtain any such actions,
nonactions, waivers, consents, approvals, orders and authorizations and, in
connection therewith, shall notify the other person promptly following the
receipt of any comments from any Governmental Entity and of any request by any
Governmental Entity for amendments, supplements or additional information in
respect of any registration, declaration or filing with, or notice to, such
Governmental Entity.

 

  

  

(b) (i) In connection with the continuing operation of the business of the
Company and its Subsidiaries between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, subject to applicable Law, the Company shall consult in good
faith on a reasonably regular basis with Parent to report material,
individually or in the aggregate, operational developments, the general status
of relationships with customers and resellers, the general status of ongoing
operations and other matters reasonably requested by Parent pursuant to
procedures reasonably requested by Parent; provided, however, that no such
consultation shall operate as a waiver or otherwise affect any representation,
warranty, covenant, agreement or other provision in this Agreement, or the
obligations of the parties (or remedies with respect thereto) or the
conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement.

  

  

(ii) Except as prohibited by applicable Law, the Company shall, promptly upon
having knowledge, notify Parent in writing of:

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

59  

  

 

 

 

  

(A) the occurrence of any matter or event that (1) is, or that could
reasonably be expected to be, material (individually or in the aggregate) to
the business, assets, properties, condition (financial or otherwise) or
results of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
or (2) has resulted, or could reasonably be expected to result, in (I) any
representation and warranty of the Company set forth in this Agreement that is
qualified as to materiality becoming untrue, (II) any such representation and
warranty that is not so qualified becoming untrue in any material respect or
(III) any condition to the transactions contemplated hereby and set forth in
Section 6.02 not being satisfied;

  

  

(B) the failure of the Company to perform in any material respect any
obligation to be performed by it under this Agreement;

  

  

(C) any notice or other communication from any person (other than a
Governmental Entity) alleging that notice to or consent of such person is
required in connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement;

  

  

(D) any notice or other communication from any customer, distributor or
reseller to the effect that such customer, distributor or reseller is
terminating or otherwise materially adversely modifying its relationship with
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a result of the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

  

  

(E) any material notice or other material communication from any Governmental
Entity in connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and a copy of any such notice or communication shall be
furnished to Parent, together with the Company's written notice;

  

  

(F) any filing or notice made by the Company with any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and a copy of any such filing or notice shall be furnished to
Parent together with the Company's written notice; and

  

  

(G) any actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or, to
the knowledge of the Company, threatened against, relating to or involving or
otherwise affecting the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that, if pending on
the date of this Agreement, would have been required to have been disclosed
pursuant to Section 3.01(h) or that relate to the consummation of the Merger
or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

  

  

provided, however, that no such notification shall operate as a waiver or
otherwise affect any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or other
provision in this Agreement, or the obligations of the parties (or remedies
with respect thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of the parties
under this Agreement.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

60  

  

 

 

 

  

(iii) Parent, upon having knowledge, shall give prompt notice to the Company
of (A) any representation or warranty made by Parent or Sub contained in this
Agreement becoming untrue or inaccurate such that the condition set forth in
Section 6.03(a) could not be satisfied or (B) the failure of Parent or Sub to
perform in any material respect any obligation to be performed by such party
under this Agreement such that the condition set forth in Section 6.03(b)
could not be satisfied; provided, however, that no such notification shall
affect the representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or obligations
of the parties (or remedies with respect thereto) or the conditions to the
obligations of the parties under this Agreement.

  

  

(c) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company shall give
Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense of any litigation against
the Company and/or its directors relating to the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including transactions under the
Shareholder Agreements, and will obtain the prior written consent of Parent
prior to settling or satisfying any such claim, it being understood and agreed
that this Section 5.03(c) shall not give Parent the right to direct such
defense.

  

  

(d) Immediately following the execution and delivery of this Agreement by each
of the parties hereto, Parent, as the sole shareholder of Sub, will adopt this
Agreement.

  

  

SECTION 5.04. Equity Awards. (a)As soon as practicable following the date of
this Agreement and in any event prior to the Effective Time, the Board of
Directors of the Company (or, if appropriate, any committee administering the
Company Stock Plans) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions
(including obtaining any required consents) as may be required to effect the
following:

  

  

(i) at the Effective Time, each Cash-Out Stock Option shall, in accordance
with any applicable Company Stock Plan or any applicable award agreement
thereunder, be canceled and each holder thereof shall be entitled to receive
in consideration for such cancelation an amount in cash equal to the product
of (A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock that are subject to such
Cash-Out Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) the
excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share
of Company Common Stock subject to such Cash-Out Stock Option, which amount
shall be payable to such holder at or as soon as practicable following the
Effective Time;

  

  

(ii) each Rollover Stock Option shall, in accordance with any applicable
Company Stock Plan or any applicable award agreement thereunder, be converted
at the Effective Time into an option to acquire, on substantially the same
terms and conditions as were applicable under such Rollover Stock Option
(other than with respect to exercisability prior to vesting or the ability to
pay the exercise price by tendering previously owned shares of Company Common
Stock), the number of shares of Parent common stock, par value $0.20 per share
("Parent Common Stock") (rounded down to the nearest whole share), determined
by multiplying the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
Rollover Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange
Ratio, at an exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock (rounded up to
the nearest whole cent) equal to (A) the exercise price per share of Company

(d) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section
5.06 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and that, without these agreements, Parent would not have entered into this

interpretation of this Agreement. Any capitalized terms used in any Exhibit

words "without limitation". The words "hereof", "hereto", "hereby", "herein"
and "hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall
refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this
Agreement. The term "or" is not exclusive. The word "extent" in the phrase "to
the extent" means the degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and
such phrase does not mean simply "if". Except as otherwise provided, any
information "made available" to Parent by the Company or its Subsidiaries

2012, a copy of which has been provided to Parent prior to the date of this
Agreement. The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the
singular as well as the plural forms of such terms. Any agreement or
instrument defined or referred to herein or in any agreement or instrument
that is referred to herein means such agreement or instrument as from time to
time amended, modified or supplemented. References to a person are also to its
permitted successors and assigns.

  

  

SECTION 8.05. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts (including by facsimile), all of which shall be considered one
and the same agreement and shall become effective when one or more such
counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the
other parties.

  

  

SECTION 8.06. Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement
(a) together with any Exhibit hereto and the Company Letter, constitutes the
entire agreement, and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both
written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter of this
Agreement, except for the Confidentiality Agreement and the Shareholder
Agreements, and (b) except for the provisions of Section 5.05, is not intended
to confer upon any person other than the parties hereto (and their respective
successors and assigns) any rights (legal, equitable or otherwise) or
remedies, whether as third party beneficiaries or otherwise.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

74  

  

 

 

 

  

SECTION 8.07. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of New York, regardless of
the Laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts
of Laws thereof, except to the extent the Laws of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania are mandatorily applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or the
Articles of Merger.

  

  

SECTION 8.08. Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by
operation of Law or otherwise by any of the parties without the prior written
consent of the other parties, except that Parent and Sub may assign, in their
sole discretion, any or all of their rights, interests and obligations under
this Agreement to any affiliate of Parent, but no such assignment shall
relieve the assigning party of its obligations under this Agreement if such
assignee does not perform such obligations. Subject to the preceding sentence,
this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by, the parties hereto and their respective successors and
assigns.

  

  

SECTION 8.09. Consent to Jurisdiction; Service of Process; Venue. Each of the
parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of (a) any New York State court sitting in the County of New York
and (b) the United States District Court for the Southern District of New
York, for the purposes of any suit, action or other proceeding arising out of
this Agreement or the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this
Agreement (and agrees that no such action, suit or proceeding relating to this
Agreement shall be brought by it or any of its Subsidiaries except in such
courts). In the event of an action filed in any New York State court sitting
in the County of New York, each party commits to designate such action as
appropriate for assignment to the Commercial Division. Each of the parties
further agrees that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law,
service of any process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to
such person's respective address set forth above shall be effective service of
process for any action, suit or proceeding in the State of New York with
respect to any matters to which it has submitted to jurisdiction as set forth
above in the immediately preceding sentence. Each of the parties hereto
irrevocably and unconditionally waives (and agrees not to plead or claim), any
objection to the laying of venue of any action, suit or proceeding arising out
of this Agreement or the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement in (i) any New York State court sitting in the County of New
York or (ii) the United States District Court for the Southern District of New
York, or that any such action, suit or proceeding brought in any such court
has been brought in an inconvenient forum.

  

  

SECTION 8.10. Waiver of Jury Trial. Each party hereto hereby waives, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any right it may have to a trial
by jury in respect of any suit, action or other proceeding directly or
indirectly arising out of, under or in connection with this Agreement. Each
party hereto (a) certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of any
other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such party would
not, in the event of any action, suit or proceeding, seek to enforce the
foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges that it and the other parties hereto
have been induced to enter into this Agreement, by, among other things, the
mutual waiver and certifications in this Section 8.10.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

75  

  

 

 

 

  

SECTION 8.11. Enforcement. The parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.
It is accordingly agreed that the parties hereto shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any New York State
court sitting in the County of New York or in the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York, this being in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity.

  

  

SECTION 8.12. Consents and Approvals. For any matter under this Agreement
requiring the consent or approval of any party to be valid and binding on the
parties hereto, such consent or approval must be in writing and executed and
delivered to the other parties by a person duly authorized by such party to do
so.

  

  

SECTION 8.13. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement or the
application of any such provision to any person or circumstance shall be held
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect by a court of competent
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect
the validity, legality or enforceability of any other provision hereof and the
invalidity of a particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not
invalidate such provision in any other jurisdiction.

meanings set forth in the Merger Agreement);

  

  

WHEREAS Shareholder is the record or beneficial owner of the number of shares
of Company Common Stock set forth on Schedule A (such shares of capital stock
of the Company, the "Original Shares", and together with any New Shares (as
defined below), the "Subject Shares"); and

  

  

WHEREAS as a condition to their willingness to enter into the Merger
Agreement, Parent and Sub have requested that Shareholder enter into this
Agreement.

  

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representa­tions,
warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein and in the Merger
Agreement, each party hereto agrees as follows:

  

  

SECTION 1. Representations and Warranties of Shareholder. Shareholder hereby
represents and warrants to Parent as follows:

  

  

(a) Organization; Authority; Execution and Delivery; Enforceability.
Shareholder has all requisite power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement, to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
to comply with the provisions of this Agreement. This Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by such Shareholder and, assuming due authorization,
execution and delivery by Parent, constitutes a valid and binding obligation
of Shareholder, enforceable against Shareholder in accordance with its terms.
If Shareholder is married and the Subject Shares of Shareholder constitute
community property or if spousal or other approval is required for this
Agreement to be legal, valid and binding, this Agreement has been duly
authorized, executed and delivered by, and constitutes a valid and binding
agreement of, Shareholder's spouse, enforceable against such spouse in
accordance with its terms.

  

  

(b) No Conflicts; Consents. The execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
compliance by Shareholder with the terms of this Agreement do not and will not
conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of, or default (with or
without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of,
or result in termination, amendment, cancelation or acceleration of any
obligation or to loss of a material benefit under, or result in the creation
of any Lien in or upon any of the properties or assets of Shareholder under,
or give rise to any increased, additional, accelerated or guaranteed rights or
entitlements under,

of this paragraph, any such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults,
terminations, cancelations, accelerations, rights, losses, Liens or
entitlements that individually or in the aggregate are not reasonably likely
to (x) impair in any material respect the ability of Shareholder to perform
its obligations under this Agreement or (y) prevent or materially impede or
delay the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. No consent, approval, order or authorization of, or registration,
declaration or filing with, any Governmental Entity or other person (including
any spouse) ("Consent") is required by or with respect to Shareholder in
connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Shareholder,
the consummation by Shareholder of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the compliance by Shareholder with the terms of this Agreement,
except for (1) filings under the HSR Act and any other applicable competition,
merger control, antitrust or similar law or regulation, (2) filings with the
SEC of such reports under the Exchange Act as may be required in connection
with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and (3) those
Consents which have already been obtained.

 

  

  

(c) Ownership. Shareholder is the record and beneficial owner of the number of
Original Shares set forth on Schedule A, and Shareholder's Original Shares
constitute all of the shares of Company Common Stock held of record,
beneficially owned or for which voting power or disposition power is held by
Shareholder. Shareholder has good and marketable title, free and clear of any
Liens, to those Original Shares of which Shareholder is the record owner.
Shareholder does not own, of record or beneficially, (i) any shares of capital
stock of the Company other than the Original Shares or (ii) any option,
warrant, call or other right to acquire or receive capital stock or other
equity or voting interests in the Company, other than those set forth on
Schedule B. Shareholder has the sole right to vote and Transfer Shareholder's
Original Shares, and none of Shareholder's Original Shares are subject to any
voting trust or other agreement, arrangement or restriction with respect to
the voting or the Transfer of Shareholder's Original Shares, except as set
forth in Sections 3 and 4 of this Agreement.

  

  

SECTION 2. Representations and Warranties of Parent. Parent hereby represents
and warrants to Shareholder as follows: Parent has the requisite corporate
power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to comply with the provisions
of this Agreement. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent, the
consummation by Parent of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
the compliance by Parent with the provisions of this Agreement have been duly
authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of Parent and no
other corporate proceedings on the part of Parent are necessary to authorize
this Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Parent and,
assuming due execution and delivery by Shareholder, constitutes a valid and
binding obligation of Parent, enforceable against Parent in accordance with
its terms. The execution and delivery of this Agreement do not, and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and compliance
by Parent with the terms of this Agreement will not, conflict with, or result
in any violation or breach of, or default

by which any of the properties or assets of Parent is subject or bound or
(iii) subject to the governmental filings and other matters referred to in the
following sentence, any Law or Judgment, in each case, applicable to Parent or
its properties or assets other than, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii),
any such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults, terminations,
cancelations, accelerations, rights, losses, Liens or entitlements that
individually or in the aggregate are not reasonably likely to (x) impair in
any material respect the ability of Parent to perform its obligations under
this Agreement or (y) prevent or materially impede or delay the consummation
of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. No Consent is
required by or with respect to Parent in connection with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement by Parent or the consummation by Parent of the
transactions contemplated hereby, other than as contemplated by the Merger
Agreement.

follows:

  

  

(a) At any meeting of the shareholders of the Company called to vote upon the
Merger Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by
the Merger Agreement, or at any postponement or adjournment thereof, or in any
other circumstances upon which a vote, consent, adoption or other approval
(including by written consent solicitation) with respect to the Merger
Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement is sought, Shareholder shall (i) appear at such meeting or
otherwise cause its Subject Shares to be counted as present thereat for
purposes of calculating a quorum and (ii) vote (or cause to be voted) all of
Shareholder's Subject Shares in favor of, and shall consent to (or cause to be

therein) or any rights to acquire any securities or equity interests of the
Company, or enter into any Contract, option, call or other arrangement with
respect to the Transfer (including any profit-sharing or other derivative
arrangement) of any Subject Shares (or any interest therein) or any rights to
acquire any securities or equity interests of the Company, to any person other

such Transfer the transferee of the Subject Shares is a party to this
Agreement, enters into a shareholder agreement with Parent on terms
substantially identical to the terms of this Agreement or agrees to become a
party to this Agreement pursuant to a joinder agreement satisfactory to
Parent, or (ii) enter into any voting arrangement, whether by proxy, voting
agreement or otherwise, with respect to any Subject Shares or rights to

its acquisition or receipt of New Shares which notice shall state the number

acquired or received by Shareholder pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) of this

any person to which record or beneficial ownership of Shareholder's Subject
Shares shall pass, whether by operation of Law or otherwise, including

further agrees to take all actions necessary to effectuate the foregoing.

  

  

SECTION 4. Grant of Irrevocable Proxy; Appointment of Proxy. (a) Shareholder
hereby irrevocably grants to, and appoints, Parent and any other individual

substitution), for and in the name, place and stead of Shareholder, to vote
all of Shareholder's Subject Shares at any meeting of shareholders of the
Company or any adjournment or postponement thereof, or grant a consent or
approval in respect of Shareholder's Subject Shares, (i) in favor of the

the Merger and each of the other transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement, and (ii) otherwise in accordance with Section 3 of this Agreement.
The proxy granted in this Section 4 shall expire upon the termination of this
Agreement.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

A-4  

  

 

 

 

  

(b) Shareholder represents that any proxies heretofore given in respect of
Shareholder's Subject Shares are not irrevocable, and that all such proxies
are hereby revoked.

  

  

(c) Shareholder hereby affirms that the irrevocable proxy set forth in this
Section 4 is given in connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement,
and that such irrevocable proxy is given to secure the performance of the
duties of Shareholder under this Agreement. Shareholder hereby further affirms

circumstances be revoked. Shareholder hereby ratifies and confirms all that
such irrevocable proxy may lawfully do or cause to be done by virtue hereof.
Each such irrevocable proxy is executed and intended to be irrevocable in
accordance with the provisions of Section 1759 of the PBCL.

  

  

SECTION 5. Further Assurances. Shareholder shall, from time to time, execute

purpose of effectuating the matters covered by this Agreement, including the

or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by operation
of Law or otherwise, by any of the parties hereto without the prior written
consent of the other parties hereto, except that Parent may in its sole
discretion assign, in whole or in one or more parts, any or all of its rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement to any Affiliate of Parent, but
no such assignment shall relieve Parent of any of its obligations under this
Agreement if the applicable assignee does not perform such obligations. Any
purported assignment in violation of this Section 6 shall be void. Subject to
the preceding sentences of this Section 6, this Agreement shall be binding

(c) Interpretation. When a reference is made in this Agreement to a Section or
a Schedule, such reference shall be to a Section of, or a Schedule to, this
Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The headings contained in this Agreement
are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include", "includes" or
"including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by
the words "without limitation". The words "hereof", "hereto", "hereby",
"herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this
Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular
provision of this Agreement. The words "date hereof" shall refer to the date
of this Agreement. The term "or" is not exclusive. The word "extent" in the
phrase "to the extent" shall mean the degree to which a subject or other thing
extends, and such phrase shall not mean simply "if". The definitions contained
in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms
of such terms. Any agreement or instrument defined or referred to herein or in
any agreement or instrument that is referred to herein means such agreement or
instrument as from time to time amended, modified or supplemented. References
to a person are also to its permitted successors and assigns.

  

  

(d) Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts
(including by facsimile), all of which shall be considered one and the same
agreement and shall become effective when one or more such counterparts have
been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other parties.

  

  

(e) Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement (a)
constitutes the entire agreement, and supersedes all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the
subject matter of this Agreement and (b) is not intended to confer upon any
person other than the parties hereto and their respective successors and
assigns any rights (legal, equitable or otherwise, except the rights conferred
upon those persons specified as proxies in Section 4) or remedies, whether as
third party beneficiaries or otherwise.

  

  

(f) Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the Laws of the State of New York, regardless of the Laws
that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of Laws
thereof, except to the extent the Laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania are
mandatorily applicable to this Agreement.

  

  

(g) Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public policy,
all other conditions and terms of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in
full force and effect. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties
hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the parties as closely as possible to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law in an acceptable manner and to the end that
the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.

(h) Consent to Jurisdiction; Service of Process; Venue. Each of the parties
hereto irrevocably and unconditionally submits to the exclusive jurisdiction
of (a) any New York State court sitting in the County of New York and (b) the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York for the
purposes of any suit, action or other proceeding arising out of this Agreement
or the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement (and
agrees that no such action, suit or proceeding relating to this Agreement
shall be brought by it or any of its Subsidiaries except in such courts). In
the event of an action filed in any New York State court sitting in the County
of New York, each party commits to designate such action as appropriate for
assignment to the Commercial Division. Each of the parties further agrees
that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, service of any
process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to such person's
respective address set forth above shall be effective service of process for
any action, suit or proceeding in the State of New York with respect to any
matter to which it has submitted to jurisdiction as set forth above in the
immediately preceding sentence. The Shareholder hereby appoints the Company as
its agent for service of process for any claim, action, suit or other
proceeding in New York with respect to any matters to which it has submitted
to jurisdiction as set forth above. Each of the parties hereto irrevocably and
unconditionally waives (and agrees not to plead or claim), any objection to
the laying of venue of any action, suit or proceeding arising out of this
Agreement or the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement in (a) any New York State court sitting in the County of New York or
(b) the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, or
that any such action, suit or proceeding brought in any such court has been
brought in an inconvenient forum.

  

  

(i) Enforcement. The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the
event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that the parties hereto shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any New York State
court sitting in the County of New York or in the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York, this being in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity.

  

  

(j) Waiver of Jury Trial. Each party hereto hereby waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law, any right it may have to a trial by jury
in respect of any suit, action or other proceeding directly or indirectly
arising out of, under or in connection with this Agreement. Each party hereto
(a) certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of any other party has
represented, expressly or otherwise, that such party would not, in the event
of any action, suit or proceeding, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and
(b) acknowledges that it and the other parties hereto have been induced to
enter into this Agreement, by, among other things, the mutual waiver and
certifications in this Section 8(j).

  

  

(k) Expenses. All fees, costs and expenses (including all legal, accounting,
broker, finder or investment banker fees) incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby are to be paid by the party
incurring such fees, costs and expenses.
