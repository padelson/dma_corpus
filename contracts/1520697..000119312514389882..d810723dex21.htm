24 (b) The Surviving Entity shall deliver to each Eligible Holder who has not, as
of the Effective Time, delivered a duly executed and completed Letter of
Transmittal or surrendered the applicable certificate(s) representing its
shares of Class L Common Stock or Class A Common Stock, (i) the Per L Share
Merger Consideration or, if the Eligible Holder is not an Accredited
Investor, cash equal to the value of the Per L Share Merger Consideration, as
provided in _Section 2.02(b)_ , in respect of each share of Class L Common
Stock represented by such certificate(s) and (ii) the Per A Share Merger
Consideration or, if the Eligible Holder is not an Accredited Investor, cash
equal to the value of the Per A Share Merger Consideration, as provided in
_Section 2.02(c)_ , in respect of each share of Class A Common Stock, in the
case of each of clauses (i) and (ii), promptly following surrender of such
certificate(s) (or a lost certificate affidavit and, if applicable, bond) and
upon delivery of a duly executed and completed Letter of Transmittal, without
interest and less any applicable Tax withholdings. Any such cash to be paid to
an Eligible Holder shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available
funds (or, at the request of an Eligible Holder, by check).

 

(c) In the event of a transfer of ownership of any shares of Class L Common
Stock or Class A Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records
of the Company, payment may be made with respect to such shares to such a
transferee if the certificate representing such shares is presented to the
Company, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such
transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been
paid. For the avoidance of doubt, any such transferee that satisfies these
requirements may be an Eligible Holder.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Company Shares
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held
by any holder who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such
shares (the " _Appraisal Shares_ ") pursuant to, and who complies in all
respects with, the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Section 262_")
shall not be converted into the right to receive the Per L Share Merger
Consideration or the Per A Share Merger Consideration as provided in _Section
2.02(b)_ or _Section 2.02(c)_ , as applicable, but instead such holder shall
be entitled to payment of the fair value of such shares in accordance with the
provisions of Section 262\. At the Effective Time, all Appraisal Shares shall
no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease
to exist, and each holder of Appraisal Shares shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the right to receive the fair value of such
Appraisal Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section
262. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such holder shall fail to perfect
or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under
Section 262 or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such
holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262, then the right
of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holders Appraisal Shares
under Section 262 shall cease and each such Appraisal Share shall be deemed to
have been converted at the Effective Time into, and shall (i) have become, in
the case of shares of Class L Common Stock, the right to receive the Per L
Share Merger Consideration (or the applicable cash payment if such holder is
not an Accredited Investor) as provided in _Section 2.02(b)_ , without
interest and less any applicable Tax withholding, and (ii) have become, in the
case of shares of Class A Common Stock, the right to receive the Per A Share
Merger Consideration (or the applicable cash payment if such holder is not an
Accredited Investor) as provided in _Section 2.02(c)_ , without interest and
less any applicable Tax withholding. The Company shall serve prompt notice to
Parent of any demands for appraisal of any Company 

 



25  Shares, and Parent shall have the right to participate in all negotiations
and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent (which shall
not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), make any payment with
respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any
of the foregoing.

 

(e) No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock shall be issued upon the conversion of Company Shares pursuant to
_Section 2.02_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each
holder of Company Shares converted pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise
have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock
(after taking into account all Company Shares exchanged by such holder) shall
receive the aggregate number of shares due to such holder pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement, rounded down to the nearest whole number; _provided_
, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, each Eligible Holder (if any) that is
an Accredited Investor and holds shares of Class A Common Stock who would have
otherwise been entitled to receive less than one share of Parent Common Stock
in respect of such Eligible Holders shares of Class A Common Stock (after
taking into account all shares of Class A Common Stock exchanged by such
holder) shall receive one share of Parent Common Stock in the aggregate in
respect of such Eligible Holders shares of Class A Common Stock; _provided_
_further_ that (i) any such issuance of Parent Common Stock pursuant to the
preceding proviso shall not increase the Aggregate Share Consideration
and (ii) notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no
event shall the number of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable by Parent
pursuant to this Agreement exceed the 6,262,046 shares of Parent Common Stock
set forth in the definition of Aggregate Share Consideration, as the amount
of such shares shall be adjusted in accordance with clauses (b)-(f) of the
definition of Aggregate Share Consideration.

 

(f) The shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger shall be
characterized as "restricted securities" for purposes of Rule 144 under the
Securities Act, and each certificate representing any such shares shall, until
such time that such shares are not so restricted under the Securities Act,
bear a legend identical or similar in effect to the following
legend (together with any other legend or legends required by applicable
state securities Laws or otherwise, if any):

"THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER
THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 (THE "ACT") AND MAY NOT BE OFFERED, SOLD OR
OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED, ASSIGNED, PLEDGED OR HYPOTHECATED UNLESS REGISTERED
UNDER THE ACT OR UNLESS AN EXEMPTION FROM THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF
THE ACT IS AVAILABLE."

26  the Effective Time, subject to receipt by the Company of a duly executed and
completed Option Surrender Agreement from each holder of such Vested In-the-

shares of Class L Common Stock underlying such Vested In-the-Money Option as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by the value of the
Per L Share Merger Consideration, based upon the Parent Reference Price,
_plus_ (B) the product of the number of shares of Class A Common Stock

Effective Time, multiplied by the value of the Per A Share Merger
Consideration, based upon the Parent Reference Price, _minus_ (II) the
aggregate exercise price payable for all shares of Class L Common Stock and
Class A Common Stock underlying such Vested In-the-Money Option. Prior to the
Effective Time and conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger, the
Company shall take all actions as are necessary under the Company Stock Plans
and related awards to provide that all Company Options other than Vested In-
the-Money Options shall terminate and be canceled at the Effective Time for no
consideration and without any obligation of Parent, the Company or the
Surviving Entity to make any payment in respect thereof. For purposes of this
paragraph, the Surviving Entity shall deliver to each Vested In-the-Money
Option holder who has not, as of the Effective Time, delivered a duly executed

and exchanged, at the Effective Time, subject to receipt by the Company of a
duly executed and completed RSU Surrender Agreement from the holder of such
Company RSU award and subject to applicable Tax withholding, for a cash
payment equal to the sum of (I) the product of (A) the number of shares of
Class L Common Stock that are underlying such award of Company RSUs,
multiplied by (B) the value of the Per L Share Merger Consideration, based
upon the Parent Reference Price; _plus_ (II) the product of (A) the number of
shares of Class A Common Stock that are underlying such award of Company RSUs,
multiplied by (B) the value of the Per A Share Merger Consideration, based
upon the Parent Reference Price. For purposes of this paragraph, the Surviving
Entity shall deliver to each Company RSU holder who has not, as of the
Effective Time, delivered a duly executed and completed RSU Surrender
Agreement, the consideration described in this _Section 2.04(b)_ in respect of
each Company RSU promptly following delivery of a duly executed and completed
RSU Surrender Agreement.

 

(c) All payments under this Agreement to each Vested In-the-Money Option

and completed Option Surrender Agreement or RSU Surrender Agreement (as
applicable), in each case consistent with existing payroll procedures.

from such holder with respect to the Merger, and (B) instructions for
effecting the surrender of such certificates for payment, (ii) to each holder
of a Vested In-the-Money Option an Option Surrender Agreement and (iii) to

respect to the making of such payment under the Code and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax Law, all such withheld amounts to be timely remitted to the
applicable taxing authority. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and
paid to the appropriate taxing authorities, such withheld amounts shall be

class (or converted into cash or other security) by reason of any stock split,
reverse stock split, stock dividend, reclassification,

(f) _Unclaimed Merger Consideration_. Following the Closing Date, any holder
of shares of Class L Common Stock entitled to receive Per L Share Merger
Consideration (or, if such holder is not an Accredited Investor, the cash

holder is not an Accredited Investor, the cash amount payable pursuant to
_Section 2.02(b)_) who has not theretofore received payment of such
consideration in accordance with _Section 2.03_ shall thereafter look only

any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.

(h)  _Lost Certificates_. If any certificate representing shares of Class L
Common Stock or Class A Common Stock shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the
Company or the Surviving Entity, the posting by such Person of a bond in such

indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
certificate, the Surviving Entity shall, upon receipt of a duly executed and
delivered Letter of Transmittal, issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed certificate the Per A Share Merger Consideration (or, if such
holder is not an Accredited Investor, the cash amount payable pursuant to
_Section 2.02(b)_) or Per L Share Merger Consideration (or, if such holder is

or limited liability

 



49  company in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
organization, (ii) has all requisite corporate, partnership or limited

SECTION 5.10. _Healthcare Compliance._

 

(a) The business of each of Parent and its Subsidiaries is currently being,
and has at all times since January 1, 2013 been, conducted in compliance in
all material respects with all Healthcare Laws.

(b) Except as set forth on _Schedule 5.10(b)_ , there is no Proceeding, audit
or material recoupment pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened by
or before any Governmental Authority which alleges a violation of Healthcare
Laws by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries. Except as set forth on

at any time since January 1, 2013, any notice alleging a material violation of
any material Healthcare Law. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has

such Parent Healthcare Permit.

Healthcare Facility to lose such accreditation. There is not currently pending
nor, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened any proceeding, investigation,
survey or action by any accrediting body to revoke, cancel, rescind, suspend,
restrict, modify, or non-renew any such accreditation/certifications. To
Parents knowledge, no event has occurred or other fact exists with respect to
such material accreditations/certifications that allows, or after notice or
the lapse of time or both would allow, revocation or termination of any such
material accreditations/certifications, or would result in any other
impairment in the rights of any holder thereof.

 



55 (e) Each Parent Healthcare Facility is certified for participation and
reimbursement in all Government Programs from which it receives payment or in
which it participates. Each Parent Healthcare Facility is a "provider", and
each Parent Subsidiary has current and valid provider agreements (the "
_Parent Provider Agreements_ ") with each of such Government Programs from
which it or its Parent Healthcare Facilities receive payment or in which it or
they participate, whether through fiscal intermediaries, program contractors
or otherwise. As applicable, each of Parent, its Subsidiaries and each of the
Parent Healthcare Facilities is in compliance in all material respects with
the conditions of participation of the Government Programs and with the terms,
conditions and provisions of the Parent Provider Agreements. Except as listed
in _Schedule 5.10(e)_ , the Parent Provider Agreements are each in full force
and effect, and neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any
indication or has any reason to believe that any such qualifications,
certifications or Parent Provider Agreements may be suspended, subjected to an
admissions hold, terminated, restricted or withdrawn related to a Government
Program involving any Parent Healthcare Facility or Parent, any
Parent Subsidiary or any of their respective current or former officers or
directors.

(f) To the knowledge of Parent, none of Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries,
any of its or their directors, officers and employees, or Persons who provide
professional services under agreements with Parent or its Subsidiaries have,
in connection with their activities directly or indirectly related to
such party and in their professional capacities only, as applicable, engaged
in any activities which are prohibited under the federal Controlled Substances
Act, 21 U.S.C. § 801 et. seq. or the regulations promulgated pursuant to such
statute or any related state or local Laws concerning the dispensing and sale
of controlled substances.

(g) All cost reports required to be filed by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries under Titles XVIII and XIX of the Social Security Act, or any
other applicable governmental Laws or private provider rules, have been
prepared and filed on a timely basis in accordance with applicable Laws in
all material respects. All such cost reports accurately reflect in all
material respects the information to be included thereon.

practices are not in substantial compliance with all applicable laws or
policies of such Third Party Payors. Except as set forth on _Schedule

Subsidiary and each Parent Healthcare Facility to any Third Party Payor are,
to Parents knowledge, complete and accurate in all material respects.

and warranties contained in _Section 5.10(a)_ and _Section 5.10(h)_
constitute the sole and exclusive representations and warranties relating to
healthcare compliance.

63 SECTION 6.04. _Consents_.

 

(a) Without limiting the generality of _Section 6.03_ , each of the parties
hereto shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain prior to the Closing all
Consents of all Governmental Authorities and other Persons necessary in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, Copper, any holder
of Company Shares, the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company or Parent
shall have any obligation to pay any material fee to any third party (which
does not include filing or other fees payable to Governmental Authorities, any
fees required to be paid by Parent, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries under any Law or Order or any fees expressly required to be paid
by Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries pursuant to any
Contract to which it is a party) for the purpose of obtaining any Consent
except as set forth in _Section 6.05(a)_. Each of the parties hereto shall
timely make or cause to be made all filings and submissions under Laws and
regulations applicable to it as may be required for the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Except as set forth in the last
sentence of _Section 6.05(a)_ , all filing fees payable in connection with any
Consents, notifications, filings, registrations or other
materials contemplated by this paragraph shall be paid entirely by Parent.

(b) Parent acknowledges that certain Consents and waivers as set forth on
_Schedule 4.06(b)_ with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement may be required from parties to the Company Material Contracts and
other Contracts to which the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company is party
and that such Consents and waivers may not be obtained. Except for the
failure by the Company to use its reasonable best efforts in accordance with
_Section 6.04(a)_ above or any other breach of this Agreement by the Company,
the Company shall not have any liability whatsoever to Parent or Copper
arising out of or relating to the failure to obtain any Consents or waivers
that may be required under Contracts as set forth on _Schedule 4.06(b)_ in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or because of
the termination of any such Contract as a result thereof. This _Section
6.04(b)_ shall not apply to the antitrust notifications, approvals, consents,
approvals, filings, registrations and other materials to which  _Section
6.04(c)_ applies.

(c) The Company shall, immediately following the execution and delivery hereof
by all parties hereto, take all actions necessary in accordance with the DGCL
to obtain, and shall obtain, irrevocable written consents from its
stockholders approving and adopting this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby (such irrevocable written consents from the Company
stockholders party to the Voting Agreement, the " _Stockholder Consent_ ") and
shall deliver such Stockholder Consent to Parent within one (1) Business Day
following the date hereof. Within ten (10) Business Days following the
effective date of the Stockholder Consent, the Company shall deliver, by any
manner permitted by applicable Law, the notice required pursuant to Sections
228 and 262 of the DGCL to each holder of record of capital stock of the
Company that has not theretofore executed and delivered an irrevocable
written stockholder consent and is entitled to such notice under the DGCL (the
" _Appraisal Notice_ "). Parent and its counsel shall have a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on the Appraisal Notice prior to the
delivery of such Appraisal Notice to such holders and the Company shall
consider in good faith the reasonable comments of Parent or Parents counsel.
The Appraisal Notice shall comply in all material respects with the DGCL and
other applicable Law. The Company shall take all actions, and do or cause to
be done, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to deliver the
Appraisal Notice and any subsequent notice required to be delivered, or
subsequent action to be taken with respect to Appraisal Shares, pursuant to
the DGCL and other applicable Law.

 



64 (d) In furtherance (and not in limitation) of _Section 6.03_ and _Section
6.04(a)_  above, the Company and, as may be required by Law or agreement,
Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to make all notifications and filings
necessary to obtain all Consents described in the first sentence of _Section
6.04(a)_ within 30 calendar days after the date of this Agreement. As
applicable, each party shall use reasonable best efforts to (i) cooperate in
all respects with each Governmental Authority in connection with any such
filing or submission, (ii) keep the other party reasonably informed of any
communication submitted to or received from any Governmental Authority in
connection with any such filing or submission, (iii) permit the other party to

other party in advance of any meeting or conference with, any Governmental
Authority in connection with any such filing or submission and (iv) permit the
other party or its designee the opportunity to attend and participate in any
meeting with any Governmental Authority in connection with any such filing or
submission.

SECTION 6.05.  _Antitrust Notifications and Approvals_.

(a) Without limiting the generality of _Section 6.03_ , the parties hereto
shall cooperate with each other and shall use their respective reasonable
best efforts to prepare and file (i) required or necessary Notification and
Report Forms under the HSR Act and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder with the FTC and the DOJ, and (ii) notifications, filings,
registrations and other materials required or necessary under any applicable
Foreign Antitrust Law, in each case, as soon as practicable following the date
of this Agreement, but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days from and
after the date hereof, and shall respond as promptly as practicable to all
requests or inquiries received from any Governmental Authority for additional
documentation or information. The parties hereto shall also cooperate with
each other and shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to make such
other filings as are necessary, if any, in other jurisdictions in order to
comply with all applicable Laws relating to competition and shall
promptly provide any supplemental information or documentation requested by
any Governmental Authority relating thereto. All filing fees payable in
connection with the notifications, filings, registrations or other materials
contemplated by this paragraph shall be shared equally by Parent and the
Company.

(b) Each party to this Agreement shall promptly notify the other parties of
any material communication it or any of its Affiliates receives from any
Governmental Authority relating to the matters that are the subject of this
_Section 6.05_ and permit the other parties to review in advance, to the
extent permitted by Law, any proposed material communication by such party to
any Governmental Authority relating thereto. No party to this Agreement shall
agree to participate in any material meeting with any Governmental Authority
in respect of any filings, investigation or other inquiry relating to the
matters that are the subject of this _Section 6.05_ unless it consults with
the other parties in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental
Authority, gives the other parties the opportunity to attend and participate
at such meeting. Subject to the Confidentiality Agreement and applicable Laws,
the parties to this

 



65  Agreement shall coordinate and cooperate fully and promptly with each other
in exchanging such information and providing such assistance as the other
parties may reasonably request in connection with the foregoing and in
seeking early termination of any applicable waiting periods, including those
under the HSR Act and any applicable Foreign Antitrust Law. Subject to the
Confidentiality Agreement and applicable Laws, the parties to this Agreement
shall provide each other with copies of all material correspondence, filings
or communications between them or any of their representatives, on the one
hand, and any Governmental Authority or members of its staff, on the other
hand, with respect to the matters contemplated by this _Section 6.05_.

(c) Parent and the Company shall use their respective reasonable best efforts
(i) to obtain all applicable approvals from Governmental Authorities under
applicable antitrust and competition laws, (ii) to prevent the initiation of
any lawsuit by any Governmental Authority or any other Person under
applicable antitrust and competition laws, and (iii) to prevent the entry of
any decree, judgment, injunction preliminary or permanent, or any other Order
that would otherwise enjoin, prohibit or otherwise make unlawful the Merger
under applicable antitrust or competition laws. For purposes of this _Section
6.05(c)_ , reasonable best efforts shall include (i) providing information to
such Governmental Authorities and other Persons and (ii) (A) proposing,
negotiating, committing disposition of or holding separate (through the
establishment of a trust or otherwise) such of Parents, the Companys and
their respective Subsidiaries assets, properties and businesses and of the
assets, properties and businesses of the Surviving Entity and its
Subsidiaries, (B) the termination, modification or extension of existing
relationships and contractual rights and obligations of Parent, the Company,
their respective Subsidiaries, the Surviving Entity and its Subsidiaries, (C)
the establishment or creation of relationships and contractual rights and
obligations of Parent, the Company, their respective Subsidiaries, the
Surviving Entity and its Subsidiaries, (D) the termination of any relevant
venture or other arrangement, (E) any other change or restructuring of Parent,
the Company, their respective Subsidiaries, the Surviving Entity and its
Subsidiaries, (F) in the case of Parent and Copper, consenting to any of
the foregoing actions taken by the Company and its Subsidiaries and (G) in
the case of the Company, consenting to any of the foregoing; _provided_ ,
_however_ , nothing in this Agreement (including the immediately following
sentence) shall obligate Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to sell, dispose
or hold separate, or consent to the sale, disposition or holding separate of,
any assets or take any other action described in the preceding portion of this
sentence (1) that in the aggregate consist of, or take any other actions that
could reasonably be expected to result in the loss of, 7.50% or more of the
combined consolidated EBITDA of Parent, the Company and their respective
Subsidiaries for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013 (based upon Parents
and the Companys books and records) or (2) the consummation or effectiveness
of which is not conditioned on the consummation of the Closing. Without
limitation, "reasonable best efforts" shall also include (x) defending in a
reasonable manner any action or proceeding instituted (or threatened to be
instituted) challenging the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
Merger under any antitrust or competition law, and (y) taking all reasonable
actions to have vacated, rescinded, repealed, lifted, reversed, overturned or
made inapplicable any decree, judgment, injunction or Order, whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits,
prevents, restricts or delays consummation of the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any antitrust or competition
law so as to permit consummation thereof, subject to, in the case of each of
clause (x) and clause (y), the limitations set forth in the proviso to the
immediately preceding sentence.

 



66 (d) In the event Parent or the Company receives a second request under the HSR
Act or any similar inquiry or request under applicable Foreign Antitrust Laws
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, such party
shall promptly comply with such request (i) as provided by Section 7A(e) of
the HSR Act (but in no event more than sixty (60) calendar days from the date
of service of such request) or (ii) as otherwise provided under applicable
Foreign Antitrust Laws. For purposes of this provision, a party shall be
deemed to have complied with any such request by providing a response that
the party in good faith believes to be in substantial compliance and by
certifying in writing to the other parties its prompt, substantial compliance.
In the event that a party receives a subpoena or civil investigative demand
requesting materials and information similar to that usually demanded in a
second request under the HSR Act or any similar inquiry or request under
applicable Foreign Antitrust Laws, such party shall promptly comply with
such subpoena or civil investigative demand (but, with respect to a second
request under the HSR Act, in no event more than sixty (60) calendar days from
the date of service of the subpoena or civil investigative demand). In the
event the Governmental Authority disputes the adequacy of compliance by a
party with respect to a second request under the HSR Act or any similar
inquiry or request under applicable Foreign Antitrust Laws, subpoena or civil
investigative demand, such party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
endeavor to satisfy the Governmental Authority so as to minimize any delay in
the conduct or resolution of the investigation.

 

(e) From the date of this Agreement through the date of termination of the
required waiting periods under the HSR Act and all applicable Foreign
Antitrust Laws, Parent, the Company and their respective Affiliates shall not
take any action that could reasonably be expected to hinder or delay, as
applicable, the obtaining of clearance or the expiration of the required
waiting periods under the HSR Act or such applicable Foreign Antitrust Laws.

SECTION 6.06. _Access to Information_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement and applicable Laws
and Orders, during the period from the date of this Agreement through the
earlier of the Closing and the date on which this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with _Article VIII_ , the Company shall permit, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to permit, Parent and its advisors, accountants, attorneys
and authorized representatives to have reasonable access, during regular
business hours and upon reasonable notice, to the offices, facilities, assets,
properties, management-level employees, books and records of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, and shall furnish, or cause to be furnished, to Parent,
such financial, tax and operating data and other information with respect to
such entities and their respective offices, facilities, assets, properties,
employees, businesses and operations as Parent shall from time to time
reasonably request. All access and investigation pursuant to this _Section
6.06(a)_ shall be coordinated through the Companys Chief Executive Officer,
Chief Operation Officer or General Counsel and shall be conducted at Parents
expense and in such a manner as not to unreasonably interfere with the normal
operations of the businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to provide such access to or to
disclose such information where such access or disclosure would violate or
prejudice the rights of its customers, jeopardize the attorney-client
privilege or other immunity or protection from disclosure of the Company or
its Subsidiaries or contravene any Law or Order or any binding agreement
entered into prior to the date of this Agreement

 



67  (provided that the Company and/or its counsel, as applicable, shall use
their reasonable best efforts to enter into joint defense agreements or other
arrangements, as appropriate, so as to allow for such access or disclosure in
a manner that does not jeopardize such attorney-client privilege or other
immunity or protection from disclosure or contravene any such Law or binding
agreement or Order). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, prior to the Closing, (i) without the prior written consent of the
Company, Parent shall not contact any vendor to, or customer of, the Company
or any Subsidiary of the Company, to discuss the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries and provided that the Company shall have the right to have a
representative present during any such contact in the event that it is
required to consent and consents to such contact, and (ii) Parent shall have
no right to perform invasive or subsurface investigations of the properties
or facilities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries without the prior
written consent of the Company (which consent may be withheld for any reason);
_provided_ , _however_ , that, for the avoidance of doubt, Parent and Copper
are expressly permitted to cause (at their sole discretion and expense) Phase
I environmental assessments to be conducted with respect to the Owned Company
Realty.

 

(b) Subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement and applicable Laws
and Orders, during the period from the date of this Agreement through the
earlier of the Closing and the date on which this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with _Article VIII_ , Parent shall permit, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to permit, the Company and its advisors, accountants, attorneys
and authorized representatives to have reasonable access, during regular
business hours and upon reasonable notice, to the offices, facilities, assets,
properties, management-level employees, books and records of Parent and its
Subsidiaries, and shall furnish, or cause to be furnished, to the Company,
such financial, tax and operating data and other information with respect to
such entities and their respective offices, facilities, assets, properties,
employees, businesses and operations as the Company shall from time to time
reasonably request. All access and investigation pursuant to this _Section
6.06(b)_ shall be coordinated through Parents Chief Executive Officer, Chief
Operating Officer or General Counsel and shall be conducted at the Companys
expense and in such a manner as not to unreasonably interfere with the normal
operations of the businesses of Parent and its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries
shall be required to provide such access to or to disclose such information
where such access or disclosure would violate or prejudice the rights of its
customers, jeopardize the attorney-client privilege or other immunity or
protection from disclosure of Parent or its Subsidiaries or contravene any
Law or Order or any binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this
Agreement (provided that Parent and/or its counsel, as applicable, shall use
their reasonable best efforts to enter into joint defense agreements or other
arrangements, as appropriate, so as to allow for such access or disclosure in
a manner that does not jeopardize such attorney-client privilege or other
immunity or protection from disclosure or contravene any such Law or binding
agreement or Order). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, prior to the Closing, (i) without the prior written consent of Parent,
the Company shall not contact any vendor to, or customer of, Parent or any
Subsidiary of Parent, and provided that Parent shall have the right to have a
representative present during any such contact in the event that it consents
to such contact, and (ii) the Company shall have no right to perform invasive
or subsurface investigations of the properties or facilities of Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries without the prior written consent of Parent (which consent
may be withheld for any reason).

 



68 (c) The parties shall hold, and shall cause their respective Affiliates,
advisors, accountants, attorneys and representatives to hold, any non-public
information so provided to one another in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement in confidence in accordance with the provisions
of the Confidentiality Agreement;  _provided_ , _however_ , that such
information relating to the Company may be disclosed (following consultation
with the Company to the extent reasonably practicable under the circumstances)
(x) in connection with the marketing of the Debt Financing and (y) in
connection with any filings required to be made by Parent pursuant to the
Securities Act or the Exchange Act where the Required Company Financing
Information is included or incorporated by reference.

 

SECTION 6.07. _Public Statements_. Except for a mutually agreed upon joint
press release, which is being issued by the parties on the date hereof, and
except as required by applicable Law or the rules and regulations of any stock
exchange upon which Parents, the Companys, the Surviving Entitys, any
Eligible Holders or any of their respective Affiliates securities are
traded, in which event the parties shall consult with each other in advance
and provide the non-disclosing party a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on any such disclosure, no press release or other
public announcement, statement or comment in response to any inquiry relating
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be issued, made or
permitted to be issued or made by any party to this Agreement or any of its
Affiliates or representatives without the prior written consent of the other
parties hereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that any Affiliate of an Eligible
Holder may disclose the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and any
material term hereof to its investors and potential investors that are
subject to confidentiality restrictions with such Eligible Holder or such
Affiliate in the ordinary course of business. For the avoidance of doubt, this
_Section 6.07_ shall not be interpreted so as to prevent any party from
complying with _Section 6.03_ , _Section 6.04_ or _Section 6.05_.

SECTION 6.08.  _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_.

(a) For a period of six (6) years after the Closing, Parent shall not, and
shall not permit the Surviving Entity or any of its Subsidiaries to, amend,
repeal or modify any provision in the Surviving Entitys or any of its
Subsidiaries certificate or articles of incorporation, by-laws or other
equivalent governing documents relating to the exculpation, indemnification
or advancement of expenses of any Persons who at any time prior to or at the
Effective Time are or were officers or directors (or their equivalent) of the
Company or any Subsidiary of the Company (each, a " _D andO Indemnified
Person_") with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time (unless and to the extent required by Law), it being the intent
of the parties that during such six-year period all such officers and
directors of the Company and the Subsidiaries shall continue to be entitled to
such exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses to the full
extent of the Law and that no change, modification or amendment of such
documents or arrangements may be made that will adversely affect any such
Persons right thereto without the prior written consent of that Person.

 

(b) In addition to the other rights provided for in this _Section 6.08_ and
not in limitation thereof, for a period of six (6) years from and after the
Closing, the Surviving Entity shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries
(each, a " _D andO Indemnifying Party_") to, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, (i) indemnify and hold harmless (and exculpate from any
liability to the Surviving Entity or any of its Subsidiaries) the DandO
Indemnified Persons

 



69  against all DandO Expenses and all losses, claims, damages, judgments, fines,
penalties and amounts paid in settlement (" _D andO Losses_") in respect of any
threatened, pending or completed claim, action, inquiry, suit or proceeding,
whether criminal, civil, administrative or investigative, based on or arising
out of or relating to the fact that such Person is or was a director or
officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and arising out of or
relating to acts or omissions occurring or existing at or prior to the Closing
(including in respect of acts or omissions in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby) (a " _D andO Indemnifiable Claim_")
and (ii) advance, unconditionally and interest-free, to such DandO Indemnified
Persons all DandO Expenses incurred in connection with any DandO Indemnifiable
Claim (including in circumstances where the DandO Indemnifying Party is
otherwise entitled to assume the defense of such claim and has assumed such
defense) promptly after receipt of statements therefor; _provided_ , _however_
, that the Person to whom DandO Expenses are to be advanced provides an
unsecured undertaking to repay such advances to the extent it is ultimately
and finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that such Person
is not entitled to indemnification. Advance payment of DandO Expenses in
connection with any DandO Indemnifiable Claims shall continue during such six-
year period or, for any DandO Indemnifiable Claim that is pending at the
expiration of such six-year period, until such DandO Indemnifiable Claim is
disposed of or all judgments, orders, decrees or other rulings in connection
with such DandO Indemnifiable Claim are fully and finally satisfied. For the
purposes of this _Section 6.08(b)_ , " _D andO Expenses_" shall mean attorneys
fees, expert fees, arbitrator and mediator fees, and all other costs, charges
and expenses paid or incurred in connection with investigating, defending,
being a witness in or otherwise participating in (including on appeal), or
preparing to defend to be a witness in or participate in, any DandO
Indemnifiable Claim, but shall exclude losses, claims, damages, judgments,
fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement (which items are included
in the definition of DandO Losses).

(c) Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity as of the Effective Time to obtain
and fully pay for, at Parents expense ( _provided_ , that the Company shall
be responsible for any amount in excess of $357,104), "tail" insurance
policies with a claims period of at least six (6) years from and after the
Effective Time, from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit
ratings as the Companys current insurance carrier with respect to officers
and directors liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance
(collectively, " _D andO Insurance_"), for the persons who are covered by the
Companys existing DandO Insurance, with terms, conditions, retentions and
levels of coverage at least as favorable as the Companys existing DandO
Insurance in place as of the date of this Agreement with respect to matters
arising out of or relating to acts or omissions occurring or existing at or
prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby), and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Entity to maintain such DandO Insurance in full force and effect for its full
six-year term. If Parent and the Surviving Entity for any reason fail to
obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the Effective Time, the Surviving
Entity shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity to, continue to
maintain in effect the Companys existing DandO Insurance in place as of the
date of this Agreement, at no expense to the beneficiaries, for a period of
at least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, for the persons who
are covered by the Companys DandO Insurance in place as of the date of this
Agreement, with terms, conditions, retentions and levels of coverage at least
as favorable as provided in the Companys existing policies as of the date of
this Agreement, or, if such insurance is unavailable, the Surviving Entity
shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity to, purchase the
best available DandO Insurance for such six-year period from

 



70  an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys
current insurance carrier with respect to the Companys existing DandO Insurance
with terms, conditions, retentions and with levels of coverage at least as
favorable as provided in the Companys existing policies as of the date of
this Agreement ( _provided_ that Parent shall not be required to expend any
amount in excess of $357,104 pursuant to this sentence).

(d) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Entity or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or Surviving Entity or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and other assets to any Person (including by liquidation,
dissolution, assignment for the benefit of creditors or similar action), then,
and in each such case, Parent or the Surviving Entity, as the case may be,
shall cause proper provision to be made so that the applicable successors and
assigns or transferees shall succeed to (or expressly assume) the obligations
set forth in this _Section 6.08_.

 

(e) Each of the Company, Parent, the Surviving Entity and their respective
Subsidiaries shall be a full indemnitor of first resort, shall be required to
advance the full amount of all DandO Expenses incurred by a DandO Indemnified
Person and shall be liable for the full amount of all DandO Losses in accordance
with the terms of this _Section 6.08_ to the extent legally permitted and as
required, without regard to any rights a DandO Indemnified Person may have
against Bain Capital Partners, LLC or any of its Affiliates or otherwise or
any insurer providing insurance coverage under an insurance policy issued
to Bain Capital Partners, LLC or any of its Affiliates.

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the rights
and benefits of the DandO Indemnified Persons under this _Section 6.08_ shall
not be terminated or modified in any manner as to adversely affect any DandO
Indemnified Person without the prior written consent of such DandO Indemnified
Person. The provisions of this _Section 6.08_ are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each DandO Indemnified Person referred
to in _Section 6.08(a)_ , his or her heirs and his or her executors,
administrators and personal representatives, each of whom is an intended
third-party beneficiary of this _Section 6.08_ , and are in addition to, and
not in substitution for, any other rights, including rights to indemnification
or contribution that any such Person may have by Contract or otherwise.

SECTION 6.09. _Employee Benefits_.

 

(a) During the one year period commencing on the Closing Date, Parent and the
Company agree to keep in effect all severance and retention plans, practices
and policies that are applicable to employees and officers of the Company and
its Subsidiaries as of the date hereof and set forth on _Schedule 6.09(a)_ ;
provided, however, except as otherwise agreed to in a written agreement in
effect as of the date hereof, Parent shall be entitled to pay (or to revise or
amend any severance or retention plans, practices and policies to provide for)
any severance or other post-employment termination compensation or benefits to
be paid in accordance with the Companys or its Subsidiaries, as applicable,
payroll schedule and practices instead of by any lump sum payment, only to the
extent doing so would not result in adverse tax consequences under Section
409A of the Code.

 



71 (b) Subject to _Section 6.09(a)_ above, if reasonably requested by Parent, the
Company hereby covenants and agrees to amend, merge, terminate or take any
other action with respect to the Company Plans ( _provided_ , that any such
amendment, merger, termination or other action shall be contingent upon and
only effective upon the occurrence of the Closing); to provide all required
notices to participants and appropriate Governmental Authorities; to adopt all
necessary resolutions and Company Plan amendments in order to accomplish such
requests; and to provide to Patent satisfactory evidence of such actions.

(c) For purposes of eligibility, vesting and entitlement to benefits,
including the determination of the level of vacation and severance pay
benefits under the benefit and compensation plans, programs, agreements and
arrangements of Parent, the Surviving Entity or any of their respective
Subsidiaries in which employees are eligible to participate following the
Closing (the " _New Plans_ "), Parent and the Surviving Entity shall credit
each employee with his or her years of service with the Company, its
Subsidiaries and any predecessor entities, to the same extent as such
employee was entitled immediately prior to the Closing to credit for such
service under any similar Company Plan, in accordance with applicable Law,
except where such crediting would result in duplication of benefits with
respect to the same period of services or for purposes of benefit accrual
under any defined benefit pension plan. The New Plans shall not deny employees
coverage on the basis of pre-existing conditions to the extent such conditions
were waived or satisfied under similar Company Plans immediately prior to the
Closing and, subject to the requirement of applicable Law, shall credit such

definitive debt documents entered into with respect to the Debt Financing) or
as otherwise contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitment or (ii) will be
funded to Parent pursuant to the Debt Financing on the terms set forth in the
Debt Financing Commitment (or the definitive debt documents entered into

Parent and Copper (i) set forth in _Section 5.01(a)_ , _Section 5.02_ ,
_Section 5.05(a)_ and _Section 5.05(d)_ , without giving effect to any

expressly made as of an earlier date, in which case at and as of such date),

at and as of the Closing with the same effect as though made at and as of the

if made at and as of the Closing (except to the extent expressly made as of
an earlier date, in which case at and as of such date), except, in the case of
this clause (iii), where the failure to be true and correct, individually or
in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to result in a
Parent Material Adverse Effect.

(b) _Performance_. Parent and Copper shall have performed and complied, in all
material respects, with all agreements, covenants and obligations required by
this Agreement to be performed or complied with by Parent or Copper, as the
case may be, on or prior to the Closing.

to result in a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.03(a)_ , _(b)_ and

subject only to official notice of issuance.

SECTION 7.04. _Frustration of Closing Conditions_. No party may rely on the
failure of any condition set forth in this _Article VII_ to be satisfied if
such failure was caused by such partys failure to use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Closing to occur, as required by _Section 6.03(a)_ , or
to satisfy its obligations under _Section 6.04_ , _Section 6.05(c)_ or, in
the case of the condition set forth in _Section 7.02(h)_ , satisfy its
obligations under _Section 6.12(b)_ , as applicable.

 

ARTICLE VIII

SURVIVAL; TERMINATION

SECTION 8.01. _Survival_. The parties, intending to modify any applicable
statute of limitations, agree that (a) the representations and warranties in
this Agreement and in any certificate delivered pursuant hereto shall
terminate effective as of the Closing and shall not survive the Closing for
any purpose, and thereafter there shall be no liability on the part of, nor
shall any claim be made by, any party or any of their respective Affiliates in
respect thereof, (b) after the Closing, there shall be no liability on the
part of, nor shall any claim be made by, any party or any of their respective
Affiliates in respect of any covenant or agreement to be performed prior to
the Closing, and (c) the covenants and agreements in this Agreement, including
as set forth in _Article II_ , to be performed at or following the
Closing shall survive the Closing in accordance with their respective terms
only for such period as shall be required for the party required to perform
under such covenant to complete the performance required thereby. The parties
agree that neither the foregoing nor any other provision of this Agreement
shall limit the liability of any party or any of their respective Related
Parties in the case of its intentional fraud relating to the subject matter of
any of the representations and warranties in  _Article IV_ or _Article V_ ,
as applicable, of this Agreement.

SECTION 8.02. _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the
transactions contemplated hereby may be abandoned at any time prior to the
Closing:

(a) by mutual written agreement of Parent and the Company;

(b) at any time after 5:00 PM New York time on May 31, 2015 (the "
_Termination Date_ ") by either Parent or the Company, by giving written
notice of such termination to the other parties, if the Closing shall not have
occurred on or prior to such time (unless the failure to consummate the
Closing by such time shall be due to or have resulted from any breach of the
representations or warranties made by, or the failure to perform or comply
with any of the agreements or covenants hereof to be performed or complied
with prior to the Closing by, the party seeking to terminate this Agreement);

 



83 (c) by either Parent or the Company, if any restraint, Order or Law of the
type described in  _Section 7.01(b)_ permanently prohibiting the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall have become final and
non-appealable; _provided_ that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to this _Section 8.02(c)_ shall not be available to any party whose failure
to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement shall have been a material
cause of the occurrence of such restraint, Order or Law;

 

(d) by Parent, by written notice to the Company, if the Company breached or
failed to perform any of its covenants or other agreements set forth in this
Agreement or if any representation or warranty of the Company contained in
this Agreement shall be or shall have become inaccurate, in either case (i)
such that any of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.01_ or _Section 7.02_
would not be satisfied as of the time of such breach or failure or as of the
time such representation or warranty was or shall have become inaccurate, and
(ii) such breach or failure to perform or inaccuracy cannot be cured by
the Company or, if capable of being cured, shall not have been cured by the
earlier of (x) the Termination Date and (y) thirty (30) calendar days after
receipt by the Company of notice in writing from Parent specifying the nature
of such breach, failure to perform or inaccuracy and requesting that it be
cured; _provided_ that Parent shall not have the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.02(d)_ if it or Copper is then in breach

agreements set forth in this Agreement that would result in any of the closing
conditions set forth in _Section 7.01_ or _Section 7.03_ not being satisfied;

 

(e) by Parent, by written notice to the Company, if the condition set forth in
_Section 7.02(c)_ cannot be satisfied and the occurrence of the Company
Material Adverse Effect cannot be cured by the Company or, if capable of being
cured, shall not have been cured within the earlier of (x) the Termination
Date and (y) thirty (30) calendar days after receipt by the Company of notice
in writing from Parent specifying the nature of the Company Material Adverse
Effect and requesting that it be cured;

(f) by the Company, by written notice to Parent, if Parent or Copper has
breached or failed to perform any of their respective covenants or other
agreements set forth in this Agreement or if any representation or warranty of
Parent or Copper contained in this Agreement shall be or shall have become
inaccurate, in either case (i) such that any of the conditions set forth in
_Section 7.01_ or _Section 7.03_ would not be satisfied as of the time of such
breach or failure or as of the time such representation or warranty was or
shall have become inaccurate and (ii) such breach or failure to perform or
inaccuracy cannot be cured by Parent or Copper, as the case may be, or if
capable of being cured, shall not have been cured by the earlier of (x) the
Termination Date and (y) thirty (30) calendar days after receipt by Parent of
notice in writing from the Company, specifying the nature of such breach,
failure to perform or inaccuracy and requesting that it be cured; _provided_
that the Company shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to this _Section 8.02(f)_ if it is then in breach of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in
this Agreement that would result in any of the closing conditions set forth
in _Section 7.01_ or _Section 7.02_ (other than those conditions which by
their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing) not being satisfied;

 



84 (g) by the Company, by written notice to Parent, if the condition set forth in
_Section 7.03(c)_ cannot be satisfied and the occurrence of the Parent
Material Adverse Effect cannot be cured by Parent or if capable of being
cured, shall not have been cured within the earlier of (x) the Termination
Date and (y) thirty (30) calendar days after receipt by Parent of notice in
writing from the Company, specifying the nature of such Parent Material
Adverse Effect and requesting that it be cured;

 

(h) by the Company, by written notice to Parent, if (i) all of the conditions
set forth in _Section 7.01_ and _Section 7.02_  have been and continue to be
satisfied or have been and continue to be waived (other than (x) those
conditions which by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing and which
are reasonably capable of being satisfied at the Closing and (y) the Funding
Condition), (ii) the Company has irrevocably confirmed in writing to Parent
that all conditions set forth in _Section 7.01_ and _Section 7.03_ have been
satisfied (or that it will waive any unsatisfied conditions), (iii) Parent or
Copper fails to consummate the Closing within two (2) Business Days of the
date the Closing should have occurred pursuant to _Section 3.01_ (but for the
failure of the Funding Condition to be satisfied) and (iv) the Company stood
ready, willing and able to consummate such transactions on such date; or

(i) by Parent, if a valid and effective Stockholder Consent is not executed
and delivered to Parent by the end of the first (1st) Business Day following
the execution and delivery of this Agreement; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
the right to terminate the Agreement under this _Section 8.02(i)_ must be
exercised, if exercisable, by the end of the fifth (5th) Business Day
following the first (1st) Business Day following the execution and delivery
of this Agreement.

 

SECTION 8.03. _Effect of Termination_.

 

(a) In the event of the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
_Section 8.02_ , (i) this Agreement shall thereafter become void and have no
effect and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be abandoned, except
that (1) this _Section 8.03_ , _Article IX_ and the Confidentiality Agreement
shall survive termination of this Agreement and remain valid and binding
obligations of each of the parties and (2) termination of this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 8.02_ shall not release any party hereto from, subject to
the limitations set forth in the provisions of this Agreement that survive
such termination as set forth in the immediately preceding clause (1)
(including _Section 8.03(b)_ , _Section 9.13_ and _Section 9.14_ ), any
liability for any willful breach by a party of this Agreement (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, any such willful breach prior to the termination of
this Agreement) or for its intentional fraud relating to the subject matter of
any of the representations and warranties in _Article IV_ or _Article V_ , as
applicable, of this Agreement, and (ii) subject to the terms and conditions
of the provisions of this Agreement that survive such termination as described
in the immediately preceding clause (i), there shall be no liability or
obligation on the part of (x) Parent, Copper or the Company, (y) any Parent
Non-Recourse Party to the Company or any Company Non-Recourse Party or (z) any
Company Non-Recourse Party to Parent or any Parent Non-Recourse Party. Subject
to and without limitation of _Section 8.03(b)_ , _Section 9.12(b)_ and
_Section 9.13_ , if a court has granted an award of damages in connection with
any such willful breach by Parent, Copper or the Company of the terms set
forth in this Agreement, the Company or Parent, as applicable, may enforce
such award and accept damages for such breach, and Parent, Copper and the
Company agree that such damages shall not be limited to reimbursement of
expenses or out-

 



85  of-pocket costs, and may, if proven by Parent, Copper or the Company, as
applicable, and awarded by such court include the benefit of the bargain lost
by the Company and/or the holders of Company Shares or Parent and/or Copper,
as applicable (taking into consideration all relevant matters, including other
combination opportunities and the time value of money). For purposes of this
_Section 8.03_ , "willful breach" means a material breach that is a
consequence of an act undertaken by the breaching party with the actual
knowledge that the taking of such act would, or would be reasonably expected
to, constitute a breach of this Agreement.

 

(b) If this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to and in
accordance with _Section 8.02(h)_ , then Parent shall pay the Company, or its
designee, an amount equal to $50,000,000 (such amount, the " _Parent Fee_ ")
no later than two (2) Business Days after such termination of this Agreement
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account specified in
writing by the Company to Parent (it being understood that notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall Parent be
obligated to pay the Parent Fee on more than one occasion). Parents payment
of the Parent Fee will be considered liquidated damages for any breach of or
failure to perform this Agreement or the Debt Financing Commitment (or any
definitive agreement related thereto) and for any and all losses, liabilities,
damages or expenses suffered or incurred by the Company or any of the
Companys Non-Recourse Parties in connection with this Agreement, the Debt
Financing, the Debt Financing Commitment (or any definitive agreement related
thereto) or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (including
the failure of such transactions to be consummated or the abandonment or
termination thereof) or for any matters forming the basis of such termination
or otherwise. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary (but
subject to the right of the Company to seek specific performance in accordance
with, and subject to the limitations set forth in, _Section 9.12_ ), in the
event this Agreement may be terminated pursuant to _Section 8.02(h)_ , (x)
the right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Section 8.02(h)_ and
receive, if due, payment of the Parent Fee pursuant to and in accordance with
this _Section 8.03(b)_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company
and its Non-Recourse Parties for any breach of or failure to perform this
Agreement or the Debt Financing Commitment (or any definitive agreement
related thereto) and any and all losses, liabilities, damages or
expenses suffered or incurred by the Company or any of its Non-Recourse
Parties in connection with this Agreement, the Debt Financing, the Debt
Financing Commitment (or any definitive agreement related thereto) or any of
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or otherwise (including the
failure of such transactions to be consummated or the abandonment or
termination thereof) or for any matters forming the basis of such termination
or otherwise and, upon payment of the Parent Fee, none of the Company or any
of its Non-Recourse Parties shall thereafter have any claims against Parent,
Copper or any of their respective Non-Recourse Parties for any breach of or
failure to perform this Agreement or the Debt Financing Commitment (or
any definitive agreement related thereto) or any losses, liabilities, damages
and expenses suffered or incurred by the Company or the Companys Non-Recourse
Parties in connection with this Agreement, the Debt Financing, the Debt
Financing Commitment (or any definitive agreement related thereto) or any of
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (including the failure of such
transactions to be consummated or the abandonment or termination thereof) or
for any matters forming the basis of such termination or otherwise and (y)
the Parent Fee shall be the maximum aggregate liability of Parent and Copper
in connection with this Agreement, the Debt Financing, the Debt Financing
Commitment (or any definitive agreement related thereto) or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (including the failure of such
transactions to be consummated or

 



86  the abandonment or termination thereof) or for any matters forming the basis
of such termination or otherwise. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, upon payment of the Parent Fee, none of Parent, Copper or
any of their respective Non-Recourse Parties shall have any further liability
or obligation to the Company or any of its Non-Recourse Parties for any breach
of or failure to perform this Agreement or the Debt Financing Commitment (or
any definitive agreement related thereto) or any losses, liabilities, damages
or expenses suffered or incurred by the Company or any of its Non-Recourse
Parties in connection with this Agreement, the Debt Financing, the
Debt Financing Commitment or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby or otherwise (including the failure of such transactions to be
consummated or the abandonment or termination thereof) or for any matters
forming the basis of such termination or otherwise, in each case whether at
Law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, by the enforcement of any
assessment, by any legal or equitable Litigation or other proceeding, by
virtue of any statute, regulation or applicable Laws or otherwise and whether
by or through a claim by or on behalf of a party hereto or any Person
(including a claim to enforce the Debt Financing Commitment) or otherwise.

 

(c) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this _Section
8.03_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and that, without these agreements, the parties would not enter into this
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no
Person other than the Company may seek to enforce the obligation of Parent to
pay the Parent Fee pursuant to _Section 8.03(b)_.

(d) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.02_ hereof:

 

(i) all confidential information received by the parties shall be treated in
accordance with _Section 6.06(c)_ hereof and the Confidentiality Agreement
referred to in such Section; and

(ii) all filings, applications and other submissions made pursuant to
_Section 6.03_ , _Section 6.04_ and _Section 6.05_ hereof shall, to the extent
practicable, be withdrawn from the Governmental Authority, agency or other
Person to which made.

SECTION 9.02. _Amendment/Waiver, etc._ Any provision of this Agreement may be
amended or waived if, and only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and
signed, in the case of an amendment, by the Parent and the Company, or in the
case of a waiver, by the party against whom the waiver is to be effective. No
failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or privilege
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial

applicable Debt Financing Sources whose consent is required to be obtained
under the Debt Financing Commitment.

 

SECTION 9.03. _Assignment_. No party to this Agreement may assign any of its
rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent
of the other parties hereto and any attempt to assign this Agreement without
such consent shall be void and of no effect; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Parent and Copper may assign this Agreement and its rights hereunder without
the prior written consent of the Company or any other Person to any of the
Debt Financing Sources (including the lenders pursuant to the terms thereof to
the extent necessary for purposes of creating a security interest herein
or otherwise assigning as collateral in respect of such Debt Financing), but
no such assignment shall relieve Parent or Copper of any liability or
obligation hereunder.

 



89 SECTION 9.04. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including all Schedules and
Exhibits hereto) contains the entire agreement among the parties hereto with
respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements and

express third-party beneficiaries following the Effective Time, (f) _Section
6.13_ , with respect to which Eligible Holders shall be express third-party
beneficiaries following the Effective Time, (g) _Section 8.03_ , _Section

arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the negotiation, execution or
performance of this Agreement, or the transactions contemplated hereby
(whether in law or in equity, and whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise), shall be governed by and enforced pursuant to the laws of the 

 



90  State of Delaware, its rules of conflict of laws notwithstanding. Each party
hereby irrevocably agrees and consents to be subject to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware located in
Wilmington, Delaware and, if such Court of Chancery declines to exercise
jurisdiction, the United States District Court located in the State of
Delaware, in any suit, action or proceeding described in the
immediately preceding sentence of this _Section 9.08(a)_. Each party hereby
irrevocably consents to the service of any and all process in any such suit,
action or proceeding by the delivery of such process to such party at the
address and in the manner provided in _Section 9.01_. Each of the parties
hereto irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of
venue of any action, suit or proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby in (i) the United States District Court
located in the State of Delaware or (ii) the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware located in Wilmington, Delaware, and hereby further irrevocably and
unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court
that any such action, suit or proceeding brought in any such court has been
brought in an inconvenient forum. Each of the parties hereto hereby agrees
that it will not bring or support any action, cause of action, claim, cross-
claim or third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or in
equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, in any way relating to
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in
any forum other than the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware located
in Wilmington, Delaware and, if such Court of Chancery declines to exercise
jurisdiction, the United States District Court located in the State of
Delaware, and that the provisions of  _Section 9.08(b)_ relating to the
waiver of jury trial shall apply to any such action, cause of action, claim,
cross-claim or third-party claim.

 

(b) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER OR RELATE TO THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND
DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN
RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING ANY LITIGATION ARISING OUT OF THE DEBT FINANCING
COMMITMENT, OR THE BREACH, TERMINATION OR VALIDITY OF THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING THE DEBT FINANCING.
EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR
ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH
OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE
FOREGOING WAIVER, (ii) EACH SUCH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE
IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (iii) EACH SUCH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER
VOLUNTARILY, AND (iv) EACH SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS
IN THIS _Section 9.08(b)_.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in _Section 9.08(a)_ to the contrary, each of the
parties hereto agrees that it will not bring or support any Litigation
(whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against any
Debt Financing Sources in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any dispute arising
out of or relating in any way to the Debt Financing Commitment or the
performance thereof, in any forum other than the Supreme Court of the State of
New York, County of New York or the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York (and appellate courts thereof). The provisions
of this _Section 9.08(c)_ shall be enforceable by each Debt Financing Source,
its Affiliates and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

 



91 SECTION 9.09. _Counterparts, etc_. This Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, and all of
which shall constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of an executed
counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by facsimile, scanned pages
or other electronic transmission shall be effective as delivery of a manually
executed counterpart to this Agreement.

SECTION 9.10. _Headings, etc. _ The provision of the Table of Contents, the
division of this Agreement into Articles, Sections and other subdivisions and
the insertion of headings are for convenience of reading only and shall not
affect or be utilized in construing or interpreting this Agreement. All
references in this Agreement to any Article, Section, subsection or clause are
to the corresponding Article, Section, subsection or clause of this Agreement,
unless otherwise specified.

 

SECTION 9.11. _Further Assurances_. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, from time to time, at the request of any party hereto and at
the expense of the party so requesting, each other party shall execute and
deliver to such requesting party such documents and take such other action as
such requesting party may reasonably request in order to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby.

SECTION 9.12. _Remedies_.

 

(a) The parties understand and agree that the covenants and undertakings on
each of their parts herein contained are uniquely related to the desire of
the parties to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, that the
transactions contemplated hereby represent a unique business opportunity at a
unique time for each of the parties hereto and further agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any provision of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with its terms and further agree that, although
monetary damages may be available for the breach of such covenants and
undertakings, monetary damages would, except as set forth in _Section 8.03_
and _Section 9.12(b)_ , be an inadequate remedy therefor. Accordingly, except
as set forth in _Section 8.03(b)_ and _Section 9.12(b)_ , each party hereto
agrees that, in the event of any breach or threatened breach by the Company,
on the one hand, or Parent or Copper, on the other hand, of this Agreement,
the Company, on the one hand, or Parent or Copper, on the other hand, shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance and other
equitable relief to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of
this Agreement, and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this
Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to
enforce compliance with, the terms and provisions of this Agreement. Any
party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement or to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with any such order or injunction. In the event that any Litigation
should be brought in equity to enforce the provisions of this Agreement, no
party shall allege, and each party hereto hereby waives the defense, that
there is an adequate remedy at law.

 



92 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Company shall not be entitled to enforce specifically the obligations of
Parent and Copper to, and Parent and Copper shall not be obligated to,
consummate the Closing or the Merger unless the Funding Condition has been
satisfied. For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, under no circumstances shall the Company be
permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance to
require Parent and/or Copper to consummate the Closing and payment of money
damages, including payment of the Parent Fee.

SECTION 9.13. _Non-Recourse_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, except with respect to (i) any claims against a
Person in respect of its intentional fraud relating to the subject matter of
any of the representations and warranties in _Article IV_ or _Article V_ , as
applicable, of this Agreement and (ii) breaches of the Voting Agreement by
the Company stockholders party thereto or the Termination and Release
Agreement by the parties thereto, this Agreement may only be enforced against
or by, and any claims or causes of action that may be based upon, arise out
of or relate to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance
of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, may only be made
against or by the entities that are expressly identified as parties to this
Agreement in their capacities as such and then only with respect to the
obligations expressly set forth herein with respect to such party and no
former, current or future direct or indirect stockholders, equity
holders, controlling persons, directors, officers, employees, general or
limited partners, members, managers, agents or Related Parties of any party
hereto, or any former, current or future direct or indirect stockholder,
equity holder, controlling person, director, officer, employee, general or
limited partner, member, manager, agent or Related Party of any of the
foregoing (each, a " _Non-Recourse Party_ ") shall have any liability
hereunder or for any obligations or liabilities of the parties to this
Agreement or for any claim (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) based on,
in respect of, or by reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby or in
respect of any representations (whether written or oral) made or alleged to
be made in connection herewith. Without limiting the rights of any party
against the other parties hereto, in no event shall any party or any of its
Affiliates seek to enforce this Agreement against, make any claims for breach
of this Agreement against, or seek to recover damages under this Agreement
from, any Non-Recourse Party (including any of the Eligible Holders), except
with respect to (i) any claims against a Person in respect of its intentional
fraud relating to the subject matter of any of the representations and
warranties in _Article IV_ or _Article V_ , as applicable, of this Agreement
and (ii) breaches of the Voting Agreement by the Company stockholders party
thereto or the Termination and Release Agreement by the parties thereto. For
the avoidance of doubt, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a
Non-Recourse Party. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
neither the Company nor any of its Non-Recourse Parties solely in their
respective capacities as such, shall have any rights or claims in connection
with this Agreement, the Debt Financing or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby against any lender or any Affiliate thereof or
any of their respective directors, officers, employees, agents or
representatives or other Persons that have committed to provide or otherwise
entered into agreements in connection with the Debt Financing (other than
Parent and its Subsidiaries).

 



93 SECTION 9.14. _Certain Damages and Remedies_. Except (a) as set forth in
the penultimate sentence of _Section 8.03(a)_, (a) for its intentional fraud
relating to the subject matter of any of the representations and warranties in
_Article IV_ or _Article V_ , as applicable, of this Agreement and (c) as
otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, no party shall be liable for
any consequential damages, damages based upon loss of revenue, income or
profits, loss or diminution in value of assets or securities, damages
calculated by "multiple of profits" or "multiple of cash flow" or other
valuation methodology, or punitive, special, exemplary or indirect damages, in
each case in any way arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the
negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement, or the transactions
contemplated hereby (whether in law or in equity, and whether in contract or
in tort or otherwise) or otherwise. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, after the Closing, except with respect to any claims of
intentional fraud of the other party or parties relating to the subject matter
of any of the representations and warranties in _Article IV_ or _Article V_ ,
as applicable, of this Agreement, no party may seek to rescind this Agreement
or any of the transactions contemplated hereby.

SECTION 9.15. _Waiver of Conflicts_. Recognizing that Ropes and Gray LLP has
acted as legal counsel to the Company, its Subsidiaries, certain of the direct
and indirect holders of Company Shares and certain of their respective
Affiliates prior to date hereof both with respect to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated herein and otherwise, and that Ropes and Gray LLP
intends to act as legal counsel to certain of the direct and indirect holders
of Company Shares and their respective Affiliates (which will no longer
include the Company and its Subsidiaries) after the Effective Time, each of
Parent, Copper and the Company hereby waives, on its own behalf and agrees to
cause its Subsidiaries, the Surviving Entity and its Subsidiaries to waive,
any conflicts that may arise in connection with Ropes and Gray LLP representing
certain of the direct or indirect holders of the Company Shares or their
Affiliates after the Closing as such representation may relate to Parent,
Copper, the Company, the Surviving Entity or its Subsidiaries or the
transactions contemplated hereby. In addition, all communications involving
attorney-client confidences between certain of the direct and indirect holders
of Company Shares, the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective
Affiliates, on the one hand, and Ropes and Gray LLP, on the other hand, solely
to the extent relating to the negotiation, documentation and consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby and requested by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries for purposes of any pending or threatened litigation by Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries against any holder of Company Shares or any of its
Affiliates with respect to the negotiation, documentation and consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby or to be utilized by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries for purposes of any such pending or threatened litigation shall
be deemed to be attorney-client confidences that belong, from and after
the Effective Time, solely to certain of the direct and indirect holders of
Company Shares and their respective Affiliates (and not the Company, the
Surviving Entity or its Subsidiaries). Accordingly, the Surviving Entity and
its Subsidiaries shall not have access to, nor any property interest in, any
such communications or to the files of Ropes and Gray LLP relating to such
engagement for such purposes from and after the Effective Time. This _Section
9.15_ will be irrevocable, and no term of this _Section 9.15_ may be amended,
waived or modified, without the prior written consent of Ropes and Gray LLP.
