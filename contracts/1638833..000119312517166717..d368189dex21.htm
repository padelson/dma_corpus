(d) _Cancellation of Company Treasury Stock_. Each Share held in the treasury
of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and
extinguished without any conversion thereof and no payment shall be made or

2.10 _Treatment of Company Options_.

"), which shall contain (x) with respect to each Stockholder (A) the name and
address of such Stockholder, if available, (B) the number and class of Shares

2.12 _Post-Closing Merger Consideration Adjustment and Payments_.

 

(a) _Delivery of Closing Statement_. As promptly as practicable, but in no
event later than seventy-five (75) days following the Closing, Purchaser
shall in good faith prepare and deliver to the Sellers Representative a
written statement (the " _Closing Statement_ "), which shall set forth

(b) _Release of Undisputed Adjustment Escrow Amount_. Subject to
_Section 2.12(e)_ , if the Final Merger Consideration as reflected in the
Closing Statement delivered by Purchaser pursuant to _Section 2.12(a)_ is
greater than or equal to the Closing Date Merger Consideration, Purchaser and
the Sellers Representative shall provide a joint written instruction to the
Escrow Agent to release to each Securityholder (other than the Preferred
Stockholders or any Stockholder in respect of Dissenting Shares) that has
delivered to the Paying Agent a properly completed Letter of Transmittal or
that has delivered to the Company a properly completed Option Surrender
Letter, as applicable, such Securityholders Pro Rata Portion of the
Adjustment Escrow Fund as if such amount were being distributed pursuant to
_Section 2.12(e)(_ _i_ _)_ ; _provided_ , that with respect to amounts to be
released to Option Holders, such amounts shall be released to the Surviving
Corporation and shall promptly be paid by the Surviving Corporation, through
the Surviving Corporations payroll system, to each such Option Holder, less
any required withholding Taxes. In addition, (i) with respect to each Common
Stockholder who shall have delivered to the Paying Agent a properly completed
Letter of Transmittal, Purchaser shall promptly deliver to the Paying Agent
for payment to each such Common Stockholder, an amount equal to the product of
(x) the number of Fully-Diluted Shares held by such Common Stockholder and
(y) the amount as reflected on the Closing

 



25  Statement delivered by Purchaser that is greater than the Closing Date
Merger Consideration, _divided_ by the number of Fully Diluted Shares, which
amount shall be payable by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
the account designated in such Stockholders Letter of Transmittal and (ii)
with respect to each Option Holder holding In-the-Money Options who shall
have delivered to the Company a duly executed and properly completed Option
Surrender Letter, Purchaser shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay,
through the Surviving Corporations payroll system, to each such Option
Holder, an amount equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of Common
Stock subject to the In-the-Money Options held by such Option Holder and (y)
the amount as reflected on the Closing Statement delivered by Purchaser that
is greater than the Closing Date Merger Consideration, divided by the number
of Fully Diluted Shares, less any required withholding Taxes. Subject to
_Section 2.12(e)_ , if the Final Merger Consideration as reflected in the
Closing Statement delivered by Purchaser pursuant to _Section 2.12(a)_ is less
than the Closing Date Merger Consideration, Purchaser and the Sellers
Representative shall provide a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent
to release to each Securityholder (other than the Preferred Stockholders or
any Stockholder in respect of Dissenting Shares) that has delivered to the
Paying Agent a properly completed Letter of Transmittal or that has delivered
to the Company a properly completed Option Surrender Letter, as applicable,
such Securityholders Pro Rata Portion of an amount equal to the excess, if
any, of (i) the entire Adjustment Escrow Amount _over_ (ii) (x) the Closing
Date Merger Consideration _less_ (y) the Final Merger Consideration as
reflected in the Closing Statement delivered by Purchaser pursuant to
_Section 2.12(a)_ , to be paid to the Securityholders as if such amount were
being distributed pursuant to _Section (e)(ii)_.

 

(c) _Objection Notice; Dispute Resolution Procedure_. After receipt of the
Closing Statement, the Sellers Representative and its Representatives shall
have reasonable access to all relevant books and records (including accountant
work papers), accountants and employees of the Surviving Corporation to the
extent required to complete its review of the Closing Statement. If, within
sixty (60) days following the delivery of the Closing Statement, the Sellers
Representative has not given Purchaser notice of its objection to any item in
the Closing Statement, the nature of such objection and the proposed
amount for the item in dispute (an " _Objection Notice_ "), then the Closing
Statement shall be deemed final and binding on Purchaser, the Surviving
Corporation and the Sellers Representative (on behalf of all
Securityholders). If the Sellers Representative delivers an Objection
Notice, then Purchaser and the Sellers Representative shall consult in good
faith to resolve the disputed items set forth in the Objection Notice and, if
any disputed items have not been resolved within thirty (30) days following
delivery of such notice, from and after such time either the Sellers
Representative or Purchaser may submit the remaining disputed items to Grant
Thornton, LLP or, if such firm is unable to serve in such capacity, to such
other nationally recognized independent public accountant that is mutually
agreeable to the Sellers Representative and Purchaser (the " _Accountant_ ")
or, if no such agreement can be reached, the Sellers Representative and
Purchaser each shall, within ten (10) days thereof, select a candidate for the
Accountant and the two (2) candidates so selected shall promptly select a
third nationally recognized independent accounting firm which shall be
appointed as the Accountant. The scope of the disputes to be resolved by the
Accountant shall be limited to fixing mathematical errors and determining
whether the items in dispute were determined in accordance with this
Agreement (including the definition of Working Capital) and the Accountant is
not to make any other determination and shall act as an expert and not as an
arbitrator. If any items in dispute are submitted to the Accountant for
resolution, (x) Purchaser and the Sellers Representative shall use their
respective reasonable efforts to cause the Accountant to resolve all remaining
disagreements with respect to the Closing Statement as soon as practicable but
in any event shall direct the Accountant to render a determination within
ninety (90) days after its retention; (y) Purchaser and the Sellers
Representative shall furnish to the Accountant and each other such work papers
and other documents and information relating solely to the disputed issues as
the Accountant may request and are available to that party (including, in the
case of Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or its accountants), and shall be
afforded the opportunity to present to the Accountant any materials relating
to the determination and to discuss the determination with the Accountant;
_provided_ , that copies of all such

 



26  materials are concurrently provided to the other party and that such
discussions may only occur in the presence (including by telephone) of the
other party; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Accountant shall consider only
those items and amounts which are identified as being in dispute; and (z) the
determination by the Accountant of the disputed items in the Closing
Statement, as shall be set forth in a notice delivered to both parties by the
Accountant, shall be final, binding and conclusive on the parties. In
resolving any disputed item, the Accountant may not assign a value to any item
greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by either party or less
than the smallest value for such item claimed by either party. The fees of
the Accountant for such determination shall be borne by Purchaser, on the one
hand, and the Securityholders, on the other hand, in proportion to the portion
of the aggregate amount in dispute that is finally resolved by the Accountant
in a manner adverse to such party. For example, if Purchaser claims the
appropriate adjustments are $1,000, and the Sellers Representative contests
only $500 of the amount claimed by Purchaser, and if the Accountant
ultimately resolves the dispute by awarding Purchaser $300 of the $500
contested, then the costs and expenses of the Accountant will be allocated 60%
( _i.e._ , 300/500) to the Securityholders and 40% ( _i.e._ , 200/500) to
Purchaser.

(d) _Final Merger Consideration_. The Closing Date Merger Consideration shall
be adjusted as follows (without duplication, including any payments otherwise
made pursuant to _Section 2.12(b)_ ): (i) (A) increased by the amount, if any,
by which the Working Capital, as finally determined pursuant to _Section
2.12(c)_  (" _Final Working Capital_ "), is greater than the Estimated
Working Capital, or (B) reduced by the amount, if any, by which the Final
Working Capital is less than the Estimated Working Capital; (ii) (A) reduced
by the amount, if any, by which the Closing Date Company Indebtedness, as
finally determined pursuant to _Section 2.12(c)_ (" _Final Company
Indebtedness_ "), is greater than the Estimated Closing Date Company
Indebtedness or (B) increased by the amount, if any, by which the Final
Company Indebtedness is less than the Estimated Closing Date Company
Indebtedness; (iii) (A) reduced by the amount, if any, by which the Closing
Date Joint Venture Indebtedness, as finally determined pursuant to _Section
2.12(c)_ (" _Final Joint Venture Indebtedness_ "), is greater than the
Estimated Closing Date Joint Venture Indebtedness or (B) increased by the
amount, if any, by which the Final Joint Venture Indebtedness is less than
the Estimated Closing Date Joint Venture Indebtedness; (iv) (A) reduced by the
amount, if any, by which the Seller Expenses, as finally determined pursuant
to _Section 2.12(c)_ (" _Final Seller Expenses_ "), are greater than the
Estimated Seller Expenses or (B) increased by the amount, if any, by which the
Final Seller Expenses are less than the Estimated Seller Expenses; (v) (A)
increased by the amount, if any, by which the Mesa Receivable Amount, as
finally determined pursuant to _Section 2.12(c)_ (" _Final Mesa Receivable
Amount_ ") is greater than the Estimated Mesa Receivable Amount or (B) reduced
by the amount, if any, by which the Final Mesa Receivable Amount is less than
the Estimated Mesa Receivable Amount; or (vi) (A) increased by the amount, if
any, by which the Closing Date Cash and Cash Equivalents, as finally
determined pursuant to _Section 2.12(c)_ (" _Final Cash and Cash Equivalents_
"), are greater than the Estimated Cash and Cash Equivalents or (B) reduced by
the amount, if any, by which the Final Cash and Cash Equivalents are less than
the Estimated Cash and Cash Equivalents.

 

(e) _Final Closing Adjustment Payment_. No later than the third (3rd) Business
Day following the final determination of the Adjustment Amount,

(i) if the Adjustment Amount is positive:

 

 (1) with respect to each Common Stockholder who shall have delivered to the Paying Agent a properly completed Letter of Transmittal, Purchaser shall promptly deliver to the Paying Agent for payment to each such Common Stockholder, an amount equal to the product of the number of Fully-Diluted Shares held by such Common Stockholder and the Adjustment Amount Per Share (net of any payments previously received by such Common Stockholder pursuant to _Section 2.12(b)_ ), which amount shall be payable by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account designated in such Stockholders Letter of Transmittal; 

 



27 (2) with respect to each Option Holder holding In-the-Money Options who shall
have delivered to the Company a duly executed and properly completed Option
Surrender Letter, Purchaser shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay,

Holder, an amount equal to the product of the number of shares of Common Stock
subject to the In-the-Money Options held by such Option Holder and the
Adjustment Amount Per Share (net of any payments previously received by such
Option Holder pursuant to _Section 2.12(b)_ ), less any required withholding
Taxes; and

 

(3) Purchaser and the Sellers Representative shall provide a joint written
instruction to the Escrow Agent to release to each Securityholder (other than
the Preferred Stockholders or any Stockholder in respect of Dissenting Shares)
that has delivered to the Paying Agent a properly completed Letter of
Transmittal or that has delivered to the Company a properly completed Option
Surrender Letter, as applicable, such Securityholders Pro Rata Portion of the
Adjustment Escrow Fund; _provided_ , that with respect to amounts to be
released to Option Holders, such amounts shall be released to the Surviving
Corporation and shall promptly be paid by the Surviving Corporation, through
the Surviving Corporations payroll system, to each such Option Holder, less
any required withholding Taxes; or

 

(ii) if the Adjustment Amount is negative:

 

(1) Purchaser and the Sellers Representative shall provide a joint written
instruction to the Escrow Agent to release an amount equal to the Adjustment
Amount to Purchaser from the Adjustment Escrow Account and if the Adjustment
Escrow Fund is insufficient to cover the entire Adjustment Amount, Purchaser
and Sellers Representative shall provide a joint written instruction to the
Escrow Agent to release an amount equal to such deficiency to Purchaser from
the Indemnity Escrow Fund; and

 

(2) Purchaser and the Sellers Representative shall provide a joint written
instruction to the Escrow Agent to release to each Securityholder (other than
the Preferred Stockholders or any Stockholder in respect of Dissenting Shares)
that has delivered to the Paying Agent a properly completed Letter of
Transmittal or that has delivered to the Company a properly completed Option
Surrender Letter, as applicable, such Securityholders Pro Rata Portion of any
portion of the Adjustment Escrow Fund remaining following any payment to
Purchaser pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.12(e)(ii)(1)_;  _provided_ , that
with respect to amounts to be released to Option Holders, such amounts shall
be released to the Surviving Corporation and shall promptly be paid by the
Surviving Corporation, through the Surviving Corporations payroll system, to
each such Option Holder, less any required withholding Taxes; or

(iii) if the Adjustment Amount is zero, Purchaser and the Sellers
Representative shall provide a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent
to release to each Securityholder (other than the Preferred Stockholders or
any Stockholder in respect of Dissenting Shares) that has delivered to the
Paying Agent a properly completed Letter of Transmittal or that has delivered

28  previously received by such Securityholder pursuant to _Section 2.12(b)_ );
_provided_ , that with respect to amounts to be released to Option Holders,
such amounts shall be released to the Surviving Corporation and shall
promptly be paid by the Surviving Corporation, through the Surviving
Corporations payroll system, to each such Option Holder, less any required
withholding Taxes.

 

(f) Following the release of any funds to the Securityholders pursuant to
_Section 2.12(e)(_ _i_ _)(2)_ ,  _Section_ __ _ 2.12(e)(ii)(2)_ or _Section
2.12(e)(iii)_ , as applicable, Purchaser and the Sellers Representative shall
provide a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent to release to the
Paying Agent the remaining portion of the Adjustment Escrow Fund. Upon
delivery of a properly completed Letter of Transmittal or Option Surrender
Letter, as applicable, Purchaser shall cause the Paying Agent to pay to any
such Securityholder, such Securityholders applicable portion of such amount.

(g) For the avoidance of doubt, neither the Sellers Representative nor any
Securityholder, nor any of their respective Affiliates, shall have any
Liability or obligation under this _Section_ __ _ 2.12_ for any portion of
the Adjustment Amount in excess of the funds remaining in the Adjustment
Escrow Account and the Indemnity Escrow Account (up to a maximum amount equal
to the Adjustment Amount). Recovery from the Adjustment Escrow Account and the
Indemnity Escrow Account (up to a maximum amount equal to the Adjustment
Amount) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy available to Purchaser for any
claims by Purchaser against the Securityholders, or otherwise, arising out of
or relating to any negative Adjustment Amount and neither Purchaser nor the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates shall have any
claim against any Securityholder in respect thereof.

(h) The Adjustment Amount shall be treated as an adjustment to the Closing
Date Merger Consideration for income Tax purposes.

shall not have delivered to the Paying Agent, at least three (3) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, a properly completed Letter of Transmittal,

2.13 _Notices to Stockholders; Dissenting Shares_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Purchaser shall designate
Acquiom Clearinghouse LLC to act as paying agent in connection with the
Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ ") to receive, for the benefit of the
Stockholders, the portion of the Closing Date Merger Consideration to which
the Stockholders shall become entitled pursuant to _Section 2.6(b)_ and 
_Section_ _2.6(c)_. Purchaser shall deposit the portion of the Closing Date
Merger Consideration to which the Stockholders shall become entitled pursuant
to _Section 2.6(b)_ and _Section_ _2.6(c)_ with the Paying Agent for delivery
to the Stockholders in accordance with this _ARTICLE 2_ , at or immediately
following the Effective Time. At any time following

 



29  the twelve (12) month anniversary of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall be
entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any portion of the
Preferred Stock Consideration or Common Stock Consideration then held by it
(including any interest received with respect thereto) that has not been
disbursed to Stockholders; _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event Purchaser is required to make any payments to any
Stockholders in respect of Dissenting Shares, Purchaser shall be entitled to
require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any portion of the Preferred Stock
Consideration or Common Stock Consideration then held by the Paying
Agent (including any interest received with respect thereto) in respect of
Dissenting Shares.

(b) The Company shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date
hereof, mail or otherwise deliver to each Stockholder (i) a letter from the
Company (A) providing such Stockholder with a brief information statement
regarding the Company and the transactions contemplated hereby, and (B) with
respect to each Stockholder, (I) providing the notification required by
Section 228(e) of the DGCL with respect to the Written Consent and (II)
providing notice in the manner contemplated in Section 262 of the DGCL of
such Stockholders right to dissent to the Merger pursuant to Section 262 of
the DGCL, and (ii) a Letter of Transmittal for return to the Paying Agent and
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates and
payments therefor. The Company shall afford Purchaser a reasonable opportunity
to review and comment upon the documents described in this _Section 2.13(b)_
and shall consider in good faith Purchasers comments thereto. Upon
surrender to the Paying Agent of any Certificates (other than Certificates
representing Dissenting Shares), together with a duly completed and validly
executed Letter of Transmittal, the holders of each Certificate shall be
entitled to receive from Purchaser (or the Paying Agent on behalf of
Purchaser), on or after the Closing Date (but following the Effective Time),
pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions in this Agreement, in
exchange for each applicable Share formerly evidenced thereby, payment of
such holders applicable portion of the Preferred Stock Consideration or the
Common Stock Consideration, as applicable, and each such Certificate so
surrendered shall be forthwith canceled. Until surrendered in accordance with
the provisions of this _Section_ _2.13(b)_ , each Certificate (other than
Certificates canceled pursuant to _Section 2.9(d)_ and Certificates
representing Dissenting Shares) shall represent for all purposes only the
right to receive the applicable portion of the Preferred Stock Consideration
or the Common Stock Consideration, as applicable. No interest will be paid or
will accrue for the benefit of the holders of the Certificates on the
Preferred Stock Consideration or the Common Stock Consideration, as
applicable, payable upon the surrender of the Certificates. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if any Certificate (other than any Certificate representing
Dissenting Shares) shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Purchaser shall
pay, or shall cause the Paying Agent to pay, the Preferred Stock Consideration
or the Common Stock Consideration, as applicable, payable in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate upon the making of a customary affidavit
of that fact by the registered holder of such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Purchaser or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, and, if required by the Purchaser
or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, (x) the posting of a bond
in such amount and form as Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation, as the case
may be, may reasonably direct or (y) agreeing to indemnify Purchaser or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, against any claim that may be made
against Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such
Certificate.

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
any shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by any Stockholder who
has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who
is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (collectively, the " _Dissenting
Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the applicable
portion of the Preferred Stock Consideration or the Common Stock Consideration
due in respect of such shares under this Agreement. Such Stockholder shall
instead be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of such
Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section

 



30  262 of the DGCL, except that any Dissenting Shares held by a Stockholder who
shall have failed to perfect or who effectively shall have withdrawn or
otherwise lost his, her or its rights to appraisal of such Dissenting Shares
under such Section 262 of the DGCL shall thereupon be deemed to have been
converted into and to have become exchangeable, as of the Effective Time, for
the right to receive the applicable portion of the Preferred Stock
Consideration or the Common Stock Consideration due in respect of such shares
under this Agreement, in each case, without any interest thereon. The Company
shall serve prompt notice to Purchaser of any demands for appraisal of
any Dissenting Shares, and Purchaser shall have the right to participate in
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of
Purchaser, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle,
any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

(d) At the Effective Time, any holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto, except the rights provided in Section
262 of the DGCL.

 

2.14 _No Further Ownership Rights in Shares; Closing of Transfer Books_. At
the Effective Time, the Share transfer books shall be closed and no transfer
of Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
thereafter be made. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any further action on the part of the Stockholders, Purchaser, the Company or
Merger Sub, the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be cancelled and extinguished, and each Certificate or
instrument previously representing such Shares shall represent only the
right to receive its respective portion of the Final Merger Consideration
pursuant to this _ARTICLE 2_. No dividends or other distributions with respect
to capital stock of the Surviving Corporation with a record date after the
Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Shares,
including Dissenting Shares.

2.15 _Unclaimed Amounts_. Any remaining cash unclaimed by the Securityholders
as of a date which is immediately prior to such time as such amounts would
otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Body shall, to the
extent permitted by Applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto.

2.16  _Withholding_. Purchaser and its Affiliates and Representatives, the
Paying Agent and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to withhold any Tax that
is required to be withheld pursuant to Applicable Law from any amount paid
pursuant to the Transaction Documents, and any such amount withheld and
remitted to the applicable Governmental Body as required by Applicable Law

reasonable efforts to waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions and
waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements
applicable to each Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents under

such action unless the taking of such action is conditioned upon the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement), in each case, as may be necessary, required or advisable in order
to obtain clearance under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws, to avoid the
entry of, or to effect the dissolution of or to vacate or lift, any decree,
judgment, injunction or other order (whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent) that would otherwise have the effect of restraining, preventing or
delaying the consummation of the Merger, the other transactions contemplated
hereby or the transactions contemplated by the Bain Investment, or to avoid
the commencement of any Legal Action that seeks to prohibit the Merger, any
other transaction contemplated by this Agreement or any transaction
contemplated by the Bain Investment; and (ii) if any objections are asserted
with respect to the Merger, the other transactions 

 



58  contemplated hereby or the transactions contemplated by the Bain Investment

challenging the Merger, any of the other transactions contemplated hereby or
any of the transactions contemplated by the Bain Investment as violative of
the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws, each of the parties hereto
shall cooperate with one another and Purchaser shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to: (x) oppose or defend against any such Legal Action to
prevent or enjoin consummation of the Merger, the other transactions
contemplated hereby and the transactions contemplated by the Bain Investment
and/or (y) take such action as necessary to overturn any such action by any

Order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that would restrain,
prevent or delay the Merger, the other transactions contemplated hereby or the
transactions contemplated by the Bain Investment, or in order to resolve any
such objections or challenge as such Governmental Body may have to such
transactions under such Antitrust Laws so as to permit consummation of the
Merger, the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by the Bain Investment. Except as may be prohibited
by any Governmental Body or by any Applicable Law, Purchaser, on the one hand,
and the Company on the other, will reasonably consult and cooperate with one
another, and consider in good faith the views of one another, in connection
with any analysis, appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief, argument,
opinion or proposal made or submitted in connection with any Legal Action
under or relating to the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws. In addition, except
as may be prohibited by any Governmental Body or by any Applicable Law, in
connection with any Legal Action under or relating to the HSR Act or other
Antitrust Laws, each of Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Company, on the
other, will permit outside counsel of the other party to be present at each
meeting or conference relating to any such Legal Action and to be consulted in
connection with any document, opinion or proposal made or submitted to any
Governmental Body in connection with any such Legal Action.

or contact with the DOJ or the FTC and except as may be prohibited by any
Governmental Body or by any Applicable Law, or as necessary to preserve any
applicable legal privilege, shall furnish to the other parties (if necessary
or advisable, on an outside counsel basis) all such information in its
possession as may be necessary for the completion of any required reports or
notifications. Neither Purchaser nor the Company shall agree to participate in
any meeting with any Governmental Body in respect of any such filings,
investigation or other inquiry unless it consults with the other party in
advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Body and Applicable
Law, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and participate at such
meeting. 

7.3 _Public Announcements_. Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing
Date, except to the extent required by Applicable Laws, none of the parties
hereto shall, directly or indirectly, issue any press release or public
announcement of any kind concerning the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto. In
the event any such public announcement, release or disclosure is required by
Applicable Laws, Purchaser and the Company will, to the extent consultation
would not, in the reasonable opinion of the disclosing partys counsel,
cause such party to violate any Applicable Law or order of any court or other
Governmental Body, consult prior to the making thereof and use their
reasonable best efforts to agree upon a mutually satisfactory text.

 

7.4 _Resignations_. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain and deliver to Purchaser at the Closing evidence reasonably

(a) Each of Purchaser and Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts to

Commitments (including, as necessary, agreeing to any requested changes to
the commitments thereunder in accordance with any "flex" provisions contained
in the Debt Financing Commitments or any related fee letter), in each case
which terms shall not in any respect expand on the conditions to the funding
of the Debt Financing at Closing or reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt
Financing available to be funded on the Closing Date (unless the Equity
Financing is increased by a corresponding amount (or Purchaser or Merger Sub
may draw upon an available revolving credit facility to fund an amount equal
to such reduction)) and (iv) assuming all conditions contained in such Debt
Financing Commitments have been satisfied, to enforce its rights under the
Debt Financing Commitments and the Debt Financing Documents in order to
consummate the Financing at or prior to Closing. Each of Purchaser and Merger
Sub shall use reasonable best efforts, assuming all conditions contained in
the Equity Financing Commitment have been satisfied, to obtain the Equity
Financing contemplated by the Equity Financing Commitment upon satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions to the Closing set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.1_
and  _Section_ __ _ 8.2_. Each of Purchaser and Merger Sub shall not permit
or consent to, without the prior consent of the Company, (w) any amendment,
supplement or modification to be made to the Equity Financing Commitment
(other than to increase the amount of Equity Financing), (x) any amendment,
supplement or modification to be made to the Debt Financing Commitments
(without the prior written consent of the Company) if such amendment,
supplement or modification would (A) expand or impose new conditions
precedent to the funding of the Debt Financing from those set forth therein on
the date hereof, (B) reasonably be expected to materially impair, materially
delay or prevent the availability of all or a portion of the Debt Financing
or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (C)
reduce the aggregate cash amount of the Debt Financing (including by changing
the amount of fees to be paid or original issue discount of the Debt
Financing (except as set forth in any "flex" provisions existing on the date
hereof) (unless any such reduction is matched with an equal increase of the
Equity Financing under the Equity Financing Commitment (or Purchaser
or Merger Sub may draw upon an available revolving credit facility to fund an
amount equal to such reduction)) to an amount such that the Financing is
insufficient to consummate the Closing (collectively, the " _Restricted
Commitment Amendments_ "); _provided_ , that subject to the limitations set
forth in this _Section_ __ _ 7.5_, each of Purchaser and Merger Sub may
amend, restate, amend and restate, or otherwise modify the Debt
Financing Commitments (1) to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners,

Financing Commitments as of the date hereof, (2) to implement any "flex"
provisions applicable thereto and (3) amend or agree to other amendments or
waivers, (y) any waiver of any remedy against the Financing Sources under the
Equity Financing Commitment or Debt Financing Commitments (other than a
condition to funding in favor of the lenders thereunder), or (z) early
termination of the Equity Financing Commitment or Debt Financing Commitments
prior to the termination of this Agreement, in each case of the foregoing, in
a manner that could reasonably be expected to materially impair or prevent
the consummation of the Closing. For purposes of this Agreement, references to
the "Debt Financing Commitments" shall include such document(s) as permitted
or required by this  _Section_ __ _ 7.5_ to be amended, modified or waived,
in each case from and after such amendment, modification or waiver. Each of
Purchaser and Merger Sub

 



60  acknowledges and agrees that its obligations to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are not conditioned or contingent upon receipt
of the Financing and reaffirms its obligation to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement irrespective and independently of the
availability of Financing or any alternative financing, subject only to
completion of the Marketing Period and the satisfaction of the applicable
conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.1_ and _Section_ __ _ 8.2_. Upon
the written request of the Company, each of Purchaser and Merger Sub shall
keep the Company informed in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts
to arrange the Debt Financing (subject to any applicable restrictions in the
Debt Financing and to the extent such disclosure would not result in a breach
of any third party confidentiality obligations or attorney-client privilege).

(b) Each of Purchaser and Merger Sub shall promptly notify the Company in
writing (i) of any material breach or default by Purchaser (or, to
Purchasers knowledge, the Debt Financing Sources) of the Debt Financing
Commitments, (ii) of the receipt by Purchaser or Merger Sub or any of their
respective Affiliates or Representatives of any written notice from the Debt
Financing Sources, any lender or any other Person with respect to any actual
breach, default or termination of the Debt Financing Commitments or any Debt
Financing Document or any material portion of the Financing contemplated
pursuant to the Debt Financing Commitments or Debt Financing Documents that
could reasonably be expected to materially impair or prevent the consummation
of the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitments at
Closing, (iii) if for any reason Purchaser or Merger Sub believes in good
faith that it will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the Financing
on the terms, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by the Debt
Financing Commitments or the Debt Financing Documents (other than to the
extent the issuance of debt securities may replace any bridge facilities
included in the Debt Financing) that could reasonably be expected to
materially impair or prevent the consummation of the Debt
Financing contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitments at Closing and (iv)
of the termination or expiration of the Debt Financing Commitments or Debt
Financing Documents prior to the termination of this Agreement. As soon as
reasonably practicable after the Company delivers to Purchaser a written
request, each of Purchaser and Merger Sub shall provide any information
reasonably requested by the Company relating to any of the circumstances
referred to in this _Section 7.5(b)_.

 

(c) In the event that any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable in
the manner or from the sources contemplated in the Debt Financing Commitments
(other than, in the case of any bridge facilities included in the Financing,
as may occur due to the issuance of other debt securities), each of Purchaser
and Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions necessary to arrange for and obtain as promptly as
practicable following the occurrence of any such event, alternative debt
financing (the " _Alternative Financing_ "), including from alternative
sources on terms and conditions that are not less favorable to Purchaser
(including the "flex" conditions) than those set forth in the Debt Financing
Commitments and in an amount sufficient to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby and perform all of its obligations hereunder, it being
understood and agreed that if Purchaser and Merger Sub proceed with any
Alternative Financing, each of Purchaser and Merger Sub shall be subject to
the same obligations with respect to such Alternative Financing as set forth
in this Agreement with respect to the Debt Financing. In the event that
Alternative Financing is obtained, each of Purchaser and Merger Sub shall
promptly provide the Company with a copy of the new financing commitment that
provides for such Alternative Financing (the " _Alternative Financing
Commitments_ "). If applicable, any reference in this Agreement to "Debt
Financing" shall include "Alternative Financing", any reference to "Debt
Financing Commitments" shall include the "Alternative Financing Commitments"
and any references to "Debt Financing Documents" shall include the definitive
documentation relating to any such Alternative Financing.

reasonable best efforts to, provide to Purchaser and Merger Sub, at the sole
expense of Purchaser and Merger Sub, such reasonable cooperation in
connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing (solely for purposes of
this _Section 7.5(d)_ , the term "Debt Financing" shall be deemed to include

historical information furnished in writing by or on

 



63  behalf of the Company and its Subsidiaries, including financial statements

against any party in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereunder; and

(c) any failure of that party to comply with or satisfy any covenant,

could reasonably be expected to give rise to a right of termination set forth
in _Section 9.1(c)_ or _Section 9.1(d)_ , as the case may be;

 

 _provided_ _,_ _however_ , __ that the delivery of any notice pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 7.7_ shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies
available hereunder to the party receiving that notice.

7.8 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) All federal, state, local, foreign and other transfer, sales, use or
similar Taxes applicable to, imposed upon or arising out of the transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Documents (" _Transfer Taxes_ ") shall be

such Taxes, fees and charges, and the parties hereto shall (and shall cause
their Affiliates to) reasonably cooperate with respect to such Tax Returns and

Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with past practice,
except as otherwise required by Applicable Law. The Company shall furnish a
complete copy of such Tax Returns to Sellers Representative for review and

64 (ii) For purposes of determining the amount of any Tax relating to a
Straddle Period that is allocable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period: (i) in the
case of property Taxes, the amount attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period
shall equal the amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period
multiplied by a faction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar days
of such Straddle Period in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the denominator
of which is the number of calendar days in the entire Straddle Period, and
(ii) in the case of all other Taxes, the amount attributable to the Pre-
Closing Tax Period shall be determined as though the relevant taxable period

any of their respective Affiliates for which Sellers Representative would be
expected to be liable pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 10.2_ (a " _Tax Claim_ "),
Purchaser shall give Sellers Representative prompt written notice of such Tax
Claim. The failure to give such prompt written notice shall not release, waive
or otherwise affect Sellers Representatives obligations with respect
thereto except to the extent that Sellers Representative is actually and
materially prejudiced as a result of such failure.

 

(ii) Sellers Representative shall have the right to assume control of any Tax
Claim, relating solely to a Pre-Closing Tax Period if within fifteen (15) days
of receiving notice of the Tax Claim Sellers Representative notifies
Purchaser of its intent to take control of such Tax Claim, provided that (A)

the prior written consent of Purchaser, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. Purchaser shall have the right to represent
the interests of the Company Group in any Tax Claim with respect to which

without the prior written consent of Sellers Representative, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Each Party will bear its own
costs incurred in participating in any proceeding relating to any Tax Claim.

receives any refund of Taxes of any member of the Company Group paid for any
Pre-Closing Tax Period or the portion of any Straddle Period allocable to the
Pre-Closing Tax Period (as determined in accordance with the principles of
_Section 7.8(b_ _)(_ _ii)_ ) (in each case, whether in the form of cash
received

 



65  from the applicable Governmental Body or a direct offset of Taxes otherwise
payable) other than any such Tax refund or Tax credit, or portion thereof, (i)
taken into account in the computation of Working Capital, or (ii) arising
from the carryback of losses, credits or other Tax attributes from a Post-
Closing Tax Period, then, in any such case, the Company shall promptly, and in
any event within ten (10) Business Days of receipt thereof, pay, or cause to
be paid, to the Sellers Representative (as agent for, on behalf of, and for
payment to, the Securityholders), the amount of such Tax refund (net of any
Tax and other costs) and the Sellers Representative shall pay each
Securityholder such Securityholders Pro Rata Portion of such payment;
_provided_ , that amounts to be paid to Option Holders pursuant to the
foregoing shall be retained by the Company and be promptly paid through the
Companys payroll system to each Option Holder, less any required withholding
Taxes. Any payments so made to the Securityholders pursuant to this _Section
7.8(d)_ shall be treated as an increase to each Securityholders Per Share
Merger Consideration. Where permitted by Applicable Law, the Company Group
shall, and shall cause each of its Affiliates, to request a cash refund
(rather than a credit in lieu of refund) if such refund would be payable to
the Sellers Representative pursuant to this _Section 7.8(d)_. The Company
shall file IRS Form 4466 (Corporation Application for Quick Refund of
Overpayment of Estimated Tax) and any analogous state and local forms (if
applicable) within thirty (30) days of the Closing Date. Additionally, with
respect to any net operating loss of the Company Group relating to the
Companys 2016 tax year and any taxable period ending on the Closing Date, the

preceding taxable years of the Company Group (to the extent permitted by
Applicable Law) in a manner consistent with the requirements set forth on
_Schedule 7.8(d)_ , (y) file IRS Form 1139 (Corporation Application for
Tentative Refund) and any analogous state and local forms (if applicable) to
claim a refund with respect to the carryback of such net operating loss within
six (6) months of the Closing Date, and (z) not waive or cause to be waived
the carryback period for such net operating loss. The Company shall pay, or
cause to be paid, any refund amount received (net of Tax and other costs)

(e) The parties hereto agree to furnish or cause to be furnished to the
other, upon request, as promptly as practicable, such information and
assistance relating to Taxes as is reasonably requested by any other party.

 

(f) Unless required by Applicable Law, following the Closing, neither the
Company Group nor any of their respective Affiliates shall (i) amend, re-file
or otherwise modify any Tax Return relating in whole or in part to any member
Company Group with respect to all or any portion of a Pre-Closing Tax Period,
(ii) make or change any Tax election or accounting method with respect to, or
that has a retroactive effect on, any Pre-Closing Tax Period or (iii) enter
into any voluntary disclosure agreement with any Governmental Body with
respect to any Taxes for any Pre-Closing Tax Period, in each case, if such
action could give rise to a claim for indemnification under this Agreement
without Sellers Representatives prior written consent, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(g) All Tax sharing or similar agreements with respect to the Company and any
Person in which the Company owns an equity interest, other than any such
agreements (i) between or among the Company and any of its Subsidiaries as of
the Closing or (ii) made pursuant to commercial contracts entered into in the
ordinary course of business that do not primarily relate to Taxes, shall be
terminated prior to the Closing, and, after the Closing, neither the Company
nor any Person in which the Company owns a direct or indirect equity interest
shall be bound thereby or have any Liability thereunder.

 



66 (h) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that for purposes of reporting
any U.S. federal, state or local tax consequences arising in connection with

ARTICLE 9

TERMINATION 

9.1 _Termination_. __This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger may be
abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time (notwithstanding any
approval of this Agreement by the Securityholders):

(a) by mutual written agreement of the Company and Purchaser;

 



68 (b) by either the Company or Purchaser, if:

 

(i) the Merger has not been consummated on or before November 9, 2017 (the "
_End Date_ "); or

 

(ii) any Governmental Body shall have enacted, issued or promulgated any
Applicable Law, or shall have issued or granted any Order, in each case, that
restrains, enjoins or otherwise prevents the consummation of the Merger and
such enjoinment shall have become final and nonappealable; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the party seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this _Section 9.1(b)(ii)_ shall have used all reasonable best efforts as may
be required by _Section_ __ _ 7.1_ or _Section_ __ _ 7.2_ to prevent, oppose
and remove such Order.

 

(c) by Purchaser, if a breach of any representation or warranty or failure to
perform any covenant or agreement on the part of the Company set forth in
this Agreement shall have occurred (A) that would cause any of the conditions
set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.2_ not to be satisfied, and (B) if such breach
or failure is curable, such breach or failure is not cured by the Company by
the earlier of (x) the End Date or (y) thirty (30) calendar days following
receipt by the Company of written notice of such breach or failure, _provided_
, that at the time of the delivery of such written notice, neither Purchaser
nor Merger Sub shall be in material breach of its obligations under this
Agreement and such breach would give rise to the failure of a condition set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.2_;

 

(d) by the Company, if:

 

(i) a breach of any representation or warranty or failure to perform any
covenant or agreement on the part of Purchaser or Merger Sub set forth in
this Agreement shall have occurred (A) that would cause any of the conditions
set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.3_ not to be satisfied, and (B) if such breach
or failure is curable, such breach or failure is not cured by the earlier of
(x) the End Date or (y) thirty (30) calendar days following receipt by
Purchaser of written notice of such breach or failure, _provided_ , that at
the time of the delivery of such written notice, the Company shall not be in
material breach of its obligations under this Agreement and such breach would
give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.3_; or

 

(ii) the Marketing Period has ended and the conditions to Closing set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 8.1_ and  _Section_ __ _ 8.2_ have been satisfied or waived
(other than those to be satisfied at Closing) and the Purchaser fails to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby on the date the Closing should
have occurred pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.2_; or

(e) by Purchaser, at any time after twenty-four (24) hours following
the execution of this Agreement and prior to receiving a copy of the Written
Consent (it being understood that Purchaser cannot terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this subsection if it receives a copy of the Written Consent
within twenty-four (24) hours following the execution of this Agreement).

For the avoidance of doubt, nothing herein shall permit Purchaser to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 9.1_ for any reason relating
to the Sequoia Matter.

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __
_ 9.1_ (other than pursuant to _Section 9.1(a)_ ) shall give notice of such
termination to the other party, including a description in reasonable detail
of the reasons for such termination, in accordance with _Section_ __ _
11.7_, specifying the provision or provisions hereof pursuant to which such
termination is effected.

 



69 9.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.1_, this Agreement shall become void
and there shall be no Liability on the part of any party hereto except (a) the
obligations provided for in this _Section_ __ _ 9.2_ and  _Section_ __ _
7.3_ (Public Announcements) and _ARTICLE 11_ (General Provisions) (other than
_Section_ __ _ 11.13_ (Specific Enforcement)) hereof shall survive any such
termination of this Agreement;  _provided_ , that the term of the
Confidentiality Agreement shall not be affected by the termination of this
Agreement, shall survive any such termination and be automatically extended
until such date that is two (2) years following the date of termination of
this Agreement, and (b) subject to the remainder of this _Section_ __ _ 9.2_,
nothing herein shall relieve any party from Liability for any willful breach
of this Agreement prior to such termination. In the event of the termination
of this Agreement by (i) the Company pursuant to _Section 9.1(d)_ , (ii)
Purchaser pursuant to _Section 9.1(b)_ at a time when the Company could have
terminated this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(d)_ or (iii) the Company
or Purchaser pursuant to _Section 9.1(b)(i)_ at a time when all the conditions
to Closing set forth in _ARTICLE 8_ have been satisfied or waived (other than
_Section 8.2(f)_ and those conditions to be satisfied at Closing, all of
which would be satisfied if the Closing were to occur as of such date of
termination), Purchaser shall promptly, but in no event later than three (3)
Business Days after the date of such termination, pay or cause to be paid to
the Company by wire transfer of same day funds an amount equal to $45,600,000
(the " _Termination Fee_ ") (it being understood that in no event shall
Purchaser be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in the event that
Purchaser is obligated to pay the Termination Fee, and without limiting the
last sentence of this _Section_ __ _ 9.2_, the actual receipt by the Company
of the Termination Fee shall be deemed to be liquidated damages and, without
limiting the rights of the Company pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 11.13_, the
sole and exclusive remedy of the Company and any other Person against (A)
Purchaser, the Equity Financing Source and any of their respective Affiliates,
and any of their respective shareholders, members, general or limited
partners, directors, officers, employees, controlling Persons, agents
and representatives, and any successors or assigns of any of the foregoing
(the " _Purchaser Related Parties_ "), and (B) any Debt Financing Source and
any Debt Financing Source Affiliate (the Debt Financing Sources and Debt
Financing Source Affiliates, together with the Purchaser Related Parties, the
" _Related Parties_ " and each a " _Related Party_ "), and no Related Party
shall have any other Liability or obligation (including for
consequential, special, multiple, punitive or exemplary damages including
damages arising from loss of profits, business opportunities or goodwill in
respect of any breach or failure to comply with this Agreement or in respect
of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) for any or all
losses suffered or incurred by the Company, its Subsidiaries, the Sellers
Representative and any of their respective Affiliates, or any of their
respective former, current or future Representatives, shareholders, members,
general or limited partners, or equityholders (including the Securityholders),
or any successors or assigns of any of the foregoing (collectively, the "
_Company Related Parties_ ") or any other Person in connection with this
Agreement (and the termination hereof), the Merger (and the abandonment
thereof), the Debt Financing, the Equity Financing or any matter forming the
basis for such termination, and none of the Company Related Parties nor any
other Person shall be entitled to bring or maintain any other Legal Action
against Purchaser or any other Related Party arising out of this Agreement,
the Merger, the Debt Financing, the Equity Financing or any matters forming
the basis for such termination, and the Company agrees to use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause any such Legal Action by the Company against
Purchaser or any Related Party to be dismissed with prejudice promptly, and in
any event within five (5) Business Days after receipt of the Termination Fee.
Each of the parties hereto acknowledges and agrees that in light of the
difficulty of accurately determining actual damages with respect to the
foregoing, upon any such termination of this Agreement by (i) the Company
pursuant to _Section 9.1(d)_ , (ii) Purchaser pursuant to _Section 9.1(b)_ at
a time when the Company could have terminated this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 9.1(d)_ or (iii) the Company or Purchaser pursuant to _Section
9.1(b)(i)_ at a time when all the conditions to Closing set forth in _ARTICLE
8_ have been satisfied or waived (other than _Section 8.2(f)_ and those
conditions to be satisfied at Closing, all of which would be satisfied if the
Closing were to occur as of such date of termination), the right to the
Termination Fee

 



70  constitutes a reasonable estimate of the losses that will be suffered by
reason of any such termination of this Agreement and constitutes liquidated
damages (and not a penalty). Purchaser acknowledges that the agreements
contained in this _Section_ __ _ 9.2_ are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these
agreements, the Company would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if
Purchaser fails to promptly pay the amounts due pursuant to this _Section_ __
_ 9.2_ and, in order to obtain such payment, the Company commences a Legal
Action that results in a judgment against Purchaser for the Termination Fee
or portion thereof or any other damages, Purchaser shall pay to the Company
its costs and expenses thereof (including attorneys fees) in connection with
such Legal Action, together with interest on the amount of the
Termination Fee or portion thereof ordered to be paid by a court at the prime
rate published in the Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition, on the date such
payment was required to be made through the date of the payment.
Notwithstanding anything to contrary in this _ARTICLE 9_ , for the avoidance
of doubt, Purchaser and its Affiliates shall have recourse against the Debt
Financing Sources pursuant to the terms of the Debt Financing Commitments. For
the avoidance of doubt, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement or otherwise, while the Company may pursue both a grant of specific
performance and the payment of the Termination Fee, under no circumstances
shall the Company be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant
of specific performance and any money damages, including all or any portion
of the Termination Fee.

ARTICLE 10

 

SURVIVAL; INDEMNIFICATION

 

10.1 _Survival_. The representations, warranties, covenants and other
agreements, in each case, contained in this Agreement, or in any instrument
or certificate delivered pursuant hereto, shall survive the Closing and shall
terminate and expire on the one (1) year anniversary of the Closing Date;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the Fundamental Representations shall
survive the Closing until the earlier of (x) the expiration of the applicable
statute of limitations and (y) the six (6) year anniversary of the Closing
Date, (ii) any covenant contained in this Agreement that, by its terms,
provides for performance on or prior to the Closing shall terminate and expire
upon the Closing, and (iii) any covenant contained in this Agreement that, by
its terms, provides for performance following the Closing shall survive until
such covenant is performed in accordance with its terms; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that notwithstanding any survival period of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in this  _Section_ __ _ 10.1_,
claims for indemnification under this _ARTICLE 10_ as to which the
Indemnifying Party has received valid notice in accordance with this _ARTICLE
10_ prior to the expiration of the applicable survival period shall survive
until resolved by either the agreement of the parties or the final non-
appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction. For the avoidance of
doubt, the foregoing survival periods shall not apply to Losses arising under
the representations and warranties of any Stockholder contained in the Written
Consent or any Letter of Transmittal.

 

10.2 _Indemnification_ _By_ ___Securityholders_. Subject to the other terms
and conditions of this _ARTICLE 10_ , after and subject to the occurrence of
the Closing, the Common Stockholders and the Option Holders (the "
_Indemnifying_ _Securityholders_ "), severally and not jointly (in accordance
with their Pro Rata Portion), shall indemnify and defend each of Purchaser
and its Affiliates (including the Company) and their respective
Representatives (collectively, the " _Purchaser_ _Indemnitees_ ") against, and
shall hold each of them harmless from and against, and shall pay and
reimburse each of them for, any and all Losses (which, in the case of _Section
10.2(f)_ shall include all Sequoia Losses) incurred or sustained by, or
imposed upon, the Purchaser Indemnitees based upon or arising from:

(a) any inaccuracy in or breach of any of the representations or warranties of
the Company contained in this Agreement or in any certificate or instrument
delivered by or on behalf of the Company pursuant to this Agreement (in each
case, as such representation or warranty would read if all qualifications or
limitations as to "materiality", "Material Adverse Effect" and words of
similar import set forth therein were deleted therefrom);

 



71 (b) any breach or non-fulfillment of any covenant, agreement or obligation to
be performed by the Company prior to Closing pursuant to this Agreement;

(c) any amounts paid to the holders of Dissenting Shares, including any
interest required to be paid thereon, that are in excess of the Per Share
Merger Consideration (with respect to dissenting Common Stock) or the
Liquidation Value (with respect to dissenting Preferred Stock);

(d) any Taxes with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period for which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is liable;

(e) any Taxes (i) attributable to any restructuring or reorganization
undertaken prior to the Closing (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the
Interim Restructuring), (ii) for which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
is liable pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar
provisions of state, local or foreign Applicable Law) by reason of such entity
being included in a consolidated or affiliated group at any time prior to the
Closing, and (iii) that are withholding Taxes imposed with respect to
payments made pursuant to the Transaction Documents that were not withheld
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.16_; and

 

(f) the Sequoia Matter.

 

Purchaser and, after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation, acknowledges and
agrees that the Indemnifying Securityholders shall not have any Liability
under any provision of this Agreement to the extent that the applicable Loss
relates to action taken by or on behalf of any Purchaser Indemnitee after the
Closing.

 

10.3 _Indemnification by Purchaser and Surviving Corporation_. Subject to the
other terms and conditions of this _ARTICLE 10_ , after and subject to the
occurrence of the Closing, Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation shall
jointly and severally indemnify and defend each of the Securityholders and
each of their respective Affiliates and Representatives (but for
the avoidance of doubt, shall not include the Surviving Corporation and its
applicable Affiliates and Representatives) (collectively, the " _Stockholder_
_Indemnitees_ ") against, and shall hold each of them harmless from and
against, and shall pay and reimburse each of them for, any and all Losses
incurred or sustained by, or imposed upon, the Stockholder Indemnitees based
upon or arising from:

 

(a) any inaccuracy in or breach of any of the representations or warranties of
Purchaser and Merger Sub contained in this Agreement or in any certificate or
instrument delivered by or on behalf of Purchaser or Merger Sub pursuant to
this Agreement (in each case, as such representation or warranty would read if
all qualifications or limitations as to "materiality", "Material Adverse
Effect" and words of similar import set forth therein were deleted therefrom);
or

 

(b) any breach or non-fulfillment of any covenant, agreement or obligation to
be performed by Purchaser or Merger Sub, or, after the Closing Date, by the
Surviving Corporation, pursuant to this Agreement.

 



72 10.4 _Certain Limitations_. The indemnification provided for in  _Section_ __
_ 10.2_ and _Section_ __ _ 10.3_ shall be subject to the following
limitations:

 

(a) The Indemnifying Securityholders shall not be liable to the Purchaser
Indemnitees with respect to any claim for indemnification under _Section
10.2(a)_ (i) until the aggregate amount of all Losses in respect of
indemnification under _Section 10.2(a)_ exceeds $7,600,000 (the " _Deductible_
"), in which event the Indemnifying Securityholders shall be required to pay
or be liable for all such Losses in excess of the Deductible and (ii) unless
such claim is for Losses in an amount in excess of $50,000; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the foregoing limitations shall not apply (x) to Losses
based upon or arising from any inaccuracy in or breach of the Fundamental
Representations or (y) in the event of Fraud. The aggregate amount of all
Losses for which the Indemnifying Securityholders shall be liable pursuant to
_Section 10.2(a)-(e)_ shall not exceed the Indemnity Escrow Amount; _provided_
, that with respect to Losses based upon or arising from any inaccuracy in or
breach of the Fundamental Representations, the maximum aggregate Liability of
the Indemnifying Securityholders shall not exceed the cash portion of the Base
Merger Consideration and shall include only those Losses not covered under any
RandW Insurance Policy. The aggregate amount of all Losses for which
the Indemnifying Securityholders shall be liable pursuant to _Section
10.2(f)_ shall not exceed the Sequoia Matter Escrow Amount. For the avoidance
of doubt, the limitations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 10.4_ shall not
apply to Losses arising under the representations and warranties of any
Stockholder contained in the Written Consent or any Letter of Transmittal or
any Option Holder in any Option Surrender Letter.

 

(b) Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable to the
Stockholder Indemnitees for indemnification under  _Section 10.3(a)_ (i)
until the aggregate amount of all Losses in respect of indemnification under
_Section 10.3(a)_ exceeds the Deductible, in which event Purchaser shall only
be required to pay or be liable for all such Losses in excess of the
Deductible and (ii) unless such claim is for Losses in an amount in excess of
$50,000; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing limitations shall not
apply to Losses based upon or arising from any inaccuracy in or breach of any
representation or warranty in _Section_ __ _ 4.1_, _Section 4.3(a)_ ,
_Section 4.3(b)_ , _Section_ __ _ 4.5_ and _Section_ __ _ 4.7_ or in the
event of Fraud. The aggregate amount of all Losses for which Purchaser and
the Surviving Corporation shall be liable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.3_
shall not exceed the Indemnity Escrow Amount.

 

(c) In calculating the amounts payable to any Indemnified Party pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 10.2_ or  _Section_ __ _ 10.3_, the amount of the
indemnified Losses shall not be duplicative of any other Loss for which an
indemnification claim has been made, and shall be computed net of any
reduction in such Indemnified Partys income Tax liability actually realized
(or to be realized) as a decrease in cash Taxes payable by the Indemnified
Party (or any Affiliate thereof) in any taxable period ending prior to or that
includes the date of such indemnification payment, calculated on a with and
without basis, and (ii) any amounts recovered by the Indemnified Party under
insurance policies (including, without limitation, any RandW Insurance Policy)
or from other collateral sources (such as contractual indemnities of any
Person which are contained outside of this Agreement) or otherwise with
respect to such Losses. The Purchaser Indemnitees shall use their best efforts
to pursue any available insurance policies or collateral sources, and in
the event the Purchaser Indemnitees receive any recovery, the amount of such
recovery shall be applied first, to refund any payments made by the
Indemnifying Parties in respect of indemnification claims pursuant to this
_ARTICLE 10_ which would not have been so paid had such recovery been
obtained prior to such payment, and second, any excess to the Purchaser
Indemnitees.

 

(d) The Indemnifying Securityholders obligation to indemnify the Purchaser
Indemnitees for Losses pursuant to _Sections  10.2(a)-10.2(e)_ shall, and
with respect to _Section 10.2(a)_ , after the Deductible has been fully
utilized, be satisfied solely and exclusively from the then remaining the
Indemnity Escrow Fund, and in no event shall the Purchaser Indemnitees be
entitled to recover more than the amount of funds available in the Indemnity
Escrow Account

 



73  pursuant to _Sections_ _10.2(a)-10.2(e)_ in the aggregate. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in respect of any and
all claims for indemnification resulting from the Sequoia Matter, (i) the
Purchaser Indemnitees may recover solely from the Sequoia Matter Escrow
Account, and in no event shall a Purchaser Indemnitee be entitled to recover
any amounts directly from any Indemnifying Securityholder, and (ii) under no
circumstances will the Purchaser Indemnitees be entitled to recover,
individually or in the aggregate, any amounts in excess of the balance of the
Sequoia Matter Escrow Account. 

(e) Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that it is entitled to seek
indemnification for the same Loss only once under this  _ARTICLE 10_ even if
a claim for indemnification in respect of such Loss has been made as a result
of a breach of more than one representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
contained in this Agreement; and

 

(f) In no event shall a Purchaser Indemnitee be entitled to indemnification
pursuant to this _ARTICLE 10_ with respect to a specific Loss to the extent
such Loss is (i) clearly and separately reserved for on the face of the Latest
Balance Sheet (it being understood and agreed, however, that the Purchaser
Indemnitees shall receive indemnification for any Losses in excess of such
specific reserve, subject to the other limitations set forth herein) or (ii)
is included in the calculation of the Final Merger Consideration, as finally
determined in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.12_ including any such Loss
that is related to any reserve or other similar item included in such
calculation.

(g) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Indemnifying
Securityholders shall not be liable for any Taxes with respect to any Post-
Closing Tax Period for which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is liable.

 

Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, after the Closing,
on the date that the Indemnity Escrow Fund or the Sequoia Matter Escrow Fund
is reduced to zero, the Purchaser Indemnitees shall have no further rights to
indemnification under _Sections 10.2(a)-10.2(e)_ or _Section 10.2(f)_ ,
respectively.

 

10.5 _Indemnification Procedures_. The party making a claim under this
_ARTICLE 10_ is referred to as the "Indemnified Party", and the party against
whom such claims are asserted under this _ARTICLE 10_ is referred to as the
"Indemnifying Party". For purposes of this _ARTICLE 10,_ (i) if Purchaser (or
any other Purchaser Indemnitee) comprises the Indemnified Party, any
references to Indemnifying Party (except provisions relating to an obligation
to make payments) shall be deemed to refer to Sellers Representative, and
(ii) if Purchaser comprises the Indemnifying Party, any references to the
Indemnified Party shall be deemed to refer to Sellers Representative. Any
payment received by Sellers Representative as the Indemnified Party shall be
distributed to the Securityholders in accordance with this Agreement.

(a) _Third Party Claims_. Subject to _Section_ _10.5(d)_ , if any Indemnified
Party (A) receives notice of the assertion or commencement of any Legal
Action made or brought by any Person who is not a party to this Agreement or
an Affiliate of a party to this Agreement or a Representative of the foregoing
(a "Third Party Claim") against such Indemnified Party with respect to which
the Indemnifying Party is obligated to provide indemnification under this
Agreement or (B) becomes aware of a Third Party Claim which such Indemnified
Party reasonably believes may result in any Losses (without giving effect to
the limitations in _Section_ __ _ 10.4_), the Indemnified Party shall give
the Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt written notice thereof, but in any
event not later than thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of such notice
of such Third Party Claim. The delay or failure to give such prompt written
notice shall not, however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
indemnification obligations, except and only to the extent

 



74  that the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by reason of such delay or
failure. Such notice by the Indemnified Party shall describe the Third Party
Claim in reasonable detail, shall include copies of all material written
evidence thereof and shall indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably
practicable, of the Loss that has been or may be sustained by the Indemnified
Party. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to participate in, or
by giving written notice to the Indemnified Party, to defend against,
negotiate, settle (subject to _Section 10.5(b)_ ) or otherwise deal with any
Third Party Claim (other than any Third Party Claim relating to the Sequoia
Matter) at the Indemnifying Partys expense and by the Indemnifying Partys
own counsel, and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate in good faith in such
defense, negotiation or settlement. Subject to _Section_ _10.5(d)_ , the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in the defense of any
Third Party Claim with counsel selected by it subject to the Indemnifying
Partys right to control the defense thereof, provided that the fees and
disbursements of such counsel shall be at the expense of the Indemnified
Party. If the Indemnifying Party elects not to defend against, negotiate,
settle (subject to _Section_ _10.5(b)_ ) or otherwise deal with any Third
Party Claim, the Indemnified Party may defend against, negotiate, settle
(subject to _Section_ _10.5(b)_ ) or otherwise deal with such Third Party
Claim using counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnifying Party. The
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate with each other
and their respective counsel in all reasonable respects in connection with the
defense, negotiation or settlement of any Third Party Claim, including making
available records relating to such Third Party Claim and furnishing, without
expense (other than reimbursement of actual out-of-pocket expenses) to the
defending party, management employees of the non-defending party as may be
reasonably necessary for the preparation of the defense of such Third Party
Claim. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any Third Party Claim
relating to Taxes shall be governed exclusively by  _Section_ __ _ 7.8_.

(b) _Settlement of Third Party Claims_. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, the Indemnifying Party shall not settle or compromise any
Third Party Claim or permit a default or consent to entry of any judgment with
respect thereto without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed)
unless such settlement, compromise, or judgment contains a release of the
Indemnified Party from all Liability in respect of such Third Party Claim;
provided, that if a settlement offer solely for money damages is made by the
applicable third-party claimant, and the Indemnifying Party notifies the
Indemnified Party in writing of the Indemnifying Partys willingness to accept
the settlement offer and, subject to the applicable limitations of this
_ARTICLE 10_ , pay the amount called for by such settlement offer, and the
Indemnified Party declines to accept such offer, the Indemnified Party may
continue to contest such Third Party Claim, free of any participation by the
Indemnifying Party, and the amount of any ultimate Liability with respect to
such Third Party Claim that the Indemnifying Party has an obligation to pay
hereunder shall be limited to the lesser of (A) the amount of the settlement
offer that the Indemnified Party declined to accept or (B) the aggregate
Losses of the Indemnified Party with respect to such Third Party Claim.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if the Indemnified
Party has assumed the defense of any Third Party Claim pursuant to _Section
10.5(a)_ , it shall not settle or compromise any Third Party Claim or permit a
default or consent to entry of any judgment with respect thereto without the
written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(c) _Direct Claims_. _Subject to_ _Section_ _10.5(d)_ , any Legal Action by
an Indemnified Party on account of a Loss which does not result from a Third
Party Claim (a " _Direct Claim_ ") shall be asserted by the Indemnified Party
giving the Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt written notice thereof, but
in any event not later than thirty (30) days after the Indemnified Party
becomes aware of such Direct Claim. The delay or failure to give such prompt
written notice shall not, however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of
its indemnification obligations, except and only to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by reason of such delay or failure. Such
notice by the Indemnified Party shall describe the Direct Claim in reasonable
detail, shall include copies of all material written evidence thereof and

 



75  shall indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of the Loss
that has been or may be sustained by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying
Party shall have thirty (30) days after its receipt of such notice to respond
in writing to such Direct Claim. The Indemnified Party shall allow the
Indemnifying Party and its professional advisors to investigate the matter or
circumstance alleged to give rise to the Direct Claim, and whether and to
what extent any amount is payable in respect of the Direct Claim and the
Indemnified Party shall assist the Indemnifying Partys investigation by
giving such information and assistance (including access to the
Companys premises and personnel and the right to examine and copy any
accounts, documents or records) as the Indemnifying Party or any of its
professional advisors may reasonably request.

 

(d) _Sequoia Matter Claims_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
Sellers Representative shall assume control of any Legal Action (including
with respect to any Third Party Claim) relating to the Sequoia Matter after
the Closing until the Sequoia Escrow Release Date; _provided_ , that the
attorneys fees and other costs and expenses of Sellers Representative shall
be paid from the Sequoia Matter Escrow Account and reduce the amount of the
Sequoia Matter Escrow Amount. Sellers Representative and Purchaser shall
cooperate with each other in all reasonable respects in connection with the
defense of any Legal Action relating to the Sequoia Matter, including making
available records relating to such Legal Action and furnishing, without
expense (other than reimbursement of actual out-of-pocket expenses) to
Sellers Representative, management employees of the Purchaser as may be
reasonably necessary for the preparation of the defense of such Legal Action.

 

10.6 _Mitigation_. Each of the Indemnified Parties agrees to take all
commercially reasonable actions to mitigate its respective indemnified Losses
upon the occurrence of any event or condition that would reasonably be
expected to result in Losses that are indemnifiable hereunder. The parties
shall cooperate with each other with respect to resolving any claim
or Liability underlying any Loss with respect to which one party is obligated
to indemnify any Person hereunder, including by making commercially reasonable
efforts to mitigate or resolve any such claim or Liability

 

10.7 _Release of Escrow Funds._

 

(a) _Release of Indemnity Escrow Fund_. In accordance with the terms set forth
in the Escrow Agreement, the Indemnity Escrow Fund shall be held by the
Escrow Agent until the one (1) year anniversary of the Closing Date (the "
_Indemnity Escrow Release Date_ "). Within five (5) Business Days following
the Indemnity Escrow Release Date, Purchaser and Sellers Representative
shall deliver a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent directing it to
release to Sellers Representative (on behalf of the Securityholders) from the
Indemnity Escrow Fund an amount equal to the then-remaining balance of the
Indemnity Escrow Amount less a reserve equal to the amount of any then pending
or disputed Losses for which any Purchaser Indemnitee claims in good faith to
be entitled to indemnification, which reserve shall be held and maintained by
the Escrow Agent in accordance with the Escrow Agreement.

(b) _Release of Sequoia Matter Escrow Fund_. In accordance with the terms set
forth in the Escrow Agreement, the Sequoia Matter Escrow Fund shall be held
by the Escrow Agent until the earlier of (x) notice to the Escrow Agent that
the Sequoia Matter has been finally resolved by (A) a binding settlement
agreement or (B) final non-appealable order of a court of competent
jurisdiction and (y) delivery of a joint written instruction to the Escrow
Agent by the Purchaser and Sellers Representative to release the then-
remaining balance of the Sequoia Matter Escrow Amount from the Sequoia Matter
Escrow Fund in accordance with the following sentence (the " _Sequoia Escrow
Release Date_ "). Within five (5) Business Days following the Sequoia Escrow
Release Date, the Purchaser and Sellers Representative shall deliver a joint
written instruction to the Escrow Agent directing it to release to Sellers
Representative (on behalf of the Securityholders) from the Sequoia Matter
Escrow Fund an amount equal to the then-remaining balance of the Sequoia
Matter Escrow Amount less a reserve equal to the amount of any then pending or
disputed Sequoia Losses for which any Purchaser Indemnitee claims in good
faith to be entitled to indemnification, which reserve shall be held and
maintained by the Escrow Agent in accordance with the Escrow Agreement.

 



76 10.8 _Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. All indemnification
payments made under this Agreement shall be treated by the parties as an
adjustment to the Base Merger Consideration for Tax purposes, unless otherwise
required by Applicable Law.

 

10.9 _Exclusive Remedies._ If the Closing occurs, subject to _Section_ __ _
11.13_, the parties acknowledge and agree that their sole and exclusive
remedy with respect to any and all claims (other than claims arising from
Fraud, criminal activity or willful misconduct on the part of a party hereto
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) for any
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation set
forth herein or otherwise relating to the subject matter of this Agreement,
shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this
_ARTICLE 10_. Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 10.9_ shall limit (i) any
Persons right to seek and obtain any equitable relief to which any Person
shall be entitled or to seek any remedy on account of any partys fraudulent,
criminal or intentional misconduct or (ii) Purchasers right to seek any
remedy with respect to any breach of representations and warranties of any
Stockholder contained in the Written Consent or any Letter of transmittal or
any Option Holder in any Option Surrender Letter. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO
THE CONTRARY CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT, PURCHASER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES
THAT, OTHER THAN IN THE CASE OF FRAUD, THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY OF
THE PURCHASER INDEMNITEES FOR ANY CLAIM RELATED TO, ARISING UNDER OR IN
CONNECTION WITH A BREACH OF ANY REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, COVENANT OR
AGREEMENT CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE AGAINST THE INDEMNITY ESCROW
AMOUNT, THE SEQUOIA MATTER ESCROW AMOUNT OR ANY RandW INSURANCE POLICY, AS
APPLICABLE.

10.10 _Remedies Not Affected by Investigation or Knowledge._ If the Closing
occurs, Purchaser expressly reserves the right to seek indemnity or other
remedy for any Losses arising out of or relating to any breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant of the Company contained herein,
notwithstanding any investigation by, disclosure to, knowledge or imputed
knowledge of Purchaser or any of its Representatives in respect of any fact or
circumstances that reveals the occurrence of any such breach, whether before
or after the execution and delivery hereof. In furtherance of the foregoing,
(i) the Company and the Sellers Representative agree that knowledge or lack
of reliance shall not be a defense in law or equity to any claim of breach of
representation, warranty or covenant of the Company herein, (ii) the Company
and the Sellers Representative shall not in any Legal Action concerning a
breach or alleged breach of any representation, warranty or covenant of the
Company herein, or any indemnity thereof, seek information concerning
knowledge or reliance of Purchaser or any of its Representatives, through
deposition, discovery or otherwise or seek to introduce evidence or argument
in any Legal Action regarding the knowledge or lack of reliance of Purchaser
or any of its Representatives on or with respect to any such representations,

GENERAL PROVISIONS

 

11.1 _Company Disclosure_ _Schedules_. If and to the extent any information
required to be furnished in any Section of the Company Disclosure Schedule is
contained in this Agreement or in any other Section of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, such information shall be deemed to be included in all Sections of
the Company Disclosure Schedule in which the information would otherwise be
required to be included to the extent that it is reasonably apparent on its
face that such disclosure is applicable to such other Section. Disclosure of
any fact or item in any Section of the Company Disclosure Schedule

 



77  shall not be considered an admission by the disclosing party that such item
or fact (or any non-disclosed item or information of comparable or
greater significance) represents a material exception or fact, event or
circumstance or that such item has had or would reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect, or that such item or fact will in fact exceed any
applicable threshold limitation set forth in this Agreement and shall not be
construed as an admission by the disclosing party of any non-compliance with,
or violation of, any third party rights (including but not limited to
any Intellectual Property rights) or any Applicable Law of any Governmental
Body, such disclosures having been made solely for the purposes of creating
exceptions to the representations made herein or of disclosing any information
required to be disclosed under this Agreement. The Company Disclosure
Schedule and the information and disclosures contained therein are intended
only to qualify and limit the representations, warranties or covenants
contained in this Agreement, and do not, except as expressly set forth in the
representations and warranties which they qualify, constitute representations
and warranties as to the matters described therein. The Company shall not be
prejudiced in any manner whatsoever, and no presumptions shall be created, by
virtue of the disclosure of any matter in the Company Disclosure Schedule
which otherwise is not required to be disclosed by this Agreement.

interests of the Securityholders and to enforce and protect the rights and

or the Sellers Representative arising out of or under or in any manner
relating to this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, or any other agreement,
instrument or document in connection with the foregoing; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no such failure to act on the part of the Sellers

guarantees, orders, receipts, endorsements, notices, requests, instructions,

as the Sellers Representative. In connection with this Agreement, and any
instrument, agreement or document relating hereto or thereto, and in
exercising or failing to exercise all or any of the powers conferred upon the
Sellers Representative hereunder (i) the Sellers Representative shall incur
no responsibility whatsoever to any Securityholder by reason of any error in
judgment or other act or omission performed or omitted hereunder or in
connection with the Escrow Agreement or any such other agreement, instrument
or document, excepting only responsibility for any act or failure to act
which represents willful misconduct and (ii) the Sellers Representative shall
be entitled to rely on the advice of counsel, public accountants or other
independent experts experienced in the matter at issue, and any error in
judgment or other act or omission of the Sellers Representative pursuant to
such advice shall in no event subject the Sellers Representative to Liability
to any Securityholder.

 



79 (c) In the event that any amount is owed to the Sellers Representative,
whether for expense reimbursement or indemnification, that is in excess of
the Sellers Representative Expense Amount, the Sellers Representative shall
be entitled to be reimbursed by the Securityholders (other than the Preferred

Stockholders) agree to so reimburse the Sellers Representative, and make the
Sellers Representative whole for such shortfall. Upon written notice from the

Stockholders) to the existence of a shortfall, including a reasonably detailed
description as to such shortfall, each Securityholder (other than the
Preferred Stockholders) shall promptly deliver to the Sellers Representative

Preferred Stockholders) in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Portion.

and shall be irrevocable and survive the death, incompetency, bankruptcy or
liquidation of any Securityholder and (ii) shall survive the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

11.3 _Entire Agreement; Amendment_. This Agreement, including the Company
Disclosure Schedules and Purchaser Disclosure Schedules and the other
documents referred to herein which form a part hereof, and the Confidentiality
Agreement, contain the entire understanding of the parties hereto with respect
to the subject matter contained herein and therein. This Agreement supersedes
all prior and contemporaneous agreements, arrangements, contracts,
discussions, negotiations, undertakings and understandings (whether written or
oral) between the parties with respect to such subject matter, other than
the Confidentiality Agreement. This Agreement may be amended, supplemented or
changed, and any provision hereof can be waived, only by a written instrument
making specific reference to this Agreement executed by the party against whom
enforcement of any such amendment, supplement, modification or waiver is
sought. Notwithstanding the foregoing, _Sections 9.2_ , _11.3_ , _11.9_ ,
_11.10_ and _11.14_ and the definitions related thereto (solely as used in
such sections) may not be amended in a manner materially adverse to the
interests of the Debt Financing Sources without the written consent of the
Debt Financing Sources party to the Debt Financing Commitments. Upon the
Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall automatically terminate and none
of the parties thereto shall have any further Liability or obligation
thereunder. No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies
herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or
remedies provided by Applicable Law.

11.4 _No Waiver_. The failure of a party to insist upon strict adherence to
any term or provision of this Agreement on any occasion shall not be
considered a waiver or deprive that party of the right thereafter to insist
upon strict adherence to that term or provision or any other term or provision
of this Agreement.

 

11.5 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced by any Applicable Law or
public policy, all other terms or provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of

 



80  the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any party. Any such term or provision held invalid,
illegal, or incapable of being enforced only in part or degree will remain in
full force and effect to the extent not held invalid, illegal, or incapable of
being enforced. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced, such term or provision is
hereby deemed modified to give effect to the original written intent of the
parties to the greatest extent consistent with being valid and enforceable
under Applicable Law.

 

11.6 _Expenses and Obligations_. Unless otherwise expressly provided herein,
all costs and expenses incurred by the parties hereto in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be borne solely and entirely
by the party that has incurred such expenses. For the avoidance of doubt,
Purchaser shall be responsible for the costs of obtaining any RandW Insurance
Policy (including the premium, commission, surplus lines tax and underwriting
fee).

under this Agreement must be in writing and (a) delivered by hand, (b) sent by

THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY
HERETO OR THERETO IN NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE OR ENFORCEMENT
HEREOF.

 



83 11.11 _Rights Cumulative_. Except as expressly limited by this Agreement,
all rights and remedies of each of the parties under this Agreement will be
cumulative, and the exercise of one or more rights or remedies not preclude
the exercise of any other right or remedy available under this Agreement or
Applicable Law.

 

11.12 _Assignment_. Except as otherwise provided herein, the provisions hereof
shall inure to the benefit of, and be binding upon, the successors by
operation of law and permitted assigns of the parties hereto. No assignment of
this Agreement may be made by any party at any time, whether or not by
operation of law, without the other parties prior written consent; 
_provided_ that, Purchaser may assign this Agreement (a) to an Affiliate at
any time without the other parties consent, provided that Purchaser shall
remain liable for its obligations hereunder or (b) effective at and after
the Effective Time, to the Debt Financing Sources and any parties providing
the Debt Financing pursuant to the terms thereof for purposes of creating a
security interest herein or otherwise assign as collateral in respect of such
Debt Financing, but no such assignment shall relieve Purchaser or Merger Sub
of their respective obligations under this Agreement.

11.13 _Specific Enforcement_ __ __.

(a) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event
that any of the obligations, undertakings, covenants or agreements of the
parties hereto were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
were otherwise breached and that monetary damages, even if available, would
not be an adequate remedy. It is accordingly agreed that the Company, on the
one hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand, shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement by the other party, and
to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement (including
_Section_ __ _ 7.1_ and _Section_ __ _ 7.2_, and including to cause
Purchaser and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger and the Closing and to make
the payments contemplated by this Agreement, including _ARTICLE 2_ ) by a
decree of specific performance, without the necessity of proving actual harm
or posting a bond or other security therefor, this being in addition to,
subject to the last sentence of  _Section_ __ _ 9.2_, any other remedy to
which such party is entitled at law or in equity, and each party hereto
agrees, subject to the last sentence of _Section_ __ _ 9.2_, that it will not
oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance or other equitable
relief on the basis that any other party hereto has an adequate remedy at law
or that any award of specific performance or other equitable remedy is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in equity. Without limitation of
the foregoing, but subject to the last sentence of _Section_ __ _ 9.2_, the
parties hereto hereby further acknowledge and agree that prior to the Closing,
the Company shall be entitled to seek specific performance to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of, and to prevent or cure breaches of
the covenants required to be performed by Purchaser and Merger Sub under this
Agreement (including  _Section_ __ _ 7.1_ and _Section_ __ _ 7.2_, and
including to cause Purchaser and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger and the
Closing and to make the payments contemplated by this Agreement, including
_ARTICLE 2_ ) in addition to any other remedy to which the Company is
entitled at law or in equity, including the Companys right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _ARTICLE 9_ and seek payment of the Termination Fee. In
the event that the Company, on the one hand, or Purchaser, on the other hand,
brings a Legal Action for specific performance against the other party
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 11.13_, and a court makes an order for
specific performance against that other party, then the other party shall
also pay the first partys costs and expenses (including attorneys fees and
expenses) in connection with all such Legal Actions to seek specific
performance of such other partys obligations under this Agreement and all
Legal Actions to collect such costs and expenses. Each of the parties hereto
further agrees that it shall not take any position in any Legal Action
concerning this Agreement that is contrary to the terms of this _Section_ __
_ 11.13_. In addition, the Company agrees to use commercially reasonable
efforts cause any Legal Action commenced by Company and pending in connection
with this Agreement against Purchaser or any Related Party to be dismissed
with prejudice promptly, and in any event within five (5) Business Days, after
such time as Purchaser consummates the Closing pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
11.13_.

 



84 (b) Notwithstanding _Section 11.13(a)_ , it is explicitly agreed that the
Company shall be entitled to seek specific performance of Purchasers
obligation to consummate the Closing and to make the payments contemplated by
this Agreement only in the event that (a) the Marketing Period has ended and
all conditions in  _Section_ __ _ 8.1_ and _Section_ __ _ 8.2_ have been
satisfied or waived (other than those to be satisfied at the Closing) and
Purchaser fails to consummate the Merger on the date the Closing should have
occurred pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.3_, (b) the Financing provided by the
Financing Commitments (or, in the case of the Debt Financing, if Alternative
Financing is being used in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 7.5_, pursuant to
the Alternative Financing Commitments with respect thereto) has been funded or
will be funded at the Closing, and (c) the Company has confirmed that it is
ready, willing and able to consummate the Closing, and will take such
actions as are within its control to so consummate the Closing, if specific
performance is granted and the Equity Financing and Debt Financing are funded.

 

(c) Subject to the last sentence of _Section_ __ _ 9.2_, until such time as
Purchaser pays the Company the Termination Fee following a valid termination
of this Agreement, in no event shall the exercise of the Company Groups right
to seek specific performance pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 11.13_ reduce,
restrict or otherwise limit the Company Groups right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.1_ and/or pursue all applicable
remedies at law, including seeking payment of the Termination Fee.

 

11.14 _Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Nothing in this Agreement shall create or
be deemed to create any third party beneficiary rights in any Person not a
party to this Agreement, nor confer any rights, benefits or remedies hereunder
upon any Person other than the parties hereto and their respective successors
and assigns, except (a) as contemplated by  _Section_ __ _ 6.2_, _Section_
__ _ 10.2_, _Section_ __ _ 11.15_, _Section_ __ _ 11.16_ and _Section_ __ _
11.17_, (b) to the extent the Effective Time occurs, for the rights of the
Securityholders under _ARTICLE 2_ on and after the Effective Time to receive
payment therefor, and (c) the Debt Financing Sources and their respective Debt
Financing Source Affiliates are express third party beneficiaries of, and are
entitled to rely on and enforce as such the provisions of, _Sections_ _9.2_ ,
_11.3_ , _11.9_ , _11.10_ and _11.14_.

 

11.15 _Non-Recourse_. Except and only to the extent set forth in the
Equity Financing Commitment, this Agreement may only be enforced against, and
a claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of, or related to this
Agreement may only be brought by the expressly named party hereto and then
only with respect to the specific obligations set forth herein with respect
to such party. Except to the extent a named party and to the extent a named
party to the Equity Financing Commitment (and then only to the extent of the
specific obligations undertaken by such named party in this Agreement or by
such named parties under the Equity Financing Commitment), no present, former
or future Affiliate, officer, director, employee, incorporator, member,
partner, stockholder, agent, attorney or other Representative of any party or
their Affiliates shall have any Liability (whether in contract, in tort or
otherwise) for any obligations or Liabilities of any party which is not
otherwise expressly identified as a party, and no recourse shall be brought or
granted against any of them, by virtue of or based upon any alleged
misrepresentation or inaccuracy in or breach of any of the representations,
warranties, agreements or covenants of any party under this Agreement for any
claim based upon, in respect of, or by reason of, the Merger or in respect of
any representations made or alleged to have been made in connection herewith
or therewith. The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 11.15_ are intended to be
for the benefit of, and enforceable by the Affiliates, officers, directors,
employees, incorporators, members, partners, stockholders, agents, attorneys
and other Representatives referenced in this _Section_ __ _ 11.15_ and each
such Person shall be a third-party beneficiary of this _Section_ __ _
11.15_.

11.16 _Legal Representation_. Purchaser and the Company hereby agree, on
their own behalf and on behalf of their Affiliates, and each of their and
their Affiliates directors, members, partners, officers, employees and
Affiliates, and each of their successors and assigns (all such parties, the "
_Waiving_

 



85   _Parties_ "), that Weil, Gotshal and Manges LLP (or any successor) may
represent (a) any or all of the Securityholders or any of their respective
Affiliates, and each of their and their Affiliates directors, members,
partners, officers, employees or Affiliates or (b) the Sellers
Representative, in each case in connection with any dispute, Legal Action or
obligation arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including under any
agreements contemplated by this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby (any such representation, the " _Post-Closing
Representation_ ") notwithstanding its representation (or any continued
representation) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and each of
Purchaser and the Company on behalf of itself and the Waiving Parties hereby
consents thereto and irrevocably waives (and will not assert) any conflict of
interest or any objection arising therefrom or relating thereto. Purchaser
and the Company acknowledge that the foregoing provision applies whether or
not Weil, Gotshal and Manges LLP provides legal services to Purchaser, the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries after the Closing Date. Each of Purchaser
and the Company, for itself and the Waiving Parties, hereby irrevocably
acknowledges and agrees that all communications among the Company Group or the
Securityholders and their counsel, including Weil, Gotshal and Manges LLP, made
in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery and
performance under, or any dispute or Legal Action arising out of or relating
to, this Agreement, any agreements contemplated by this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, or any matter relating to any of
the foregoing, are privileged communications between the Securityholders and
such counsel (notwithstanding that a member of the Company Group participated
or was provided such communications nor that the Company Group is also a
client of such counsel) and from and after the Closing neither Purchaser, the
Company, nor any Person purporting to act on behalf of or through Purchaser or
the Company or any of the Waiving Parties, will seek to obtain the same by
any process. From and after the Closing, each of Purchaser and the Company, on
behalf of itself and the Waiving Parties, waives and will not assert any
attorney-client privilege with respect to any communication between Weil,
Gotshal and Manges LLP and the Company, its Subsidiaries or any Securityholder
occurring prior to the Closing in connection with this Agreement, any other
Transaction Document, any of the transactions contemplated herein or therein,
or any Post-Closing Representation.

11.17 _Release_. Effective as of the Closing Date (but only if the Closing
actually occurs), except for any rights or obligations under this Agreement or
the other Transaction Documents, each of Purchaser and the Surviving
Corporation, each on behalf of itself and each of its Subsidiaries and
Affiliates and each of its current and former officers, directors, employees,
partners, members, advisors, successors and assigns (collectively, the
"Releasing Parties"), hereby irrevocably and unconditionally releases
and forever discharges the Securityholders, their respective Affiliates and
each of their respective current and former officers, directors, employees,
partners, managers, members, advisors, successors and assigns (collectively,
the "Released Parties") of and from any and all Legal Actions, causes of
action, executions, judgments, duties, debts, dues, accounts, bonds, contracts
and covenants (whether express or implied), and claims and demands whatsoever
whether in law or in equity (whether based upon contract, tort or otherwise)
that the Releasing Parties may have against any of the Released Parties, now
or in the future, in each case in respect of any cause, matter or thing
relating to the Company or any of its current or former Subsidiaries that may
arise against the Released Parties solely as a result of the Securityholders
ownership of Equity Securities of the Company, but only to the extent that
such cause, matter or thing does not otherwise constitute Fraud. The
provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 11.17_ are intended to be for the benefit
of, and enforceable by the Released Parties referenced in this _Section_ __ _
11.17_ and each such Person shall be a third-party beneficiary of this
_Section_ __ _ 11.17_.
