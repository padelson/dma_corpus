expressly stated therein, debt financing in the amounts set forth therein (being collectively referred to as the &ldquo;<B>Debt
Financing</B>&rdquo; and, together with the Equity Financing, the &ldquo;<B>Financing</B>&rdquo;). As of the date hereof, none
of the Financing Commitment Letters has been withdrawn, terminated, repudiated, rescinded, amended or modified, no terms thereunder
have been waived, and, to the knowledge of Parent, no such withdrawal, termination, repudiation, rescission, amendment, modification
or waiver is contemplated. Parent or Merger Sub has fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees payable on or prior to
the date hereof in connection with the Financing Commitment Letters. Assuming (i) the Financing is funded in accordance with the
Equity Commitment Letters and the Debt Commitment Letter, as applicable, the net proceeds contemplated by the Equity Commitment
Letters and the Debt Commitment Letter (both before and after giving effect to any &ldquo;flex&rdquo; provisions contained in
the Debt Commitment Letter) will, in the aggregate be sufficient for Parent and Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to pay
all amounts required to be paid in connection with the Merger and the transactions contemplated in this Agreement and Financing
Commitment Letters, including, without limitation, payment of the Aggregate Merger Consideration, repayment or refinancing of
debt of the Company and its Subsidiaries contemplated by this Agreement or the Debt Commitment Letter, and payment of any other
fees and expenses and payment obligations required to be paid or satisfied by Parent or Merger Sub on or prior to the Closing
Date in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Financing (the &ldquo;<B>Required Amount</B>&rdquo;),
assuming the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in <U>Section 7.02(a)</U> and <U>Section 7.02(b)</U> on the Closing Date.
The Financing Commitment Letters are, as to Parent, Merger Sub and the other parties thereto, enforceable against Parent and Merger
Sub and, to the knowledge of Parent, each of the other parties thereto, in accordance with their terms, in each case, as enforcement
may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar Applicable Laws affecting creditors&rsquo; rights generally
and by general principles of equity. As of the date hereof, the Financing Commitment Letters are in full force and effect and
no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would or would reasonably be expected to constitute
a default or breach on the part of Parent or Merger Sub or, to the knowledge of Parent, any other parties thereto, under any of
the Financing Commitment Letters. Assuming the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in <U>Section 7.01</U> and <U>Section
7.02</U> on the Closing Date, as of the date hereof, Parent does not have any reason to believe (both before and after giving
effect to any &ldquo;flex&rdquo; provisions contained in the Debt Commitment Letter) that any of the conditions to the funding
of the full amount of the Financing will not be satisfied on a timely basis or that the full amount of the Financing will not
be available to Parent or Merger Sub on the date of the Closing. As of the date hereof, the Financing Commitment Letters contain
all of the conditions precedent and other conditions to the obligations of the parties thereunder to make the full amount of the
Financing available to Parent on the terms therein. There are no side letters or other agreements, arrangements or understandings
(other than with respect to an alternative financing consistent with the provisions of Section 6.17(b)) that could affect the
availability of the Financing on the Closing Date to which Parent or any of its Affiliates is a party related to the funding or
investing, as applicable, of the Required Amount other than as expressly set forth in the Financing Commitment Letters. The Equity
Commitment Letters provide, and will continue to provide, that the Company is a third party beneficiary thereof as set forth therein.
The obligations of Parent and Merger Sub under this Agreement are not subject to any conditions regarding Parent&rsquo;s, Merger
Sub&rsquo;s, their respective Affiliates&rsquo; or any other Person&rsquo;s (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Company&rsquo;s
or any Subsidiary of the Company&rsquo;s) ability to obtain the Financing.</P>

of this Agreement, the term &ldquo;<B>Solvent</B>&rdquo; when used with respect to any Person, means that, as of any date of determination
(x) the amount of the present &ldquo;fair saleable value&rdquo; of the assets of such Person will, as of such date, exceed (i)
the value of all &ldquo;liabilities of such Person, including contingent and other liabilities,&rdquo; as of such date, as such

and other liabilities) as such debts become absolute and mature, (y) such Person will not have, as of such date, an unreasonably
small amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged following such date,
and (z) such Person will be able to pay its liabilities, including contingent and other liabilities, as they mature. For purposes
of this definition, &ldquo;not have an unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in which it is
engaged or proposed to be engaged&rdquo; and &ldquo;able to pay its liabilities, including contingent and other liabilities, as
they mature&rdquo; means that such Person will be able to generate enough cash from operations, asset dispositions or refinancing,
or a combination thereof, to meet its obligations as they become due.</P>
