Section 2.04 _Surrender and Payment_.

  



  

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint Computershare
Trust Company, N.A. as the exchange agent (or such other nationally
recognized exchange agent agreed to between the parties hereto) (the
"Exchange Agent") for the purpose of exchanging the Merger Consideration for
certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock (the "Certificates");
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that any references herein to "Certificates" are
deemed to include references to book-entry account statements relating to the

and except with respect to the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to
Company Restricted Stock Awards (which are governed by _Section 2.06(b)_
), Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited with the Exchange
Agent the Aggregate Merger Consideration (the "Payment Fund"). To the extent
such fund diminishes for any reason below the level required to make prompt
payment of the Merger Consideration, Parent shall promptly replace or
restore, or cause to be replaced or restored, the lost portion of such fund
so as to ensure that it is, at all times, maintained at a level sufficient to
make such payments. The Payment Fund shall be invested by the Exchange Agent
as directed by Parent; _provided_ that (i) no such investment or losses
thereon shall relieve Parent from making the payments required by this
_Article 2_ or affect the amount of Merger Consideration payable hereunder,
(ii) no such investment shall have maturities that could prevent or delay
payments to be made pursuant to this Agreement and (iii) such investments
shall be in short-term obligations of the United States with maturities of no
more than 30 days, or guaranteed by, and backed by the full faith and credit
of, the United States. Any and all interest or other amounts earned with
respect to such funds shall become part of the Payment Fund. The Payment Fund
shall not be used for any other purpose. The Surviving Corporation shall (and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) pay all charges and expenses,
including those of the Exchange Agent, in connection with the exchange of
shares of Company Common Stock and the payment of the Merger Consideration in
respect of such shares of Company Common Stock.

  



  

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time, and in any event no later
than three Business Days after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall send, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each
record holder of shares of Company Common Stock at the Effective Time whose
shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
pursuant to _Section 2.03(a)_ (other than shares of Company Common Stock
subject to Company Restricted Stock Awards) a letter of transmittal and
instructions in customary forms reasonably satisfactory to the Company and
Parent (which shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery or transfer of the
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates pursuant to
_Section 2.09_ ) to the Exchange Agent) for use in such exchange. Each holder
of shares of Company Common Stock that have been converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration (other than shares of Company Common Stock
subject to Company Restricted Stock Awards) shall, subject to _Section
2.04(e)_ , be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration in respect of the
shares of Company Common Stock represented by a Certificate upon (i) surrender
to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a duly completed and
validly executed letter of transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an "agent's
message" by the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer
as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry
transfer of shares of Company Common Stock, and, in each case, delivery to the
Exchange Agent of such other documents as may reasonably be requested by the
Exchange Agent. Until so surrendered or transferred, each such Certificate
shall represent after the Effective Time for all purposes only the right to
receive such Merger Consideration. No interest shall be paid or accrued on
the cash payable upon the surrender or transfer of such Certificate.

(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is
registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that (i) either such
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form
for transfer and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the
Exchange Agent any transfer or other Tax required as a result of such payment
to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish
to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is
not payable.

  



  

(d) All Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of Certificates
in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock
formerly represented by such Certificate and from and after the Effective
Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company
Common Stock on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation. If,
after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger
Consideration as provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set
forth, in this _Article 2_.

  



  

(e) Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains undistributed to
the holders of shares of Company Common Stock 12 months after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand,
and any such holder who has not exchanged shares of Company Common Stock for
the Merger Consideration in accordance with this _Section 2.04_ prior to that
time shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of
the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon but subject to any
applicable withholdings. None of Parent, the Company or the Surviving
Corporation shall be liable to any holder of Company Common Stock for any
cash from the Payment Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any
abandoned property, escheat or similar Applicable Law.

  



  

Section 2.05 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding _Section 2.03_ ,
shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of adoption
of this Agreement or consented thereto in writing, who is entitled to
appraisal and who has properly exercised appraisal rights for such shares in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL shall not be converted into a right to
receive the Merger Consideration but instead shall be entitled to payment of
the appraised value of such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL
following which such shares shall automatically be canceled and shall cease
to exist; _provided_ , _however_ , that if, after the Effective Time, such
holder fails to perfect, withdraws or loses such holder's right to appraisal,
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL or if a court of competent jurisdiction
shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by
Section 262 of the DGCL, such shares of Company Common Stock shall be treated
as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration (less any amounts entitled to be deducted or
withheld pursuant to _Section 2.08_ ) in accordance with _Section 2.03(a)_ ,
without interest thereon, upon surrender of such Certificate formerly
representing such share. The Company shall provide Parent prompt written
notice of any demands or threatened demands received by the Company for
appraisal of shares of Company Common Stock, any withdrawal of any such demand
and any other demand, notice or instrument delivered to the Company prior to
the Effective Time pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL that relates to such
demand, and Parent shall have the opportunity and right to participate in all
negotiations and Proceedings with respect to such demands. Except with the
prior written consent of Parent, the Company shall not make any payment with
respect to, or offer to settle or settle, any such demands or agree to do any
of the foregoing.

Section 2.06 _Company Equity Awards; ESPP_.

  



  

(a) Except as otherwise agreed upon with the Company and Parent, as
of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of the holders thereof, unless otherwise agreed by a holder thereof, each
Company Stock Option, whether or not vested and exercisable, that is
outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be
automatically converted into the right to receive from the Surviving
Corporation (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay) an
amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the excess,
if any, of the Merger Consideration over the per share exercise price of such
Company Stock Option, by (ii) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common
Stock that were issuable upon exercise or settlement of such Company Stock
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time (such product, the "Option
Cash Amount"); provided, however, that if the exercise price per share of a
Company Stock Option is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration,
such Company Stock Option shall be cancelled and terminated effective upon the
Effective Time without any cash payment being made in respect thereof. The
cancellation of a Company Stock Option as provided in the immediately
preceding sentence shall be deemed a release of any and all rights the holder
thereof had or may have had in respect of such Company Stock Option. From and
after the Effective Time, the former holder of any cancelled Company Stock
Option shall only be entitled to receive the Option Cash Amount in respect of
such cancelled Company Stock Option. Payments of the Option Cash Amount shall
be made by the Surviving Corporation no later than the next regular payment
date under the Company's payroll system that is at least five Business Days
after the Effective Time, without interest. All payments provided pursuant to
this _Section 2.06(a)_ shall be made through the Surviving Corporation's or
one of its Affiliate's payroll and/or equity award maintenance
systems, subject to withholding in accordance with the provisions of _Section
2.08_.

  



  

(b) Except as otherwise agreed upon with the Company and Parent, as
of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of the holders thereof, each outstanding Company Restricted Stock Award
shall become fully vested and the restrictions with respect thereto shall
lapse. All Company Restricted Stock Awards, including shares that become fully
vested and with respect to which the restrictions shall lapse as of the
Effective Time, shall not be assumed by Parent or Merger Sub in the Merger
and shall automatically be cancelled and converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration and be treated in the Merger in the same manner as
the other shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with _Section 2.03(a)_.
The Company Restricted Stock Award payments described in this _Section
2.06(b)_ shall be made by the Surviving Corporation no later than the
next regular payment date under the Company's payroll system that is at least
five (5) Business Days after the Effective Time, without interest. All
payments provided pursuant to this _Section 2.06_ shall be made through the
Surviving Corporation's or one of its Affiliate's payroll and/or equity award
maintenance systems, subject to withholding in accordance with the provisions
of _Section 2.08_. In no event shall this _Section 2.06_ and _Section 2.04_
result in a duplication of benefits with respect to any Company Restricted
Stock Awards.

shall be canceled and extinguished as of the Effective Time and, in exchange
therefor, each former holder of any such Company RSU Award shall have the
right to receive from the Surviving Corporation (and Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to pay) an amount in cash equal to the product
obtained by multiplying (i) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to such Company RSU Award by (ii) the Merger Consideration (such
amounts payable hereunder, the "RSU Award Payments"). From and after the
Effective Time, the former holder of any canceled Company RSU Award shall
only be entitled to receive the RSU Award Payment in respect of such canceled
Company RSU Award. The RSU Award Payments described in this _Section 2.06(c)_
shall be made by the Surviving Corporation no later than the next regular
payment date under the Company's payroll system that is at least five
Business Days after the Effective Time, without interest; _provided_  that
such payment shall be made at such other time or times following the Effective
Time consistent with the terms of the Company RSU Award to the extent
necessary to avoid the imposition of additional income tax under Section 409A
of the Code. All payments provided pursuant to this _Section 2.06(c)_ shall
be made through the Surviving Corporation's or one of its Affiliate's payroll
and/or equity award maintenance systems, subject to withholding in accordance
with the provisions of _Section 2.08_.

  



  

(d) Except as otherwise agreed upon with the Company and Parent, as
of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of the holders thereof, each Company PSU Award shall be deemed fully
earned at the greater of (i) 100% of the specified target award level, and
(ii) the percentage of the target award level that would be earned based on
achievement of the applicable performance metric as of the Effective Time
pursuant to the terms of the applicable Performance Restricted Stock Unit
Award Agreement, any time-based restrictions thereon shall lapse, and such
Company PSU Awards shall not be assumed by Parent or Merger Sub in the Merger
and shall be canceled and extinguished as of the Effective Time and, in
exchange therefor, each former holder of any such Company PSU Award shall
have the right to receive from the Surviving Corporation (and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to pay) an amount in cash equal to the product
obtained by multiplying (i) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to such Company PSU Award (taking into account the
achievement and acceleration contemplated by this _Section 2.06(d)_ ) by (ii)
the Merger Consideration (such amounts payable hereunder, the "PSU Award
Payments"). From and after the Effective Time, the former holder of any
canceled Company PSU Award shall only be entitled to receive the PSU Award
Payment in respect of such canceled Company PSU Award. The PSU Award Payments
described in this _Section 2.06(d)_ shall be made by the Surviving
Corporation no later than the next regular payment date under the Company's
payroll system that is at least five Business Days after the Effective Time,
without interest; _provided_ that such payment shall be made at such
other time or times following the Effective Time consistent with the terms of
the Company PSU Award to the extent necessary to avoid the imposition of
additional income tax under Section 409A of the Code. All payments provided
pursuant to this _Section 2.06(d)_ shall be made through the Surviving
Corporation's or one of its Affiliate's payroll and/or equity award
maintenance systems, subject to withholding in accordance with the provisions
of _Section 2.08_.

product obtained by multiplying (i) the aggregate number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company Phantom Stock Award by (ii) the
Merger Consideration (such amounts payable hereunder, the "Phantom Stock
Payments"). From and after the Effective Time, the holder of any canceled

(i) contained solely in the risk factors sections of such Company SEC
Documents, except to the extent such information consists of factual and/or
historical statements, and (ii) in any forward-looking statements in such
Company SEC Documents or that are of a nature that they speculate about
future developments or otherwise relate to information, factors or risks that
are predictive, cautionary or forward-looking in nature); provided, that
nothing disclosed in such Company SEC Documents shall be deemed to modify the
representations and warranties in _Section 4.01_ , _Section 4.02_ , _Section
4.05_ , _Section 4.09(b)_ , _Section 4.23_ , or _Section 4.24_  or (b) as set

Company Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed disclosure with respect to any
other Part or sub-Part of the Company Disclosure Schedule to which the
relevance of such item is reasonably apparent on the face of such
disclosure) the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger
Sub as follows:

  



  

Section 4.01 _Corporate Existence and Power_. The Company is a
corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under
the laws of the State of Delaware and has all corporate powers and authority
required to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on
its business as now conducted. The Company is duly qualified to do
business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction where such qualification is necessary, except for
those jurisdictions where failure to be so qualified would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect. The Company has Made Available to Parent complete and correct
copies of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company as
currently in effect. The Company is not in violation of its certificate of
incorporation or bylaws, each as amended to date, in any material respect.

(a) The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to
enter into this Agreement and, subject to receipt of the
Stockholder Approval, to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The execution, delivery and performance by
the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the Company of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except for
obtaining the Stockholder Approval, have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate action on the part of the Company and no other corporate
proceedings on the part of the Company pursuant to the DGCL or otherwise, are
necessary to authorize the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement or to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The only vote of holders of any class of
capital stock of the Company necessary to adopt this Agreement, approve the
Merger and consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby is the affirmative vote (in person or by proxy) of holders of a
majority in voting power of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock,
voting together as a single class (such vote, the "Stockholder Approval").
This Agreement constitutes a valid and binding agreement of the Company
enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except as such
enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium and other
similar Applicable Law affecting creditors' rights generally and by general
principles of equity.

(b) At a meeting duly called and held, prior to the execution of

recommendation of the Special Committee) duly adopted resolutions (i)
determining and declaring that this Agreement, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement are advisable and in the
best interests of the Company's stockholders, (ii) approving the execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) directing that the
adoption of this Agreement be submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the
Company at the Stockholder Meeting and (iv) recommending adoption of this
Agreement to the stockholders of the Company (the "Company
Recommendation"). The Company is not party to any stockholder rights
agreement or "poison pill" or similar anti-takeover agreement or plan. The
Company Board has taken all necessary action so that Section 203 of the DGCL
or any similar anti-takeover, moratorium, or "control share" law applicable
to the Company does not, and will not, apply to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

Section 4.03 _Governmental Authorization_. The execution, delivery
and performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the
Company of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement require no action
by or in respect of, or filing with, any Governmental Authority, other than

the State of Delaware, (ii) compliance with any applicable requirements of (A)
the HSR Act and (B) any other applicable Antitrust Laws, (iii) compliance

rules or regulations of Nasdaq, and (iv) any actions or filings the absence of
which would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

Section 4.04 _Non-contravention_. The execution, delivery and
performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the
Company of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement do not and will not (with or without notice or lapse of time, or

notice or lapse of time, or both) or loss or impairment of any benefits or
rights under, or alter the rights or obligations of any third party under, or
result in termination, cancellation, modification or acceleration or give to
others any right of termination, cancellation, modification or acceleration of
any Material Contract to which the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company
is a party, or by which any of their respective properties or assets are
bound, or (iv) result in the creation or imposition of any Lien (other than
Permitted Liens) on any asset of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, with

financial and non-financial) required to be disclosed by the Company in the
reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported to the individuals responsible for
preparing such reports within the time periods specified in the rules and
forms of the SEC and (ii) all such information is accumulated and
communicated to the Company's management as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications of the
principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the Company
required under the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act with respect to such reports.

  



  

(d) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to,
is subject to, or has any commitment to become a party to or subject to, any

or arrangement relating to any transaction or relationship between or among

forth in _Section 7.01_ and _Section 7.02_ on the Closing Date, as of the
date hereof, Parent does not have any reason to believe (both before and after
giving effect to any "flex" provisions contained in the Debt Commitment
Letter) that any of the conditions to the funding of the full amount of the
Financing will not be satisfied on a timely basis or that the full amount of
the Financing will not be available to Parent or Merger Sub on the date of
the Closing. As of the date hereof, the Financing Commitment Letters
contain all of the conditions precedent and other conditions to the
obligations of the parties thereunder to make the full amount of
the Financing available to Parent on the terms therein. There are no side
letters or other agreements, arrangements or understandings (other than with
respect to an alternative financing consistent with the provisions of Section
6.17(b)) that could affect the availability of the Financing on the Closing
Date to which Parent or any of its Affiliates is a party related to the
funding or investing, as applicable, of the Required Amount other than as
expressly set forth in the Financing Commitment Letters. The
Equity Commitment Letters provide, and will continue to provide, that the
Company is a third party beneficiary thereof as set forth therein. The
obligations of Parent and Merger Sub under this Agreement are not subject to
any conditions regarding Parent's, Merger Sub's, their respective Affiliates'
or any other Person's (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the
Company's or any Subsidiary of the Company's) ability to obtain the
Financing.

Section 5.09 _Solvency_. Assuming (a) satisfaction of the conditions
to Parent's obligation to consummate the Merger, and after giving effect
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Financing
and the payment of the Aggregate Merger Consideration, (b) any repayment or
refinancing of debt contemplated in this Agreement or the Financing Commitment
Letters, (c) the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the
Company set forth in _Article 4_ hereof, (d) payment of all amounts
required to be paid in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (e) payment of all related fees and expenses,
(f) compliance with the Company's obligations in this Agreement and
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.01_ and _Section 7.02_
on the Closing Date and (g) any estimates, projections or forecasts of
the Company and its Subsidiaries furnished to Parent or its Affiliates or
Representatives have been prepared by them in good faith based upon
assumptions that were and continue to be reasonable, each of Parent and the
Surviving Corporation will be Solvent as of the Effective Time and
immediately after the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Solvent" when used with
respect to any Person, means that, as of any date of determination (x) the
amount of the present "fair saleable value" of the assets of such Person will,
as of such date, exceed (i) the value of all "liabilities of such Person,
including contingent and other liabilities," as of such date, as such quoted
terms are generally determined in accordance with Applicable Laws governing
determinations of the insolvency of debtors, and (ii) the amount that will be
required to pay the probable liabilities of such Person on its existing debts
(including contingent and other liabilities) as such debts become absolute
and mature, (y) such Person will not have, as of such date, an
unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in
which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged following such date, and (z)
such Person will be able to pay its liabilities, including contingent and
other liabilities, as they mature. For purposes of this definition, "not have
an unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in
which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged" and "able to pay its
liabilities, including contingent and other liabilities, as they mature"
means that such Person will be able to generate enough cash from operations,
asset dispositions or refinancing, or a combination thereof, to meet its
obligations as they become due.

  



  

Section 5.10 _Guarantee_. Parent has furnished the Company with a
duly executed, true, complete and correct copy of the Guarantees. Each
Guarantee is in full force and effect. Each Guarantee is (i) a legal, valid
and binding obligation of the applicable Guarantor and (ii) enforceable in
accordance with its respective terms against such Guarantor, except as such
enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium and other
similar Applicable Law affecting creditors' rights generally and by general
principles of equity. There is no breach or default under any Guarantee by
the applicable Guarantor, and no event has occurred that would constitute a
breach or default (or with notice or lapse of time or both would constitute a
breach or default) thereunder by such Guarantor.

neither Parent, Merger Sub nor any of their respective Affiliates has entered
into any agreement, arrangement or understanding (in each case, whether oral
or written), or authorized, committed or agreed to enter into any agreement,
arrangement or understanding (in each case, whether oral or written), (i)
pursuant to which any stockholder of the Company would be entitled to receive,
in respect of any share of Company Common Stock, consideration of a different
amount or nature than the Merger Consideration or pursuant to which any
stockholder of the Company has agreed to vote to adopt this Agreement or has
agreed to vote against any Superior Proposal or (ii) pursuant to which any
stockholder of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has agreed to make an
investment in, or contribution to, Parent or Merger Sub in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. As of the date hereof, there
are no agreements, arrangements or understandings (in each case, whether oral
or written) between Parent, Merger Sub, the Guarantor or any of their
respective Affiliates, on the one hand, and any member of the Company's
management or directors, on the other hand, that relate in any way to, or
are in connection with, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. As
of the date hereof, none of Parent, Merger Sub, the Guarantor has entered
into any Contract with any Person prohibiting such Person from providing or
seeking to provide debt financing to any Person in connection with a
transaction involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection
with the Merger, other than Contracts with any Debt Financing Sources in
effect on the date hereof, true, correct and complete copies of which have
been provided to Parent on the date hereof.

  



  

Section 5.12 _Stock Ownership_. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub owns
any shares of capital stock of the Company. None of Parent, Merger Sub nor
any of their respective Affiliates is an "interested stockholder" of the
Company as defined in Section 203(c) of the DGCL.

  



  

Section 5.13 _Brokers ' Fees_. There is no investment banker,
broker, finder or other agent or intermediary that has been retained by or is
authorized to act on behalf of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, Affiliates,
or any of their respective officers or directors in their capacities as
officers or directors, who is entitled to any advisory, banking,
broker's, finder's or similar fee or commission for which the Company could
be responsible in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, other than those that become payable by the
Surviving Corporation following the consummation of the Merger.

with  _Section 6.02(a)_ , if, at any time on or after the date hereof, but

did not result from a material breach of this _Section 6.02_ and (iii) the
Company Board or the Special Committee determines in good faith, after
consultation with the Company Financial Advisor and outside legal counsel,
that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or could reasonably be
expected to result in, a Superior Proposal, then if, but only if, the Company

to take such actions would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under Applicable Law, the Company may, after entering into an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with such Third Party, (A) furnish

regarding such Acquisition Proposal or otherwise cooperate with or assist or

Agreement, the Company and its Representatives may (x) following the receipt

Proposal made by such Third Party so as to determine whether such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior
Proposal and (y) direct any Persons to this Agreement, including the
specific provisions of this _Section 6.02_. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their
respective Representatives to not, provide any commercially sensitive non-

Representatives with respect to such information in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby.

receipt of (i) any Acquisition Proposal or (ii) any inquiries, proposals or
offers with respect to, or that would reasonably be expected to lead to, an
Acquisition Proposal, any request for non-public information that would
reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal or any request for
discussions or negotiations with, the Company, any of the
Company's Subsidiaries or any of the Company's Representatives that would
reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, in each case of
this clause (ii), from a bona fide potential purchaser of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries (any such inquiry, proposal, offer or request, an
"Inquiry"), which notification shall include a copy of the applicable
written Acquisition Proposal or other such proposal or offer (or, if oral,
the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal or other such
proposal or offer) and the identity of the Third Party making such Acquisition
Proposal or Inquiry. The Company shall thereafter keep Parent reasonably
informed on a reasonably current basis of the status of any material
developments, discussions or negotiations regarding any such Acquisition
Proposal or Inquiry, and the material terms and conditions thereof in the case
of any Acquisition Proposal or other such proposal or offer (including any
change in price or form of consideration or other material amendment
thereto), including by providing a copy of material documentation relating
thereto that is exchanged between the Third Party (or its Representatives)
making such Acquisition Proposal or other such proposal or offer and the
Company (or its Representatives) within 24 hours after receipt thereof.

  



  

(d) The Company agrees not to release or permit the release of any
Person from, or to waive or permit the waiver or termination of any provision
of, any confidentiality, standstill or similar agreement (or any standstill or
confidentiality provision of any other contract or agreement) to which any of
the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company is a party (a "Standstill
Provision") or any "moratorium," "control share acquisition," "fair price,"
"interested stockholder," "affiliate transaction," "business combination," or
other antitakeover Applicable Law ( _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the
Company Board or any committee thereof may grant a waiver, release or
termination of a Standstill Provision if, but only if, the Company Board or
any committee thereof determines in good faith, after consultation with the
Company Financial Advisor and outside legal counsel, that failure to provide
such waiver, release or termination would reasonably be likely to
be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law), and the
Company will use its reasonable best efforts to enforce or cause to be
enforced to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law each such
agreement.

  



  

(e) The Company agrees that in the event any of its Subsidiaries or
its or their Representatives takes any action which, if taken by the Company
would constitute a breach by the Company of _Section 6.02(a)_ , _Section
6.02(b)_ or _Section 6.02(d)_ , the Company shall be deemed to be in breach
of _Section 6.02(a)_, _Section 6.02(b)_ or _Section 6.02(d)_ , as applicable.

  



  

Section 6.03 _Company Recommendation_.

Agreement, Parent or Merger Sub, or otherwise make any public statement or
proposal inconsistent with, the Company Recommendation, (ii) approve, adopt

agreement or other similar agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal
(other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) or (v) resolve or
publicly propose to take any action described in the foregoing clauses (i)
through (iv) (each of the foregoing actions described in clauses (i) through
(iv) (or clause (v) solely to the extent related to clauses (i) through (iv))
being referred to as an "Adverse Recommendation Change").

(b) (i) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, including _Section 6.03(a)_ , at any time prior to obtaining the
Stockholder Approval (and subject to the Company's or the Company Board's, as
applicable, compliance with Section 6.02, this Section 6.03 and _Section
9.04_ ), the Company Board or the Special Committee may, if it determines in
good faith (after consultation with the Company Financial Advisor and outside
legal counsel), that the failure to do so would be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board under Applicable
Law, (A) make an Adverse Recommendation Change as a result of either (1) a
Superior Proposal or (2) any fact, event, change, development or circumstance
not known or reasonably foreseeable by the Company Board as of the date
hereof and not relating to any Acquisition Proposal or Inquiry (such fact,
event, change, development, circumstance or consequences thereof, an
"Intervening Event") or (B) cause the Company to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01(h)_ and authorize the Company to enter
into a definitive agreement concerning a transaction that constitutes a
Superior Proposal (which agreement shall be entered into substantially
concurrently with such termination), subject in each case to compliance with
the terms of paragraph (ii) or (iii) below, as applicable.

  



  

(ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) no Adverse Recommendation
Change pursuant to this _Section 6.03(b)_ may be made as a result of a
Superior Proposal and (y) no termination of this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 8.01(h)_ may be made, in either case:

  



  

(A) until after the fourth Business Day following written notice from
the Company advising Parent that the Company Board or the Special
Committee intends to make an Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01(h)_ (a "Notice of Superior Proposal") and
specifying the reasons therefor, including, the material terms and conditions
of, and the identity of the Third Party making, such Superior Proposal, and a
copy of any other relevant transaction documents (it being understood and
agreed that any amendment to the financial terms or any other material term of
such Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice of Superior Proposal, which
shall require a new notice period of two Business Days, and compliance with
this _Section 6.03(b)_  with respect to such new notice);

  



  

(B) unless during such four Business Day period (or two Business Day
period following an amended proposal), the Company shall, and shall cause its
Representatives to, to the extent requested by Parent, negotiate with Parent
in good faith to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the Guarantees, the Financing Commitment Letters as would permit
the Company Board or the Special Committee to maintain the Company
Recommendation and not make an Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this
Agreement; and

  



    

 | 53| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(C) unless, following to the expiration of such four Business Day
period (or two Business Day period following an amended proposal), the
Company Board or the Special Committee has considered in good faith Parent's
proposal to adjust the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the
Guarantees, the Financing Commitment Letters, and the Company Board or the
Special Committee determines in good faith (after consultation with the
Company Financial Advisor and outside legal counsel) that (x) the failure to
make an Adverse Recommendation Change or authorize the termination of this
Agreement would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
Applicable Law and (y) after taking into account any adjustment or
modification to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent, that
the Acquisition Proposal continues to be a Superior Proposal. None of the
Company, the Company Board or any committee thereof shall enter into any
agreement with any Third Party to limit or not to give prior notice to Parent
of its intention to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change or to terminate
this Agreement in light of a Superior Proposal.

  



  

(iii) In the case of an Intervening Event, no Adverse Recommendation
Change pursuant to this _Section 6.03(b)_ may be made:

  



  

(A) until after the fourth Business Day following written notice from
the Company advising Parent that the Company Board or the Special
Committee intends to take such action and specifying the material facts
underlying the determination by the Company Board or the Special Committee
that an Intervening Event has occurred, and the reason for the Adverse
Recommendation Change, in reasonable detail (a "Notice of Intervening
Event");

  



  

(B) unless during such four Business Day period, the Company shall,
and shall cause its Representatives to, to the extent requested by
Parent, negotiate with Parent in good faith to enable Parent to amend this
Agreement, the Guarantees, the Financing Commitment Letters in such a manner
that permits the Company Board to maintain the Company Recommendation and not
make an Adverse Recommendation Change; and

  



  

(C) unless, by the expiration of such four Business Day period, the
Company Board or the Special Committee has considered in good faith
any amendments to this Agreement, the Guarantees, the Financing Commitment
Letters proposed by Parent and has determined in good faith (after
consultation with the Company Financial Advisor and outside legal counsel),
that the failure to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
Applicable Law if such amendments were implemented.

  



    

 | 54| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

The provisions of this _Section 6.03(b)(iii)_ shall also apply to any
material change to the facts and circumstances relating to an Intervening
Event, in which case such change shall require a new Notice of Intervening
Event and the Company shall be required to comply again with the provisions of
this _Section 6.03(b)(iii)_ , except that any reference to four Business Days
shall instead be to two Business Days.

  



  

(c) Nothing contained in Section 6.03 or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prohibit the Company from (i) taking and disclosing a position
contemplated by Rule 14d-9, Rule 14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A
promulgated under the Exchange Act with regard to an Acquisition Proposal,
(ii) making any disclosure to the Company's stockholders if, in the good faith
judgment of the Company Board or the Special Committee, after consultation
with outside legal counsel, such disclosure is required by Applicable Law, or
(iii) making any disclosure that constitutes a stop, look and listen
communication or similar communication of the type contemplated by
Section 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act, _provided_ that the
Company Board shall not recommend that the stockholders of the Company tender
their shares in connection with any tender or exchange offer (or otherwise
approve or recommend any Acquisition Proposal) or effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change, unless, in each case, the applicable requirements of
_Section 6.03(b)_  shall have been and continue at the time of such action to
be satisfied as to an Adverse Recommendation Change.

  



  

Section 6.04 _Approval of Merger Agreement_.

  



  

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event within
twenty (20) Business Days) after the execution of this Agreement, the Company
shall prepare a proxy statement in preliminary form for a special meeting of
the Company's stockholders (including any adjournments and postponements
thereof, the "Stockholder Meeting") (together with any amendments thereof or
supplements thereto and any other required proxy materials, the "Proxy
Statement") and file it with the SEC and the Company and Parent shall
cooperate with each other in connection with the preparation of the foregoing,
including to cause their respective Affiliates, as applicable, to cooperate
with the preparation of the foregoing. The Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to have the Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC as
promptly as practicable after the filing thereof, including by using its
reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to
any comments received from the SEC or its staff concerning the Proxy
Statement. The Company ,Parent and Merger Sub shall notify the others promptly
upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff or any other
government officials and of any request by the SEC or its staff or any other
government officials for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement and
shall supply the others with copies of all correspondence between it or any
of its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, or its staff or any
other government officials, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy
Statement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of Parent
and Merger Sub shall cooperate, and shall cause their respective Affiliates
to cooperate, with the Company in connection with the preparation and filing
of the Proxy Statement, including promptly furnishing to the Company in
writing upon request any and all information relating to Parent, Merger Sub
and their respective Affiliates as may be required to be set forth in the
Proxy Statement under Applicable Law. Parent shall ensure that such
information supplied by it and its Affiliates in writing for inclusion in the
Proxy Statement will not, on the date it is first mailed to stockholders of
the Company and at the time of the Stockholder Meeting or filed with the
SEC (as applicable), contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
stated above, prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement (or any amendment
or supplement thereto), or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect
thereto, the Company shall provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on such document or response and shall consider Parent's
comments in good faith. The Company shall ensure that the Proxy Statement (i)
will not on the date it is first mailed to stockholders of the Company and at
the time of the Stockholder Meeting contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading and (ii) will comply
as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC and Nasdaq.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company assumes no responsibility with
respect to information supplied in writing by or on behalf of Parent or
Merger Sub or their Affiliates for inclusion or incorporation by reference in
the Proxy Statement. If, at any time prior to the Stockholder Meeting, the
Company, Parent or Merger Sub discovers information provided by it for
inclusion in the Proxy Statement has become false or misleading in any
material respect, the party hereto which discovers such information shall
promptly notify the other parties hereto and the Company shall promptly
prepare and file with the SEC an appropriate amendment or supplement to the
Proxy Statement and, to the extent required by Applicable Law or the SEC or
its staff, disseminate such amendment or supplement to the Company's
stockholders.

(b) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the clearance of
the Proxy Statement by the SEC for mailing (and in any event within five (5)
Business Days after clearance by the SEC), the Company shall cause the Proxy
Statement in definitive form to be mailed to the Company's stockholders. As
promptly as reasonably practicable following the mailing of the Proxy
Statement to the Company's stockholders, the Company shall, in accordance
with Applicable Law and the Company's governing documents, convene and hold
the Stockholder Meeting for the purpose of considering and taking action upon
the matters requiring Stockholder Approval (with the record date and meeting
date set in consultation with Parent). Unless the Company Board or the Special
Committee has withdrawn the Company Recommendation in compliance with Section
6.03, the Company shall (i) make the Company Recommendation to the
stockholders of the Company and include such recommendation in the Proxy
Statement, (ii) use its reasonable best efforts to solicit from stockholders
of the Company proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and (iii)
take all other action necessary or advisable to secure the vote of the
holders of shares of Company Common Stock required by Applicable Law to
effect the Merger. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, the Company may adjourn, recess or postpone the Stockholder Meeting
solely (i) after consultation with Parent, to the extent necessary to ensure
that any required supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided
to the stockholders of the Company within a reasonable amount of time in
advance of the Stockholders Meeting or (ii) if as of the time for which the
Stockholders Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy
Statement) there are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented
(either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct
the business of the Stockholders Meeting.

upon reasonable notice, the Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to) afford Parent, the Debt Financing Sources and its and their authorized
Representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours throughout
the period prior to the Effective Time, to its properties, books,
Tax Returns, Contracts and records. The foregoing shall not require the
Company (a) to provide access to or otherwise make available or furnish any
books, Contracts or records if such access would violate a confidentiality,
non-disclosure or other similar agreement in effect as of the date hereof,
(b) to provide access to or otherwise make available or furnish any
information if and to the extent that the provision of such information would
in the good faith judgment of the Company based on advice of
counsel jeopardize any attorney-client, work product or other legal privilege
or protection (it being agreed that, in the case of clauses (a) and (b), the
Company shall give notice to Parent of the fact that it is withholding such
information or documents and thereafter the Company and Parent shall use
their respective commercially reasonable efforts to cause such information to
be provided in a manner that would not reasonably be expected to violate such
restriction or waive the applicable privilege or protection), (c) to provide
access to or otherwise make available any information relating to the process
conducted by the Company that led to the execution of this Agreement, or (d)
to provide access to or otherwise make available or furnish any information if
and to the extent that the provision of such information could in the
reasonable judgment of the Company based on advice of counsel violate any
Applicable Law (it being agreed that, in the case of clause (d), that the
Company shall give notice to Parent of the fact that it is withholding such
information or documents and thereafter the Company and Parent shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to cause such information to be provided
in a manner that would not reasonably be expected to violate such
Applicable Law). Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Parent and
Merger Sub shall not, and shall cause their respective Representatives acting
on their behalf not to, contact any customer, partner, vendor or supplier of
the Company in connection with the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement without the Company's prior written consent,
and Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that any such contact shall
be arranged and supervised by Representatives of the Company. All requests
for information made pursuant to this _Section 6.05_ shall be directed to the
executive officer or other Person designated by the Company. All such
information shall be deemed Evaluation Material (as defined in the
Confidentiality Agreements) under and be governed by the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreements.

Parent will give prompt notice to the other (and will subsequently keep the
other informed on a reasonably current basis of any material developments
related to such notice) upon its becoming aware of (i) the occurrence or
existence of any fact, event or circumstance that has, (x) with respect to
the Company, had or would reasonably be expected have a Company Material
Adverse Effect and (y) with respect to Parent or Merger Sub, had or would
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, (ii) the
occurrence or existence of any fact, event or circumstance that is reasonably
likely to result in any of the conditions set forth in _Article 7_ not being
able to be satisfied prior to the End Date, or (iii) any notice or other
communication that has been received by the Company from any Person alleging
that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. No notification given by any
party pursuant to this _Section 6.06_ shall limit or otherwise affect any of
the representations, warranties, covenants, obligations or conditions
contained in this Agreement.

Section 6.07 _Employee Benefit Plan Matters_.

  



  

(a) From and after the Closing Date, with respect to employees of
the Company or its Subsidiaries immediately before the Effective Time who
continue employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary
of Parent or the Surviving Corporation following the Closing Date
("Continuing Employees"), Parent shall cause the service of each such
Continuing Employee to be recognized for purposes of eligibility to
participate, levels of benefits (but not for benefit accruals under any
defined benefit pension plan) and vesting under each compensation,
retirement, vacation, fringe or other welfare benefit plan, program or
arrangement of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries
(collectively, the "Parent Benefit Plans") in which any Continuing Employee
is or becomes eligible to participate, but solely to the extent service was
credited to such employee for such purposes under a comparable Company
Employee Plan immediately prior to the Closing Date and to the extent such
credit would not result in a duplication of benefits. Parent shall assume any
and all vacation balances of Continuing Employees, and shall assume all costs
and notice obligations incurred in connection with terminations of non-
Continuing Employees.

  



  

(b) For a period of not less than 12 months after the Closing Date,
Parent shall provide each Continuing Employee with (i) (A) base salary or
base hourly rate and (B) cash incentive compensation target opportunity
(including commissions but excluding specified performance goals for any cash
incentive compensation in respect of any calendar year after the 2017 calendar
year), in each case in an amount at least equal to the level that was
provided to each such Continuing Employee prior to the Closing Date, and (ii)
employee benefits (other than equity awards) that are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to those provided to each such Continuing
Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date. Parent shall also honor the
Company's annual cash incentive bonus plans in effect for the 2017 calendar
year, and shall provide each Continuing Employee with a cash incentive bonus
for 2017 which shall be paid consistent with the Company's prior bonus
payment timing, but in no event later than March 15, 2018. Each Person listed
on  _Schedule 6.07(b)_ shall receive his or her pro-rated target cash bonus
with respect to 2017 in connection with and at the Effective Time of the
Merger, and the bonus amount payable to such Person following the conclusion
of the 2017 fiscal year shall be reduced by any pro-rated target cash bonus
paid with respect to 2017 at the Effective Time. In addition, Parent shall (i)
assume and honor the terms of the severance agreements listed on _Schedule
6.07(b)_ and provide the severance payments and benefits required thereunder
to be provided to any employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
subject to the terms and conditions of such agreements and (ii) for a period
of 12 months after the Closing Date, honor the terms of Company's and its
Subsidiaries' severance policies generally applicable to all employees as in
effect as of the Closing Date. Between the date hereof and the Closing Date,
the Company may, subject to Parent's consent, and the Parent and the Company
will work in good faith to, implement changes to the Company's 2017 cash
incentive bonus plan for VP and director level employees to be effective as of
the Closing Date, which changes will be designed to facilitate the retention
of such employees.

  



    

 | 58| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) From and after the Closing Date, with respect to each Parent
Benefit Plan that is an "employee welfare benefit plan" as defined in Section
3(1) of ERISA in which any Continuing Employee is or becomes eligible to
participate, Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to cause each such
Parent Benefit Plan to (i) waive all limitations as to pre-existing
conditions, waiting periods, required physical examinations and exclusions
with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable under such
Parent Benefit Plan for such Continuing Employees and their eligible
dependents to the same extent that such pre-existing conditions, waiting
periods, required physical examinations and exclusions would not have applied
or would have been waived under the corresponding Company Employee Plan in
which such Continuing Employee was a participant immediately prior to his or
her commencement of participation in such Parent Benefit Plan but, with
respect to long-term disability and life insurance benefits and coverage,
solely to the extent permitted under the terms and conditions of Parent's
applicable insurance contracts in effect as of the Closing Date; _provided_
,  _however_ , that for purposes of clarity, to the extent such benefit
coverage includes eligibility conditions based on periods of employment,
_Section 6.07(a)_ shall control; and (ii) provide each Continuing Employee and
their eligible dependents with credit for any co-payments and deductibles
paid in the calendar year that, and prior to the date that, such Continuing
Employee commences participation in such Parent Benefit Plan in satisfying
any applicable co-payment or deductible requirements under such Parent
Benefit Plan for the applicable calendar year, to the extent that such
expenses were recognized for such purposes under the comparable Company
Employee Plan.

  



  

(d) From and after the Closing Date, Parent shall honor, and shall
cause the Surviving Corporation and their respective Subsidiaries to honor,
in accordance with its terms, (i) each existing (as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time) employment, change in control, retention, severance and
termination protection plan, policy or agreement of or between the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries and any current or former officer, director or
employee of that company to the extent set forth on _Schedule 6.07(b)_ ,
(ii) all obligations in effect as of the Effective Time under any "Merger
Bonus Agreement" as defined and set forth in Part 4.16(d) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, (iii) all obligations in effect as of the Effective Time
under any bonus or bonus deferral plans, programs or agreements of the
Company or its Subsidiaries and (iv) all vested and accrued benefits under any
Company Employee Plan. Parent acknowledges that the transaction contemplated
hereby shall constitute a "change in control" for purposes of each Company
Employee Plan set forth on Schedule _6.07(d)_ that uses such term.

  



  

(e) Nothing in this _Section 6.07_ shall be deemed to amend any
Parent Benefit Plan or to require Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their Affiliates to continue or amend any particular benefit plan before or
after the consummation of the transactions contemplated in this Agreement,
and any such plan may be amended or terminated in accordance with its terms
and Applicable Law. The provisions of this _Section 6.07_ are for the sole
benefit of the parties hereto and nothing herein, express or implied, is
intended or shall be construed to confer upon or give to any person
(including any Continuing Employee), other than the parties to this Agreement
and their respective successors and permitted assigns, any legal or equitable
or other rights or remedies under or by reason of any provision of this
_Section 6.07_. Nothing contained herein, express or implied is intended to
confer upon any Continuing Employee any right to employment or continued
employment for any period of time by reason of this Agreement, or any right
to a particular term or condition of employment.

  



  

(f) The Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries (as applicable)
shall continue to abide by the terms of the Union Agreements while such Union
Agreements are in effect.

Section 6.08 _State Takeover Laws_. If any "control share
acquisition," "fair price," "moratorium" or other anti-takeover Applicable
Law becomes or is deemed to be applicable to the Company, Parent, Merger Sub,
the Merger, or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, then each
of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, and their respective Board of Directors
shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise act to
render such anti-takeover Applicable Law inapplicable to the foregoing.

  



  

Section 6.09 _Obligations of Merger Sub_. Subject to the terms and
conditions set forth herein, Parent shall cause Merger Sub to perform its
obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby on the terms and conditions set forth in
this Agreement.

  



  

Section 6.10 _Voting of Shares_. Parent shall vote any shares of
Company Common Stock beneficially owned by it or any of its Subsidiaries in
favor of adoption of this Agreement at the Stockholder Meeting, and will vote
or cause to be voted the shares of Merger Sub held by it or any of its
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, in favor of adoption of this Agreement.

  



  

Section 6.11 _Director and Officer Liability_.

  



  

(a) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to maintain officers' and directors' liability
insurance in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective
Time covering each such person currently covered by the Company's officers'
and directors' liability insurance policy on terms with respect to coverage
and amount no less favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date
hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that in satisfying its obligation under this
_Section 6.11(a)_ , neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be
obligated to pay annual premiums in excess of 300% of the amount per annum
the Company paid in its last full fiscal year prior to the date hereof (the
"Current Premium") and if such premiums for such insurance would at any time
exceed 300% of the Current Premium, then the Surviving Corporation shall
cause to be maintained policies of insurance that, in the Surviving
Corporation's good faith judgment, provide the maximum coverage available at
an annual premium equal to 300% of the Current Premium. The provisions of the
immediately preceding sentence shall be deemed to have been satisfied if
prepaid "tail" or "runoff" policies have been obtained by the Company prior
to the Effective Time, which policies provide such persons currently covered
by such policies with coverage for an aggregate period of six years with
respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before
the Effective Time, including in respect of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the amount paid for such
prepaid policies does not exceed 300% of the Current Premium. If any such
prepaid policies described in this _Section 6.11(a)_ have been obtained by
the Company prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
(and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain any and all
such policies in full force and effect for their full term, and continue to
honor the obligations thereunder.

  



    

 | 60| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) From and after the Effective Time, each of Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall: (i) indemnify and hold harmless each
individual who (x) at the Effective Time is, or at any time prior to the
Effective Time was, a director or officer of the Company or of a Subsidiary
of the Company or (y) is listed on _Part 6.11(b)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule (each such individual in clause (x) or (y), an "Indemnified Party")
for any and all costs and expenses (including fees and expenses of
legal counsel, which shall be advanced as they are incurred; _provided_ that
the Indemnified Party shall have made an undertaking to repay such expenses
if it is ultimately determined that such Indemnified Party was not entitled to
indemnification under this  _Section 6.11(b)_ ), judgments, fines, penalties
or liabilities (including amounts paid in settlement or compromise)
imposed upon or reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection
with or arising out of any action, suit or other Proceeding (whether civil or
criminal) in which such Indemnified Party may be involved or with which he or
she may be threatened (regardless of whether as a named party or as a
participant other than as a named party, including as a witness) (an
"Indemnified Party Proceeding") (A) by reason of such Indemnified Party's
being or having been such director or officer or an employee or agent of the
Company or any Subsidiary of the Company or otherwise in connection with any
action taken or not taken at the request of the Company or any Subsidiary of
the Company or (B) arising out of such Indemnified Party's service in
connection with any other corporation or organization for which he or she
serves or has served as a director, officer, employee, agent, trustee or
fiduciary at the request of the Company (including in any capacity with
respect to any employee benefit plan), in each of (A) or (B), whether or not
the Indemnified Party continues in such position at the time such Indemnified
Party Proceeding is brought or threatened and at, or at any time prior to,
the Effective Time (including any Indemnified Party Proceeding relating in
whole or in part to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
relating to the enforcement of this provision or any other indemnification or
advancement right of any Indemnified Party), to the fullest extent permitted
under Applicable Law; and (ii) fulfill and honor in all respects the
obligations of the Company pursuant to: (x) each indemnification agreement in
effect as of the date hereof between the Company and any Indemnified Party,
the form of which has been Made Available to Parent; and (y) any
indemnification provision (including advancement of expenses) and any
exculpation provision set forth in the certificate of incorporation or bylaws
of the Company as in effect on the date hereof. Parent's and the Surviving
Corporation's obligations under the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) shall
continue in full force and effect for a period of six years from the Effective
Time;  _provided_ , _however_ , that all rights to indemnification,
exculpation and advancement of expenses in respect of any claim asserted or
made within such period shall continue until the final disposition of such
claim. If Parent or the Surviving Corporation fails to comply with its
obligations in this _Section 6.11(b)_ and an Indemnified Party commences a
suit which results in a final, non-appealable determination by a court of
competent jurisdiction that Parent or the Surviving Corporation failed to
comply with such obligation, Parent shall pay such Indemnified Party his or
her costs and expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees and
disbursements) in connection with such suit, together with interest thereon at
the "prime rate" as published in The Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition, in
effect on the date such payment was required to be made through the date of
payment (calculated daily on the basis of a year of 365 days and the actual
number of days elapsed, without compounding).

  



  

(c) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set
forth in this _Section 6.11_.

  



    

 | 61| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d) The provisions of this _Section 6.11_ are (i) intended to be for
the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or
her heirs and his or her Representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that
any such individual may have under any certificate of incorporation or bylaws,
by contract or otherwise. The obligations of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation under this _Section 6.11_ shall not be terminated or modified in
such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of any Indemnified Party
unless (x) such termination or modification is required by Applicable Law or
(y) the affected Indemnified Party shall have consented in writing to such
termination or modification (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnified
Parties shall be third party beneficiaries of this _Section 6.11_
); provided, however, that such rights of the Indemnified Parties as third
party beneficiaries under this _Section 6.11_ shall not arise until the
Effective Time.

  



  

Section 6.12 _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

  



  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the
Company and Parent shall use their reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist
and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper
or advisable under Applicable Law to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, including (i) using reasonable best efforts to obtain all
necessary actions or non-actions, waivers, consents and approvals from
Governmental Authorities and to make all necessary registrations and filings
(including filings with Governmental Authorities, if any) and to take such
steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid a
Proceeding by, any Governmental Authorities, (ii) using reasonable best
efforts to deliver required notices to, and obtain required consents or
waivers from, Third Parties and (iii) the execution and delivery of any
additional instruments necessary to consummate the Merger and to fully carry

termination of any applicable waiting period and to resolve such objections,
if any, as the FTC and the DOJ, or other Governmental Authorities of any other

required with respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; _provided_ that (A) the Company and its Subsidiaries will

(c) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this
_Section 6.12_ , each party hereto shall: (i) give the other parties prompt
notice of the making or commencement of any request, inquiry or Proceeding by
any Governmental Authority with respect to the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) keep the other parties

regarding any such request, inquiry or Proceeding, and provide a copy of all

Act only if the other parties hereto agree. Subject to Applicable Law, in
advance and to the extent practicable, each of Parent or the Company, as the
case may be, will consult the other on all the information relating to Parent
or the Company, as the case may be, and any of their respective Subsidiaries
that appear in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any
third party and/or any Governmental Authority in connection with the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall
incorporate all comments reasonably proposed by Parent or the Company, as the
case may be; _provided_ , _however_ , that if review of any information would
be material in connection with any second request (or similar process) such
information shall be provided solely to those individuals acting as outside
antitrust counsel for the other parties ( _provided_ that such counsel shall
not disclose such information to such other parties and shall enter into a
joint defense agreement with the providing party). In addition, except as may

at each meeting or conference (including telephonic) relating to such
request, inquiry or Proceeding and to have access to and be consulted in
connection with any document, opinion or proposal made or submitted to any
Governmental Authority in connection with such request, inquiry or

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, Parent
agrees to take promptly any and all steps necessary to avoid, eliminate or
resolve each and every impediment and obtain all clearances, consents,
approvals and waivers under Antitrust Laws that may be required by any
Governmental Authority, so as to enable the parties hereto to consummate the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement on a timely
basis (and in any event no later than three Business Days prior to the End
Date), including (i) committing to or effecting, by consent decree, hold
separate orders, trust, or otherwise, the sale, license, transfer,
assignment or other disposition of assets or businesses of Parent or the
Company or their respective Subsidiaries, (ii) terminating,
relinquishing, modifying, transferring, assigning, restructuring, or waiving
existing agreements, collaborations, relationships, ventures,
contractual rights, obligations or other arrangements of Parent or the
Company or their respective Subsidiaries and (iii) creating or consenting to
create any relationships, ventures, contractual rights, obligations,
behavioral undertakings or other arrangements of Parent or the Company or
their respective Subsidiaries (and, in each case, to enter, or offer to enter,
into agreements and stipulate to the entry of an Order or file appropriate
applications with any Governmental Authority in connection with any of the
foregoing and in the case of actions by or with respect to the Company or its
Subsidiaries or its or their businesses or assets, by consenting to such
action by the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such action may, at
the discretion of Parent or the Company, be conditioned upon consummation of
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement) (each a
"Divestiture Action") as may be necessary or required, to avoid the entry of,
or to effect the dissolution of or vacate or lift, any Order that would
otherwise have the effect of preventing consummation of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and to ensure that no
Governmental Authority with the authority to clear, authorize or otherwise
approve consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, fails to do so on a timely basis and in any event no
later than three Business Days prior to the End Date. Parent and the Company
shall cooperate in any proposal, negotiation, or offer to commit and to
effect, by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, any and all
Divestiture Actions or otherwise to offer to take or offer to commit (and if
such offer is accepted, commit to and effect) to take any Divestiture Action
as may be required to resolve any Governmental Authority's objections to the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

(e) In the event that any Proceeding is commenced challenging the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and such
Proceeding seeks, or would reasonably be expected to seek, to prevent
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts to
take any and all action to resolve any such Proceeding and each of the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall cooperate with each other and use its
respective reasonable best efforts to contest any such Proceeding and to have
vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or
other Order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect
and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

(f) Neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall, nor shall they permit their
respective Subsidiaries to, acquire or agree to acquire any rights,
assets, business, Person or division thereof (through acquisition, license,
joint venture, collaboration or otherwise), if such acquisition, would
reasonably be expected to increase the risk of not obtaining any applicable
clearance, consent, approval or waiver under Antitrust Laws with respect to
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

as reasonably practicable (and in any event within two Business Days) notify

shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense and
settlement of, any Stockholder Litigation; provided, however, that
the Company shall not be permitted to settle (or engage in settlement
negotiations concerning) any Stockholder Litigation without the prior written
consent of Parent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. Without otherwise limiting the Indemnified Parties'
rights with regard to the right to counsel, following the Effective Time, the

consult with each other before issuing any press release or making any other
public announcements, or scheduling a press conference or conference call with
investors or analysts, with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and shall not issue any such press release or
make any such other public announcement without the consent of the other
party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed,
except (i) as such release or announcement may be required by Applicable Law
or any listing agreement with or rule of any national securities exchange or
association upon which the securities of the Company or Parent, as
applicable, are listed, in which case the party required to make the release
or announcement shall use reasonable best efforts to consult with the other
party about, and allow the other party reasonable time (taking into account
the circumstances) to comment on, such release or announcement in advance of
such issuance and (ii) for statements that (1) are consistent with previous
releases, public disclosures or public statements made jointly by the parties
(or individually, if approved by the other party), or (2) relate to an
Acquisition Proposal, Superior Proposal, Adverse Recommendation Change or
"stop-look-and-listen" communication or similar communication of the type
contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act.

  



  

Section 6.15 _Further Assurances_. At and after the Effective Time,

things to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving
Corporation any and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the
rights, properties or assets of the Company acquired or to be acquired by the
Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger.

  



  

Section 6.16 _Section 16 Matters_. Parent and the Company agree
that, in order to most effectively compensate and retain those officers and
directors of the Company who are subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act in connection with the Merger, both prior
to and after the Effective Time, it is desirable that such Persons not be
subject to a risk of liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act to the
fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and, for that compensatory and
retentive purpose, agree to the provisions of this _Section 6.16_. Promptly
after the date hereof and in any event prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any
dispositions of shares of Company Common Stock resulting from the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is subject
to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with
respect to the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law.

Section 6.17 _Financing_.

  



  

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to use, its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all actions and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to arrange, obtain and consummate the Financing on the
terms and conditions (including, to the extent required, the full exercise of
any "flex" provisions) described in the Financing Commitment Letters and the
fee letter pursuant to the terms thereof (or, with respect to terms
applicable to the Debt Financing following the Closing, such other terms as
are no less favorable, in the aggregate, to Parent than those set forth in
the Debt Commitment Letter and do not conflict with their obligations
hereunder), and shall not permit any amendment, supplement or modification to
be made to, or any waiver of any provision under, the Financing Commitment
Letters if such amendment, supplement, modification, replacement or waiver
(A) with respect to the Financing Commitment Letters, reduces (or could have
the effect of reducing) the aggregate amount of the Financing (including by
increasing the amount of fees to be paid or original issue discount unless
(x) the Debt Financing or the Equity Financing is increased by a corresponding
amount or the Debt Financing is otherwise made available to fund such fees or
original issue discount and (y) after giving effect to any of the transactions
referred to in clause (x) above, the representation and warranty set forth in
_Section 5.09_ shall be true and correct), (B) imposes new or additional
conditions or otherwise expands, amends or modifies any of the conditions to
the Financing, or (C) otherwise expands, amends or modifies any other
provision of the Financing Commitment Letters in a manner that would
reasonably be expected to (x) delay (taking into account the Marketing
Period) or prevent or make less likely the funding of the full amount of the
Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to the Financing) on the Closing
Date or (y) adversely impact the ability of Parent, Merger Sub or the
Company, as applicable, to enforce its rights against other parties to the
Financing Commitment Letters or the definitive agreements with respect
thereto ( _provided_ that, subject to compliance with the other provisions of
this _Section 6.17(a)_ , Parent and Merger Sub may amend the Debt Commitment
Letter to (i) add additional lenders, arrangers, bookrunners, agents and
other similar entities or (ii) replace such Financing with alternative
financing from alternative sources in an amount sufficient to pay the
Required Amount (after taking into account consideration cash on hand at the
Parent and other available financing (with conditions not less favorable to
Parent and Merger Sub than the terms and conditions set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letter)). Parent and Merger Sub shall not agree to the withdrawal,
termination, repudiation or rescission of any commitment in respect of the
Debt Financing without the prior written consent of the Company, and shall not
release or consent to the termination of the obligations of the financing
sources under the Debt Commitment Letter other than to effect the joinder or
addition of financing sources to the Debt Commitment Letter providing
replacement commitments in a manner not prohibited by this _Section
6.17_. Parent shall promptly deliver to the Company copies of any such
material amendment, modification or replacement. For purposes of this
_Section 6.17_ , references to "Financing" shall include the financing
contemplated by the Financing Commitment Letters as permitted to be amended,
modified, supplemented or replaced by this _Section 6.17(a)_ , references to
"Debt Financing" shall include the debt financing contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter as permitted to be amended, modified, supplemented or
replaced by this _Section 6.17(a)_ and references to "Debt Commitment Letter"
shall include such documents as permitted to be amended, modified or replaced
by this _Section 6.17(a)_.

(b) Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and obtain the
Financing on the terms (including the market "flex" provisions) and subject
only to the conditions set forth in the Financing Commitment Letters,
including using reasonable best efforts (A) to maintain in effect the
Financing Commitment Letters, (B) to negotiate and enter into definitive
agreements with respect to the Debt Commitment Letter on the terms and
subject only to the conditions (including, as necessary, agreeing to any
requested changes to the terms thereunder in accordance with any "flex"
provisions) contained in the Debt Commitment Letter (or, with respect to
terms applicable following the Closing, on such other terms acceptable to
Parent and its Debt Financing Sources to the extent such terms do not
conflict with their obligations hereunder), (C) to prepare on a timely basis
the necessary offering circulars, private placement memoranda, or other
offering documents, rating agency materials and other marketing materials
with respect to the Debt Financing and to commence on a timely basis the
marketing and/or syndication activities contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letter, (D) to satisfy on a timely basis all conditions to funding in the Debt
Commitment Letter and such definitive agreements thereto and in the Equity
Commitment Letters and to consummate the Financing at or prior to the Closing,
including using its reasonable best efforts to cause the lenders and the
other Persons committing to fund the Financing to fund the Financing at the
Closing, and (E) to enforce its rights under the Financing Commitment Letters.
Parent shall keep the Company reasonably informed, in all reasonable detail,
of the status of its efforts to arrange and consummate the Debt Financing and
of all material developments in respect thereof. Parent shall provide the
Company, upon request, with copies of any material definitive documents in
respect of the Debt Financing and such other information regarding the Debt
Financing and any syndication efforts as shall be reasonably necessary to
allow the Company to monitor the progress of such financing activities.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub shall
give the Company prompt notice (x) of any material breach or default by any
party to any of the Financing Commitment Letters or definitive agreements
related to the Financing of which Parent or Merger Sub become aware, (y) of
the receipt of (A) any written notice or (B) other written communication, in
each case from any Debt Financing Source with respect to any actual or
potential breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party to any of
the Financing Commitment Letters or definitive agreements related to the
Financing of any provisions of the Financing Commitment Letters or definitive
agreements related to the Financing, and (z) if at any time for any reason
Parent or Merger Sub believes in good faith that it will not be able to
obtain all or any portion of the Financing on the terms and conditions, in
the manner or from the sources contemplated by any of the
Financing Commitment Letters or definitive agreements related to the
Financing; _provided_ , that in no event will Parent or Merger Sub be under
any obligation to disclose any information that would result in the waiver of
attorney-client or similar privilege if Parent and Merger Sub shall have used
their reasonable best efforts to disclose such information in a way that would
not waive such privilege (it being agreed that Parent or Merger Sub shall
give notice to the Company of the fact that it is withholding
such information). As soon as reasonably practicable, Parent and Merger Sub
shall provide any information reasonably requested by the Company relating to
any circumstance referred to in clause (x), (y) or (z) of the immediately
preceding sentence (subject to the proviso and limitations set forth in the
immediately preceding sentence) or the status of the Debt Financing. Upon the
occurrence of any circumstance referred to in clause (x) or (y) of the second
preceding sentence or if any portion of the Debt Financing otherwise becomes
unavailable, and such portion is reasonably required to fund the Aggregate
Merger Consideration and all fees, expenses and other amounts contemplated to
be paid by Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation pursuant to this
Agreement and the Financing, Parent and Merger Sub shall use their reasonable
best efforts to arrange and obtain in replacement thereof alternative debt
financing from alternative sources in an amount sufficient to consummate the
Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement with terms and
conditions not less favorable to Parent and Merger Sub than the terms and
conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter and with lenders
reasonably satisfactory to Parent and Merger Sub, as promptly as reasonably
practicable following the occurrence of such event. Parent shall deliver to
the Company true and complete copies of all agreements, arrangements or
understandings (including fee letters (subject to redaction consistent with
the requirements of _Section 5.08_ )) related to any such alternative Debt
Financing. Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that the obtaining of
the Financing, or any alternative financing, is not a condition to Closing.

best efforts to provide, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to use
their respective reasonable best efforts to provide, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives to use their respective
reasonable best efforts to provide, to Parent and Merger Sub, in each case at
Parent's sole expense, all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in
connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing, including (i) upon
reasonable notice and at mutually convenient times, causing representatives

Company any and all information to be included in such pro forma financial
statements (other than the historical financial statements) as promptly as
practicable and in no event later than June 26, 2017, including (1) all
information relating to (x) the proposed aggregate amount of debt and equity
financing, together with assumed interest rates, fees and expenses
relating to the incurrence of such debt and equity financing, for the
transactions contemplated hereby, (y) the assumed pro forma capitalization of
the Company after giving effect to the Closing, the Financing and the
refinancing or repayment of any Indebtedness of the Company and its
Subsidiaries in connection therewith and (z) the assumed cost savings,

hereby, (iv) causing representatives of senior management of the Company to

causes any covenant, representation or warranty in this Agreement to be

Section 6.21 _Stock Market De-Listing_. Prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall cooperate with Parent and use reasonable best efforts to
take such actions as may be necessary to cause the Company's securities to
be de-listed from Nasdaq and de-registered under the Exchange Act as soon as
practicable following the Effective Time.

  



  

Section 6.22 _Treatment of Convertible Notes, Note Hedge Instruments
and Warrants._

  



  

(a) The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
take all actions required by the Indenture to be performed by the
Company prior to the Effective Time as a result of the execution and delivery
of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the giving of any
notices or announcements that may be required prior to the Effective Time in
connection with the Convertible Notes, the delivery to the Trustee of any
certificates, opinions, documents or instruments required to be delivered
prior to the Effective Time to the Trustee in connection with such
transactions or otherwise required pursuant to the terms of the Indenture.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, prior to the
Effective Time, the Company agrees to (i) deliver the notices required by
Sections 14.01(b)(iii) and 15.02(c) of the Indenture and (ii) execute and
deliver, at the Effective Time, a supplemental indenture, officer's
certificate and opinion of counsel pursuant to Sections 14.07 and 17.05, as
applicable, of the Indenture.

  



  

(b) The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take
all actions required by the terms of the applicable Note Hedge
Instruments and Warrants prior to the Effective Time as a result of the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
giving of any notices to the counterparties that may be required prior to the
Effective Time. Upon Parent's reasonable request, prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall engage in discussions with the counterparties and take
other actions reasonably requested by Parent with respect to the
termination, settlement, cancellation and/or payment of the Note Hedge
Instruments or Warrants in connection with the consummation of the
Merger. The Company shall not take any action with respect to the
termination, settlement, cancellation and/or payment of the Note
Hedge Instruments or Warrants without the prior written consent of Parent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

  



    

 | 70| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) Prior to taking any of the foregoing actions, the Company shall
consult with and reasonably cooperate with Parent with respect to the action
and the intended manner and form thereof. Parent shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to review any notice, announcement, certificate, document,
instrument or legal opinion before such document is provided to the Trustee or
the counterparty to any Note Hedge Instruments or Warrants, as applicable,
and the Company shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any
comments made by Parent. The Company will not make any settlement election
under or make any change to the terms of the Indenture, the Note Hedge
Instruments or the Warrants without the prior written consent of Parent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

  



  

(d) Parent shall reimburse the Company promptly upon demand for all
reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys' fees) incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in
connection with any actions taken by the Company with respect to the Note
Hedge Instruments and Warrants upon the written request of Parent as
contemplated by _Section 6.22(b)_ and shall indemnify and hold harmless the
Financing Indemnitees from and against any and all losses, damages, claims,
judgments, fines, claims, penalties, interest, awards and liabilities and
reasonable, out-of-pocket costs and expenses directly or indirectly suffered
or incurred by any of them in connection with actions taken by the Company
with respect to the Note Hedge Instruments and Warrants upon the
written request of Parent as contemplated by _Section 6.22(b)_. This _Section
6.22(d)_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger and the Closing and any
termination of this Agreement.

  



  

Section 6.23 _Company Transaction Expenses_. The Company does not
anticipate that the Company Transaction Expenses as of the Effective Time
will exceed such aggregate amount set forth on Schedule 6.23. Upon the written
request of Parent from time to time prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall provide Parent with an updated estimate of the Company
Transaction Expenses as of the Effective Time. Prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide invoices
(with final payment amounts and wire instructions) for all Company Transaction
Expenses as of the Effective Time.

  



  

Section 6.24 _FIRPTA Delivery_. The Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to deliver to Parent at Closing a certification from the Company
prepared pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.1445-2(c) that meets the
requirements of Treasury Regulations Section 1.897-2(h) in form reasonably
acceptable to Parent along with written authorization to deliver such notice
to the Internal Revenue Service on behalf of the Company upon Closing;
provided, that the only remedy of Parent and Merger Sub for the Company's
failure to provide such certification or notice shall be to make any
applicable withholding consistent with _Section 2.08_.

  



    

 | 71| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Section 6.25 _Excess Cash_. The Company shall deliver to Parent, no
later than five (5) Business Days prior to, and no earlier than ten (10)
Business Days before, the anticipated Closing Date, a written notice setting
forth, as of the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding
the Closing Date, the Company's good faith estimate of the aggregate cash
balances held by the Company and its Subsidiaries (by jurisdiction). The
Company will cooperate in good faith with Parent to mutually agree with
Parent to use such available cash in excess of $30 million to pay amounts
otherwise to be paid by Parent or the Surviving Corporation under _Section
2.04_ of this Agreement so long as such efforts do not result in the Company
or its Subsidiaries incurring a material tax or other material liability;
_provided_ that failure of the Company and Parent to mutually agree with
respect to the use of such excess available cash shall not be a condition to
Parent's and Merger Sub's obligations to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, or otherwise affect
Parent's and Merger Sub's obligations to pay amounts otherwise to be paid by
Parent or the Surviving Corporation under _Section 2.04_ of the Agreement.

of the Closing Date (except to the extent that any such representation and

or in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect, (ii) the representations and
warranties set forth in _Section 4.01_ (Corporate Existence and Power),
_Section 4.02_ (Corporate Authorization), and _Section 4.23_ (Brokers' Fees)

representation and warranty shall be true and correct in all material respects
as of such earlier date), and (iii) the representations and warranties set

_Section 7.03_ , as the case may be, to be satisfied (or to be able to be
satisfied) to excuse it from its obligation to effect the Merger if such

Agreement.

  



  

Article 8 
 TERMINATION

 | 74| 
---|---|---

Company's delivery of written notice describing such breach to Parent;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be entitled to terminate

shall not be entitled to make such request on more than one (1) occasion per
Acquisition Proposal and twice in the aggregate unrelated to any Acquisition

(provided that for purposes of this clause (y), the Company shall have

Proposal in accordance with _Section 6.03_ , (ii) concurrently with such
termination, the Company enters into a definitive agreement with respect to
such Superior Proposal and (iii) immediately prior to or
substantially concurrently with the termination of this Agreement, the

(i) by the Company, upon written notice to Parent, if (A) the
conditions set forth in _Section 7.01_ and _Section 7.02_ (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by actions taken at the

satisfied at a Closing on such date, assuming for purposes hereof that the
date of termination is the Closing Date) have been satisfied or waived, (B)

Section 8.02 _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to _Section 8.01_ , this Agreement shall become void and
of no effect without liability of any party (or any Representative of such

6.05_ , (iii) the last sentence of _Section 6.12(b)_ , (iv) _Section 6.17(e)_
, (v) _Section 6.18_ , (vi) _Section 6.22(d)_ and (vii) _Article 9_ shall

any liabilities or damages (collectively, "Damages") arising out of its
willful and material breach of any provision of this Agreement, subject only
to _Section 9.04(b)_ and  _Section 9.09(d)_. For the avoidance of doubt, (a)
the failure of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the Merger on
the date required by _Section 2.01_ after the conditions set forth in _Article
7_ (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at
the Closing and which are capable of being satisfied on the Closing Date,
assuming for purposes hereof that the date of termination is the Closing
Date) have been satisfied or waived shall constitute a willful and material
breach by such party, (b) the Confidentiality Agreements shall survive the
termination of this Agreement and shall remain in full force and effect in
accordance with its terms and (c) the Guarantees shall survive the termination
of this Agreement and shall remain in full force and effect in accordance

Section 9.02 _Survival of Representations and Warranties_. The
representations and warranties contained herein and in any certificate or
other writing delivered pursuant hereto shall not survive the Effective Time.

  



  

Section 9.03 _Amendments and Waivers_.

  



  

(a) Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived prior
to the Effective Time if, but only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing
and is signed, in the case of an amendment, by each party to this Agreement
or, in the case of a waiver, by each party against whom the waiver is to be
effective; _provided_ , _however_ , that without the further approval of the
Company's stockholders, no such amendment or waiver shall be made or given
after the Stockholder Approval that requires the approval of the stockholders
of the Company under the DGCL unless the required further approval is
obtained. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, _Section
8.02_ , this _Section 9.03(a)_ , _Section 9.04(c)_ , the last sentence of
_Section 9.05_ ,  _Section 9.06_ , the last sentence of _Section 9.07_ ,
_Section 9.08_ , _Section 9.09_ , and _Section 9.10_  (and any definition in
this Agreement to the extent an amendment, modification, or waiver of such
definition would modify the substance of the foregoing sections) may not be
amended, modified, or waived in a manner that adversely affects the right of
the Debt Financing Sources in any respect without the prior written consent
of the Debt Financing Sources party to the Debt Commitment Letter.

  



  

(b) No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power
or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single
or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. Except as otherwise
expressly provided in this Agreement, the rights and remedies herein provided
shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by
Applicable Law.

  



  

Section 9.04 _Expenses_.

  



  

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, all costs and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement shall be paid by
the party incurring such cost or expense.

  



  

(b) In the event that:

  



  

(i) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.01(g)_ ;

  



  

(ii) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.01(h)_ ;

  



    

 | 78| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(iii) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.01(e)_ as a
result of a willful and material breach of this Agreement by the Company; or

  



  

(iv) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.01(b)_ (if
the Company shall have materially breached any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement) _Section
8.01(d)_ or _Section 8.01(e)_ (other than a termination pursuant to _Section
8.01(e)_ with respect to which the Company Termination Fee has already been
paid) and (A) an Acquisition Proposal is made, communicated or is otherwise
publicly disclosed, (x) before such termination, in the case of a termination
pursuant to  _Section 8.01(b)_ or _Section 8.01(e)_ or (y) before receipt of
the Stockholder Approval, in the case of a termination pursuant to _Section
8.01(d)_ , and (B) within twelve months after the date of such termination,
the Company consummates an Acquisition Proposal or enters into a definitive
agreement in respect of an Acquisition Proposal, which Acquisition Proposal
is subsequently consummated (whether during such twelve month period or
thereafter) ( _provided_ that for purposes of this subsection (iv), each
reference to "20%" in the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed
to be references to "50%");

  



  

then the Company shall pay Parent (or its designee) the Company Termination
Fee by wire transfer of same-day funds (x) in the case of _Section 9.04(b)(i)_
or _Section 9.04(b)(iii)_ , within three Business Days after such
termination, (y) in the case of _Section 9.04(b)(ii)_ , prior or substantially
concurrently with the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.01(h)_ and (z) in the case of _Section 9.04(b)(iv)_ ,
substantially concurrently with the consummation of the Acquisition Proposal.
For the avoidance of doubt, any payment made by the Company under this
_Section 9.04(b)_ shall be payable only once with respect to _Section 9.04(b)_
and not in duplication, even though such payment may be payable under one or
both provisions hereof. In the event that Parent is entitled to receive
payment pursuant to this _Section 9.04(b)_ , the receipt of the Company
Termination Fee shall (other than in the case of willful and material breach
by the Company) be deemed to be liquidated damages for any and all losses or
damages suffered or incurred by Parent, Merger Sub, any of their respective
Affiliates or any other Person in connection with this Agreement (and the
termination hereof), the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (and the
abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such
termination, and, other than in the case of willful or material breach on the
part of the Company, except for payment of the Company Termination Fee and
any Parent Recovery Costs under this _Section 9.04(b)_ , the Company shall
have no further liability, whether pursuant to a claim at law or in equity,
to Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates in connection with
this Agreement (and the termination hereof), the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (and the abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the basis
for such termination, and (other than in the case of willful and material
breach by the Company) none of Parent, Merger Sub, any of their respective
Affiliates or any other Person shall be entitled to bring or maintain any
Proceeding against the Company or any of its Affiliates for damages or any
equitable relief arising out of or in connection with this Agreement (other
than equitable relief to require payment of the Company Termination Fee), any
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any matters forming the
basis for such termination; _provided_ that if the Company fails to pay the
Company Termination Fee and Parent and/or Merger Sub commences a suit which
results in a final, non-appealable judgment against the Company for the
Company Termination Fee, then the Company shall pay Parent and Merger Sub
their reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorney's fees and disbursements) in connection with such suit, together
with interest on the Company Termination Fee at the "prime rate" as published
in The Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition, in effect on the date such
payment was required to be made through the date of payment (calculated daily
on the basis of a year of 365 days and the actual number of days elapsed,
without compounding) (the "Parent Recovery Costs").

(c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated (i) pursuant to
_Section 8.01(i)_ or (ii) pursuant to _Section 8.01(f)_ as a result of a
willful and material breach of this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub, then
Parent shall pay the Company the Parent Termination Fee by wire transfer of
same-day funds on the third Business Day following such termination (it being
understood that in no event shall Parent be required to pay the Parent
Termination Fee on more than one occasion). In the event that the Company is
entitled to receive payment pursuant to this _Section 9.04(c)_ , the receipt
of the Parent Termination Fee shall be deemed to be liquidated damages for
any and all losses or damages suffered or incurred by the Company in
connection with this Agreement (and the termination hereof), the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (and the abandonment thereof) or any matter
forming the basis for such termination, and, except for payment of the Parent
Termination Fee and the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to
_Section 6.17(e)_ and _Section 6.22(d)_ (collectively, the "Parent Expenses"),
and any Company Recovery Costs under this _Section 9.04(c)_ , neither Parent
nor Merger Sub shall have any further liability, whether pursuant to a claim
at law or in equity, to the Company or any of its Affiliates under this
Agreement (and the termination hereof), the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (and the abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the basis for
such termination, and the Company shall not be entitled to bring or maintain
any Proceeding against Parent or Merger Sub for damages or any
equitable relief arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any matters forming the
basis for such termination (other than equitable relief to require payment of
the Parent Termination Fee and/or any Parent Expenses); _provided_ that if
Parent fails to pay the Parent Termination Fee and/or any Parent Expenses and
the Company commences a suit which results in a final, non-appealable
judgment against Parent for the Parent Termination Fee and/or any
Parent Expenses, then Parent shall pay the Company its reasonable out-of-
pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees and
disbursements) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the
Parent Termination Fee and/or Parent Expenses at the "prime rate" as
published in The Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition, in effect on the date
such payment was required to be made through the date of payment (calculated
daily on the basis of a year of 365 days and the actual number of
days elapsed, without compounding) (the "Company Recovery Costs").

  



  

Section 9.05 _Assignment; Benefit_. This Agreement shall not
be assigned by any of the parties hereto (whether by operation of law or
otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other parties; _provided_
, _however_ , that Parent and Merger Sub may without the consent of the other
party (a) assign their rights under this Agreement, in whole or in part, to
an Affiliate or (b) collaterally assign their rights under this Agreement to
any of the Debt Financing Sources or any agent or collateral trustee for such
Debt Financing Sources, but in the case of clause (a) and (b) no such
assignment will relieve Parent or Merger Sub of their obligations under this
Agreement. This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the
benefit of the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns,
and any reference to a party shall also be a reference to the successors and
permitted assigns thereof. Notwithstanding anything contained in
this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement, express or
implied, is intended to confer on any Person other than the parties hereto or
their respective heirs, successors, executors, administrators and permitted
assigns any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by reason
of this Agreement, except (i) for the provisions of _Article 2_ concerning
payment of the Aggregate Merger Consideration, _Section 6.11_ , _Section
6.17(e)_ , _Section 6.18_ , _Section 6.22(d)_ and _Section 8.02_ , which
provisions shall inure to the benefit of the Persons or entities benefiting
therefrom who are expressly intended to be third-party beneficiaries thereof
and who may enforce the covenants contained therein and (ii) that the Debt
Financing Sources and Parent Related Parties are intended third party
beneficiaries of and may enforce their respective rights under _Section 8.02_
, _Section 9.03(a)_ , _Section 9.04(c)_ , this _Section 9.05_ , _Section 9.06_
, the last sentence of  _Section 9.07_ , _Section 9.08_ , _Section 9.09_ ,
and _Section 9.10_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that, prior to the Effective
Time, the rights and remedies conferred on the Company's stockholders pursuant
to _Article 2_  concerning payment of the Aggregate Merger Consideration may
only be enforced by the Company acting on the behalf of the
Company's stockholders and holders of Company Equity Awards.

and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without
regard to the conflicts of law rules of such State. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, each party hereto acknowledges and irrevocably agrees
that any Proceeding, whether in contract or tort, at law or in equity or
otherwise, involving any Debt Financing Source in any way relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,

sitting in the State of Delaware. Each party hereto hereby irrevocably
submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such court in respect of any legal or
equitable Proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or relating to enforcement of any
of the terms of this Agreement, and hereby waives, and agrees not to assert,
as a defense in any such Proceeding, any claim that it is not subject
personally to the jurisdiction of such court, that the Proceeding is brought
in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of the Proceeding is improper or
that this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may not
be enforced in or by such courts. Each party hereto agrees that notice or the
service of process in any Proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be properly
served or delivered if delivered in the manner contemplated by _Section 9.01_
or in any other manner permitted by law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each
party hereto agrees that it will not bring or support any action, cause of
action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or description,
whether in law or equity, whether in contract or tort or otherwise, against
the Debt Financing Sources in any way relating to this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any dispute arising
out of or relating in any way to the Debt Commitment Letter or the
performance thereunder, in any forum other than the Supreme Court of the
State of New York, county of New York, or, if under Applicable Law exclusive

Section 9.08 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL
PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT, THE EQUITY COMMITMENT LETTERS, THE GUARANTEES,
THE DEBT COMMITMENT LETTER OR THE ACTIONS OF PARENT, COMPANY OR MERGER SUB,
THE GUARANTOR OR ANY DEBT FINANCING SOURCE IN THE NEGOTIATION,
ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT HEREOF OR THEREOF. NEITHER THE
COMPANY NOR ITS STOCKHOLDERS, PARTNERS, MEMBERS, AFFILIATES,
DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, CONTROLLING PERSONS OR AGENTS SHALL HAVE ANY
RIGHTS OR CLAIMS AGAINST ANY DEBT FINANCING SOURCE IN CONNECTION WITH THIS
AGREEMENT, THE DEBT FINANCING OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR
THEREBY, WHETHER AT LAW OR EQUITY, IN CONTRACT, IN TORT OR OTHERWISE;
PROVIDED THAT, NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, NOTHING IN THIS SECTION 9.08
SHALL IN ANY WAY LIMIT OR MODIFY THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF PARENT OR
MERGER SUB UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY DEBT FINANCING SOURCE'S OBLIGATIONS TO
PARENT OR MERGER SUB UNDER THE DEBT COMMITMENT LETTER OR IN CONNECTION WITH
THE DEBT FINANCING.

  



  

Section 9.09 _Specific Performance; Parent Liability Cap; Company
Liability Cap_.

  



  

(a) The parties hereto agree that irreparable harm would occur in
the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that
money damages or other legal remedies would not be an adequate remedy for any
such harm. The parties hereto agree that unless and until this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with _Section 8.01_ and any dispute over the right
to termination has been finally resolved, (i) the parties hereto shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions from a court of competent
jurisdiction as set forth in _Section 9.07_ to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement (other than Parent's and Merger Sub's obligation to effect the
Closing, which shall be governed by the next sentence), without bond or other
security being required, this being in addition to any remedy to which they
are entitled pursuant to _Section 8.02_ or _Section 9.04_ , and (ii) the
right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, and without that right,
none of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub would have entered into this
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, the parties hereto agree that unless and until this Agreement is
validly terminated in accordance with _Section 8.01_ , the Company shall be
entitled to an injunction, specific performance or other equitable remedy in
connection with enforcing Parent's obligation to cause the Equity Financing to
be funded and to specifically enforce Parent's and Merger Sub's obligations
to effect the Closing on the terms and conditions set forth herein if and
only if (A) the conditions set forth in _Section 7.01_ and _Section 7.02_
(other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing; _provided_ that each such condition is then capable of being
satisfied at the Closing have been satisfied or waived and such conditions
would be so satisfied on such date if it were the Closing Date), (B) the
Debt Financing is available to be funded at the Closing and has been funded
or will be simultaneously funded at the Closing if the Equity Financing is
funded, (C) the Company has irrevocably notified Parent in writing that all
conditions set forth in _Section 7.03_  have been satisfied or waived and the
Company is ready, willing and able to consummate the Merger, and (D) Parent
and Merger Sub fail to complete the Closing on the date the Closing is
required to have occurred pursuant to _Section 2.01_ (such clauses (A)
through (D), together, the "Specific Performance Conditions"). Each of the
parties hereto agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction,
specific performance or other equitable relief on the basis that any other of
such parties has an adequate remedy at law or that any such injunction or
award of specific performance or other equitable relief is not an appropriate
remedy for any reason; _provided_ that solely with respect to the equitable
remedy in connection with enforcing Parent's obligation to cause the Equity
Financing to be funded and to specifically enforce Parent's or Merger
Sub's obligation to effect the Closing, Parent and Merger Sub may oppose the
granting of specific performance only on the basis that one of the Specific
Performance Conditions has not been satisfied. The parties hereto further
agree that (i) following the Company's termination of this Agreement in
accordance with _Section 8.01_ , the Company shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions from a court of competent jurisdiction as set forth
in _Section 9.07_ to enforce specifically Parent's and Merger Sub's surviving
payment obligations herein, and (ii) following Parent's termination of this
Agreement in accordance with _Section 8.01_ , Parent shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions from a court of competent jurisdiction as set forth
in _Section 9.07_ to enforce specifically the Company's surviving payment
obligations herein.

---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) The parties hereto further agree that (i) by seeking the
remedies provided for in this _Section 9.09_ , a party shall not in
any respect waive its right to seek any other form of relief that may be
available to a party under this Agreement for breach of any of the provisions
of this Agreement or in the event that this Agreement has been terminated or
in the event that the remedies provided for in this _Section 9.09_ are not
available or otherwise are not granted, and (ii) nothing set forth in this
_Section 9.09_  shall require any party hereto to institute any Proceeding
for (or limit any party's right to institute any Proceeding for) specific
performance under this _Section 9.09_ prior or as a condition to exercising
any termination right under _Article 8_ , nor shall the commencement of any
Proceeding pursuant to this _Section 9.09_ or anything set forth in this
_Section 9.09_ restrict or limit any party's right to terminate this
Agreement in accordance with the terms of _Article 8_  or pursue any other
remedies under this Agreement that may be available at any time.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary but without
limiting any of the Company's rights and remedies under the Guarantees, the
maximum aggregate liability of Parent and Merger Sub for monetary damages in
connection with this Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letters, the Guarantees
and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be limited to the
Parent Termination Fee plus the Parent Expenses and, to the extent payable
pursuant to _Section 9.04(c)_ , the Company Recovery Costs (collectively, the
"Parent Liability Cap"), and, except for an order of specific performance
prior to any valid termination of this Agreement as and only to the extent
expressly permitted by, and subject to the limitations contained in, _Section
9.09(a)_  and except for the Company's right to enforce the terms of the
Equity Commitment Letters (subject to the terms and conditions thereof),
payment of the Parent Termination Fee, Parent Expenses and, to the extent
payable pursuant to _Section 9.04(c)_ , Company Recovery Costs, shall be the
sole and exclusive remedies (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort
or otherwise) of the Company and its Affiliates against Parent, Merger Sub,
the Guarantor, the Debt Financing Sources and any of their respective former,
current and future direct or indirect equityholders, controlling persons,
stockholders, directors, officers, employees, agents, Representatives,
Affiliates, members, managers, general or limited partners or assignees (each,
a "Parent Related Party"). In no event shall the Company seek or permit to be
sought on behalf of the Company any monetary damages or other remedy of any
kind, including consequential, indirect, or punitive damages, from Parent,
Merger Sub, the Guarantor, the Debt Financing Sources or any of Parent
Related Parties in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement other than payment of the Parent Termination
Fee, the Parent Expenses and, to the extent payable pursuant to _Section
9.04(c)_ , the Company Recovery Costs, and upon payment of such amounts, none
of Parent, Merger Sub, the Guarantor, the Debt Financing Sources or any
Parent Related Parties shall have any further liability or obligation relating
to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, the Guarantees, the Equity Commitment Letters or in respect of any
other document or theory of law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise;
_provided_ , _however_ , subject to the terms and conditions of, and
limitations set forth in, the Equity Commitment Letters and/or the Guarantees
and the limitations set forth in _Section 9.09(a)_ (and without limiting or
expanding the Company's remedies thereunder), the Company may enforce the
terms of such Equity Commitment Letter against the Guarantor to the extent
permitted thereby as an express third party beneficiary thereof, and the
Company may seek payment by the Guarantor of the Parent Termination Fee,
Parent Expenses and/or, to the extent payable pursuant to _Section 9.04(c)_ ,
Company Recovery Costs, in each case, to the extent payable under the terms of
the Guarantees.

(d) Notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary, the
maximum aggregate liability of the Company in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be limited to
$70,000,000 (the "Company Liability Cap"), and, except for an order of
specific performance prior to any valid termination of this Agreement as and
only to the extent expressly permitted by, and subject to the limitations
contained in, _Section 9.09(a)_ , (i) payment of the Company Termination Fee
and, to the extent payable pursuant to _Section 9.04(b)_ , Parent Recovery
Costs, and (ii) liability for Damages arising out of the Company's willful
and material breach of this Agreement (such Damages not to exceed the Company
Liability Cap, less any portion of the Company Termination Fee and Parent
Recovery Costs previously paid by the Company to Parent pursuant to
_Section 9.04(b)_ ) shall be the sole and exclusive remedies (whether at law,
in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) of the Parent, Merger Sub and
their respective Affiliates against the Company and its Subsidiaries and any
of their respective former, current and future direct or indirect
equityholders, controlling persons, stockholders, directors, officers,
employees, agents, Representatives, Affiliates, members, managers, general or
limited partners or assignees (each, a "Company Related Party"). In no event
shall Parent or Merger Sub seek or permit to be sought on behalf of Parent or
Merger Sub any monetary damages or other remedy of any kind, including
consequential, indirect, or punitive damages, from the Company or any Company
Related Parties in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement other than (x) payment of the Company
Termination Fee, (y) to the extent payable pursuant to _Section 9.04(b)_ ,
the Parent Recovery Costs, and (z) liability for Damages arising out of the
Company's willful and material breach of this Agreement (such Damages not to
exceed the Company Liability Cap, less any portion of the Company Termination
Fee and Parent Recovery Costs previously paid by the Company to Parent
pursuant to  _Section 9.04(b)_ ), and upon payment of such amounts, none of
the Company or any Company Related Parties shall have any further liability
or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or in respect of any other document or theory
of law or equity, in contract in tort or otherwise.

Section 9.10 _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or
restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or
other Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the
remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be
affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such a determination, the
parties hereto agree to negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as
to effect the original intent of the parties hereto as closely as possible in
an acceptable manner, in order that the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties intend that the
remedies and limitations thereon contained in _Section 8.02_ , _Section
9.04(b)_ , _Section 9.04(c) _ and _Section 9.09_ of this Agreement shall be
construed as an integral provision of this Agreement and that such
remedies and limitations shall not be severable in any manner that increases
a party's liability or obligations hereunder or under the Equity Commitment
Letters or the Guarantees or any Debt Commitment Letter.

  



  

Section 9.11 _Parent Guarantee_. Parent shall cause Merger Sub to
comply in all respects with each of the representations, warranties,
covenants, obligations, agreements and undertakings made or required to be
performed by Merger Sub in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the
Merger, and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. As a
material inducement to the Company's willingness to enter into this Agreement
and perform its obligations hereunder, Parent hereby unconditionally
guarantees full performance and payment by Merger Sub of each of
the covenants, obligations and undertakings required to be performed by
Merger Sub under this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, subject to all terms, conditions and limitations contained in this
Agreement, and hereby represents, acknowledges and agrees that any such
breach of any such representation and warranty or default in the performance
of any such covenant, obligation, agreement or undertaking of Merger Sub
shall also be deemed to be a breach or default of Parent, and, subject to the
terms and limitations of this Agreement, the Company shall have the right,
exercisable in its sole discretion, to pursue any and all available remedies
it may have arising out of any such breach or nonperformance directly against
either or both of Parent and Merger Sub in the first instance. As applicable,
references in this _Section 9.11_ to "Merger Sub" shall also include
the Surviving Corporation following the Effective Time.

  



  

Section 9.12 _Entire Agreement; No Reliance; Access to Information_.

  



  

(a) This Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreements, the exhibits and
schedules to this Agreement, the Company Disclosure Schedule and
the Financing Commitment Letters and the Guarantees constitute the entire
agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
among the parties with respect thereto.

  



    

 | 85| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) Parent and Merger Sub agree that, except for the representations
and warranties contained in _Article 4_ of this Agreement, the Company makes
no other representations or warranties and hereby disclaims any other
representations or warranties made by itself or any of its Representatives,
with respect to the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, notwithstanding the delivery or
disclosure to any other party or any other party's Representatives of any
document or other information with respect to any one or more of the
foregoing. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, but subject
to the express representations and warranties made by the parties in this
Agreement, each of Parent and Merger Sub agrees that none of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries make or has made any representation or warranty with
respect to (i) any projections, forecasts, estimates, plans or budgets or
future revenues, expenses or expenditures, future results of operations (or
any component thereof), future cash flows (or any component thereof) or
future financial condition (or any component thereof) of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or the future business, operations or affairs of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries heretofore or hereafter delivered to or
made available to it, or (ii) any other information, statements or documents
heretofore or hereafter delivered to or made available to it, including the
information in the electronic data room of the Company, with respect to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the business, operations or affairs
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except to the extent and as
expressly covered by a representation and warranty made in _Article 4_ of this
Agreement.

  



  

(c) Parent and Merger Sub each acknowledges and agrees that it (a)
has had an opportunity to discuss the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries with the management of the Company, (b) has had reasonable
access to (i) the books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries and
(ii) the documents provided by the Company for purposes of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (c) has been afforded a reasonable
opportunity to ask questions of and received answers from officers of the
Company and (d) has conducted its own independent investigation of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, their respective businesses and the transactions
contemplated hereby, and has not relied on any representation, warranty or
other statement by any Person on behalf of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, other than the representations and warranties of the Company
contained in _Article 4_ of this Agreement. Each of Parent and Merger Sub
hereby acknowledges that there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to
develop estimates, projections, forecasts, business plans and other forward-
looking information with which Parent and Merger Sub are familiar, that Parent
and Merger Sub are taking full responsibility for making their own evaluation
of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, projections,
forecasts, business plans and other forward-looking information furnished to
them (including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such
estimates, projections, forecasts, business plans and other forward-looking
information), and, for the avoidance of doubt, that Parent and Merger Sub
will have no claim against the Company or any of its stockholders, directors,
officers, employees, Affiliates, advisors, agents or other Representatives
with respect thereto, except to the extent and as expressly covered by a
representation and warranty made in _Article 4_ of this Agreement.

  



  

Section 9.13 _Rules of Construction_. Each of the parties hereto
acknowledges that it has been represented by counsel of its choice throughout
all negotiations that have preceded the execution of this Agreement and that
it has executed the same with the advice of said independent counsel. Each
party and its counsel cooperated and participated in the drafting and
preparation of this Agreement and the documents referred to herein, and any
and all drafts relating thereto exchanged among the parties shall be deemed
the work product of all of the parties and may not be construed against any
party by reason of its drafting or preparation. Accordingly, any rule of law
or any legal decision that would require interpretation of any ambiguities in
this Agreement against any party that drafted or prepared it is of no
application and is hereby expressly waived by each of the parties hereto, and
any controversy over interpretations of this Agreement shall be decided
without regard to events of drafting or preparation.

Section 9.14 _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may
be signed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original,
with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the
same instrument. This Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto
shall have received a counterpart hereof signed by all of the other parties
hereto. Until and unless each party has received a counterpart hereof signed
by each other party hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no party
shall have any right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other
oral or written agreement or other communication). Signatures to this
Agreement transmitted by facsimile transmission, by electronic mail in PDF
form, or by any other electronic means designed to preserve the original
graphic and pictorial appearance of a document, will be deemed to have the
